Marco Rubio says debt ceiling vote not tied to question over default
","
In the days leading up to the Aug. 1, 2011, vote in the U.S. House on raising the debt ceiling, members of the House, the Senate and President Barack Obama engaged in a war of words about what would have happened if they couldn't reach an agreement.

As the vote approached, Obama urged the public to contact their representatives in order to push them to reach a deal. The phone lines in congressional offices were flooded with calls from voters across the country urging politicians to seal the deal. On Aug. 1, the U.S. House voted 269-161 in favor of raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling in stages -- the first one immediately. The Senate voted 74 to 26 on Aug. 2 for the deal, which also included cutting deficits by $917 billion over 10 years through spending reductions in defense, education and other programs -- but not Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

A PolitiFact reader forwarded us a July 29 e-mail he received from U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida's junior senator and a Republican -- who later voted against the bill -- about the debt ceiling. Here is one paragraph from Rubio's e-mail that stood out to us:

""The debt ceiling is the total amount of money owed by the United States by both the general public and the federal government to either foreign or domestic lenders. If the debt ceiling is surpassed, our nation will not go into default as some suggest. The debt ceiling can be raised, lowered or remain the same when Congress allows it to come to a vote. What we must do is prioritize our debt payments in the event that the ceiling is not raised, and I support legislation which would ensure that interest payments, Social Security benefits and pay for our men and women in uniform go out in a timely manner.""

Rubio wrote that he would not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless it was accompanied by other reforms including to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

There were a few points that interested us in Rubio's response, but we decided to focus on his suggestion that the United States could avoid default even if Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling before the Aug. 2 deadline.

The Truth-O-Meter has examined multiple claims about the debt ceiling, including one by Georgia Republican U.S. Rep Tom Price, who said on CNN July 24: ""Well, the U.S. won't default, because default means that you don't pay your creditors,"" Price replied. ""And it takes about 10 percent of the money that's coming in right now...""

Price argued that a failure to pay bills would not equal default, and what mattered was that the United States continued to pay interest owed on bonds. Republican U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota made a similar argument during a July 13, 2011, press conference that ""it is simply not true"" that ""if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, that somehow the United States will go into default, and we will lose the full faith and credit of the United States.""

While cash would have covered bondholder obligations at least for some time, the government could have prioritized some payments -- likely Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- but then would have been unable to pay others -- perhaps veterans benefits, educational programs and payments to vendors and contractors.

The Truth-O-Meter check on Bachmann explained: ""But the assumption here is that the markets would be satisfied as long as the interest on bonds was paid, even if doing so meant delaying payments to any number of other creditors to the federal government, from Social Security beneficiaries to federal workers to Pentagon contractors. ... Our experts largely agreed that -- contrary to Bachmann’s implication -- a failure to pay any of its bills, not just interest to bondholders, would be classified as a default.""

Even though we've dealt with this question twice already, we've decided to take it up again due to continuing reader interest in the topic as well as additional evidence that has come to light since our original items were published.

We contacted Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos to ask for an explanation why Rubio argued that not raising the debt ceiling would not lead to default.

""You have to read that entire paragraph for context, not simply extrapolate one sentence,"" Burgos replied by e-mail. ""When the debt ceiling is surpassed, the government is still taking in revenue and can prioritize payments to meet its obligations on interest owed, to Social Security recipients and the military. It does not have to amount to a full-scale, across-the-board default on these obligations. That entire paragraph outlines steps Senator Rubio believes our government should take to ensure these payments are prioritized in the event that Congress does not raise the debt ceiling.""

Rubio signed on as one of more than 20 co-sponsors of a bill by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., ""The Full Faith and Credit of the United States and Protecting America’s Seniors and Soldiers Act"", which would require the Treasury Department to prioritize payments on publicly held debt, Social Security and active-duty military pay in the event the federal government failed to raise the debt limit before Aug. 2, Burgos wrote.

But what if you prioritize your debts and pay some but not all of them? Would that represent a default, even a partial one?

We think it's appropriate to consider the legal definition of default. That is ""a failure to perform a legal duty -- for example, a default on a mortgage or a car loan happens when you fail to make the loan payments on time, fail to maintain adequate insurance or violate some other provision of the agreement."" That would suggest that if the government fails to pay bills other than interest payments it might qualify as a default.

But we also contacted a range of economic experts for their opinion of both the legal and commonsense definitions. A number of our experts agreed that if the government paid some bills and not others, it would be considered a default -- or as one expert, Kathy Ruffing at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, called it ""selective default.""

""If the debt ceiling is not lifted, the U.S. will not be able to honor all of its obligations and in that sense will surely default,"" Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at Stern School of Business at New York University wrote to us before the House's vote.

Ruffing argued in a report that the government would default on some obligations:

""The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) estimates that between August 3 and August 31, a prolonged inability to borrow would force the federal government to cut expenditures by 44 percent. That would affect federal employees, defense contractors, hospitals and doctors, state and local governments, farmers, colleges and universities, program beneficiaries, and millions of others. All of these people and organizations rely on timely federal payments to meet their own bills and payrolls, and an interruption would set off a domino effect of lower demand and missed payments throughout the U.S. economy.""

Even if the government prioritized certain expenditures, financial markets would not be ""reassured if they saw a cash-strapped superpower picking which bills it could afford to pay today,"" Ruffing wrote.

Dean Baker, of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote that it would only technically be a default if the government missed a payment on debt.

""However, once we hit our borrowing limit the government has a limited capacity to prioritize payments as Sen. Rubio wants,"" Baker wrote. ""First, the Constitution tells the president to spend money appropriated by Congress. Nixon lost a case at the Supreme Court where he claimed he could choose not to spend money. So arguably Obama does not have the authority to prioritize payments. This means he makes one set of payments, then he doesn't have money to pay interest on the debt.""

Ultimately people could have had legal claims for money that they were owed and a judge could have ordered the government to pay up -- and ""then they don't have the cash to pay the interest on the debt,"" Baker wrote. ""There is a limited grain of truth in that Aug. 2 was not literally a drop-dead date, but the idea that the government could operate for any sustained period of time without facing default is ridiculous.""

Some of our experts said there's room for some disagreement. Donald Marron, professor at Georgetown University and former acting director of the Congressional Budget Office argued that it depends how one interprets ""default.""

""I believe he is correct that the U.S. would not need to default on its debt obligations. I believe Treasury said last week that it would prioritize payments to make sure interest is covered. Some people use the word default, however, to include the idea of missing any financial obligation. Under that definition, prioritization would count as a form of default, since someone would not receive timely payment from the federal government.""

Barry Bosworth, senior fellow in economic studies at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution wrote "".... I agree that his priority to debt payments is correct in that most would not consider that a default. .... However, some legal experts would argue that the government has defaulted on its commitments (broadly defined) when it does not honor the bills that are submitted to it. However, the failure to pay bills in a timely fashion has happened in the past (mid 1990s), particularly by state and local governments, and it was not considered a default.""

And J.D. Foster, senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation argued that ""the accuracy of this statement depends in part on how much you're willing to take into account the preceding sentence, which specifically refers to the debt. If the debt ceiling is not raised, then we will not go into default on the debt because as everyone now understands, the interest would be paid. This is, for many, the No. 1 issue. However, taken in isolation, the statement is incorrect because the nation would go into a technical default if the debt ceiling were not raised if only because Congress has passed laws the president has signed requiring certain spending be undertaken for which the funds would be lacking.""

Meanwhile, key ratings agencies weighed in with their interpretation since our previous items have appeared.

On July 26 -- around the same time we were publishing our Tom Price item -- The Wall Street Journal reported in a blog post that the influential ratings firm Moody's provided its definition of default:

""What would Moody’s consider a default? We do not consider delayed payments for obligations other than debt service to be a default,"" the post said. ""In other words, President Barack Obama could make good on his warnings that Social Security checks wouldn’t go out, and that wouldn’t constitute a 'default.'""

David Beers, the global head of sovereign ratings for another key ratings agency, Standard & Poors, said in a July 27 interview with CNBC that ""it would not be default so long as the government is continuing ... to pay its debt as it matures and its interest payments. But we would suspect that that's not a tenable situation for very long.""

Our rating

Rubio told a constituent in an e-mail: ""If the debt ceiling is surpassed, our nation will not go into default as some suggest."" We focused on whether it would be considered a default if the United States had chosen to pay some bills but not others, due to prioritization decisions amid a cashflow problem.

The legal definition would seem to suggest that the U.S. would be in at least partial default under that scenario, and a number of experts agreed with that view. Other experts said there's some wiggle room in how you define ""default.""

Ultimately, much of the statement's accuracy hinges on whether you consider ratings agencies to be the ultimate guardian of the term ""default,"" or whether you consider a legal or commonsense definition to apply. We acknowledge that there are a range of opinions on this matter, but it has become clearer since our prior attempts to tackle this question that the ratings agencies are willing to overlook any defaults beyond those involving bondholders when they measure the nation's creditworthiness. By virtue of their position, the ratings agencies carry significant weight on this question. Still, we feel Rubio wrongly downplayed the likelihood of technical defaults on other creditors, such as federal contractors. We believe that the nation can be in default on some obligations even if the agencies choose to ignore them as they calculate their ratings. On balance, we rate Rubio's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/02/marco-rubio/rubio-says-if-debt-ceiling-was-surpassed-us-would-/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Eric Cantor']","
Eric Cantor said, ""There are no tax increases in this debt limit bill. Period.""
","
After weeks of partisan rancor, Congress approved a debt ceiling increase that will fund the federal government through 2013 and prevent potential economic catastrophe. The final legislation -- the Budget Control Act of 2011 -- allows the United States to borrow $2.1 trillion through the next election. 

In modern congressional tradition, representatives flocked to their Twitter accounts to share their thoughts about the legislation. On the evening of Aug. 1, 2011, after the House of Representatives passed the bill, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., tweeted, ""There are no tax increases in this debt limit bill. Period.""

His tweet alludes to the debate between Republican and Democratic lawmakers regarding taxes. President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats wanted tax revenue increases in the bill. It was one of the chief sticking points through the negotiations. The final bill that Congress approved Aug. 2, contained no explicit tax increases or revenue raisers.

Still, that's not quite the end of the story. 

We reviewed the text of the legislation, as well as detailed summaries put out by the White House and congressional Republicans. To help analyze Cantor's statement, here's a quick rundown of the Revised Budget Control Act of 2011: 

The bill raises the debt limit by $2.1 trillion but requires Congress to cut $2.4 trillion out of the federal budget over the next decade to match and exceed this increase. Roughly $917 billion of the cuts are implemented with the passage of the bill. The specifics of the second $1.5 trillion in cuts will be determined by a newly created bipartisan deficit reduction committee, made up of 12 lawmakers, with six members from each party.

The committee must make its recommendations on what to cut by Nov. 23, 2011. Both houses of Congress must then approve these recommendations in an up-or-down vote, allowing for no amendments. If the committee deadlocks and can't achieve $1.2 trillion in cuts, or if Congress doesn't approve the committee's recommendations, then there is an automatic $1.2 trillion in cuts that come from both defense and domestic programs. Several programs, including Social Security, benefits for Medicare recipients and initiatives for low-income Americans, are exempt.

The bill also requires that both chambers vote on a constitutional balanced budget amendment. If both chambers approve this amendment, then no automatic cuts will occur even if the committee reaches an impasse. But the chances of a balanced budget amendment aren't good: It requires a two-thirds majority of the House and Senate. 

Getting back to Cantor's tweet, it's possible that the bipartisan committee could recommend revenue increases to help bridge the deficit gulf. However, there are several things Republicans could do to block this outcome. First, the six Republicans on the committee could refuse to go along with additional tax revenues. If the recommendations include tax increases, the Republican House could still vote the deal down. 

Cantor's tweet is largely correct. It's true that there are no tax increases written directly into the bill. Still, the debt committee has the power to propose tax increases if a majority of its members feel it is appropriate, and if Congress approves those recommendations they would become law. Those are high hurdles, so we rate Cantor's statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/aug/02/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-said-there-are-no-tax-increases-debt-l/

Florida state investment chief says transparency was a big issue for lawmakers in 2011
","
Facing questions about the handling of the state's $130 billion investment portfolio, the executive director and chief investment officer of the State Board of Administration tried to reassure Florida Gov. Rick Scott that everything is fine.

SBA executive director Ash Williams defended SBA procedures and policies to Scott and members of the Florida Cabinet on Aug. 2, 2011. The comments came following a St. Petersburg Times analysis, which found that state investments would have yielded a better return sitting in an automated index fund than they did under high-priced investment consultants. The SBA currently invests about $130 billion for more than 1 million current and future government retirees and hundreds of state and local government agencies.

Part of the concern for Scott, were questions about whether the SBA is handling its transactions in secret.

""What about the question about transparency?"" Scott asked Williams. ""Are there things that we ought to be doing that we're not doing yet?"" 
""Well, I think the transparency issue got a great airing the last legislative session. We have for the most part full transparency,"" Williams said. ""All of our publicly traded activity is very readily observable or obviously subject to the public records law. We have one very narrow slice of our activity that has a very limited exception from Florida's public records law and that relates to alternative investments and subjects them to a certain type of review prior to being released.""

What stuck out to us at PolitiFact Florida was Williams' suggestion that the question of transparency at the SBA ""got a great airing the last legislative session."" (After all, we witnessed the entire legislative session firsthand.)

Was that what really happened?

The 2011 annual legislative session came and went with lengthy debate on a number of issues. We remember hours of debate about a bill -- which ultimately failed -- that would have eliminated the automatic payroll deduction of union dues for public employees. We remember feisty arguments and a fair amount of public testimony about a bill that passed (and is now being challenged in court) altering Florida voter laws.

Early in the session, debate zeroed in on an education bill that would eliminate a form of tenure for public school teachers. Late in the session, in the Senate, debate roiled over an immigration bill.

We can list others -- bills about abortion, the state budget and amending the state's growth management laws all consumed hours of time in the 60-day spring session.

But again, back to Williams' statement -- transparency at the SBA.

We searched and found one bill on the topic -- HB 7225 (the identical Senate bill was SB 2174).

The bill was filed in order to extend a public records exemption for the SBA that was set to expire. Specifically, it renews a 2006 law giving the SBA an exemption from public records requirements for ""proprietary confidential business information."" The bill passed the Senate 33-3 (one senator originally voted yes, but changed -- more on that later) and the House 114-1. It was signed into law by Scott on May 31.

Williams explained the 2006 law and the extension this way to Scott and Cabinet members as part of his Aug. 12 comments:

""That law has been in effect and affects less than 10 percent of the SBA's portfolio, so the other 90-plus percent doesn’t have any of that protection,"" he said. ""That law was under sunset review last legislative session. It was heard extensively in committees and in the House and Senate, and the overwhelming vote of the Legislature was that it was in the public interest, so much so that it was reinstated and the future recurring sunset review of it was removed because it's been in place for so many years that the judgment of the Legislature in public hearings and after extensive staff review was that it actually served the public interest well.""

The Florida Senate and House websites archive video of committee meetings, as well as regular floor sessions. So by retracing the path of the bill, we were able to watch the entire debate over HB 7225 and SB 2174.

Lucky for us, there wasn't a lot.

The measure was first heard in the Senate Governmental Oversight and Accountability on April 5. It was explained by a Senate staffer (the de facto sponsor, Sen. Jeremy Ring, D-Margate, was not at the meeting.)

After its introduction, Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, asked several questions about the records exemption and whether it was necessary. Eventually, Williams responded to Fasano's questions directly in a back-and-forth that lasted a little less than 20 minutes. At one point, Fasano showed SBA documents that had been heavily redacted. ""It's all blank, Mr. Chairman. There's nothing. It just goes on and on,"" he said.

Williams, in response, noted that the document Fasano was referring to -- an Invitation to Negotiate for legal services -- was heralded as being a model of transparency by a national group.

That didn't win over Fasano, who continued to voice strong objections. Another senator, Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, also voiced concern.

The proposal, which didn't get a vote that day, returned before the same committee April 14, when senators heard and discussed the bill for 10 minutes. No one from the public spoke; neither did Williams.

Fasano reiterated his concerns, as did Latvala. Democratic Sen. Bill Montford of Tallahassee said he had no problem with the exemption, and Ring defended the proposal -- saying companies now doing business with the state would walk away if the public records exemption were allowed to expire.

It passed the committee 11-2.

On the same day, April 14, a House committee heard its version of the same bill. Discussion lasted three minutes and 15 seconds. Republican Paige Kreegel of Punta Gorda asked sponsor Rep. Jimmy Patronis, R-Panama City, if there had been concerns over some of the SBA's investments. Patronis didn't directly answer the question, saying the two members could talk later, and that the bill had another committee stop.

The bill passed unanimously 17-0.

But it never went to another committee.

Instead, it appeared on the House floor April 28, where it was read the required second and third times and passed by the full chamber 114-1 in a total of 57 seconds.

The Senate then took up the House version of the legislation the next day (though the versions were identical). The Senate read the bill a second and third time as required, and without any discussion or debate -- voted 34-2 in favor. Fasano, originally a yes vote, changed his vote to no, making the final outcome 33-3.

Total time on the Senate floor: One minute, 30 seconds.

Overall, the SBA public records exemption was a topic for less than 36 minutes in a public meeting, according to our review of videos from committee hearings and from the floors of the House and Senate.

Of that, about 25 minutes of the discussion came from one senator, Fasano, during a back-and-forth with Williams and a subsequent committee speech.

And excluding the sponsors -- Ring and Patronis -- only five members of the 160-member Legislature ever discussed the exemption in a public forum: Fasano, Latvala, Montford, Kreegel and Rep. Rick Kriseman, D-St. Petersburg, who asked during a hearing what the First Amendment Foundation thought about the bill.

That brings us back to what Williams said, that ""the transparency issue got a great airing the last legislative session.""

At PolitiFact we're sometimes reluctant to analyze statements that are open to interpretation (what's the definition of ""great"" in this case), but we feel confident that someone seeing Williams' statement would come away with an impression that is very different from the legislative record. In fact, the public records SBA bill that moved through the House and Senate passed with just slightly more debate than is absolutely necessary to comply with state rules that a bill be read three times before it is passed. We're not saying it's Williams' fault that the Legislature decided not to speak out on this bill. But we do hold him accountable for his words. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/02/ash-williams/florida-state-investment-chief-says-transparency-w/

Allen West challenger says he has raised more money than all other congressional challengers
","
Democrats may not yet agree on who offers the best chance to beat U.S. Rep. Allen West in 2012, but they all know this: it will take a lot of money.

West raised more than $6.5 million in 2010 for his successful campaign against incumbent Democrat Ron Klein in a Broward/Palm Beach swing district.

And he's only gotten more popular in many Republican circles since going to Washington. West has become something of a spokesman for the tea party movement (which also makes him a lightning rod for criticism), having appeared on NBC's Meet the Press as well as being a frequent guest on Fox News.

West already has raised more than $2.2 million through the first two quarters of 2011. 
Yet Democrats think West may be vulnerable in a South Florida district that they say might not fully embrace his tea party mentality. Already, two Democrats have filed to run against him in 2012: former West Palm Beach mayor and state legislator Lois Frankel and Patrick Murphy, a 28-year-old businessman. 

Murphy -- a former Republican who switched party affiliation in January 2011 -- has never run for political office in his life, but on July 16, 2011, he claimed that he has raised more cash than any other congressional challenger in the country.

""For the second quarter in a row, my campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and brought our fundraising total to over $800,000,"" he said on his website. ""Some political insiders doubted we would be able to do it again, but our second quarter haul of over $450,000 proves that not only are people fed up with Allen West but that I am the candidate they want to replace him.""

Has Murphy two quarters in a row raised more money than any other challenger in the nation -- over $800,000?

Through June 30 (the first two quarters of 2011), Murphy raised $808,671.59, according to the Federal Election Commission. The amount includes no loans, but Murphy did donate $36,100 to the campaign. (A donation is different from a loan in that Murphy has no expectation he'll be repaid.)

We called the Federal Election Commission -- the repository of Congressional campaign finance reports -- and asked spokesman Christian Hilland if Murphy had raised more than any other congressional challenger in the nation two quarters in a row. Based on campaign finance reports submitted to the FEC, Hilland sent us back a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet of the top 10 fundraisers among congressional challengers in the first and second quarters in 2011. 

The chart shows that during the first quarter, Jan. 1 through March 31, 2011, Murphy took in about $352,448.99. He took in $456,222.60 during the second quarter, April 1 through June 30, 2011. A few other fundraisers taking on incumbents did take in more than Murphy in the first or second quarter. But they only surpassed Murphy because they either gave themselves large loans or because they transferred money from a U.S. Senate campaign.

• John Atkinson of Illinois raised $173,550.18 more than Murphy in the first quarter of 2011 but included a $270,000 loan. (Atkinson dropped out of his House race in June 2011.)

• Abel Maldonado of California raised $80,867.40 more than Murphy in the second quarter. But his figures included a $250,000 loan. 
And then there were two candidates from Texas with the last name of Williams who switched their campaigns from the U.S. Senate to the U.S. House. 
• Roger Williams' total for the second quarter was $1,017,535, but he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2008 and then switched to a congressional race in June 2011. 
• Michael Williams raised $418,619.20 during the first quarter, which was $66,170.21 more than Murphy's, but he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2008 and then switched to a congressional race in June 2011.

 For the record, Murphy's Democratic primary opponent also made the top 10 list: Frankel raised $698,545.88 for the first two quarters combined.

Murphy said, ""For the second quarter in a row, my campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and brought our fundraising total to over $800,000."" A couple of other candidates technically raised more money, but that is thanks to either personal campaign loans or switching from a statewide U.S. Senate campaign to a run for the House. We think Murphy is on solid footing to leave those scenarios out when making his claim.

So, we rate it True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/02/patrick-murphy/allen-west-challenger-says-he-has-raised-more-mone/

The Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy for America say an elementary school was closed because of budget cuts supported by Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon)
","
The small elementary school in the Waushara County Town of Poy Sippi opened in 1962 and harks back to a bygone era. It’s not a one-room school house, but it’s not far from that.

A total of 75 students attended the K-4 school in the 2010-’11 school year, said Robert Eidahl,  administrator for the Berlin Area School District, which includes Poy Sippi. That compares with 650 students at the other elementary school in the district, Clay Lamberton, located in Berlin, west of Oshkosh.

In May 2011, the school board made a wrenching decision for any small community: It voted to close Poy Sippi. The decision was followed by a tearful last day that was covered on local television where small children and their teachers said goodbye to their school, and focused on a move to the much larger facility about 15 miles away.

Yet, as sorrow melted into summer, the school-closing issue flared up again, thanks to an ad in one of the high-stakes state Senate recall races.

Poy Sippi Elementary plays a starring role in a TV ad from the Progressive Change Committee and Democracy for America targeting Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon), one of six GOP state senators facing recall elections on Aug. 9, 2011. The ad blames Olsen for the closing of the school.

""I'm standing here in front of Poy Sippi Elementary School where Luther Olsen's kids went to school,"" local resident Jay Jones says in the ad. ""All of my kids have gone here. Two of them still do. But next year, because of budget cuts Luther Olsen voted for, my kids are not going to get the opportunity to go to this little school.""

He later adds: ""Republicans have found a way to find multimillion dollar tax cuts for rich corporations, but they can't find a way to keep my kids' school open.""

Jones, a social studies teacher at Wautoma High School, declares at the end  that he will vote for Olsen’s challenger, state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo)

So, did Olsen and the budget he voted for close the school?

When asked to back up their claim, Democracy for America provided a May 24, 2011 letter to parents announcing the closing, signed by Eidahl and Poy Sippi Elementary principal Scott Bartol.

""This decision was made after discussions and planning over the last two months precipitated by the historic budget cuts required by the new governor’s budget,"" the letter said. ""The decision to close Poy Sippi was a very difficult one for everyone involved but it proved to be the best alternative to handle our financial problems.""

However, the school had been operating for years on borrowed time.

In an interview, Eidahl said closing Poy Sippi has been contemplated for more than a decade. He said the decision was the result of declining enrollment -- there was one class for each grade and 14 or 15 students in each -- and the cost of operating the tiny stand-alone facility.

""We just couldn’t afford to keep it open any longer,"" he said.

The school board voted 7-2 to close the school at a meeting May 23, 2011, a move that will cut district costs by about $500,000. He noted that school districts across the state have closed other lightly attended schools in recent years.

So, the decision has been in the works for a while. But was the 2011-’13 budget the tipping point?

The Berlin district had a number of retirements that made this a good time to close Poy Sippi, said Eidahl and school board president Mark Finger. The 13 retirements allowed the district to transfer Poy Sippi teachers and merge the two schools without any layoffs.

Finger said the transfers and closing made more sense than filling the open jobs and then possibly having to fire those new teachers in a year or two if the Poy Sippi closing came then.

We’ll return to those retirements in a minute.

But let’s look at how the state budget affected the school district’s finances.

The Berlin district has a $14.9 million budget for the 2011-’12 school year. Of that, about $10.2 million is in the form of state aid, and $4.7 million is from local property taxes, Eidahl said.

The amount of state aid that the district received was cut by $943,000 in the 2011-’13 state budget. At the time of the school-closing decision, the board thought the aid cut could be as high as $1.1 million, Eidahl said.

The aid cut was offset, however, by other measures. The district switched from the WEA Trust insurance plan to a different carrier, saving $320,000. Union staff members paying toward their retirement -- one of the components in a separate measure advanced by Gov. Scott Walker and approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature -- cut district costs by $410,000. Both measures were adopted as part of a one year contract extension with the teachers, Eidahl said.

That covered about $730,000 of the aid cut, leaving the district with a shortfall of about $210,000.

""That had to be made up somehow,"" Eidahl said.

The retirement of the 13 people also presented the school board with a chance to reduce costs.

District officials say the number of retirements was unusually high. Some -- if not all -- were linked to the changes that curtailed collective bargaining for public employees … the same changes that allowed the district to require them to pay more for pensions and health care.

So, what does that mean for the claim in the ad?

The Progressive Change Campaign Committee says budget cuts advocated by Olsen led to the closing of a small town’s elementary school.

District officials said in interviews that Poy Sippi Elementary has been on life support for years, due to the low enrollment and cost of operating the building, but that the timing of the closing was due in part to a high number of retirements. Some of those were driven by the GOP-backed collective bargaining changes.

But that’s only one piece of the picture. Much of the district’s cut in direct state aid was offset by budgetary changes allowed by the ""tools"" Walker and the GOP advocated. But the school district still had a shortfall -- and told parents that the time had come for closing Poy Sippi because of the ""historic budget cuts"" advanced by Walker and supported by Olsen. What’s more, the wave of retirements prompted by the changes contributed to the timing.

UPDATED: Retiree group says Social Security doesn't contribute a penny to U.S. deficit
","
CORRECTION, Sept. 29, 2011: This fact check originally said that without changes in law, the Social Security trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2036. That is incorrect, a reader pointed out, though 2036 is the year Social Security is expected to no longer cover full benefits--again, barring changes in law. This correction, reflected in the amended text below, does not affect our original rating.

The Texas AFL-CIO’s Ed Sills noted in his July 12 email blast of labor-related news that a Washington group was urging people to call their U.S. senators about preserving Social Security.

In asking its members to call their senators, the Alliance for Retired Americans said: ""Social Security faces an immediate threat from politicians in Washington"" who want to cut the program’s cost-of-living inflation adjustment ""to reduce the deficit. But Social Security doesn’t contribute a penny to the deficit.""

Not a cent?

That’s an eye-catching claim because last year for the first time since 1983, Social Security’s income from payroll taxes did not cover what it paid beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration’s summary of its 2011 annual report says the program ran a ""cash deficit"" of $49 billion in 2010 and is projected to run a $46 billion deficit in 2011. The summary attributes these shortfalls in part to the weakened economy. It also says that in 2012-14, the agency expects such deficits to shrink as the economy strengthens. In subsequent years, though, Social Security’s deficits are expected to grow rapidly as the ""number of beneficiaries continues to grow at a substantially faster rate than the number of covered workers.""

The agency doesn’t say Social Security is going broke. Through 2022, it says, ""annual cash deficits will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets"" from the U.S. Treasury.

Some ""trust fund"" background: When Social Security’s payroll tax income exceeds payments to beneficiaries, the government spends the surplus as general revenue and the Treasury gives Social Security interest-bearing bonds in return. When Social Security has to redeem its ""trust fund assets"" to cover a difference between income and payments, it is relying on these bonds and the interest they generate.

As of December 2010, there was about $2.6 trillion in Treasury bonds and related interest in Social Security’s trust fund. Barring changes in law, the agency’s summary report says, the trust fund will not have enough money to cover full benefits starting in 2036. ""Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2085,"" the summary states.

So the question is, when Social Security’s trust fund is used to cover benefits, is Social Security contributing to the government’s overall deficit, which was approaching $1.4 trillion when we started this review?

David Blank, spokesman for the Alliance for Retired Americans, said the group made its not-a-cent claim because Social Security is financed by the payroll tax paid by workers and employers on each worker's first $106,800 of annual income, supplemented by income from the government bonds purchased by the program in surplus-income years.

""Social Security is prohibited from spending any money beyond what it has in its trust fund,"" Blank said by email. ""This means that it cannot lawfully contribute to the federal budget deficit, since every penny that it pays out must have come from taxes raised through the program or the interest garnered from the bonds held by the trust fund.""

Blank’s bottom line: Social Security ""is a self-financed program.""

Correct, said Ben Veghte, a research associate at the National Academy of Social Insurance, whose mission is to ""promote understanding of how social insurance contributes to economic security and a vibrant economy."" Veghte told us that because Social Security is considered an ""off-budget"" independently financed program, it simply can’t contribute to the general government deficit. When it needs to draw on revenue from bonds that were purchased in earlier years, he said, it’s simply fetching due returns. At this time, he said, Social Security is funding 83 percent of its benefits from payroll taxes, 13 percent from interest on bonds and 3 percent from taxing the benefits of high-income recipients.

Neil Buchanan, a professor of law at George Washington University who’s disputed claims that Social Security is in the ditch, said the program’s 2010 and expected 2011 cash deficits might have been hurried along because of the latest recession, but it’s long been known that as baby boomers started to retire, each year’s payroll tax income for Social Security would stop covering all the costs of benefits.

However, Buchanan said, it’s possible to conclude that the recent cash deficits contributed a trivial amounts to the federal deficit.

Jagadeesh Gokhale, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, said in an interview that whenever Social Security taps proceeds from its U.S. bonds, it’s clearly affecting overall government spending because the Treasury has to get the money somehow, usually by borrowing money from another source. ""Basically the liability of the federal government to Social Security is going to be exchanged for liability to the public,"" Gokhale said. ""So, yes, if Social Security is redeeming Treasury IOUs to pay scheduled benefits, it is contributing to the federal government’s unified federal deficit.""

Unified?

The Social Security Administration says  the ""unified"" budget encompasses all of the government’s budgetary activities, excluding Social Security and Post Office operations, with the unified budget deficit being the measure that determines how much the government has to borrow from the public to meet its obligations. Then again, it notes, ""those involved in budget matters often produce two sets of numbers, one without Social Security included in the budget totals and one with Social Security included. Thus, Social Security is still frequently treated as though it were part of the unified federal budget even though, technically, it no longer is.""

Feeling flummoxed, we heard back from June O’Neill, who headed the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for part of the 1990s. O’Neill, an economics professor at Baruch College, City University of New York, aligned with Gokhale of the Cato Institute, saying that whenever Social Security doesn’t collect enough in payroll taxes to cover benefits, its need for additional money naturally ripples through the entire budget.

She pointed out, though, that Social Security in 2010 and this year is hardly responsible for a big part of the deficit. Also, she stressed, it would have been incorrect to say Social Security contributed to deficits before last year. That’s because more money came in via payroll taxes than was paid out in benefits.

O’Neill said all government programs contribute to the deficit. ""There’s nothing special about"" Social Security on this point, she said. Put another way, she said, the CBO tracks government receipts and expenditures; Social Security’s money in and money out are included.

We’re expertised out.

And our conclusion is that there's a legitimate rationale for saying Social Security doesn’t contribute to the deficit. After all, it draws on a payroll tax to pay for itself and has built up $2.6 trillion in Treasury IOUs and interest to cover cash shortfalls.

However, when Social Security draws from its trust fund, as it did last year and will again this year, it is asking Treasury for money that has to come from the overall budget. And these transactions contribute to the overall federal deficit--not much perhaps, but more than a penny.

We rate the statement Mostly False.

Gingrey claims federal health care board can decide if you get dialysis, chemo
","
U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, who’s also a doctor, is aiming his scalpel at a lesser-known provision of last year’s health care overhaul.

The Marietta Republican recommends swift removal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which was created to rein in growing Medicare costs.

Gingrey, an obstetrician-gynecologist, wants the board repealed. He said at a recent news conference it’s worse than tossing Granny off Stone Mountain.

""Democrats like to picture us as pushing Grandmother over the cliff or throwing someone under the bus. In either one of those scenarios, at least the senior has a chance to survive,"" Gingrey said June 22.

""But under this IPAB we described that the Democrats put in Obamacare, where a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy, I guarantee you, when you withdraw that, the patient is going to die,"" said Gingrey. ""It’s rationing.""

What a bleak prognosis. Under the IPAB, does ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" really ""decide whether you get care""?

PolitiFact Georgia asked a Gingrey spokeswoman for proof, but she did not provide any.

We turned to four health care policy experts with differing opinions on the IPAB. They all told us that Gingrey was wrong.

But before we explain their reasoning, here’s more about the Independent Payment Advisory Board.

Lawmakers created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare, the federal program that provides health care for seniors.

Under the health care reform bill, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time frame, it is automatically implemented.  

Both sides of the aisle have their problems with the board. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule IPAB recommendations, or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, Republicans such as Gingrey and even Democrats have signed on to repeal the board.

This brings us back to Gingrey’s claim that under the IPAB, ""a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy.""

Gingrey is ""not even close to correct,"" said Michael Tanner, a scholar with the libertarian Cato Institute. He opposes the IPAB.

""It [IPAB] has nothing to do with individual care at all. It’s not making decisions on individuals,"" Tanner said.

Experts agree that the IPAB has no say in whether a specific person receives dialysis, chemotherapy or any other such treatment. The board does not intercede in individual patient cases. It makes broad policy decisions that affect Medicare’s overall cost.

Furthermore, the IPAB is barred from making policy recommendations that would block patients from receiving needed care, experts told PolitiFact Georgia.

""The legislation explicitly forbids the board from rationing care,"" said Stuart Guterman, a health policy expert with the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan group which works to improve health care access, quality and efficiency. Guterman said he thinks the IPAB can help with health care savings.

Our analysis of the bill only found language designed to avoid the result Gingrey foretells.

For instance, the IPAB may not submit ""any recommendation to ration health care,"" Section 3403 states.   

The same section also bars raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, as well as increasing deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue, either.

The IPAB can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions, or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing.

If Medicare reimbursements for chemotherapy drop too low, doctors might stop treating Medicare patients, or avoid recommending chemotherapy.

But this is not the scenario that Gingrey describes.

Gingrey makes no mention of indirect or long-term consequences. He says that with the IPAB, ""a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy. I guarantee you, when you withdraw that, the patient is going to die.""  

In other words, Gingrey says that bureaucrats will have the power to deny you treatment. And because of the bureaucrats, you could die.

This claim is incorrect. The IPAB does not have anything close to the power that Gingrey suggests. It cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying lifesaving care.

The claim is also outrageous. A policy board is not deadlier than pushing Grandma off a cliff.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says Social Security didn't cause the debt crisis
","
As talks on the federal debt ceiling turned into a standoff, President Obama pressed congressional leaders to consider a debt-reduction plan that would include changes in Social Security to reduce costs.

The plan, intended as a trade to win Republican support for increases in tax revenue, drew criticism from Democrats that included Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland.

Kucinich said on the House floor July 15, 2011, that Social Security was being falsely thrown into the debate, and that reducing benefits or raising the retirement age would only ""give government more money for tax cuts, spending or repaying the debt.""

""Social Security didn’t cause the debt crisis. Social Security had nothing to do with the debt crisis,"" he said.

PolitiFact Ohio asked Kucinich's office how he backed up his statement.

They referred us to ""Social Security: The Trust Fund,"" a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.

We also discovered that similar statements about Social Security and the debt crisis were previously checked by PolitiFact, and by our colleagues at Factcheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker.

Unfortunately, we found that they rated the statements true, not true and ""true but false"" -- and that their stories were followed by notes about ""our angry readers"" and stepping on a live wire.

Let's take deep breath and walk through it.

Social Security is a government program funded primarily by dedicated payroll taxes. It's called a pay-as-you-go system because current revenues are used to pay current costs. 
For most of the past 30 years, because of reforms designed by the Greenspan Commission in 1982 to protect Social Security’s solvency, collected revenues have exceeded benefit payments to retirees, survivors and the disabled.

Those surplus funds were credited to the Social Security trust fund.  By the end of 2010,  the trust fund totaled $2.6 trillion.

Last year, Social Security began to run a cash flow deficit. Costs exceeded tax revenues, for reasons that included the recession and its high unemployment. Social Security dipped into the trust fund to make up the difference.

Social Security's trustees projected that the fund would fully cover benefits through 2035, the Congressional Research Service notes, and that it would cover about 77 percent of benefits after that until 2085. Taking action like increasing the payroll tax or lifting the level of income subject to the tax above its current limit of $106,800 would keep the fund fully solvent for the entire 75 years.

And this is where money meets myth, cash flow meets credit and true meets false.

The trust fund is not a savings account or ""lock box"" into which cash is deposited. Social Security is required by law to put its entire surplus into interest-bearing government bonds -- Treasury securities backed by the U.S. government.

They are IOUs -- assets to Social Security but liabilities to the rest of government. They're one part of government promising to pay back another.

Once invested, the trust fund money is mingled with money from other sources of revenue in the U.S. Treasury general fund, and it is used for other government purposes that include spending, repaying debts or cutting taxes. For years, the infusion of Social Security's surplus revenue held down the federal deficit -- and, some say, encouraged spending.

When Social Security operates with a negative cash flow -- that is, when benefits exceed revenues -- it draws on interest from the trust fund securities.

To pay that interest and honor its IOUs to the trust fund, when the rest of the federal budget is operating at a deficit, the government has to borrow money.

That contributes to the deficit -- even though Social Security is legally drawing on the surplus that was collected from its dedicated tax, and even though the Congressional Research Service says that ""government borrowing from the public is not clearly linked to any particular aspect of what the government does.""

Kucinich was accurate in saying that Social Security didn’t cause the debt crisis. If anything, Social Security delayed it by subsidizing other spending and reducing the need to borrow money elsewhere. On the books, the Social Security trust fund has credits approaching $2.6 trillion.

Social Security’s negative cash flow has begun to contribute a relatively small amount to the federal deficit, however, because Treasury has to borrow to cover the trust fund money that has been spent elsewhere. That is a recent development, and that information provides clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich’s claim Mostly True.

Wall Street figure Ken Langone blasts Obama as 'unpresidential,' raps lack of suit jacket
","
Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot and a well-known Wall Street figure, took a shot at President Barack Obama during a July 28, 2011, roundtable segment on CNBC, the business-focused cable network.

""Let me make it very clear, and I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of hate mail because of this, and that’s okay,"" Langone said. ""I think our sitting president is acting so unpresidential …. He is dividing us as a nation. He is not bringing us together. He’s willfully dividing us. He’s petulant. ...

""The reality is we believe in a government of three legs, all equal. So if (House Speaker John) Boehner and (Senate Majority Leader Harry) Reid -- well, Reid will do whatever (Obama) tells him -- if Boehner had said I am not coming unless you speak to me in a respectful way, I am third in line to the president, (then I won’t come).

""Ronald Reagan would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on — that's how much he revered the presidency. This guy (Obama) worked like hell to be president, okay? He’s got it. Behave like a president.""

Langone’s comment is heavily opinionated, and at PolitiFact we make it our policy not to fact-check opinions. However, Langone used a vivid example that we think is checkable -- namely, whether it’s true that Reagan ""would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on."" As we look into that question, we’ll compare Reagan’s sartorial habits in the Oval Office with Obama’s to see whether Langone is justified in using Obama’s clothing choices to support his view that Obama is ""not acting presidential.""

We began by contacting people who either worked in the Reagan White House or who covered it as journalists.

Annelise Anderson said that neither she nor her husband Martin, both of whom worked in the Reagan White House, ""ever saw Reagan in the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room without a tie and jacket"" and that they’d frequently heard that Reagan didn't even take his jacket off in the heat of summer.

""Martin was in meetings with Reagan several times a day while he was assistant to the president for policy development,"" she said. ""I was associate director of the Office of Management and Budget and saw the president less often, but always with coat and tie. Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter, was far more casual.""

Andrea Mitchell, who covered the Reagan White House for NBC News and who now hosts MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports, said she agrees that ""Reagan was more formal than some of his predecessors or successors. My recollection is that Reagan did usually wear his jacket in the Oval Office, as did many other presidents, at least when they were photographed. But there were clearly informal moments, especially on weekends and holidays when they didn’t have outside visitors.""

For documentary evidence, we turned to the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif. We reached Steve Branch, an audiovisual archivist with the National Archives and Records Administration, who may know more than anyone else about the official White House photographs of the Reagan era.

""We do have photos of President Reagan in the Oval Office without a coat and tie, but these only appear to be on weekends and I believe only for his Saturday radio addresses,"" Branch said. ""During the regular work week, he always wore a coat and tie, which is evident from all the photos we have in our collection.""

As an example, Branch forwarded us contact sheets from two rolls of film that show Reagan in casual dress. Both were taken when Reagan came in to make a Saturday radio address. We found an additional image of a casual Reagan in the Oval Office in this slide show compiled by the Huffington Post.

Mark Weinberg, an assistant press secretary in the Reagan White House, offered a simple explanation for why Reagan decided not to wear a jacket on weekends.

""He did not want to make everyone coming into work feel like they had to dress up too,"" Weinberg said. ""He knew that if he wore one, everyone else would, and he felt it was not fair to younger staff coming into work on weekends.""

So Langone is incorrect when he says that Reagan would ""never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on."" There’s photographic evidence showing Reagan jacket-less in the Oval Office, but there’s also ample evidence that Reagan usually wore jackets during the work week.

What about Langone’s conclusion that Reagan’s dress habits in the White House stemmed from ""how much he revered the presidency""?

We heard, particularly from former Reagan aides, that the 40th president treated the office with reverence. ""He made a point of saying the Oval Office was not his, that it belonged to the people, and he was only the custodian,"" Weinberg said. ""I never, ever heard him refer to it as ‘my office.’""

However, other experts see additional explanations for Reagan’s formality. One issue is the image-making that has shaped the modern presidency.

Reagan, who polished his skills as an actor in Hollywood, has been widely hailed as a modern master of image-making. When Reagan was at his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., he tended to wear western garb. In Washington, he tended to dress more formally. Both styles complemented and reinforced each other, helping define a clear persona of someone who was robust and in charge.

""Reagan understood that the image one projects helps shape the public’s view, and I suspect it is not just generational that a president who carries himself in a more formal, dignified manner projects by that a bit more gravitas than a president who dresses and acts like he’s just ‘one of the guys,’"" said Sam Donaldson, who covered the Reagan White House for ABC News.

To the extent that Obama has sometimes appeared without a jacket for Oval Office meetings, his decision communicates something different, said Bronwyn Cosgrave, the author of Sample: Cuttings from Contemporary Fashion and Costume & Fashion: A Complete History. Cosgrave said Obama in shirtsleeves ""projects the sense that he is actually rolling up his sleeves, getting down to business and tackling the task of running the country,""

The other factor has to do with the norms for a man of Reagan’s generation.

Lou Cannon, an author and journalist who covered Reagan both as California governor and as president, told PolitiFact that ""Reagan certainly did revere the office of the presidency, but, in my view, the fact he wore a coat and tie to work is mostly generational. He did the same in Sacramento, at least on weekdays, when he was governor. People of my father's generation -- he was born seven years before Reagan -- were taught to wear a suit and tie for formal occasions and certainly would have done so in the White House.""

Fashion historians agreed that it’s important to keep in mind generational shifts.

""The norms for dress have changed since the Reagan years to a much more casual attire,"" said Joanne B. Eicher, editor in chief of the Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion and an emeritus professor of design, housing, and apparel at the University of Minnesota. ""This can even be seen in what people wear for air travel, as one example, then and now.""

Eicher said that ""many men today do not wear complete suits or even jackets with trousers to social functions as once was expected. For example, a prominent business executive I know, about 60, was attending a late afternoon wedding reception last month wearing a well-pressed long-sleeved plaid shirt, with no tie. Times have changed a lot in regard to what is acceptable.""

We also tried to judge how often Obama has gone jacket-less in the Oval Office. We did this by looking at the White House Flickr stream, which includes photographs taken by the official White House photographers.

We found that in the great majority of Oval Office photographs during his presidency, Obama was seen wearing a suit. We did find that Obama was likelier to be jacket-less during his first 100 days in office, with 13 instances during that period.

However, in the 26 months since then, Obama has sharply curtailed the number of times he has been caught on camera in the Oval Office without a jacket. We found only eight examples on weekdays during that period, or about one such occasion every three months. (We found two additional cases after the first 100 days when Obama went casual on a weekend or holiday.)

We also noted that none of these eight occasions included an outsider. All showed Obama either by himself or with top aides or cabinet members.

Eicher, the fashion historian, added that even when jacket-less, Obama's choice of shirts and ties is ""immaculate.""

Most people who we interviewed for this story thought Langone had gone too far in demonizing Obama.

""Reagan was a transformational president, but I don't really think the fact he wore a coat and tie to the Oval Office had anything to do with it,"" said Cannon, the Reagan biographer. ""And while I have my criticisms of President Obama, the notion that ‘his behavior’ means ‘the end of America as we know it’ is rot. Obama dresses appropriately for the present generation, as Reagan did for his.""

Bruce Bartlett, an economist who worked in the Reagan White House, agreed that ""Reagan was certainly more formal than Carter, but probably no more so than Nixon or Ford had been. I don’t have the impression that Obama is any different than most presidents in that regard. In any case, it is idiotic to say that he would be debasing the presidency by not wearing a jacket.""

So where does this leave us? Langone isn’t correct that Reagan ""would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on,"" since he did dress casually on weekend days. But it is true that Reagan consistently wore a jacket on weekdays. That’s a stricter standard than Obama has set, though the differences between the two presidents aren’t as divergent as Langone suggests.

In addition, most people we interviewed thought that he went too far when he used Obama’s patterns of dress as evidence that he is ""unpresidential."" Since the end of Obama’s first 100 days, Obama has been photographed without a jacket in the Oval Office only about once every three months and never with a visitor who wasn’t a senior staff member or appointee. The vast majority of photographs show Obama dressed in a jacket in the Oval Office, even though fashion experts agreed that generational norms have shifted, making jackets less essential, and less expected, in such settings. 
It's clear that Reagan's customary dress -- relaxed only on weekends -- was a suit and tie. But Langone's use of the word ""never"" overstated the case. In our rulings, words matter. So we rate Langone’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/01/ken-langone/wall-street-figure-ken-langone-blasts-obama-unpres/

Stimulus jobs cost taxpayers $278,000 each, GOP committee says in claim against Dem Wis. Rep. Ron Kind
","
Finding a Republican who likes President Barack Obama’s stimulus plan might be harder than finding a hair comb-over that’s truly convincing.

There almost certainly are no stimulus fans at the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is devoted to electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives.

In January 2009, the NRCC criticized the stimulus allotment of $335 million for sexually transmitted disease prevention programs. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National rated that claim Mostly True.

In an October 2010 claim against then-U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen, D-Wis., the NRCC said the stimulus cost Wisconsin ""77,000 jobs lost."" We rated that one Pants on Fire.

And the attacks have continued.

In a July 5, 2011, news release, the committee singled out U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., saying ""Kind’s stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job.""

Although the stimulus wasn’t his plan, Kind voted for it. Eleven House Democrats and all House Republicans voted against it.

As we noted in our NRCC item about Kagen, critics say the $830 billion cost of the stimulus has bought too few jobs, and unemployment has grown generally worse since Obama signed the measure into law in February 2009.

But the claim that the stimulus spent $278,000 for every job it created is striking.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio and PolitiFact Texas already have examined it.

PolitiFact Ohio found that the statistic originated in a blog posting on the website of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. The posting by Jeffrey H. Anderson attributes the $278,000-per-job cost to ""Obama’s economists."" But to come up with that amount, Anderson did his own math with figures from a status report on the stimulus by Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.

Citing the report, Anderson said the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.4 million jobs at a cost to date of $666 billion. He divided the $666 billion by 2.4 million jobs to come up with a rounded-up figure of $278,000  per job.

Here’s how our colleagues sized up two reiterations of the claim:

House Speaker John Boehner

PolitiFact Ohio weighed in after Boehner, an Ohio Republican, tweeted about the blog post. Our colleagues rated Boehner’s echoing of the $278,000 cost as False, pointing out that it lumps all of the various types of stimulus spending together.

Stimulus spending, as the Associated Press noted in a fact check of a similar GOP claim, pays not only for the worker but for material, supplies and that worker's output -- a portion of a road paved, for example.

Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst

Dewhurst, a Republican, also tweeted about the blog posting. PolitiFact Texas found that of the $666 billion stimulus spending to date, 43 percent was spent on tax cuts for individuals and businesses; 19 percent went to state governments, primarily for education and Medicaid; 13 percent paid for government benefits to individuals such as unemployment and food stamps; and the remaining roughly 24 percent was spent on projects such as infrastructure improvement.

That underscores how stimulus money was spent on many things in addition to creating jobs. Our Texas colleagues rated Dewhurst’s claim False.

That’s two False ratings on the same claim.

We asked the NRCC if it had any evidence beyond the blog post cited by Boehner and Dewhurst to back up its version of the statement -- that ""Kind’s stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job."" Spokeswoman Andrea Bozek cited various reports critical of the stimulus, but nothing to establish that the $278,000 figure is correct.

To review:

The National Republican Congressional Committee, like Boehner and Dewhurst, claimed that the federal stimulus cost $278,000 per job. The NRCC called it ""Kind’s stimulus"" because U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., voted for it. Our PolitiFact colleagues have twice ruled the claim False and the NRCC offered us no new evidence to consider. We rate its claim False, as well.",/factchecks/2011/aug/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/stimulus-jobs-cost-taxpayers-gop-committee-says-in/

Gov. John Kasich says consumer spending has actally increased the last eight months
","
As a member of House of Representatives, Ohio Gov. John Kasich chaired a budget finance committee in the 1990s when Congress achieved a bi-partisan deal to balance the federal budget under former Democratic President Bill Clinton.

So, the Republican governor has become somewhat of a go-to historian lately for national media outlets reporting on the budget debate and stalemate over the debt ceiling.

The governor appeared July 17, 2011, on ""Meet the Press"" as part of a panel discussion that also included National Urban League president Marc Morial, economist Diane Swonk, Honeywell CEO David Cote and CNBC’s David Faber.

Host David Gregory set up part of the discussion with a Wall Street Journal article which rattled off a number of dejecting economic statistics and said that consumer spending has been decimated.

Faber concurred, saying that the United States has a consumer-led economy and consumers just aren’t willing to spend right now.

Cote noted that businesses like his are reluctant to increase production which could in turn create more jobs until they are sure there is demand for their products from consumers.

Then Kasich chimed in.

""Believe it or not, consumer spending is up over the last eight months, OK?"" he said.

Swonk, the economist,  acknowledged Kasich’s point.

The governor then went on to suggest that business has been slow to grow and add jobs because government has left too much uncertainty hanging in the balance in way of potential increases regulations or business taxes.

Sounds fair enough but is he right about consumer spending?

PolitiFact Ohio consulted the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis which charts spending trends.

The most recent information shows that disposal personal income -- meaning money Americans had available to spend after paying typical taxes -- was indeed up eight straight months from September 2010 thru May 2011. June figures were not yet available.

And the personal consumption expenditures -- money spent after taxes and typical living expenses -- were up 11 straight months from June 2010 through May 2011.

PolitiFact Ohio also thought it would be wise to ask a few economists, people who study the ins and outs and make projections about this stuff everyday, to give the rise in consumer spending some perspective.

Dean Baker, a co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, said Kasich is right, but added a caveat.

""I would just point that this is an extremely low bar. Consumer spending measured in nominal dollars is almost always rising, except in a severe recession,"" Baker said. ""So, saying that consumer spending is up over the last eight months isn’t too different from saying it is warmer in July than January. We pretty much always expect that to be true.""

Baker said the rate of growth adjusted for inflation is a better factor for determining consumer spending is really growing to any worthwhile degree.

Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former economist with the U.S. Department of Labor, offered another significant measure -- comparing consumer spending in a given month compared to the same month one year earlier.

Look at the figures that way, and Kasich looks golden again as year-to-year consumer spending has been up for over a year.

And he agreed that the rate of grown adjusted for inflation was also a good measure. When seasonally adjusted for inflation, Burtless said that consumer spending actually fell slightly, by one-tenth of a percentage point in two months, April and May.

Kasich is correct, though,  that consumer spending, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, has been risen overall the past eight months.

In fact, the year-over-year spending comparison shows that real consumer spending has been higher than the year ago amount since December 2009.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim True.

"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Virginia', 'Bobby  Scott']","
Scott says balanced budget amendment does not require balanced budget
","
U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott recently urged House colleagues not to be fooled by the title of a proposed ""balanced budget"" amendment.

""No provision of the amendment requires a balanced budget,"" Scott, D-3rd, said in a July 14 letter he sent to fellow lawmakers. ""All debate on this bill has been on the title and not the provisions in it.""

A balanced budget amendment with no stipulation to balance the budget? Scott has made this claim repeatedly, so we decided to check it out.

First, we should point out a number of proposals for balanced budget amendments are in the pipelines. Scott directed his statement at a resolution sponsored by a fellow Virginian - U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th.

Goodlatte’s measure was approved by the House Judiciary Committee -- on which Scott serves -- on June 15. It calls for the president to propose a balanced budget each fiscal year. But there are two exceptions that Scott says give the resolution more holes than the Titanic.

Scott points to language in the legislation that says, ""Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll call vote.""

""It doesn’t say you need to pass a balanced budget,"" Scott told us over the telephone. ""It doesn’t require it. It just says you need three-fifths vote to pass a budget that’s not balanced.""

The Democrat also noted that the amendment would allow Congress, by simple majority votes, to waive the balanced budget requirement if the U.S. is involved in a conflict ""that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security.""

Scott, during a June hearing, suggested that Congress could exaggerate national security risks and use them as an escape valve against balancing the budget.

So would Goodlatte’s amendment require a balanced budget? For an answer to this semantic question, we first turned to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzed the bills in a June 21 letter to Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

In summarizing the bill’s provision calling for the passage of a balanced budget, the CBO said ""such a requirement could be overridden by a three-fifths vote in each House (in Congress)."" In other words, the resolution does require a balanced budget but allows that stipulation to be waived.

Next, we turned to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that, along with Scott, opposes Goodlatte’s resolution.

Robert Greenstein, the center’s president, said in a July 16 statement that Goodlatte’s amendment was one of several pending before Congress that ""would essentially require that the budget be balanced within the coming decade.""

A June 1 letter to the House Judiciary committee, signed by 123 groups opposing Goodlatte’s legislation, said the measure ""would require a balanced budget every year, regardless of the state of the economy.""

We also talked to Bob Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a non-partisan group that has long spoken out against federal deficits. He said balanced budget amendments typically have an ""escape clause"" to allow extra spending. He said the three-fifths vote required for additional spending under Goodlatte’s bill is a high threshold.

""The intent of Goodlatte’s legislation is clearly to establish a balanced budget,"" Bixby said. ""You could say in a very technical sense (a balanced budget) is not required if Congress has an escape clause, but of course that’s par for the course in a constitutional amendment.""

Goodlatte’s measure would also set an annual federal spending limit at 18 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product and would require a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate to exceed that threshold. In addition, it would require a three-fifths vote in both houses to raise the debt ceiling.

Constitutional amendments are extremely difficult to pass. First they require a two-thirds vote in each House of Congress. Then three-quarters of the 50 state legislatures have to approve the amendment before it could become part of the Constitution.

Let’s review:

Scott said that no provision in Goodlatte’s balanced budget amendment would require balancing the budget. He makes a narrow argument based on escape valves built into the resolution.

But a number of policy experts say the resolution does, first and foremost, require a balanced budget and imposes high thresholds for its exceptions. We agree and find Scott’s semantic debate misleading. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/01/bobby-scott/scott-says-balanced-budget-amendment-does-not-requ/

Nearly half of Hispanic children in Georgia rely on Medicaid for health care
","
In a recent broadcast, WABE-FM (90.1) led into a story on the impact of proposed deficit-cutting measures with a shocking number.

""Forty-one point seven percent of Latino children in Georgia rely on Medicaid programs for health care,"" the reporter said, before cutting to tape of Jennifer Ng’andu, deputy director of health policy for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group.

Ng’andu said a Republican-led proposal in Congress to cut the deficit, in part with $1.4 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over 10 years, would have disproportionate effect on Hispanics because they are more likely to rely on taxpayer-funded health care.

That figure – 41.7 percent – is eye-popping. We wondered if it was accurate. The number comes from La Raza’s report ""The Meaning of Medicaid: A State-by-State Breakdown,"" recently released as a rebuttal to the GOP plan.

It turns out the nexus here is between race or ethnicity and poverty.

More than a quarter of Hispanics in the United States live in poverty, according to the U.S. census. The poverty rate has gotten worse in recent years for everybody, but Hispanics and blacks have the higher percentages of their ranks among the poor.

The census figures do not delve into immigration status -- whether someone is here legally or illegally. Some critics of illegal immigration contend that U.S. taxpayers should not be liable for the medical costs of anyone in the country illegally. This fact-check makes no attempt to wade into that controversy.

Children – defined by the census as people under 18 – also are more likely to be in poverty than any other age category. The most recent figures indicate 20.7 percent of young people meet the federal definition of poverty.

Census figures tie together poverty and a lack of insurance.

The percentage of all people without insurance rose from 15.4 percent in 2008 to 16.7 percent in 2009, according to a report released late last year. That’s 50.7 million people without insurance.
Broken down by race or ethnicity, the census calculates that 32.4 percent of Hispanics are uninsured. That’s significantly higher than blacks (21 percent), Asians (17.2 percent) or whites (12 percent).

Not surprisingly, income affects insurance rates. Nearly 27 percent of people making $25,000 a year or less are uninsured, according to the census.

So, the poor are more likely to be uninsured and Latinos are more likely to be uninsured. But is the number correct?

We contacted the Kaiser Family Foundation, which acts as a clearinghouse for health-related data, to see if the figure quoted for Georgia is correct. According to foundation spokesman Chris Lee, it checks out – or comes very close.

Lee said the figure they came up with is 41 percent even, using a three-year average of census data.

Ng’andu said La Raza used the same source to get its figure. In terms of raw numbers, that’s about 120,000 Latino children in the state relying on Medicaid for health care.

Medicaid is a federal program administered -- and jointly funded -- by the states that provides medical care to low-income people and the disabled, although eligibility varies by state. It covers a wide range of health-related costs, from doctor’s visits to nursing home care.

Nationally, the states and federal government put about $339 billion into Medicaid, with the federal government picking up 57 percent of the total cost, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The program costs Georgia $1.7 billion, and that figure is expected to climb with a planned federal expansion of the program that would add an estimated 650,000 people in 2014. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the additional costs to be around $714 million, while the governor’s office has projected the cost of the expansion at $2.5 billion over the next decade.

Currently, about one in six Georgia residents is enrolled in Medicaid, and most of those are children. La Raza is highlighting the high percentage of Latino children on the Medicaid rolls as an argument against cutting the program to lower the federal deficit.

That’s a subject for political debate, not PolitiFact. For the purposes of this fact-check,  the number in the WABE broadcast appears to be on target.

President Barack Obama says American manufacturers are creating new jobs for the first time since 1990
","
President Barack Obama packed an upbeat job statistic for his visit to the Master Lock plant in Milwaukee.

""For the first time since 1990, American manufacturers are creating new jobs,"" the president said on Feb. 15, 2012, as he praised Master Lock for bringing jobs back from China.

""American manufacturers are hiring for the first time since 1990,"" Obama said in repeating the claim two days later at a Boeing plant in Washington state.

The remarks got wide media play.

The claim of recent growth in manufacturing employment rang true: Wisconsin has added manufacturing jobs at a modest pace the last two years, seeing growth in durable goods production -- things like electric machinery, manufacturing equipment and auto parts.

And Wisconsin’s economy is as reliant on manufacturing jobs as any state. Wisconsin and Indiana have been trading the top spot in that category, state officials said.

Wisconsin’s last sustained growth period was from 1991 to 1999, when the state added almost 80,000 manufacturing jobs, peaking at 597,000, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusted figures. The next decade was a bumpy ride down to about 425,000 jobs.

But what about the national picture, which was what Obama cited in his Master Lock visit?

Obama claimed the nation was experiencing the first uptick ""since 1990.""

But the nation experienced a sustained period of modest manufacturing growth deep into the 1990s, most of it under the watch of President Bill Clinton. He presided during the longest continuous economic expansion in U.S. history.

In fact, the nation’s manufacturing boat rose with that tide, for a time at least, ticking up in the middle part of that decade and peaking in 1997, federal employment statistics show.

None of this was news to the White House, whom we contacted after checking the president’s remarks against his speech text. They forwarded a blueprint by the White House’s economic advisers that says the growth is the best since ""the late 1990s.""

The reference was correct in the Milwaukee the speech text, too (the italics are ours):

""For the first time since the 1990s, American manufacturers are creating new jobs, which is good for companies up and down the supply chain.  You’ve all heard enough about outsourcing.  Well, more and more companies like Master Lock are now insourcing.""

The White House said the president deviated from the text in Milwaukee, and it turns out he did the same thing in Washington state.

It may have been a misstatement, but it was what many news outlets focused on from his remarks, and what many at home heard as well.

The manufacturing uptick of the last two years is small – a 3 percent jump after a 35 percent drop the prior 12 years. Employment is still down compared to the start of Obama’s term. But the numbers have been in the plus column since January 2010.

So, in the end, the president got it wrong after he had it right.

And we’re rating what he said, not what he was supposed to say.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Jan Jones']","
Is Ga. at the head of the class in teacher compensation?
","
There’s apparently one major lesson that Georgia teachers should be sharing with their students.

You can do better as a public school teacher here than any other state in America, says one influential state lawmaker.

""[W]hen adjusted for cost of living, Georgia ranks first nationally in teacher salary and benefits,"" said Rep. Jan Jones, a Republican from north Fulton County who is also House speaker pro tem.

Jones’ comments were posted on The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Get Schooled blog. Many readers were surprised by her claim.

Some said this was a case for the Truth-O-Meter.

Jones used a February 2009 study by the John Locke Foundation, a Raleigh, N.C.-based think tank that supports limited government, to help back up her claim. She also did some research on her own, looking at states that had higher average salaries and determining that there were other factors -- such as differences in cost of living -- to conclude that Georgia teachers lead the nation in total compensation.

""I couldn’t find any factors that led me to believe that anyone had jumped ahead of us,"" she said.

The John Locke Foundation report focused on teacher compensation in the foundation’s home state, North Carolina. Although Georgia ranked 17th in average salaries, the Peach State finished first in overall annual compensation.

How did the foundation reach that conclusion?

It used a formula that included the National Education Association’s average salaries ($53,270 for Georgia) in 2008, pension contribution rates and a cost-of-living formula to measure compensation. They concluded that the average Georgia teacher’s annual compensation was $72,393. The average years of experience for Georgia of 12.9 was slightly below the national average of 14.6.

Interestingly, the difference between average salary and total compensation was higher for Georgia than any other state, at $19,123. The percentage difference between average salary and total compensation for Georgia was 35.9 percent. The only other state with a higher percentage difference was Arkansas, at 36.7 percent.

Tax dollars contributed to Georgia teacher pension plans were 9.28 percent in 2009, which the Locke Foundation used to calculate Georgia’s pension contribution. The national average was 10.16 percent, Locke reported. The Georgia contribution rose to 9.74 percent in 2010, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. 

Georgia’s cost-of-living index was 0.909, which was lower than every state except Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Georgia had the same cost-of-living index as Texas. Much of the research we found shows Georgia ranks in the lower half of the nation when it comes to cost of living. In late 2011, Georgia had the 16th lowest cost of living in the nation, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center.

Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, looked at the Locke Foundation’s study and thought the general approach it used to measure cost of living was ""reasonable."" Humphreys noted the study used ACCRA, a well-known index that measures cost of living in the nation’s larger cities and metropolitan areas. The foundation apparently used the cost of living of each city in a state to calculate the entire state’s cost-of-living index. The company that runs ACCRA told PolitiFact Georgia it does not measure cost of living for the entire state.

In general, though, Humphreys said salaries are based on simple supply and demand.

""To get enough teachers to move into those states, they have to pay more,"" Humphreys said. ""It’s really market economics at its best.""

We found no research that considered other factors such as pensions and cost of living to calculate teacher compensation.  

According to one website, www.teachersalaryinfo.com, Georgia was behind 18 other states and Washington, D.C., in teacher pay in 2009, the most recent year available. The average salary was $51,050. Another website, Teacher Portal, ranked Georgia third behind Illinois and Delaware in its ""salary comfort index."" It used a number of sources to come up with the average salary figure, but noted ""[f]inding accurate beginning and average salaries for teachers by state is a tricky business.""

The conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation did its own research on teacher salaries in 2011, but it did not include a state-by-state comparison. A senior policy analyst there, Jason Richwine, suggested other factors such as health insurance, life/disability insurance, retiree health care, and paid leave need to be included in any such comparisons.

Tim Callahan, spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, dismissed Jones’ claim. He argued that many Georgia teachers have had furlough days, had their salaries frozen and faced other cuts that Jones did not consider.

""That doesn’t pass the laugh test,"" Callahan said of Jones’ claim.

Jones, who said she became interested in the subject from her time as vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee, countered that teachers in several other states have similar financial circumstances. 

""I’m comfortable with my conclusions,"" the lawmaker said.

As we mentioned, there is little research on total teacher compensation nationally. The independent experts we spoke to looked at the Locke study and found its methodology was sound, but they found some areas to quibble about. We also wonder about the cost-of-living calculation used since ACCRA doesn’t measure it for the entire state.

The statement is based in some solid methodology, but we believe there are too many variables to consider and not enough research in order to make a true apples-to-apples comparison here. Under our rating system, that’s a Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/22/jan-jones/ga-head-class-teacher-compensation/
"['Rhode Island', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'States', 'Richard Morrison']","
Rhode Island State Rep. Richard P. Morrison says that Arizona experienced nearly immediate health benefits after a statewide ban on smoking in public places took effect
","
Rhode Island would extend the current ban on smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars to a slew of public places, including beaches, parks and playgrounds, under legislation introduced by state Rep. Richard P. Morrison.

The health benefits of a wider ban -- which would be one of the strictest in the country --  far outweigh any inconvenience to smokers, the Bristol Democrat said at a State House hearing on Feb. 15.

To bolster his point, Morrison pointed to another state that passed a far-reaching ban on smoking five years ago.

""If we pass this, we are not alone,"" he said at the hearing before the House Health, Education and Welfare Committee. ""The State of Arizona in 2007 banned smoking in all public places, and an unintended consequence of that, in the first year alone, the admissions for acute myocardial infarction -- or heart attack, for a better term -- stroke, asthma, angina, decreased following the implementation of the ban.""

""The reductions in hospital charges are estimated to total $16 million in the first 13 months after the ban was put into place,"" he continued. ""It’s an unintended consequence, but it’s a really good unintended consequence.""

Morrison’s statement caught our attention. Could  Arizona really have seen nearly immediate benefits from its smoking ban?

Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia currently have some type of statewide indoor smoking ban in place. Some bans are confined only to workplaces. Many include restaurants and bars. Hundreds of municipalities have also enacted bans, including New York City, which attracted widespread attention after prohibiting smoking in public parks and other outdoor places last year.

Arizona’s statewide ban on smoking does not go as far as New York City’s ban or Morrison’s proposal for Rhode Island. The Smoke-Free Arizona Act prohibits smoking in workplaces, as well as restaurants, bars and other enclosed public places, but does not apply to parks or other outdoor spaces. The ban took effect May 1, 2007, after winning passage in a referendum the previous November.

When we asked Morrison about the health effects of that ban, he sent us two references to a study in Arizona that was published in the American Journal of Public Health. Both references -- one from a science website and the other from a Rhode Island study on the Ocean State’s 2005 smoking ban -- only summarized the results, so we contacted the Journal, which sent us the full article.

In the peer-reviewed study that was published in March 2011, Patricia M. Herman and Michele E. Walsh, researchers at the University of Arizona’s department of psychology, examined hospital admissions before and after Arizona banned indoor smoking.

They compared data from the state’s 87 hospitals from January 2004 to April 2007 -- up until the ban went into effect -- to the 13-month period afterward, from May 1, 2007, to May 31, 2008. Herman and Walsh looked at admissions for acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), angina, stroke and asthma -- all diagnoses connected to smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. They only considered patients that were Arizona residents.

Herman and Walsh found that admissions for all four diagnoses dropped, in some cases significantly, in the period after the ban took effect. Cases of acute myocardial infarction decreased by 13 percent, angina by 33 percent, stroke by 14 percent and asthma by 22 percent. The estimated savings in hospital costs from those reductions were $16.8 million.

The study attempted to account for reductions in these rates that could have been caused by other factors by separating the hospitals into two groups -- those in areas where county-level or municipal smoking bans were already in effect and those in places that had never had bans. If the decreases were larger in places that hadn’t had bans, then they were attributed to the statewide ban.

The authors concluded that the results of their study, combined with other research on smoking bans that had similar findings, showed ""there is now little room to doubt their effectiveness.""

Herman and Walsh noted that there have been many studies that found a causal relationship between smoking bans and reductions in hospital visits for respiratory and heart conditions. But independent reviews concluded that some of those studies were not optimal. And critics have said that the results of those and other studies were overblown, countering that heart attack rates have been dropping anyway because of improved treatment.

Although there is still some debate about the effectiveness of smoking bans, we couldn’t find any challenges to the results of the Arizona study.

Our ruling

To prove the effectiveness of broad smoking bans in improving public health, Representative Morrison pointed to Arizona’s experience.

His statement about the nearly immediate benefits of that state’s ban was based on a reputable scientific study, which he characterized accurately.

But he mischaracterized Arizona’s ban as applying to all public spaces, when it actually applies only to all public indoor spaces -- a big difference.

Because of that inaccuracy, we rate Morrison’s claim Half True.

Ohio Dem chair Chris Redfern says Mitt Romney plans to raise retirement age for Social Security
","
Ohio Democrats have a two-tier approach when discussing the looming Super Tuesday Republican presidential primary. They delight in the roller coaster nature of the Republican nominating race, and would really like to see Rick Santorum win because they think he would be an easier opponent against President Barack Obama in the fall

But they think that Mitt Romney is more likely to wind up as the eventual nominee, and they see Romney as tougher in the November election. So even while Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, has been riding high in the polls, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern has been sending email targeting Romney.

Urging Democrats to share his messages on Facebook and Twitter, Redfern uses this headline: ""Stuff Mitt Romney Supports.""

One of those things that Romney supports, Redfern said in an email to Ohio Democrats on Feb. 15, is raising the eligibility age for collecting Social Security. Redfern cited a Romney quote from Feb. 10, when the former Massachusetts governor addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Washington:

""We are going to slowly and gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security""

Did Romney really say he would raise the retirement age? PolitiFact Ohio took a look.

On the retirement age, Redfern is mostly accurate. Romney has said a number of times, in speeches and position papers, that he would deal with eventual Social Security viability issues by slowly and gradually raising the age at which a senior could collect the retirement benefit. He also has said he would not support increasing taxes as part of the solution. And he has said that high-income retirees might not see the same growth in their benefits as other retirees would.

But he has said as clearly as can be that current seniors would not be affected.

We watched a video replay of Romney’s CPAC speech and read the full transcript. We read his campaign’s economic plan. We exchanged email with a campaign spokesman to see if there was more.

Here is an example of how Romney has described his intentions, from his ""Plan to Turn Around the Federal Government,"" issued on Nov. 4:

""Social Security: No one at or near the retirement age will see any changes and tax hikes cannot be on the table. Instead, Social Security can be placed on a sustainable trajectory with commonsense reforms: 
And here is what Romney told CPAC: ""Under my plan, no one near retirement age or currently retired will see any of the changes I’m going to describe. But people in their 20s and 30s and 40s and early 50s are going to see some changes.

""And by the way, tax hikes are off the table.

""We’re going to slowly and gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security and we’ll slow the growth rate in benefits for higher-income retirees.""

Everything we have reviewed shows that Romney would, as Redfern says, raise the Social Security retirement age.

Knowing, though, that present day seniors would be unaffected is important, though. Elsewhere in his note, Redfern quips: ""Here’s just five (words) that almost every Ohio senior knows: ‘Hands off my Social Security.’ So, good luck with that, Governor.""

Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman said in an email, ""It was already implied by the words ‘slowly and gradually’ of the quoted statement that Governor Romney was referring to raising the retirement age for future retirees, and we did not mean to suggest otherwise. The point here is that Social Security is a critical issue to Ohio’s seniors – both present and future – and tinkering with Social Security benefits is a threat to their economic security.""

Bringman added, ""We raise this point because Social Security is a compact between the federal government and Americans that if they work hard, pay their taxes and play by the rules, they’ll have something to fall back on when they retire. We have to honor that compact and stop the threats to the program that so many rely on today and so many others will rely on in the future.""

Bringman’s explanation goes beyond even his boss’s words, let alone Romney’s words. Romney talked of protecting current seniors’ benefits. Yet Redfern invoked a spell known to  every political pro: Scare the seniors and you lose their votes. It’s why Social Security is called the third rail of American politics.

Redfern’s claim about Romney is accurate. Romney has said repeatedly that he would gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security. But that Romney specifically has excluded people already retired and those near retirement age is additional information that helps clarify the statement.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Redfern’s claim rates Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/22/chris-redfern/ohio-dem-chair-chris-redfern-says-mitt-romney-plan/

Texas Democratic Party says Ted Cruz opposes DREAM Act and 85% of Latinos support it
","
In a Feb. 3, 2012, press release, a Texas Democratic Party spokeswoman charged Republicans with using the Latino community ""as a wedge to gain support from the extreme wing of their party."" 
Among the examples of what the release sarcastically calls ""GOP Latino-outreach efforts"" is this statement: ""Ted Cruz forcefully opposes the DREAM Act, which is supported by 85% of Latinos."" 
The DREAM Act — which stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors — would provide illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children a path to permanent residency if they attend college or serve in the military. 
The Democratic Party’s statement led us to a two-part fact-check. 
Let’s start with how Cruz, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, stands on the cited act. 
We didn’t have to look far. In a transcribed interview with blogger Sonja Harris of Conservatives in Action that Cruz has on his campaign website, the candidate says: ""I do not support the DREAM Act and categorically oppose amnesty. I categorically oppose amnesty, and I strongly support legal immigration for those that have followed the rules and come here to pursue the American dream."" 
In December 2010, the U.S. House, which then had a Democratic majority, approved a version of the act. The proposal did not make it through the Senate. Critics of the plan, including many Republicans, say it amounts to amnesty for some illegal immigrants. 
So, Cruz opposes the act. But is it supported by 85 percent of Latinos? 
Fortunately for us, PolitiFact Florida recently looked into a similar claim in an ad from the left-leaning political group Presente Action. 
Concentrating on polls, our colleagues found many national ones that looked at general public opinion on issues such as the DREAM Act, and those polls included Latino respondents. But polls on the opinions of Latinos as a group must have enough Latino respondents to be statistically valid, and most general polls do not meet this standard. 
However, PolitiFact found two major polling groups that focus on Latinos: Latino Decisions and the Pew Hispanic Center. 
In its 2011 National Survey of Latinos, the Pew Hispanic Center found that 91 percent favored the DREAM Act when asked this question: ""Thinking about immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children … would you favor or oppose a law that would let these young adults become legal residents if they go to college or serve in the military for two years?"" 
The most recent national poll from Latino Decisions, conducted in January 2012 with Univision News and ABC News, asked: ""Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?"" It found that 66 percent strongly supported the law and an additional 19 percent somewhat supported the law, for a total of 85 percent. 
In each poll, the margin of error was about 4 percentage points. 
When we asked the Texas Democratic Party for backup information, spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña also pointed us to a February 2011 national poll by Latino Decisions, with impreMedia, publisher of Spanish-language newspapers in Texas, California, New York and other states. Respondents were asked about the DREAM Act in a section of the survey that began: ""In December 2010, Congress considered a number of different policies.

Mike Martinez says he banned texting while driving in Austin
","
Mike Martinez, an Austin City Council member seeking re-election in May, recently pointed supporters to his campaign website, which includes an issues page touching on ways he says he’s delivered for the Austin community.

On the page, which we viewed Feb. 10, 2012, Martinez says he helped lead efforts to protect an East Austin spring, helped the city establish a ""no-kill"" policy at municipal animal shelters and helped launch a community gardens program.

We’re not checking any of that for this article. But we paused at another Martinez point: ""Banned texting while driving to improve safety for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians.""

Martinez banned TWD in ATX?

Austin’s texting-while-driving ban, which took effect Jan. 1, 2010, has yielded about $31,800 in fine revenue for the city’s general fund, according to Rebecca Stark, the city’s municipal court director. She told us that 93 drivers in 2010 and 158 drivers in 2011 pleaded no contest or guilty or were found guilty of violating the ban. In 2010, 121 cases of ban violations were filed, she said. That figure nearly doubled to 222 in 2011.

In a telephone interview, Martinez, a former firefighter who won his first council term in 2006, told us that as a member of the city’s public safety task force, he brought up the idea of banning texting while driving, initially to derision. He said he asked the Austin Police Department to research texting as a local traffic hazard and after years of community conversations, the seven-member City Council approved the ordinance.

Martinez told us that he did not ban texting by his lonesome: ""Anything we do has to be ratified by the council. I did take a certain ownership and pride in this issue. I was the only council member to originally call for a ban on texting.""

According to Austin American-Statesman news articles, the ordinance barring texting while driving won unanimous council approval in October 2009. Violations are Class C misdemeanors subject to fines of up to $500.

Some Statesman stories describe Martinez as the council’s lead proponent of the ban.

In November 2008, the public safety task force voted to urge City Manager Marc Ott to develop a ban proposal. A Nov. 4, 2008, Statesman news article says ""Martinez, who is leading the effort, said he has received dozens of calls in recent months from motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists asking for such a law. ""It is something that needs to be done,"" the story quotes Martinez saying. ""When you see accidents that have happened or you hear about near-misses, it is just a step we can take to ensure the safety of our citizens.""""

In August 2009, the council directed city staffers to draft the proposed ban as an ordinance. An Aug. 28, 2009, Statesman news article refers to Martinez as the lead proponent of the ban.

According to minutes of the Oct. 22, 2009, council meeting during which members adopted the ban, Martinez made the ""main motion"" for its approval. The motion was seconded by Mayor Lee Leffingwell.

Upshot: Martinez’s claim overshoots because, of course, he could not have imposed the ban by himself. The seven-person council acts on proposed ordinances. 
Still, Martinez was a leading advocate of the ban. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/21/mike-martinez/mike-martinez-says-he-banned-texting-while-driving/

Was Super PAC right on Romney claim?
","
Georgia voters, brace yourselves for some rounds of political ad warfare.

With two weeks before the Republican presidential primary in Georgia, part of Super Tuesday, surrogates for former Georgia congressman and House Speaker Newt Gingrich are battling supporters of GOP rival Mitt Romney via the 30-second ad.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported last week that Gingrich supporters are paying for radio time to direct listeners to a website, Time to Choose, that lays out the facts about their candidate and the truth about Romney.

There, we found several ads produced by a pro-Gingrich super political action committee, Winning Our Future. The ads attack Romney and make claims such as this: ""Romney supervised a company guilty of massive Medicare fraud. That’s a fact!""

Really?

Not so, said Flackcheck.org, a website run by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.  

Flackcheck.orgcq played that portion of the ad and flashed the word ""MISLEADING"" over the video.

So who’s correct here, and what is this all about?

In 1989, while Romney was head of the investment firm Bain Capital, it bought a medical testing company in Massachusetts called Damon Corp. Bain’s business was buying companies, making them financially sound, and then selling them for a profit.

Bain took the company public in 1991 and Romney served on its board of directors. Damon Corp. was sold in 1993 to Corning Inc., according to news reports and ""The Real Romney,"" a biography written by Boston Globe reporters.

PolitiFact Florida, investigating a similar claim about Romney, reported: 


Romney claimed to have uncovered the fraud, but the Globe reported that prosecutors gave the bulk of the credit to exposing the problem to Corning.

The Globe first reported on Damon Corp. more than a decade ago. The case was recycled last month before the Florida primary when Gingrich and Romney duked it out for the Sunshine State’s prized delegate count.

PolitiFact Florida rated the claim Mostly True that when Romney ""was a director of the Damon Corp., the company was defrauding Medicare of millions."" PolitiFact Florida found it was difficult to assess whether Romney knew about the fraud and what he did to stop it since the implication was that Romney should had known what was going on.

Winning Our Future’s claim is more specific. That ad says Romney ""supervised,"" and was not just a ""director"" of the company. Winning Our Future spokesman Rick Tyler directed us to a recent Forbes article about the issue. Forbes reported much of what was in the Boston Globe, including Romney’s defense and what prosecutors said Corning did to uncover the fraud. Forbes wrote ""it would be reasonable to conclude that while the illegal activity was going on under Mr. Romney’s nose, Romney would, himself, bear only some responsibility for perhaps not being as on top of things as one might hope for a company’s director to be.""

""Every board member has a fiduciary responsibility for the company they serve but Romney’s role was very hands-on at Damon,"" Tyler told us via email. ""He led Bain to acquire the company and he put himself on the board and was a very active member in the company.

""Despite this, the fact remains that Damon was engaged in Medicare and other fraud when Bain purchased the company, was engaged in fraud while Bain owned the company and continued to engage in fraud when Bain sold the company, which was sold the same month the subpoenas were issued.""

The overbilling began before Bain bought Damon and continued for several years. For two years, Damon was under Bain’s ownership before it went public. Afterward, Romney served on its board.

Winning Our Future’s claim that Romney ""supervised"" the Damon Corp. is more specific than the prior claim. It suggests that Romney had a direct role in supervising the company. As PolitiFact Florida found, it is difficult to determine whether Romney was involved in the fraud.

Bain had control of Damon for four years, two of those before it went public. We believe Romney had some authority over the policies at Damon.

But to say he ""supervised"" the company is somewhat of a stretch. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/21/winning-our-future/was-super-pac-right-romney-claim/

George Allen says price of gas tank fill-up has risen $30 during Obama's term
","
U.S. Senate candidate George Allen has been reminding voters of sticker shock at the gas pump.

In a recent interview, Allen took at shot at President Barack Obama’s energy policies and recalled a time when things were better for American motorists.

""We have high gasoline prices which are costing us about $30 more for each fill-up than the cost was when President Obama came into office,"" Allen, a Republican, said in a Feb. 6 audio interview with the conservative Bearing Drift website.

Is that right?

Let’s look at the numbers.

Dan Allen, a senior advisor for the Allen campaign, pointed to weekly fuel price data from the federal Energy Information Administration, which tracks gas prices.

On Jan. 19, 2009, the day before Obama was inaugurated, the national average for a gallon of regular gas was $1.83, according to the EIA data. On Feb. 6, 2012, the day Allen’s interview was posted on Bearing Drift, that cost had risen to $3.44.

So between those two dates, the price of gas per gallon increased by $1.61.

To measure how that translates into higher costs for each fill-up, Dan Allen also sent us links to a Department of Energy website listing the fuel-tank capacity for various vehicles.

A 2012 Ford Explorer, an SUV, has an 18.6 gallon tank, which means the cost of filling up is about $29.95 more than when Obama took office. A Dodge Caravan minivan with a 20-gallon tank costs $32.20 more to fill, and a Buick LaCrosse, a mid-size car with an 18-gallon tank, costs $28.98 more to fill up. In the compact car category, Allen’s campaign noted a 2012 Camaro has a 19-gallon tank. That means the Camaro owner is paying $30.59 more.

Those are all close to Allen’s number.

Of course there are many cars on the road with fuel tanks that hold less than the 18-20 gallon capacities that Allen cites. The gas tank capacity of the Toyota Corolla, which Edmunds.com says is the world’s best selling car of all time, is 13.2 gallons for the 2011 model. That means the owner of that car is paying $21.26 more for each tank of gas than they were when Obama entered the White House. That’s higher than January 2009, but still less than the figure Allen cites.

Allen’s statement also implies that Obama deserves blame for the higher gas costs. We ran that past a couple of analysts to see what they thought.

""(The president) has very little control over gas prices,"" said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at gasbuddy.com. ""It has less to do with the president’s policies and more to do with supply and demand and the fundamentals of the industry.""

DeHaan acknowledged that prices risen considerably since Obama took office. But he was quick to add there should ""be a massive asterisk"" next to that statement. A big reason prices were so low to begin with when Obama became president was because he entered the White House as the U.S. was coming out of an economic downturn, which depresses gas prices, DeHaan said.

Ben Brockwell, the director of data, pricing and information services at the Oil Price Information Service, said it’s ridiculous to pin gas prices on any president, Republican or Democrat, saying fuel costs are a ""market phenomenon.""

Brockwell noted that under former President George W. Bush, the price of gas hit its all-time high of $4.16 on July 16, 2008. And, Brockwell noted, Bush wasn’t to blame for that situation either. ""The fact of the matter is Obama is no more to blame than Bush was in ‘08 when (oil) prices went to $150 a barrel,"" Brockwell said.

Our ruling

Allen said the cost of filling up a tank of gas costs $30 more now than when Obama took office.

The price of a gallon of gas is nearly twice what it was when Obama took office. Allen’s use of the $30 figure is a bit of a broad brush, since that assumes the capacities of 18-20 gallon tanks, and many cars have smaller gas tanks. But we don’t think the $30 extra fill-up costs is an unreasonable figure to use, because it would be the higher cost for many cars on the road.

But that doesn’t mean Obama is to blame for motorists’ pain at the pump. Analysts told us presidents in general have little impact on the gas prices.

The numbers are correct. But Allen is misrepresenting the cause of the increase. Therefore, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/20/george-allen/president-doesnt-control-gas-prices/

Uncle Sam spends six figures to study coked birds copulating, Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Mark Neumann says
","
When the federal government gets ridiculed for doing a study on what seems like a wacky phenomenon, it always sounds like the research was concocted by Leno or Letterman.

Then Uncle Sam goes and funds another study that sounds even crazier.

Spending tax dollars in this way amounts to juicy red meat for budget hawks such as Mark Neumann, one of the Republicans running for a U.S. Senate seat from Wisconsin in 2012.

On Jan. 26, 2012, the former congressman put out a list of 10 federal programs he’d trim or eliminate that he said would save $138 billion.

Near the bottom of the list was … eliminating a federal study!

Neumann claimed he could save $175,587 by ending a study of the ""connection between cocaine and risky sex habits of the Japanese quail.""

We wondered: Which comedian was Neumann citing as his source?

Just kidding.

So is Uncle Sam really spending six figures just to observe coked-up copulating quails? Or is there more to the study?

Asked for backup, Neumann campaign spokesman Chris Lato showed us that in January 2011, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $175,587 grant to a University of Kentucky psychology professor for an ""enhancement of sexual motivaton"" project.

Indeed, the sex habits of Japanese quail on cocaine were to be observed.

So, Neumann is correct on the cost and the basic set-up of the study.

Lato also cited an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news web site. The article pointed out that the project is actually a five-year study and it quoted a university official defending it.

Quail watching

The grant information shows the government launched the project with a $181,406 award in January 2010. It added the $175,587 cited by Neumann in 2011 and another $175,211 in February 2012. The study is slated to continue through January 2015.

The grant document explains why Japanese quail were chosen and how the study relates to humans:

""The goal of the proposed experiments is to utilize an animal model whose sexual behavior system has been well-studied, Japanese quail. In addition to the benefits of using quail to study sexual behavior, the use of a visually-oriented species in studying drug effects may be of additional relevance to studying human drug addiction.

""We currently have preliminary evidence in male Japanese quail that pre-exposure to cocaine enhances sexual motivation. This finding ties in well with clinical observations that indicate that cocaine use in humans may increase sexual motivation, thereby increasing the likelihood of the occurrence of high-risk sexual behavior,"" such as unprotected sex and increased number of sexual partners.

The Daily Caller article provided by Neumann’s campaign noted that James Tracy, the vice president for research at the University of Kentucky, defended the study.

""Why Japanese quail? Cocaine abuse in humans has been shown clinically that it leads to risky sexual behavior, they have more sexual partners, and that leads to more sexually transmitted diseases,"" Tracy told a Kentucky TV station.

""It's important to look what is behind the title (of the study). You are limited to only 64 characters"" in applying for the federal grant, he said.

Also backing the study is chronobiologist Bora Zivkovic, blog editor of Scientific American, which describes itself as the ""leading source and authority for science, technology information and policy for a general audience.""

Zivkovic said in the magazine he spent 10 years studying the Japanese quail and that the bird has been used in laboratory research since at least 1914.

""Studying effects of cocaine on reproductive behavior is so much more efficient in a species in which we do not have to start from scratch – we already know so much about its brain, behavior and reproduction, we can move on to more sophisticated studies than just the first exploratory ‘basic experiments.’ Thus we can make faster progress. This is an efficient approach,"" Zivkovic wrote.

Whether it’s a good use of tax money to do more study on quail and sex and cocaine isn’t a question we’re here to settle.

But the study Neumann cited isn’t intended merely to learn about birds, but about drug abuse and sexual habits of humans that can lead to public health problems.

Our rating

Neumann said he could save $175,587 by eliminating a study of the ""connection between cocaine and risky sex habits of the Japanese quail."" A grant for that amount was awarded for such a study in 2011, another was made in 2012 and more are slated to be made.

But the scope of the study is much larger than what Neumann suggests by citing only the title.

Neumann’s claim was accurate, but needed additional information. We don’t know how Leno or Letterman would rule, but that’s our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/20/mark-neumann/uncle-sam-spends-six-figures-study-coked-birds-cop/
"['New Jersey', 'Marriage', 'Stephen Sweeney']","
Steve Sweeney claims two-thirds of marriages end in divorce
","
Marriage ends in divorce sometimes.

In fact, it happens two-thirds of the time, according to Senate President Stephen Sweeney.

And if same-sex couples are allowed to wed in New Jersey, they would face the same marital woes heterosexual couples do, Sweeney (D-Gloucester) said in a Feb. 10 interview on WNYC’s ""The Brian Lehrer Show.""

A caller asked Sweeney whether he has considered what would happen to the children of a gay or lesbian couple in a divorce. Sweeney said it’d be no different than when a man and a woman divorce.

""You would go through the same process and a court would make a decision. You know, because sometimes courts do rule the father is the better parent than the mother. So, you know, each case is just like any divorce,"" Sweeney said. ""And you know something, divorces will happen, absolutely, just like they happen for heterosexuals and probably, what's it, 67 percent of marriages now wind up in divorce.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found Sweeney’s claim is off. But as Skip Burzumato, assistant director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, put it: ""divorce rates are such slippery statistics,"" which can vary dramatically depending on age, sex, race and education.

Spokesmen for Sweeney did not respond to five e-mails and two phone calls requesting comment. Burzumato, who called the 67 percent figure an ""odd number,"" said if Sweeney’s statistic was true for all marriages, ""I think we would feel that and we would all know that. We would not see as many married people as we do.""

One measure of divorce rates is the number of divorces in a given year per 1,000 people. The United States had a divorce rate of 3.4 by that measure in 2009, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, an arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Another approach cited more often is to estimate the likelihood a marriage will end in divorce.

Generally, experts we spoke with and studies we consulted agreed that the likelihood of marriages ending in divorce fell somewhere between 40 percent and 50 percent.

""Estimates of divorce are around 45%. When you throw in a few percent of couples who separate but never get around to divorcing, the figure of 50% is close,"" Paul Amato, a professor of family sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University, wrote in an e-mail. ""The probability of divorce is unlikely to rise further. In anything, it appears to be going down slightly.""

""I think there is some truth to the fact that half of marriages end in divorce,"" Casey Copen, an associate service fellow with the National Survey of Family Growth, said. But, she said, ""it’s just so dependent on the population you’re looking at.""

For example, studies show couples with higher levels of education are less likely to divorce.

Burzumato put the likelihood of marriages now ending in divorce slightly lower, between 35 percent  and 45 percent, but said ""it might be in the 50s, it’s hard to tell.""  

""What we have found is that divorce rates are coming down,"" he said. ""Cohabitation is on the rise. So those who do select marriage tend to be more committed.""

The U.S. Census Bureau reported similar findings.

""As marriage rates have decreased and cohabitation has become more common, marriage has become more selective of adults who are better off socioeconomically and have more education, and divorce rates have leveled,"" a May 2011 report said.

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Sweeney said that 67 percent of marriages end in divorce.

We found no data to support Sweeney’s claim and his office did not return multiple requests for clarification.

The chance of a marriage ending in divorce varies depending on a number of factors, including education and race. But overall, experts told us and reports show the overall probability of marriages now ending in divorce falls between 40 percent and 50 percent.

We rate the statement False.

"['Georgia', 'Ethics', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich says he was ""exonerated"" in ethics probe
","Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich faced some of his harshest attacks on ethics violations during the Florida GOP primary last month.

On Feb. 10, Gingrich appeared on Neal Boortz’s radio talk show on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB to make his case.

With the Georgia primary just weeks away, Boortz told Gingrich that he should have fought harder in Florida against the attacks.

""Well, look,"" Gingrich replied. ""The Wall Street Journal said the ads were false and that in fact I was exonerated in every single case. National Review said the ads were false, I was exonerated in every single case.""

""Exonerated in every single case?"" This was a surprise to us.

A U.S. House of Representatives committee looked into whether Gingrich broke ethics rules in the 1990s. All but one of the charges were dropped, and he was reprimanded by the House in 1997.

In what amounted to a plea deal, Gingrich agreed to pay $300,000 and admit he had ""engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives.""  

So how could Gingrich have been exonerated? He even admitted to poor conduct.

We contacted the Gingrich campaign but received no response. We therefore switched gears and took a closer look at the National Review and The Wall Street Journal, the two publications he cited.

But first, here’s a review of the ethics controversy, as provided by PolitiFact National:

The case primarily involved a course at Kennesaw State College (now Kennesaw State University) that Gingrich taught while in Congress. Its organizers solicited financial support from ""individuals, corporations and foundations,"" promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status.

But the ethics committee concluded that the course aimed to ""help in achieving a partisan, political goal"" -- something that would run afoul of its tax-exempt status.

A further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which ""the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis."" Gingrich ""should have known"" that the information in the letters ""was inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable.""

The Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation, Gingrich-related groups backed with tax-deductible donations, helped fund the course.

Obviously, Gingrich wasn’t exonerated by the House of Representatives. The ethics committee, which has an even number of Republicans and Democrats, voted 7 to 1 to pass a report that recommended a reprimand and $300,000 penalty.

The full House passed the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans supporting it.

Now on to the articles Gingrich cited. Neither publication said he was cleared on all ethics counts. However, an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal said that a formal IRS investigation in 1999 ""exonerated Mr. Gingrich."" We found a similar claim in the National Review.

News accounts tell a different story.

The House ethics committee left it to the IRS to determine whether there were violations of tax laws. It cleared the Progress and Freedom Foundation of accusations that it violated its tax-exempt status in 1999.

The IRS described its decision as a ""close case,"" according to news accounts. It accused the ethics committee of failing to turn over crucial transcripts.

""It is possible that if the ethics committee had rendered full cooperation with our examination, the transcripts might have affected our conclusion,"" the decision said.  

News accounts from the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times said that the IRS did not directly exonerate Gingrich.

The IRS did find the Lincoln foundation was involved in partisan efforts to train Republican political activists. It lost its tax-exempt status in December 1998, and the decision was upheld in federal court, according to an article in Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call.

But the IRS restored its tax-exempt status in 2003 through a little-known review process, according to Roll Call.

Critics said the move opened the IRS to accusations that it was swayed by political influence, and the process was soon abolished, according to Roll Call. The IRS did not say at the time whether the Lincoln foundation controversy was a factor.

An IRS letter restoring the Lincoln foundation’s tax-exempt status does not say whether the group was cleared of engaging in partisan activity.

No, Gingrich was not ""exonerated in every single case,"" as he said during the Boortz show. There is no doubt that the full House of Representatives voted to formally reprimand him for his conduct, and he was required to pay a $300,000 penalty.  

Furthermore, the IRS’ treatment of the Progress and Freedom Foundation and the Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation don’t clear him, either. One was cleared -- with a caveat the IRS was unable to obtain important evidence.

Even if both groups were cleared, that would not blot out or negate the House of Representatives’ historic decision to reprimand him. Trying to claim that it does is ridiculous.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Myra Crownover']","
Myra Crownover says the 2011 Legislature increased state spending on education
","
In a letter to constituents, state Rep. Myra Crownover strikes a familiar Republican chord by suggesting the 2011 Legislature dealt with tough times without shorting Texas public schools.

Crownover’s message, which a reader pointed out to us on her campaign website in January 2012, says: ""Most importantly, we balanced the state's budget with the first overall decrease in state spending in 50 years. We also were able to increase state spending on Education by $1.6 Billion even in the face of the worst recession in decades.""

We wondered if Crownover, R-Denton, was right about state education aid going up while the Republican-majority Legislature balanced the 2012-13 budget without a tax increase. That’s proved a common refrain from some Republicans including Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who presides over the Senate.
   
Crownover’s chief of staff, Kevin Cruser, provided a statement from Crownover pointing out that lawmakers last year wrote the budget after learning the state would reap $27 billion less in tax revenue over the two years than it would need to maintain  ""current services"" spending, which takes into account the impact of growing demands in major funding areas including education, health and human services and employee benefits, according to the December 2011 ""Fiscal Size-up"" report by the nonpartisan Legislative Budget Board.

Crownover’s statement further says schools were asked to tighten their belts and that federal funding available for the education part of the budget decreased significantly.

""The Legislature did the best it could to lessen the impact of the recession and the decreased federal funding for public schools,"" her statement says, which the note says lawmakers could not cover. ""In House Bill 1 (the budget act), General Revenue appropriations to the Foundation School Program increased by $1.6 billion over the previous biennium. General Revenue,"" Crownover notes, ""is the term for state revenue that the Legislature has direct control over, and the Foundation School Program represents the most direct source of state revenue to our public schools.""

By law, the foundation program’s purpose is to guarantee that each school district has adequate resources to provide each student a basic instructional program and facilities. Also, each district is guaranteed access to substantially equalized financing for additional needs.

Crownover’s statement also says the Legislature could not fund costs associated with rapid projected growth in the student population. After mentioning the $1.6 billion increase a second time, her statement says legislators did their best to prioritize schoolchildren.

Clear sailing, then? Not for long.

News accounts of legislative deliberations and budget board figures clarify that Crownover’s slightly-off recap of additional state revenue to the foundation program -- the bump proved to be $1.5 billion -- overlooks other spending decisions adding up to more than $5 billion in state-driven education budget reductions. In a way, this claim is a reminder that touting only one part of a budget can be deceptive.

Let’s cover what legislators did and said, starting with news reports.

Lawmakers tied up loose ends in the 2012-13 budget in a June 2011 special session. Key to Crownover’s claim: Members voted largely along party lines to approve a $2 billion a year reduction in state aid to schools based on existing funding formulas. According to a June 19, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article, such aid, triggered by expected changes in enrollment, demographics and local property values, had formed the baseline for state education funding for 60 years.

In the June session, the Republican heads of respective House and Senate education panels each acknowledged the June action as a reduction to districts though also saying the cuts could have been worse. As the Senate acted, according to a June 4, 2011, news article in the San Antonio Express-News, Sen. Florence Shapiro of Plano said: ""Nobody wants cuts. But we have to have them."" And as the House followed suit, a June 11, 2011, news article in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram quoted Rep. Rob Eissler of The Woodlands saying the overall net decrease to districts would average 4 to 5 percent, which he called ""not that big a cut.""

Legislative Budget Board analyses of the budget reveal other ways that lawmakers reduced education aid.

Board staffers summarized the yet-to-be finalized budget in May 2011 by saying the foundation program’s total funding, counting federal aid, would be reduced by $1.8 billion, a figure later adjusted to $1.9 billion based on actions in the June special session, according to the 2011 ""Fiscal Size-up"" report.

This occurred, in part, due to federal aid to the foundation program dropping $2.8 billion, according to the May 2011 budget summary. In contrast, lawmakers in 2009 had the luxury of applying $3.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid to the public education part of the state budget, helping to cover a projected shortfall in state revenue. Congress did not send fresh stimulus money to the states in 2011.

Summing up foundation program funding challenges, the 2011 ""Fiscal Size-up"" report says the 2011 Legislature was faced both with making up for the loss of the federal stimulus dollars that went to education in the previous budget plus $2.2 billion in costs to school districts to accommodate annual enrollment growth of 78,000 students through the 2012-13 school year. In addition, the report says, legislators had to address an estimated $2.3 billion needed to balance out past under-payments to districts for various reasons.

And how did lawmakers confront those demands? They put $1.5 billion more in state revenue into the foundation program, as Crownover notes. Otherwise, the report shows, the Legislature did not cover costs of the projected enrollment increases and postponed a regular distribution of state aid to schools for 2012-13 into fiscal 2014, likely meaning the budget to be written by the 2013 Legislature.

In addition, the May board summary shows that schools took another hit due to $1.4 billion in legislated reductions in funding for programs outside the foundation program. That 53 percent reduction, the summary says, diminished teacher incentive pay and dropout prevention funding and zeroed out grants to the pre-Kindergarten Early Start program.  In a telephone interview, board staff spokesman John Barton told us lawmakers trimmed the reduction to $1.3 billion in their June special session.

Our ruling

Crownover’s statement focuses on one stream of public school funding. But other legislative decisions resulted in funding reductions to Texas schools more than twice as great as her touted increase. Overall funding to the foundation program went down.

So, lawmakers ultimately cut public school aid, with key leaders even acknowledging so as those decisions were sealed. To tell constituents otherwise is not only inaccurate, it’s misleading and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/feb/20/myra-crownover/myra-crownover-says-2011-legislature-increased-sta/

State Rep. Kathleen Clyde says new election law doesn't solve 'wrong precinct' problem
","
Provisional ballots are used in general elections when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at a polling station. Poll workers allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until the problem is sorted out, and if the person is an eligible voter, then the ballot is counted.

PolitiFact Ohio recently checked -- and rated as True -- the claim that Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and that many of those ballots go uncounted.

State Rep. Kathleen Clyde of Kent raised the issue in discussion about House Bill 194, the controversial overhaul of Ohio election laws that was passed last spring but will go on the ballot in November as a referendum issue.

Clyde pointed to numbers in the Election Day Survey Report of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission showing that the biggest reason for provisional balloting in Ohio is change of address.

But, she added, the problem of provisional ballots and uncounted votes is worsened by Ohio's ""wrong precinct"" rules.

""Wrong precinct rules exacerbate our provisional ballot problems,"" she said in an email. ""HB 194 does nothing to solve the wrong-precinct problem.""

Rather, she said, the law makes it worse by eliminating the requirement that poll workers must direct a voter to their correct precinct.""

PolitiFact Ohio can't fact-check the future, so we won't rate the question of whether HB 194 will worsen provisional ballot problems.

But we can look at the rules and at HB 194.

Voting in the wrong precinct is the biggest reason, after change of address, for provisional ballots. Provisional ballots can be cast in the wrong precinct because poll workers accidentally send voters to the wrong table in a polling place with multiple precincts, or to the wrong polling place, which can follow an error such as a poll worker misreading a street guide.

Reports from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission show that relatively few states reject significant numbers of provisional ballots because they were cast in the wrong precinct. Only New York and Arizona rejected more wrong precinct ballots than Ohio in 2008, according to the EAC, and those three states accounted for the majority of the nation's total.

In 2010, no state left more provisional ballots uncounted than Ohio.

Rejected wrong-precinct ballots represent registered voters whose ballots were thrown out because they went to the wrong table or location. Ohio had 14,227 of them in 2008, according to the EAC report. The number is slightly larger, 14,335, on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted.

House Bill 3, the Ohio elections law enacted in 2006, expanded provisional voting and restricted the counting of provisional ballots. It required that a provisional ballot be cast in the correct jurisdiction to count, and specifically defined jurisdiction as precinct. Election boards previously could count the races for a voter's correct precinct on a misdirected ballot.

HB 194 ""permits, instead of requires, an election official to direct a voter who is in the wrong precinct to the voter's correct precinct,"" according to the Ohio Legislative Service Commission. It says that it is the duty of the individual voter to ensure that a ballot is cast in the correct precinct.

We note that we’re not taking a position on whether it’s good policy to leave that duty with the individual voter. Suffice to say that Clyde’s position is that more should be done.

The issue went to federal court recently because of a race for juvenile court judge in Hamilton County that has been unresolved since Election Night 2010 because of provisional  ballots. The two candidates in that race were separated by 23 votes in the election board's tally, but 849 provisional ballots were not counted due to error. Hundreds of those votes should be counted, U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott ruled this month in a 93-page decision.

In some cases, Dlott noted, voters showed up at the right polling place, but mistakenly voted at the wrong precinct table, an error known as ""right church, wrong pew.""

Testimony showed that poll workers mistakenly directed some voters to the wrong table, and that some poll workers did not recognize the significance of voting at the correct precinct table.

Currently under Ohio's precinct-based voting, Dlott wrote, votes cast in the wrong precinct are not to be ""counted under any circumstance, even when the ballot is miscast due to poll worker error."" She said that policy ""is fundamentally unfair and abrogates the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of due process of law.""

The ruling reinforces Clyde’s assertion that wrong-precinct rules worsen the problems with provisional voting.

Clyde said that ""wrong precinct rules exacerbate our provisional ballot problems,"" a reference to the high rate of provisional voting in the state. Data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission shows that wrong precinct voting is the No. 2 reason for provisional voting. In Ohio, votes cast in the wrong precinct are not counted. There were more than 14,000 such ballots in the 2008 election.

We’re not rating whether HB 194 will worsen those problems. But that the legislation  ""permits, instead of requires, an election official to direct a voter who is in the wrong precinct to the voter's correct precinct,"" shows it’s not an attempt to aggressively address the issue.

The duty remains on the individual voter to ensure that a ballot is cast in the correct precinct.

"['Rhode Island', 'State Budget', 'Transportation', 'John G. Edwards']","
State Rep. John Edwards, quoting Rhode Island DOT, says 40 percent of Sakonnet Bridge traffic is from outside the state
","
State Rep. John ""Jay"" Edwards was a guest on WHJJ's Helen Glover show when the issue came up of requiring motorists to pay a toll to cross the Sakonnet River Bridge, which connects Portsmouth and Tiverton and is a main thoroughfare to and from Aquidneck Island. Edwards represents both towns.

""It's just another tax on the people who live in East Bay,"" he said. ""I'm sure there is going to be a split fare between the people who have a Rhode Island E-ZPass and those who do not. They're saying that 40 percent of the traffic that goes over that is [from] out of state.""

Glover expressed skepticism over that percentage. ""I think that's mostly locals commuting for jobs,"" she said.

It sounded like the perfect thing to track down.

We called Edwards to find out precisely who ""they"" are. He told us he got the information from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and said he had his own doubts about the factoid. ""I think they may be using it to make it sound more palatable,"" he said.

When we contacted the DOT, spokesman Bryan Lucier, wrote us to say ""The Director [Michael Lewis] has stated publicly that approximately 40 percent of the traffic is from out of state.""

Lucier said the percentage comes from a DOT study that tracked license plate numbers. He told us that 38.2 percent of the cars and trucks traveling southbound -- from Tiverton to Portsmouth -- had out-of-state plates and 31.4 percent going northbound.

Average daily out-of-state volume was 35.1 percent, not 40.

The traffic count was done on just two days in the middle of winter -- Jan. 26, a Thursday, and Jan. 28, a Saturday. And it was conducted only from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The afternoon rush hour was not included.

Among the out-of-state vehicles, 90 percent had Massachusetts license plates, 2 percent were from Connecticut, and 1 percent were from New Hampshire, New York and New Jersey.

The bridge currently has an 18-ton weight limit, which requires a lot of trucks to detour around it. Lucier said the expectation is that when the bridge is replaced, truck traffic will increase and that will increase the percentage of out-of-state vehicles using it.

Our ruling

Rep. John Edwards said, ""They're saying that 40 percent of the traffic that goes over [the Sakonnet River Bridge is from] out of state.""

The DOT says Edwards is correctly quoting Michael Lewis, who has been saying ""approximately 40 percent"" and whose source is a two-day traffic study commissioned by the DOT that concludes that the actual percentage is 35.

Clearly, when he was talking to Glover, Edwards was saying that the data wasn't his and he told us, after the fact, that he had doubts about its accuracy. It turns out, he may have reason for skepticism.

We rate the statement made by Lewis and repeated by Edwards Mostly True.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Kathleen Falk']","
Recall candidate Kathleen Falk says Governor Scott Walker enacted ""the biggest cuts to education in our state's history""
","
Democrats searching for the right combination of punches to drive Scott Walker from office have focused on joblessness, schools, tax fairness and leadership style.

One of the jabs they throw repeatedly centers on cuts Walker’s 2011-’13 budget made in state aid to local school districts.

Kathleen Falk, the best-known Democrat so far in the likely 2012 gubernatorial recall election, tried to land a roundhouse right as she became the first announced candidate.

The former Dane County executive told a Feb. 8, 2012 audience in La Crosse that Walker has ""divided us instead of united us.""

""He's done it with the wrong choices,"" Falk said, according to a WXOW-TV online story. ""He gave big tax breaks for a few and then made the biggest cuts to education in our state's history.""

The state’s history covers a long time.

Are Walker’s cuts truly the largest ever?

We have already looked at several statements about Walker’s education budget.

We gave state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, a Mostly False for saying Walker’s property tax freeze would cost schools $1.6 billion in revenue. It was about half that, according to the most common accounting.

We labeled Mostly False a claim from Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller that Wisconsin ""enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation."" At the time, the study he cited looked at only 24 states, not all 50.

Now we have Falk’s claim.

It is bold, but it actually is narrowly drawn, referring specifically to cuts in state aid -- a number easy to track and measure.

Asked for backup, Falk’s campaign said she was referring not just to state aid to local schools, but cuts in state funding to the university system and technical colleges. And she meant the biggest cut ever in raw dollars, according to campaign spokesman Scot Ross.

To be sure, Walker made two other moves that affected school budgets: A virtual freeze on schools’ ability to increase property taxes to make up for lost aid, and collective bargaining limits that allowed many districts to cut costs by imposing larger contributions from workers towards health insurance and pensions.

But Falk’s statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation.

Falk’s campaign did not provide a total of the education cuts, nor provide any history of funding cuts other than to say they had found none bigger.

We did the math and found $792 million in aid cuts to school districts, $250 million in reduced aid to the university system and $71.6 million from the tech colleges.

Total: $1.11 billion.

Looking at it in terms of raw dollars limits the usefulness of any comparison, given inflation. That said, let’s look back.

Local schools

Walker’s budget was not the first to cut education aid, though any cut is rare.

Facing a massive projected shortfall, lawmakers and then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, approved cutting $284 million from aid to school districts in the 2009-11 budget.

The cut under Doyle was the first ever, according to Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group that tracks the history of aid changes.

We couldn’t confirm that, but went back to the mid 1980s and found no evidence of a cut. If there was one earlier than that, it couldn’t rival Walker’s -- unless a previous governor cut 100 percent of the school aid budget, which was much smaller then.

Walker’s $792 million cut was much larger in raw dollars than the $284 million cut in 2009, and as a percentage -- 7.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent.

In the first year under Walker’s budget, nearly all districts lost aid, and the median decrease was 9.9 percent, according to the state Department of Public Instruction.

University system

Doyle and Walker cut identical amounts -- $250 million -- from the base budget of the UW system. The cut under Doyle was in 2003-05.

The cut under Doyle was a bigger percentage cut than Walker’s because the university system’s biennial budget from state taxes grew from about $2 billion to $2.3 billion between 2003 to 2011.

On the other hand, Walker’s cut was deeper if you factor all the budget adjustments to the state-tax-supported portion of UW’s budget, according to Dave Loppnow, an education funding expert at the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

For instance, UW got more state funding for things like rising fuel and utility costs, offsetting some of the $250 million funding cut. By this measure, it was about an 8 percent reduction by Doyle, and 9 percent under Walker.

Loppnow said the $250 million base-budget cuts under both governors were the largest ever in raw dollars.

Tech schools

Walker proposed, and the Republican-controlled Legislature passed, a 30 percent cut in general aid to the state’s technical college system. That amounted to $71.6 million over two years.

The tech college system found records dating to 1991 that showed only one other general aid cut  -- a 0.5 percent trim in 2007.

As we noted in a recent item, that general aid is only 12 percent of the tech system’s funding, which relies heavily on property taxes.

So, in the big picture, there have been very few instances of cuts to education, with all of them coming in recent years as deficits mounted.

What makes the Walker cuts stand out is the combination -- in the same budget -- of reductions across the three levels of education: kindergarten-12th grade; tech colleges; and the universities.

In 2003-05, when the UW took a hit, Doyle and lawmakers boosted the K-12 budget by 1 percent, or $115 million. And the tech colleges’ general state aid was not reduced.

As we noted, there were many other changes in the budget.

Notably, Walker sharply curtailed collective bargaining rights for public employees, including university and local school employees.

That allowed local school districts to save at least $200 million in pension costs because most districts put in place a pension change made possible by the budget, according to Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates, school officials and our calculations.

The savings to districts from changes to health insurance premiums were significant in some cases, but vary widely by district; no statewide cost savings estimate is available.

But some districts, due to existing union contracts and other reasons, were not able to benefit from the health insurance changes. That underlines an element essential aspect of Falk’s statement: The state controls its aid, but not what is done at the local level.

Our conclusion

Falk claimed Walker’s cuts in state support to local schools, tech colleges and public universities amount to the largest in state history.

We found previous cuts in those areas, but not in all three in the same year, and not nearly as deep when you roll them all together as has Falk.

Suburban advocates say Shelby County 'gave' Memphis 44 schools in annexations
","
During a Shelby County Commission discussion over the possibility of transferring school facilities to suburban municipalities, Chris Thomas made a point that has become almost a suburban mantra.

In that meeting and another held on Feb. 10, Thomas and suburban colleagues Wyatt Bunker and Terry Roland hammered home the contention that Shelby County always ""gave"" school facilities to Memphis, free of charge, when the city took areas through annexations. Following that precedent, they argue, the county should give buildings to suburban cities wanting to split from the controversial new  unified school district and form municipal districts.

Memphis City Councilman Shea Flinn, during the Feb. 10 deliberations, vented his frustrations on his Twitter feed: ""Dear comm Bunker that 44 school system (sic) given to Memphis is False. It was done by agreement an (sic) other consideration was given. Damn.""  And: ""My head might explode with the number of times that bull (expletive) is going to come up.""

So who is right here, on an issue of utmost importance as Shelby County’s system of public schools goes through an historic transition? At least since 1965, have annexations resulted in Shelby County just giving school buildings to Memphis’s special school district, Memphis City Schools?

We found a complicated set of legal and historical circumstances, and, as with other issues associated with the impending transfer of Memphis’s public schools to the county, stances that have reversed over time, depending on residency. Memphis stakeholders who once argued buildings must be given over without consideration now want the suburbs to pay up, while suburban interests who once argued a city should compensate the county now say the county should give buildings to suburban towns free and clear.

Thomas and other advocates for the suburban municipalities cite feasibility studies from suburban school consultants Southern Educational Strategies. The studies say: ""Since the 1960’s, at least 44 of these facilities, plus the furniture, fixtures, and equipment held in trust for the students were transferred by Shelby County Schools to the special school district at no direct cost to the Memphis City Schools.""

One figure in the study shows that for each year since 1965 exactly $0.00 flowed to Shelby County in exchange for the schools.

Thomas’s statement is worth quoting in full, because it captures the prevailing suburban view:  ""I think it’s funny over the past many years that Shelby County donated – I’m sorry, gave – 44 schools to the city of Memphis . . .  when they annexed areas. And now all of a sudden when a municipality, when a city in the county wants to educate those children, we are going to say we are going to charge you but we were giving them to Memphis? Personally I think that stinks. I think it’s unfair.""

Flinn cites, among others, blog posts from Smart City Memphis, the consultant firm run by Tom Jones, a close aide to county mayors from the late 1970s until the early 2000s. ""It’s how you understand a contract  —  consideration is more than just cash,"" Flinn said.

Smart City’s blog has taken serious issue with those studies, and in particular targeted former suburban Shelby County Schools (SCS) superintendent Jim Mitchell. A post titled ""Town Districts School Building Fiction"" quotes Mitchell at a suburban forum saying, ""That is not what’s been done in this county for 45 years."" Meaning, the county had not gotten payment from Memphis for schools during annexations.

Jones wrote: ""Let’s say it simply: he is wrong."" He added: ""There have been torturous negotiations to give county government financial consideration . . . using waivers of ADA funding requirements, offsetting financial credits, or through joint design of schools by city and county school district.""

In other words, although there was not a direct cost, Memphis-partisans point out that the county was indirectly compensated in other ways, such as agreements to allow the county to forego what is commonly referred to as the Average Daily Attendance (ADA) funding requirement. ADA requirements mean that for every $1 the county gives for capital improvements to the suburban system, it has had to give a corresponding share to Memphis City Schools (MCS) based on the city’s much-larger student population.

""When I’ve heard the county commissioners, it’s like, ‘Oh, they annexed and they got the schools la dee da,’ "" Flinn said. ""But that’s not an accurate rendition. It was a negotiated transaction, with give and take on both sides.""

Where the feasibility studies do reference negotiated agreements between the city and county over the schools, to waive ADA requirements, they do so in the form of footnotes.  Ernest Kelly, the attorney at Evans, Petree who litigated for MCS for decades, said those footnotes came out of years-long legal wrangling.

Those footnotes show that Memphis ultimately agreed to allow Shelby County a $12 million waiver on ADA funds as ""credit"" for Memphis taking schools in annexations from the late 60s and early 70s.

To Memphis at the time, $12 million spent on suburban school capital improvements meant, because of the then $5.7-to-$1 ADA split, it stood to see $68.4 million flow into its coffers from county government. That $68.4 million equates to $229 million in purchasing power in the 2010 economy, and the website MeasuringWorth.com calculates that $68.4 million in projects in the 1978 economy equates to $433 million in projects in the 2010 economy.

For the suburban school system, the $12 million credit  —  equivalent to $76 million in projects today  —  allowed for construction or renovation of some of the very buildings municipalities want to receive for free. A Jan. 27, 1978, article from longtime Commercial Appeal education reporter Jimmie Covington, now working to help Collierville start a municipal system, points out: ""For several years, the county has not had to share school construction funds with the city because of credits received from the city system for county schools which were annexed. However, about $4 million in county school building projects approved for this year have about exhausted the credits."" In an April 28, 1978, article, Covington wrote that ""the city system has paid the county for annexed schools by waiving"" the ADA share.

Kelly does emphasize that MCS felt strongly it could have and should have received buildings without any considerations, based on an 1898 case, Prescott vs. the Town of Lennox. While cautioning that the legal niceties related to an annexation differ from the current circumstances, Kelly explained that Lennox determined facilities are a public trust and therefore ""the buildings ought to follow the kids.""

""We were all suited up and ready to go to Chancery Court,"" Kelly said Thursday, but there were other variables, some having nothing to do with schools – like the city’s desire to push the burden of costs related to the city’s public hospital over to the county. Cut a deal giving the county something for the annexed schools, MCS was told, so we can save money on the hospital issue.

""So the legal argument didn’t get resolved on one side or the other,"" Kelly said. ""We had a compromise that . . . eliminated the risk of paying money, which would have been painful and in our view unjust. From the county’s point of view, they got something.""

Two of the planners most involved in more recent transfers – longtime and recently-retired SCS chief of operations Richard Holden and former MCS director of planning Louise Mercuro  —  each said there were agreements in which MCS again agreed to allow the county to waive ADA requirements.

""Most of them had to do with schools that would eventually become part of Memphis City Schools,"" Holden said.

For some buildings, MCS and SCS cooperated with joint funding, planning and designing.

""It was never a straight policy that they give the schools, ever,"" Mercuro said. ""The county always got something out of it, one way or the other.""

Holden, now a key member of the county’s schools merger transition commission, said that after SCS became an elected board, in 1998, there was more of a push from the suburbs to get fair value from MCS for annexed schools.

""In the latter years Shelby County Schools board members thought there should be some compensation,"" Holden said. Longtime SCS board chairman David Pickler agreed with that assessment.

According to a Feb. 12, 2003 article, one of the initial proposals for financing what became Arlington High School involved crediting the county for $37 million for annexed schools. Both Memphis and suburban school boards ""agreed to the proposal in concept"" but it did not come to fruition. Arlington High School was eventually financed with bonds paid for by a tax levy on non-Memphis residents only.

Our ruling

So did Shelby County in fact ""give"" 44 school buildings to Memphis City Schools? As the consultants note, exactly $0.00 in real dollars has exchanged hands for the buildings MCS took over during annexations.

But there were serious past negotiations where the county received considerations of real value, even if it never got a check. Some of the suburban municipalities, in fact, benefitted from new schools or renovations made possible by Memphis agreeing to ""credit"" the county for some value of schools it took over.

Because of that, we rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/19/chris-thomas/suburban-advocates-say-shelby-county-gave-memphis-/

Congressman Steve Rothman claims “Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare”
","
Fact-checkers across the country have debunked the claim numerous times over the last year, but that didn’t stop U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman from shouting these nine words during a recent debate on the House floor:

""The Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare.""

Democrats have been making similar claims since the Republican-controlled House signed off in April 2011 on a Medicare reform proposal advanced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin). Rothman (D-9th Dist.) made that accusation -- and then repeated it -- during a Feb. 8 debate about extending the payroll tax cut.

But repeating a falsehood still doesn’t make it right, Congressman.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Ryan’s plan would dramatically restructure Medicare, but it wouldn’t eliminate the program. Also, the proposed changes would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries or others who turn 65 years old before 2022.

Our PolitiFact colleagues have issued False or Pants on Fire rulings to versions of this Medicare claim in nine separate fact-checks, ultimately designating it as the 2011 Lie of the Year. Two other fact-checking groups -- FactCheck.org and The Washington Post’s Fact Checker -- also said the claim was inaccurate.

Rothman spokesman Aaron Keyak said in an email that the congressman stands by his statement.

""Right now, every senior citizen is guaranteed comprehensive medical care under Medicare,"" Keyak wrote. ""The Republican plan authored by Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), and approved by the House Republican Majority on April 15, 2011, would end this guarantee for everyone under age 55 and replace it with a voucher system that would cover only a portion of the cost of buying health insurance.""

Let’s explain how the Ryan proposal would change Medicare.

Under the traditional Medicare program, which is available to anyone 65 or older, the government pays health care providers directly for services. Beneficiaries must bear the cost of deductibles and coinsurance.

Ryan called for converting the Medicare program to a privatized system, starting with people who turn 65 years old beginning in 2022. Under that system, the government would provide ""premium support payments"" to help beneficiaries purchase private health insurance.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, most beneficiaries would pay more for health care through the proposed program than under the current Medicare system.

In April 2011, the House approved a budget resolution containing Ryan’s proposal, but the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate later rejected it.

Now, let’s point out two problems with Rothman’s claim.

First, Ryan’s proposal would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries or people who were at least 55 years old by the end of 2011 and later sign up for Medicare.

Secondly, Medicare would still exist under the proposal, just in a very different form. Federal dollars would still be subsidizing people’s health care.

The Ryan plan ""would potentially have major changes in how Medicare operates and who bears the financial costs of the program, but it would not literally do away with the program,"" Thomas Oliver, a professor of Population Health Sciences at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, said in an email.

Joel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, agreed that the Ryan plan would maintain a Medicare program, but told us the proposal ""would end the government program that most people think of when we say ‘Medicare.’""

""Bottom line, in my view, is that the quote from Cong. Rothman is hyperbole, but has (a) thread of truth,"" Cantor said in an email, later adding that the congressman’s ""comment is an over-statement of the impact of the Ryan plan on Medicare.""

Our ruling

In a speech on the House floor, Rothman repeated a claim that’s been debunked many times before: ""The Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare.""

Republicans approved a dramatic restructuring of the Medicare program, but that plan would not ""end Medicare."" The program would remain in existence, and the proposed changes would not affect current beneficiaries or others who turn 65 years old before 2022.

We rate the statement False.
