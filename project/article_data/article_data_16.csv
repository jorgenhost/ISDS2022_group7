What percentage of Americans have alcohol use disorder?
","Richard Ojeda, the former West Virginia legislator who mounted a short-lived presidential campaign, has continued to tweet extensively as a private citizen. On Oct. 19, 2019, Ojeda tweeted about the scale of alcohol abuse and how it might be tamed by cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical found in cannabis. ""One in eight American adults, or 12.7% of the U.S. population, now meets diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder. CBD might be the answer to this massive problem. #CBDOil #Healthylifestyle #Alcoholism #Quitsubstanceabuse,"" Ojeda tweeted. The tweet attached an ad for a CBD oil vendor. One in eight American adults, or 12.7 percent of the U.S. population, now meets diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder. CBD might be the answer to this massive problem. #CBDOil #Healthylifestyle #Alcoholism #Quitsubstanceabuse pic.twitter.com/sojvTsPagF The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that cannabis-based products can help ease the side effects of chemotherapy and muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis.  A 2015 article in the journal Substance Abuse reviewed prior studies and expressed some optimism about CBD’s usefulness in combating some addictions, though it found less evidence for alcohol specifically. A second article from 2019 in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research found, based on rodent trials, that ""CBD appears to have promise"" for treating alcohol use disorder, but the authors cautioned that more research needs to be done to confirm this effect in human subjects. Too little is known about the effects of CBD on alcohol abuse for us to address that part of Ojeda’s tweet. But what about Ojeda’s statistic, that ""one in eight American adults, or 12.7% of the U.S population, now meets diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder""? We found significant uncertainty when it comes to measuring how many Americans have issues with alcohol. (Ojeda did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a part of the National Institutes of Health, defines alcohol use disorder as uncontrolled and problematic drinking. The institute considers alcohol use disorder to be synonymous with the more commonly used term ""alcoholism."" There are different ways to measure the extent of alcohol abuse. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 25.1% of adults age 18 or older have had at least one heavy drinking day during the past year. This comes from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, which defined a heavy drinking day as five or more drinks consumed (for men) and four or more (for women). Meanwhile, a different federally sponsored survey, the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, used another definition -- people reporting that they engaged in heavy alcohol use in the past month. The survey defined heavy alcohol use as having at least five drinks (for men) or four drinks (for women) on at least five days in the past month. In 2017, the survey found that 6.7% of respondents reported that they had engaged in heavy alcohol use during the past month. Drinking to this level on a very frequent basis can be indicative of a problem, although there is not a clear consensus on exactly how often -- and this by itself does not constitute an alcohol use disorder. Officially, the same survey found that 14.1 million adults -- 9 million men and 5.1 million women -- have alcohol use disorder. That works out to 5.7% of the adult population.  This 5.7% figure is smaller than Ojeda’s 12.7%. So where did that come from? It appears to have come from a study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry in 2017. In fact, Ojeda’s wording is taken straight from a Washington Post article describing the study. The study was based on data from the federally sponsored National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Its headline finding was that the prevalence of alcohol use disorder has spiked, rising by 49% in the first decade of the 2000s. Specifically, the percentage of adults meeting the criteria for alcohol use disorder rose from 8.5% in 2001-02 to 12.7% in 2012-13. Another review of alcohol use disorder was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2018 said the percentage could be even higher. Alcohol abuse disorder ""is present in up to 14% of US adults during a 1-year period,"" the authors wrote. The differences between the dueling federal studies have been striking enough that researchers published a paper about it in 2007 in the journal Addiction. They suggested a variety of reasons may be causing the variations, notably the divergent policies on anonymity for respondents. Technical factors like data weighting, question wording, and response format may be making a difference as well. Ojeda would not have needed to dig up the 2007 study to understand this background -- the Washington Post article that his assertion originally came from included a section noting this caveat. ""While the study's findings are alarming, a different federal survey, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, has shown that alcohol use disorder rates are lower and falling, rather than rising, since 2002,"" the article said. It quoted the JAMA Psychiatry study's lead author, National Institutes of Health researcher Bridget Grant, saying she isn’t sure what is behind the discrepancies. Kenneth Leonard, director of the Clinical and Research Institute on Addictions at the University of Buffalo, told PolitiFact that he agreed with this description of the two surveys. Ojeda tweeted, ""One in eight American adults, or 12.7% of the U.S population, now meets diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder."" This statistic comes from a peer-reviewed study that was based on federal survey data. However, by citing only this study, Ojeda glosses over the reality that a different federal study showed rates about half as high. Researchers have suggested that the dueling studies may be reporting divergent numbers due to differences in their methodologies. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether the 12.7% statistic is accurate or if it’s actually half that. There is valid evidence for both numbers, and researchers can’t fully account for the difference.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C190900>],/factchecks/2019/nov/19/richard-ojeda/what-percentage-americans-have-alcohol-use-disorde/

Rob Wittman wrongly says House has issued more subpoenas than passed bills
","U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman took aim at House Democrats during a recent radio interview, claiming they have spent more time pursuing President Donald Trump’s impeachment than legislating. ""The critical business of the nation is not getting done,"" he said during a Nov. 11 interview with Jeff Katz on NewsRadio WRVA, ""Everything has ground to a halt and everything becomes these hearings on impeachment. The ridiculous thing about this is there’s actually been more subpoenas issued by the majority than bills passed."" Wittman’s claim parrots a similar attack that has made the rounds among  Republican lawmakers and  conservative pundits as the House continues its probe into Trump’s actions on Ukraine. The claim has roots in an Oct. 22 article from the Washington Times, which said that under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing just 46 bills that went on to become laws.  While some Republicans specified that the Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Wittman was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed.  In fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump’s desk. We reached out to Wittman and his director of communications, Kathleen Gayle, told us the congressman misspoke. ""Congressman Wittman meant to emphasize that House Democrats have issued more subpoenas than have had bills signed into law, as clearly there have been many partisan bills that have passed the House by an exclusively Democrat majority,"" Gayle wrote in an email the contained the italics. Even this revised claim gives a misleading impression, however. Experts said it’s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles to passing legislation. Counting House-backed laws can be misleading The Washington Times counted 56 publicly acknowledged subpoenas that House Democrats issued between the start of their majority and the article’s Oct. 22 publication, including 15 related to the impeachment inquiry. The report’s authors did not respond to requests for comment, but their subpoena tally lines up with what other news outlets have reported. By our count, the House has subpoenaed at least 24 people to date as part of the impeachment inquiry.  Pelosi spokesperson Ashley Etienne said she believes the House has issued about 47 in total, adding that many were due to ""stonewalling of the current administration and Trump’s posture of refusing to respond to congressional requests, inquiries and subpoenas."" Etienne also pointed out that during President Bill Clinton’s administration, Republicans in the majority issued more than 1,000 subpoenas. The Washington Times said the House has introduced and passed 47 bills-turned-laws since Democrats took over in January. According to Congress.gov, that’s accurate: There are 44 bills and 3 joint resolutions that originated in the House, passed the Senate and were signed into law by Trump. But Josh Tauberer, president of GovTrack.us, a nonpartisan website that tracks government and congressional data, said the number of House bills that become law is not a reliable indicator of how hard the House is working to legislate. That’s because bills are often introduced in pairs, with the House and Senate each proposing their own versions. ""But which one is enacted is up to chance and doesn't indicate that only legislators in one chamber put in any effort,"" Tauberer said. Also,the text of a bill is often replaced as it goes through the legislative process, meaning ""the chamber that a bill originated in, and a bill's original sponsor, may have no connection to the substance of the bill when it is enacted,"" he said. This year, the House and Senate have combined to pass 68 bills that earned Trump’s signature, according to Congress.gov. But Tauberer said Pelosi’s House has voted on about 1,200 pages of new laws and roughly 200 unique legislative proposals that ended up in those enacted laws.  The House can’t make laws by itself Experts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate’s role in sending House-backed bills to the president’s desk. ""The House can't pass ‘bills into law’ by itself,"" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. According to Congress.gov, the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January. But the Senate hasn’t acted on many of them. In July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed to block Democrats’ progressive policy proposals, telling an audience to ""think of me as the grim reaper."" The GOP doesn’t have the same blocking power when it comes to subpoenas, however.  ""We are talking about two completely different processes,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank. ""A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law. The latter is a much bigger hump to surmount."" Of course, Wittman’s botched version of the comparison is even more wrong, since he originally said there have been more subpoenas than bills passed, which simply isn’t true. We should note that Political National fact-checked and rated False a nearly identical to Wittman’s, made Oct. 31 by CNN commentator Mike Shields.    Our ruling Wittman said, ""There’s actually been more subpoenas issued by the majority than bills passed."" That’s wrong, and Wittman’s spokesperson told us the congressman misspoke. But the claim the claim Wittman’s spokesperson says the congressman was trying to make - that House Democrats are responsible for more subpoenas than bills passed into law - is also misleading, since it compares two very different processes. We rate this statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097746080>],/factchecks/2019/nov/19/rob-wittman/rob-wittman-wrongly-says-house-dems-have-issued-mo/

No, Nike and Steph Curry didn’t split over Bible verses
","Did Golden State Warriors basketball player Steph Curry part ways with Nike because the company wouldn’t let him put bible verses on his shoes?  That’s what one viral rumor on social media claims. The post features a photo of someone on a basketball court donning a pair of white and blue Under Armor shoes. The words, ""I can do all things.."" are written on the side of the sneakers. That’s the beginning of the Phillipians 4:13 Bible verse, ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.""  Text below the photo reads: ""Steph Curry had to make a decision to either stop writing scripture in his shoe before every game while wearing Nikes, or wear a sneaker made by a company who would support his vision. Steph Curry decided that his faith was more important that (sic) the fortune he earned from Nike, so he cancelled his deal with Nike and now wears Under Armor sneakers and they print the scripture in his shoes for him. As a believer never compromise your faith to make any deal, any situation ir (sic) relationship work. God will always provide you with partners and connections who support your vision."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is accurate that Curry writes a variation of Phillipians 4:13 on his shoes –– he has since his college days –– but there is no evidence to support the claim that his Nike endorsement deal fell through because the company wouldn’t allow him to write scripture on his shoes. There have been no statements from Curry, Nike or Under Armour that say religion was a factor in any dealmaking. According to ESPN, Nike and Curry split in 2013 after Under Armour offered Curry, a young basketball player who soon emerged as one of the best in the league, more money than Nike. Curry said he started writing Phillippians 4:13 on his shoes for encouragement while he was playing at Davidson College. He has written a variation of it on his sneakers ever since. In the 2013 offseason, Curry and his father, Dell Curry, attended a pitch meeting to extend the Nike contract.  But in the meeting, the elder Curry told ESPN it was clear from the start that the company didn’t consider his son a top-tier athlete. Among other missteps, Dell Curry said a Nike official mispronounced Steph’s first name Stephen (which is pronounced traditionally) as ""Steph-on,"" and one powerpoint slide featured Kevin Durant’s name instead. ESPN reported that Dell Curry said he stopped paying attention after that, and while they sat through the entirety of the pitch, ""the decision to leave Nike was in the works"" Writes ESPN: ""In the meeting, according to Dell, there was never a strong indication that Steph would become a signature athlete with Nike. ‘They have certain tiers of athletes,’ Dell says. ‘They have Kobe, LeBron and Durant, who were their three main guys. If he signed back with them, we're on that second tier.’"" Curry went on to sign a $4-million-a year deal with Under Armour that Nike failed to match. In 2015, the partnership was extended through 2024. It’s true that Curry writes his favorite Bible verse on his shoes, but there is no indication Nike barred him from writing the verse or that any such conflict over Curry writing Bible verses inspired Curry to leave the company and join Under Armour.

What is the value of drugs that come to the U.S. border?
","In October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents. A major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country. Border agents ""say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,"" he said, according to the Intelligencer, the Wheeling News-Register. Is this number correct? It’s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.  We’ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.  As a result, in this fact-check, we’ll interpret McKinley’s comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley’s office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.) Here’s the most recent data on drug seizures — cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl — from Customs and Border Protection.   The official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value. For cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado. For fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriff’s office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019. The following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.  Once you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.  That’s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it’s in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.  ""There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,"" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade. We should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It’s unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.  Another caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico ""remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States"" and that ""Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States."" McKinley said that ""$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs."" If you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million. That’s smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a reasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value fluctuations and other limitations of the data. We rate the statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280972B8100>],/factchecks/2019/nov/18/david-mckinley/what-value-drugs-come-us-border/

Columbia’s economy may be booming, but it hasn’t beat out the nation
","Columbia Mayor Brian Treece boasts that his city has the strongest economy in Missouri. At an October press conference with Gov. Mike Parson, Treece claimed: ""We’re one of the fastest growing cities in the region, the only city in the state to grow jobs faster than the nation as a whole."" Is Columbia the economic powerhouse that Treece claims it to be? Treece was referencing a 2018 article from the Columbia Daily Tribune in his claim, which cited a report by two University of Missouri economics professors, Joseph H. Haslag and John H. Holtmann Jr. The report, ""On the Columbia Economy: A Comparison across Missouri and across Counties,"" looked at four cities in Missouri — Columbia, Springfield, St. Louis and Kansas City — and found that Columbia’s economy outperforms the other cities in a number of categories. The first category, gross domestic product growth, measures the final goods and services produced in an area in a period of time. Haslag and Holtmann studied the GDP growth rate for each city from 2001 to 2016. Columbia’s was the highest at 1.81%, which is also greater than 1.69%, the growth rate for the country. So, Columbia’s GDP growth is a good indicator that the city is outdoing the nation. However, Treece claimed that Columbia’s job growth was faster than that of the nation. Haslag and Holtmann’s report only compares Columbia’s job growth to the other major cities in Missouri. It doesn’t make the comparison with the nation. According to the report, Columbia’s payroll employment — the standard measure of the number of jobs a region has — increased at an average annual rate of 2% from 1990 to 2018. The Missouri average was .78%. But the report does not cite the payroll employment rate for the nation. Total payroll employment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that Columbia is behind the rate of the nation. From January 2009 to January 2019, the U.S. saw an average annual growth rate of nonfarm employment of 1.18%. In that same time period, Columbia’s average annual growth rate was .97%. So, while Columbia may be beating the rest of the state in job growth, it is not outperforming the nation, as Treece claimed. Treece also said that Columbia is the only city in the state to have this impressive job growth. Because they account for 70% of the total economic production in Missouri, Haslag and Holtmann’s report only studied Columbia, St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield. Other cities in Missouri were not included in the study, so it’s not clear whether Columbia is the only city in the state to experience this growth. Treece said that Columbia is ""one of the fastest growing cities in the region, the only city in the state to grow jobs faster than the nation as a whole."" Treece was correct in asserting that Columbia is one of the fastest growing cities in the region from an economic standpoint. Haslag and Holtmann’s report shows that Columbia has the highest GDP growth out of the four major metropolitan cities in Missouri. However, Treece also said that Columbia is the only city in the state to have jobs grow faster than the nation. Data from the BLS indicates this isn't true, as the U.S. saw a greater average annual payroll employment growth rate than Columbia. Treece was correct in asserting that Columbia is booming compared to other Missouri cities, but BLS data shows the city is not outperforming the state in terms of job growth. For these reasons, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CA100>],/factchecks/2019/nov/16/brian-treece/columbias-economy-may-be-booming-it-hasnt-beat-out/

Claim that Missouri has among the highest rates of uninsured children misses part of the data
","Nicole Galloway, state auditor and Democratic candidate for Missouri governor, said in an email she’s running for governor to ""help the children who are not being protected by the current Jefferson City administration."" She added that ""in 2018, the year Mike Parson took office, Missouri saw a 9% drop in children insured under Medicaid and CHIP."" She called for the expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and said: ""Missouri has one of the highest rates of uninsured children in the country, and it’s completely avoidable."" Galloway’s office cited a September 2019 report from the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission to support her claim. It showed Missouri had the largest decline — 15.1% — in children covered by those two insurance programs between May 2017 and May 2019. Does that mean Missouri’s uninsured children rate is actually one of the country’s highest? Most children are covered by their parent’s insurance, but if a parent is uninsured they may be eligible for coverage from Medicaid and CHIP. Children are eligible for Medicaid if their parents meet the income threshold of 150% of the federal poverty level, which according to the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation is $25,750 a year for a family of four. CHIP expands Medicaid’s coverage and covers children whose parents’ income is still low, but doesn’t meet the threshold. An enrollment decline could be a good thing if more people are getting insurance through jobs with health benefits. That’s not necessarily the case, according to Samantha Artiga, director of the Disparities Policy Project and associate director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Some of that enrollment decline may reflect people who are coming off of coverage because of problems completing renewals or other systems or processes issues, not necessarily because they're no longer eligible for the coverage,"" she said. Medicaid and CHIP enrollment rates aren’t necessarily the same thing as uninsured rates, said Gerald Kominski, a health policy and management professor and senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization, Missouri’s rate of uninsured people from the ages 0 to 18 was the same as the national average at 5% in 2017, the most recent year data was available. ""Saying Missouri has one of the highest rates is stretching; it’s high, but it’s higher in neighboring states,"" Kominski said in an email. Some examples of states with higher rates of uninsured children are Oklahoma with 8%, and Nebraska with 6%. Texas had the highest rate of uninsured children at 11%. Overall, Missouri is tied with nine other states for 15th highest in the nation. ""Missouri has one of the highest rates of uninsured children in the country,"" Nicole Galloway said in an email to voters. While the data Galloway used shows Missouri had the steepest decline in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, those programs are a subset of the overall uninsurance rates. The enrollment declines between 2017 and 2019 don’t by themselves show that Missouri had one of the country’s highest rates of uninsured children.

Trump inaccurately disparages Yovanovitch in Somalia, Ukraine
","As former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified during the second day of the public impeachment hearings, President Donald Trump bashed her career record on Twitter. ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" Trump tweeted during the Nov. 15 hearing. ""She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff read the tweet aloud and asked Yovanovitch to respond. ""I don’t think I have such powers — not in Mogadishu, Somalia — and not in other places. I actually think that where I served over the years I and others have demonstrably made things better for the U.S. as well as for the countries that I served in,"" Yovanovitch said, mentioning work toward fighting corruption in Ukraine. Yovanovitch was the point person for American anti-corruption policy in Ukraine and later became the target of Trump’s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine. Experts on foreign policy told us it was ridiculous to think that one person could turn a country ""bad,"" and even if that weren’t the case, Yovanovitch was well-regarded.  We asked the White House to provide evidence that ""everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" and we did not get a response. Trump tweeted that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky ""spoke unfavorably"" about Yovanovitch. The summary of the July 25 phone call shows Zelensky did, after Trump brought her up first, calling her ""bad news."" Zelenksy responded: ""It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous president and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new president well enough."" Michael Kofman, an expert on Russia and senior research scientist at the CNA Corporation,  told PolitiFact, ""Zelensky not liking her is hardly indicative of whether she was a good or bad ambassador."" ""Ambassadors are not there to appease foreign leaders, but to represent our policy,"" he said. ""Often times, it’s not the ambassador but the policy or the U.S. stance that is to blame. The ambassador is the messenger. One thing Zelensky and Trump both have in common is that neither had any government experience and may simply not understand what the role of an ambassador is."" We couldn’t pinpoint exactly when Yovanovitch was stationed in Somalia, but it appears she was there in the late 1980s. We know that she joined the foreign service in 1986 and said that Somalia was her first job.  ""For my first job, I moved to Mogadishu, Somalia,"" she told the New York Times in 2016. ""This was before the internet, and it took three months from the time I wrote a letter to the time I got one back."" Ken Menkhaus, a political scientist at Davidson College in North Carolina, was in Somalia during the same time as Yovanovitch on a Fulbright. He said he didn’t personally know her although he knew others in the embassy at the time. In 1988, the U.S. government froze aid to Somalia in response to reports about human rights abuses and the government attacking its own people, Menkhaus said. Other countries also withdrew aid. The Somali government lost the ability to pay its soldiers, the soldiers defected and a civil war swept the country. The U.S. government cut off aid to Somalia, a country whose strategic importance was dwindling as the Cold War ended.  ""None of that had anything to do with the U.S. foreign service in Mogadishu or Washington,"" Menkaus said. ""The idea that any single U.S. government official could be blamed for the early period of civil war which was when she there is ludicrous."" The U.S. embassy wasn’t to blame for what the Somali government did to its own people or Congress cutting off the aid. ""All of that was well beyond the capacity of an embassy to control,"" he said. ""No mistake was made by our embassy by that point to handle any of this."" Ahmed I. Samatar, a Macalester College professor of international studies who grew up in Somalia, said that the country at the time was a place of ""chaotic violence"" where the ""institutions of the state had melted."" (Samatar ran for president of Somalia in 2012.) He said that there was no one from the embassy could have stopped the violence. ""Nobody could save Somalia from themselves at that time,"" he said.  While Samatar said he didn’t know her personally, he had heard she had a good reputation. ""She was stellar — people said that,"" he said. ""She was very intelligent, very proper, very strict and sympathetic."" David Shinn, a former ambassador to Ethiopia from 1996 to 1999, called the allegation about Yovanovitch ""absurd."" When she was in Somalia, he was ambassador to Burkina Faso.  ""As a junior officer she had no control over the situation in Somalia,"" he told PolitiFact.  The United States never formally severed diplomatic relations but closed the embassy in 1991. Yovanovitch worked for the government for over 30 years. She testified during the impeachment hearing that in her job she has ""moved 13 times and served in seven different countries, five of them hardship posts."" On May 20, Yovanovitch was removed as ambassador to Ukraine after being told Trump lost confidence in her. She had initially been appointed to that role by President Barack Obama in 2016. Yovanovitch focused on the sphere of the former Soviet Union. Before Ukraine, she was the ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, both times appointed by President George W. Bush. She worked under six administrations, two of them Democratic and four Republican. Earlier in the Bush years, she was deputy chief of mission of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. The Senate confirmed Yovanovitch eight times between 1986 and 2016 (we saw this reported in a tweet by National Journal reporter Zach Cohen) All of the confirmations were by voice vote or unanimous consent.  When Yovanovitch was nominated as ambassador to Armenia in 2008, former U.S. Sen.

He testified that he had seen her work as ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, and that the president of Kyrgyzstan told him ""what a great job she had been doing and how she'd worked out some of the problems that they had with America."" ""She's made a very serious contribution to our national interest in securing our Air Force base and establishing a constructive relationship with the government after what they called the Tulip Revolution in 2005,"" he said. During the 2008 hearing, Yovanovitch faced some criticism when she didn’t use the word ""genocide"" when talking about the mass killings in Armenia. The previous ambassador was withdrawn after he used the ""genocide"" term, which was against U.S. policy. During her 2016 confirmation, she was confirmed easily by the Senate.  Trump tweeted, ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad"" and then referenced Somalia and Ukraine. The White House failed to provide evidence that Yovanovitch was to blame for what happened in Somalia during her tenure. She was stationed in Somalia early in her career in the 1980s. There is no evidence that as an embassy official she played any role in Somalia’s downfall.  People also spoke highly of her time in Ukraine, and we were able to find no hard evidence to suggest her Ukraine tenure was ""bad."" In fact, we found many positive words about her job performance.

Fact-checking Tucker Carlson’s false claim about the testimony of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine
","One of the ways Republicans and allies of President Donald Trump sought to undermine the Nov. 15 public testimony of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, in the impeachment inquiry was to claim she gave ""dishonest"" testimony under oath in the past. Fox News host Tucker Carlson carried the torch on his Nov. 7 show, when he highlighted portions of testimony Yovanovitch gave to Congress behind closed doors. Carlson told his viewers that Yovanovitch was recalled from her post ""following allegations of serious partisanship and political bias."" He said that a Democratic congressional staffer reached out to Yovanovitch before the whistleblower complaint became public on Sept. 26. Yovanovitch, Carlson then said, wasn't truthful in her Oct. 11 closed-door testimony about the handling of that email. Carlson said his show had obtained the email from the staffer to Yovanovitch. ""Yovanovitch claimed that she never personally responded to it. Never responded to the Democratic staffer. In fact, it turns out that she did respond. In fact, she said, ‘look forward to chatting with you’ to that staffer,"" Carlson said. ""And as Congressman (Lee) Zeldin pointed out, the ambassador’s original answer, which was dishonest, was given under oath."" It appears Ambassador Yovanovitch did not accurately answer this question I asked her during her “impeachment inquiry” deposition under oath. https://t.co/2Ju420Pkpb pic.twitter.com/WACsyksMzW The scope of this fact-check is to assess Carlson’s key claim: That Yovanovitch gave dishonest testimony under oath. And more specifically, that Yovanovitch claimed that she never responded to an email from the staffer in question when, in fact, she had. The transcript, in this case, disproves Carlson’s point.  Here are the facts. Yovanovitch testified as part of a closed-door hearing Oct. 11 that she received an August email from a Foreign Affairs Committee staffer. The email was sent to Yovanovitch’s personal email, she said. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., pressed Yovanovitch about the details of the staffer’s email, including whether Yovanovitch knew the person who emailed her and how she handled that communication. Yovanovitch said her understanding of the email was that the Foreign Affairs Committee wanted her to talk about the circumstances of her May removal as ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch said she knew the staffer because the staffer previously worked at the State Department.  Zeldin asked Yovanovitch if the staffer was trying to get Yovanovitch to come in and testify. But Yovanovitch answered that the communication ""just didn't get that far"" because Yovanovitch ""transferred that information"" to the State Department. Asked specifically if the staffer was ""responded to by you or someone else,"" Yovanovitch said she believed someone in the legislative affairs office had done so. (The identity of that person is redacted). Critically, Yovanovitch never said she didn’t respond, as Carlson claimed. Yovanovitch went on to talk about a second email from the staffer. The staffer said, ""oh, okay, you know, who should I be talking to?""  Yovanovitch, according to the transcript, said she didn’t reply to that email. For full context, what follows below is the relevant exchange between Zeldin and Yovanovitch, based on the transcript released by the House committees involved in the impeachment inquiry. Zeldin: ""Did you know this person?"" Yovanovitch: ""Yes."" Zeldin: ""And how did -- where did you know that person from?"" Yovanovitch: ""She had previously worked at the State Department."" Zeldin: ""And how do you know that person at the State Department?"" Yovanovitch: ""Because she worked at the State Department."" Zeldin: ""Where did you work together at the State Department?"" Yovanovitch: ""Well, I’m not exactly sure. I think she worked in DRL and in the office that handles human rights, and it must have been either in connection with my Ukraine work or previous work in the European Bureau. I don't recall exactly when we met."" Zeldin: ""And when was -- how often do you communicate with this person?"" Yovanovitch: ""That was the only time."" Zeldin: ""When was the last time you had communicated with that person?"" Yovanovitch: ""Well, I should actually clarify. So she emailed me. I alerted the State Department and, you know, asked them to handle the correspondence. And she emailed me again and said, you know, who should I be in touch with?"" Zeldin: ""To try to get you to come in and testify to the House Foreign Affairs Committee?"" Yovanovitch: ""It wasn't clear to me whether it was going to be – whether this was a discussion with her, whether this was a discussion with other staffers, whether it was a deposition. I mean, it just didn't get that far, because I transferred that information to the State Department lawyers well, H, actually."" (The transcript doesn’t make clear who is ""H."") Zeldin: ""And what specifically was she asking you to speak about?"" Yovanovitch: ""I think -- I think it was the circumstances of my departure, or maybe she just kept it more general and said to catch up, but I understood it as that."" Zeldin: ""Do you know if she had reached out to other people about that?"" Yovanovitch: ""I don't know."" Zeldin: ""And you -- one more time. And what did you do after you received the email?"" Yovanovitch: ""I alerted the State Department, because I'm still an employee and so matters are generally handled through the State Department."" Zeldin: ""Was that person responded to by you or someone else?"" Yovanovitch: ""I believe, yes, by (redacted) in the Legislative Affairs office."" Zeldin: ""Did you receive any subsequent requests to testify to the House Foreign Affairs Committee or to come in to speak to someone at the House Foreign Affairs Committee following that initial email? Was there any follow-up?"" Yovanovitch: ""Well, as I said, there was the second email where she said, oh, okay, you know, who should I be talking to? I didn't respond to that email, because I had already transferred everything to the State Department and I figured they would be in touch, and they were."" Carlson said Yovanovitch claimed under oath that she never personally responded to an email from a Democratic staffer. But ""in fact, it turns out that she did respond.""  Yovanovitch, based on the transcript that Carlson and others have access to, made no such claim. Yovanovitch never said she didn’t respond to the staffer. Yovanovitch did say she did not respond to a second email. But she alluded to replying to an initial email.

No, Russia did not donate $145 million to the Clinton Foundation
","An inaccurate attack about the Clinton Foundation and Russia gained renewed popularity on Facebook. One Nov. 13 post claims the philanthropy run by Bill and Hillary Clinton has received money from Russia in the past, while President Donald Trump got nothing. ""Russia donated 0$ to Donald Trump,"" the post reads. ""Russia donated 145.000.000$ to the Clinton Foundation. Why was Trump’s campaign INVESTIGATED?"" We’ve fact-checked variations of the claim, and this one is no more accurate. The post, which has been shared hundreds of times by several conservative pages, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) The image itself — which displays text around a photo of Russia President Vladimir Putin holding Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., as a puppet — appears to have been created on ImgFlip, a popular meme-making site, at least two months ago. It’s a riff off a similar meme from 2016 that originally had Trump’s head where Schiff’s is. Here’s what you need to know: • There’s no evidence that Clinton Foundation received contributions from the Russian government. At best, investors with a business connection to Russia donated $4 million. (See the previous fact-check.) • There’s no evidence that Trump has accepted political contributions from the Russian government. Russians have invested in his properties. The Clinton Foundation donations involve nine people related to a 2007 deal between Clinton Foundation board member Frank Giustra’s company and Uranium One, a Canadian mining company. In 2009, Russia’s nuclear energy agency bought a 17% share of Uranium One. A year later, it bought enough shares to give it a 51% stake. But the bulk of the money donated to the Clinton Foundation, about $131 million, came from Giustra — a businessman from Canada, not Russia. Giustra said he sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and about 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state. If he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One investors drops significantly — from $145 million to $4 million. According to the Federal Election Commission, foreign nationals are not permitted to contribute to American elections. That includes foreign governments donating to campaigns. So Russians could not directly contribute to Trump’s 2016 campaign. RELATED: Exaggerated post connects Clintons, Russia, uranium deal Special Counsel Robert Mueller considered bringing charges against members of the Trump campaign for meeting with Russian nationals who said they had dirt on Clinton, but ultimately didn’t. The reason is ""the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation."" The Mueller report makes no mention of donations to the Trump campaign.  Trump himself has benefited from Russian money through his global real estate business. A 2017 Reuters investigation found that Russian elites have invested tens of millions of dollars in Trump’s buildings. Among the buyers were several politically connected businessmen, but none were from Putin’s inner circle. A Facebook post claimed that the Clinton Foundation has received $145 million from Russia, while Trump has received nothing. It’s inaccurate to say that the Clinton Foundation $145 million — it may be closer to $4 million from Uranium One investors. It against election law for candidates to accept political contributions from foreign governments, and the Mueller report did not show that Trump’s campaign broke it.  The statement is not accurate.

Viral post says Democrats spent $40 million on impeachment. That’s False
","Republicans have criticized the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump’s actions on Ukraine as an overextension of Democrats’ power in Congress. On Facebook, some users take issue with another part of impeachment: the price tag. One post published Nov. 11 by a conservative Facebook page, which has more than 500,000 followers, claims the inquiry has cost American taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. ""Democrats spent $40,000,000 of YOUR tax dollars trying to impeach Trump,"" the post reads. ""But not one cent was spent to benefit citizens!"" The post, which has been shared more than 4,800 times and copied by a slew of users and pages, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) The House will decide whether to impeach Trump over actions surrounding a July phone call in which he asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden’s son’s appointment to an energy board over the next few weeks. But as for the impeachment inquiry’s price tag, there is no evidence that it has cost $40 million. That $40 million figure most likely comes from an incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the cost of the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The impeachment inquiry centers around actions by Trump that occurred after Mueller’s investigation was completed. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard the claim that a public investigation cost $40 million. After Mueller concluded his special counsel investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, claimed during a Fox News interview that it cost ""about $40 million."" Expenditure filings from May 2017 to 2019 put the cost closer to $32 million. The investigation was paid for through a permanent, indefinite appropriation for independent counsels. RELATED: Here’s what we know about the cost of the Mueller investigation Mueller’s office said indirect expenses — such as personnel from the FBI or other agencies — aren’t really a use of additional tax dollars, since the personnel and resources would have been devoted to other cases if there had been no special counsel investigation. Two notes: First, the cost of the investigation doesn’t account for forfeitures made by people ensnared in the probe. The financial penalties leveled against Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman, stand out among nearly three-dozen indictments stemming from the probe. As part of a plea agreement, Manafort forfeited to the government his real estate property in New York, funds in three bank accounts, and his life insurance policy. Court documents do not specify the estimated value of each asset. (Some news outlets reported that the combined value of the real estate properties could be an estimated $22 million.) Second, none of Mueller’s findings have been — to date — part of the impeachment inquiry. The inquiry has solely focused on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine in the time period after Mueller’s investigation had concluded. Tax policy experts told us they aren’t sure how much the impeachment inquiry has cost since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced it Sept. 24. ""I can’t think of anyone who’s tried to calculate this cost,"" said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, in an email. We asked the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the investigation, for an estimate of how much it has spent on the impeachment inquiry. We did not hear back. One potential way to determine the approximate cost of the impeachment inquiry would be to add up the salaries of staffers on the relevant committees. According to LegiStorm, a congressional research website, salary expenditures for staffers on the Intelligence Committee totaled $2.4 million as of June. In 2018, salaries surpassed $5 million. If you factor in staff salaries for the Judiciary Committee, which will weigh in on the Intelligence Committee’s investigation in the House, the total comes to around $5.7 million as of June. But that number still doesn’t tell us a lot about the cost of the inquiry.  RELATED: Fact-checking Trump, Ukraine impeachment hearings, day 1 Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense, said there isn’t much congressional spending. ""All the members and staff would have been paid regardless. There are costs of transcription of the hearings, but that’s about all I can think of,"" he said in an email. ""For the executive branch there are the costs of having witnesses travel from overseas in the case of Ambassadors (Gordon) Sondland and (William) Taylor (if that is the case). And there are costs for additional attorneys at the White House to work on impeachment."" Politico reported that more than a dozen Trump administration officials have hired attorneys that typically earn between $1,000 and $1,500 per hour. But they were paid for by the Republican National Committee, officials themselves or through a legal defense fund — not with taxpayer money. As for the witnesses that will appear in upcoming impeachment hearings, it’s unclear what their travel expenses will be. But there’s no reason to think they’d cost tens of millions of dollars. Past impeachments could shed some light on the potential cost. But there’s not a lot to go off of. A 1998 report to Congress estimated that the cost of former special counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation of former President Bill Clinton had ""just shy of $30 million."" The investigation, which centered on Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, resulted in his impeachment in the House. RELATED: Johnson, Nixon, Clinton, Trump: 9 questions about impeachment Later media reports placed the cost somewhere between $47 million and $50 million. Robert Ray, who succeeded Starr as head of the Office of the Independent Counsel, told the Associated Press in 2002 that about $12.5 million was spent on the perjury and obstruction probe of Clinton and his relationship with Lewinsky. But the Starr investigation lasted several years and looked into multiple aspects of the Clinton presidency, such as the Whitewater scandal. And it was independent of Congress, making it more similar to Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in 2016 (which was slightly less expensive, when adjusting for inflation) than the Intelligence Committee’s investigation of Trump’s call with Ukraine. A Facebook post claimed, ""Democrats spent $40,000,000 of YOUR tax dollars trying to impeach Trump.""  That number echoes an exaggerated estimate of the cost of the Mueller investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election. That did not go through the impeachment process. We haven’t seen any estimates of the cost of the impeachment inquiry so far. Salaries for staffers on the committees involved, as well as expenses associated specifically with Clinton’s impeachment charges, suggest that the cost of the Trump inquiry is far less than $40 million. They would be earning salaries regardless. The Facebook post is inaccurate.

No, sex traffickers aren’t using zip ties to mark victims or abduct women
","Viral posts on Facebook are warning women to be wary if they find a zip tie attached to their vehicles.  The posts – like this one – claim that sex traffickers are leaving zip ties on cars (and sometimes mailboxes and fences) to either mark targets or to distract and kidnap women when they try to remove the ties. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While human trafficking is a very real threat that impacts millions of people around the world – and it’s possible someone has anecdotal evidence of a sex trafficker leaving zip ties – this is not a widespread tactic to mark or kidnap victims. The hoax appears to have originated in October 2018 after social media posts said the method was being used by traffickers in San Angelo, Texas. Local news outlets reported that the San Angelo Police Department started to receive several phone calls about the rumor after posts on social media went viral.  The agency addressed the posts in a news release and noted the department hadn’t received any reports of ""human trafficking, kidnappings or attempted kidnappings relating to human trafficking."" The release also stated there were no reports of zip ties being used as a means to mark a target of any type of crime. They added that the women who made the original post was not the owner of the vehicle in the photo, and that she simply used the image and copied and pasted the warning to alert other women. When we searched news archives for any reports of zip ties being used by sex traffickers, we found numerous instances in which law enforcement reported such ties had been employed by perpetrators to bind victims. But we did not locate any legitimate mentions of the zip ties being used as a way to target or distract people.  Ayan Ahmed is a spokesperson with the Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization that works to combat and prevent modern-day slavery and human trafficking. She provided PolitiFact with a statement from the organization that read that most human traffickers lure victims using psychological means such as tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening. Survivors often report being trafficked by people they know. Stranger abduction is less common, the statement said. Polaris encourages people to educate themselves and others about the realities of human trafficking. But the organization’s advocates ""strongly caution against spreading stories with potentially misleading information about human trafficking recruitment tactics as they may ultimately cause more harm than good.""  Polaris recommends anyone who wants to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, to contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email [email protected]. It’s important that people remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings, but this post amounts to an unverified, alarmist warning.

Is Jim Kenney's staff 40 percent more expensive than Nutter's?
","Budget talks lead to debate every spring, and this year Mayor Jim Kenney’s proposed 3-cent soda tax has made the stakes higher than usual. On Sunday, the city’s Republican Party made its views on the tax clear. City Committee chairman Joe DeFelice wrote an editorial for the Inquirer headlined ""Mayor’s soda tax is a Big Gulp of folly."" One of his suggestions for Kenney for dealing with funding for Pre-K, as well as Philly’s other financial problems, was to look at the size of his ""own administration,"" which DeFelice wrote ""is already 45 percent larger than his predecessor's and 40 percent more costly."" Has the mayor’s administration grown by that much under Kenney? And what actually counts as his administration? DeFelice said he was referring to a February Inquirer article comparing the organizational structure of Kenney’s cabinet to Nutter’s. The article noted 16 people reported directly to Kenney and 11 reported to Nutter and also gave the combined salaries for the people under each mayor's watch. Those numbers and DeFelice’s interpretation of them check out. Kenney has 16 staffers reporting directly to him. Nutter had 11, according to the last organizational chart released by the city in his tenure. That’s a 45.5 percent difference. Kenney’s 16 staffers make $2,584,872 added together. Using the 2015 salary data available for nine of Nutter’s staffers and 2013 numbers, which were the last readily available for the other two, they made $1,907,118. The percentage difference is 35.5 percent. That’s not quite 40 percent but could be charitably rounded up. That said, Committee of Seventy President/CEO David Thornburgh said the comparison regarding the number of people who reported to the mayor wasn’t necessarily a helpful one or the same as calling it the mayor's ""administration."" ""People generally think of the administration in broad strokes, like 20-some-thousand people that work for the city,"" Thornburgh said. ""That’s where it kind of hiccuped in my head. But you know politics."" City employees are grouped into different categories. Those who work under the mayor -- but don’t necessarily report to the mayor -- are considered part of the Mayor’s Office. Kenney released a flowchart detailing the office’s composition. It features 22 people, and the salaries and expenses of the Mayor’s Office total about $4.26 million, according to the proposed FY 2017 budget. In the last year of Nutter’s tenure, his office was more expensive. According to the FY 2016 budget, the Mayor’s Office salaries and expenses totaled about $5 million. In terms of pure size, Nutter’s administration could actually be considered larger than Kenney’s. The Nutter organizational chart, which detailed the people who report to Nutter and the people who report to them, featured 71 names, including heads of quasi-governmental agencies like DRWC and SEPTA. The same type of organizational chart for Kenney features 66 names.   Same goes for Nutter’s cabinet. According to the organizational chart released by the city, 11 people report to him, but his cabinet is actually larger. His administration listed 20 people as cabinet members in a January 2015 report about his accomplishments. That cabinet size would be larger than Kenney’s 16-person cabinet.     Kenney’s Mayor’s Office does include several new positions he created, such as digital director, deputy mayor for public engagement and chief diversity and inclusion officer. Many of these new positions command salaries of $150,000 annually. Lauren Hitt, Kenney’s director of communications, said one of the cabinet positions was created because of a charter change and two others ""because of broad consensus among the public and City Council that they were needed."" The size of Philadelphia government overall has tended to grow year after year. In the last two years, the size of the city's total workforce has gone up while total salaries have gone down. In 2014, there were 29,779 total employees making $1.63 billion in yearly salary. As of March 2016, there were 30,254 making $1.57 billion. Our Ruling Republican City Committee chairman Joe DeFelice suggested Mayor Jim Kenney examine the size of his administration before enacting something like the soda tax and argued it was 45 percent larger and 40 percent more costly than his predecessor Michael Nutter’s. Those numbers match up when comparing the staffers who report to Kenney to the staffers who reported to Nutter, but the reporting structure in city government doesn’t give the whole picture. Nutter’s Mayor’s Office was more costly than Kenney’s office is budgeted for this year, and his cabinet was larger than Kenney’s.

U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson downplays potential for punishment in ethics investigation
","U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson waved off a recent congressional report on his alleged ethics violations, arguing that the findings mean he’s practically in the clear. The Office of Congressional Ethics on April 5, 2016, released a report recommending that a House committee keep investigating Grayson. The Orlando Democrat, who is running for Sen. Marco Rubio’s soon-to-open seat, has been accused of improperly managing a hedge fund, not disclosing all his finances and conducting business deals with the federal government that would be conflicts of interest. So far, the House has not formed a new subcommittee to keep looking into the allegations. Grayson said in a conference call with reporters that is a sign he likely won’t have to face serious repercussions. ""In every single instance where there's been any formal sanction -— an expulsion, a reprimand or a censure of any member — in every one of those cases since the Office of Congressional Ethics was established, there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first,"" he said. He added that if the House Ethics Committee doesn’t form one of these panels, it usually will dismiss the complaint. ""What this does very likely represent is the end of the road regarding this particular inquiry,"" he said. We wondered whether Grayson was right that formal sanctions have only followed the creation of an investigative subcommittee. We found that Grayson has a point on the most severe types of punishments, but it doesn’t mean investigations (or potential penalties) have reached ""the end of the road."" There may yet be mileage to cover here. House rules Let’s look at how ethics investigations work. The Office of Congressional Ethics is an independent body in charge of reviewing misconduct charges by House members and their staffs. The House created the office in March 2008 after criticism that its own self-policing wasn’t working very well, and the new office began reviewing cases in February 2009. The office investigates complaints, then makes recommendations to the House Ethics Committee. The committee can act upon the office’s reports, and still has the power to start investigations on its own. Grayson cited as ""formal sanctions"" — expulsion, reprimand and censure — but those are punishments that Congress rarely metes out, to begin with. Expulsion is what it sounds like: A member is removed from the House by a two-thirds vote. It has only happened five times in the history of the chamber, all before the Office of Congressional Ethics was created. The last time was in 2002, when Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, was expelled after taking campaign funds for personal use. Pennsylvania Democrat Michael Myers was expelled in 1980 for accepting a $50,000 bribe during the FBI’s Abscam sting, and three other members were kicked out after the Civil War started, for disloyalty to the Union. Next is censure, when a majority of the House votes to admonish a member’s behavior. Usually this includes a public shaming of sorts, during which the censured member must stand in the middle of the House chamber while a resolution is read aloud. The most recent example is Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., who was censured in 2010 for 11 ethics violations. Those violations included misusing his office resources to solicit funds and not paying taxes on a vacation home. It was the 23rd time a member had been punished with a censure. Rangel’s censure did have an investigative subcommittee in the House Ethics Committee, because procedure in this case required it. The same is true for the formal reprimand, also decided by House vote following an investigation. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report, ""reprimand"" and ""censure"" were essentially interchangeable until ""reprimand"" was defined as a lesser punishment in 1976. Unlike a censure, there is no public humiliation component of a reprimand. In 2012, California Democrat Laura Richardson was reprimanded for making congressional staff work on her campaign. Her punishment included a $10,000 fine. It was the 10th formal reprimand since 1976. We’ll note the Office of Congressional Ethics doesn’t factor in here, because the House Ethics Committee started its own investigation into Richardson, without a referral from the office. Again, the committee did empanel an investigative subcommittee, because that’s the procedure. Craig Holman, a lobbyist with government watchdog Public Citizen, said Grayson ""is painting a false picture"" of how members of Congress are disciplined. The formal punishments outlined above require an investigative subcommittee, but House rules outline scads of other punishments that can be levied. These other actions include fines, restitution, amending errant financial reports, removal from committees, loss of privileges or seniority or ""any other sanction determined by the Committee to be appropriate."" Holman said there’s been more than 20 of these cases since the OCE started. The House Ethics Committee is not necessarily bound to begin an investigative subcommittee in these cases. And even then, as sometimes happens in these cases, members can leave office rather than face an investigation (the committee only holds sway over House members). In 2011, Ohio Republican Jean Schmidt was ordered to repay $500,000 for free legal help without the House Ethics Committee starting an investigative subcommittee. She was not found guilty of knowingly violating House ethics rules. She repaid less than $50,000 before losing her re-election primary. There also isn’t always a set time limit for action, as Grayson implied. Instead of dismissing the complaint, the House Ethics Committee cited rule 18(a) in its conclusion to the OCE report on his case. That means the committee will keep the case open and may start an investigative subcommittee later. Sometimes that can mean much later. For example, the committee invoked rule 18(a) in  August 2012 for Rep. Rob Andrews, D-N.J. An investigative subcommittee didn’t come until six months later, in March 2013. Andrews resigned the following year, with the investigation still open. We also found one other exceptional case that’s important to note. South Carolina Republican Joe Wilson was formally reprimanded in 2009 for interrupting President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address by shouting, ""You lie!"" That was through a resolution, not an ethics investigation. Wilson refused to formally apologize on the House floor after already apologizing to Obama personally. The Democrat-led House voted 240-179 for the reprimand over his ""breach of decorum."" The vote was largely seen as a political maneuver, not an outright ethics violation. Our ruling Grayson said that in every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, ""there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first."" The formal sanctions he cited were expulsion, censure and reprimand, all of which are exceedingly rare punishments. There are only three examples to pick from since the Office of Congressional Ethics materialized in 2009. In one case — the case of Wilson yelling ""you lie!"" — a formal reprimand came via a largely party-line resolution, not an ethics investigation, so no subcommittee was established. More importantly, Grayson omits that there are many other ways to discipline a member of Congress beyond formal sanctions. He also downplays that the House Ethics Committee kept his case open and could convene an investigative committee later. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972C0100>],/factchecks/2016/apr/13/alan-grayson/us-rep-alan-grayson-downplays-potential-punishment/
"['Transportation', 'Texas', 'Sylvester Turner']","
World's widest highway not where Sylvester Turner thinks it is
","You don’t have to look hard in Texas to find supersized variations of everything from donuts to state fair mascots to steak-eating challenges. According to Houston Mayor Sylvester Turne,, there’s a category Houstonians alone can claim. Twice in two months, Turner singled out one of Houston’s major highways. At a March 4, 2016, press conference, Turner said: ""The Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world, with up to 26 lanes including frontage road lanes."" Turner went on to hammer that an expansion of I-10 that finished in 2008 still left drivers sitting in traffic during peak drive times, saying cities should consider other methods to control congestion beyond expansion.   Houston’s 14 expressways are all big, of course. But is the Katy Freeway really the widest on the planet? For starters, the mayor counting main lanes along with frontage roads to judge width struck us as unusual. To our inquiry, Brad Eaves, principal at the Houston firm TEI, agreed, saying that from a traffic standpoint, he’d consider main lanes of a freeway and the frontage roads separately since each one serves a different function: Main lanes are high-speed, long-trip roadways while frontage roads serve a purpose that’s a little different. While he’s heard this stat before, since he’s ""obviously not familiar with every freeway in the world,"" he could not confirm whether Turner’s claim is true or not. We could have wandered many ways to check this claim. For starters, a Google search of ""widest freeway in the world"" pulled up more than 92,000 results. The first, a May 2015 Chron.com article that also included this claim. Turner’s spokeswoman, Janice Evans, also sent us a link to the same story as the source for Turner’s claim.  That Houston Chronicle story called the Katy Freeway the world’s widest, at 26 lanes including managed lanes and frontage roads near the interchange with Beltway 8. This wasn’t the newspaper’s judgment, however. Rather, the story referred to an August 2012 Business Insider web post listing the ""11 wildest highways to drive before you die,"" with the Katy Freeway chunk of I-10 (which runs from Jacksonville, Florida to Los Angeles) designated the world’s widest. Here’s the full Business Insider entry, which appeared between mention of Bolivia’s treacherous Yungas Road and mention of the Karakoram Highway in the Himalayas: ""With 26 lanes in certain parts, the Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10, is the widest highway in the world. It serves more than 219,000 vehicles daily in Texas. Built in the 1960s, Interstate 10 expands across a 23-mile stretch from its intersection with Interstate 610 to the city of Katy in Texas."" In the entry, the words ""Katy Freeway"" link to a web page sponsored by Webinfolist.com, ""Civil Engineer,"" presenting definitions including: ""Highway is defined as the main road intended for travel by the public between cities and towns. The Pan-American Highway is the longest international highway which connects many countries. It is nearly 48,000 kilometers long. ""Whereas,"" the definition continues, ""the Katy Freeway in Houston, Texas, USA, is the widest highway, having a total of 26 lanes in some sections."" We saw no sourcing for the characterization and our attempts to draw elaboration, repeatedly by email, proved a dead end; no replies. At the least, then, we know where the mayor’s wording likely originated. Our own width search Our search for fuller perspective started with TXDOT data indicating that in 2014, I-10 just west of the 610 loop saw a daily average of 316,182 cars. One thing that is clear: the freeway’s designation as the world’s widest folds in its frontage lanes. The freeway alone is 13 lanes at its widest, with most sections consisting of 10 to 12 lanes, Doug Hecox, a public affairs specialist with the Federal Highway Administration, told us via email. The FHWA uses the Highway Performance Monitoring System, a database that collects information on the nation’s public roads. Congress uses data from the system in reports that determine highway funding, and states and local governments use data to assess everything from highway condition to air quality trends. We’d reached out to the agency to gauge how I-10 compares in width to other major U.S. roadways -- never mind highways of the world. When comparing freeway lanes alone, I-10 doesn’t appear to be especially wide. In fact, as of July 2010, at least eight sections of other U.S. freeways had more lanes. A section of I-405 in Los Angeles had 14 freeway lanes, parts of I-75 in Atlanta had 15 lanes, and we spotted stretches of freeway in more than 10 other cities with 12 or 13 lanes. This means, according to the agency, highways in six other states had more lanes than the Katy Freeway. Hecox told us the agency doesn’t include frontage roads nor does it have a way to include them. And in Canada… Considering highways globally starts to make the Katy look picayune. As of 2016, for instance, Highway 401 near the Toronto Airport ran 18 lanes across. And, the Hong Kong-Macau Expressway, otherwise known as the G4, made headlines in October 2015 when a newly-installed checkpoint funneled 50 lanes -- yes, 50 lanes, to accommodate multiple toll booths--  into 20, causing an hours-long traffic jam. Our ruling Turner called the Katy Freeway, a Houston portion of I-10, the widest freeway in the world, with up to 26 lanes, including its frontage roads. If frontage and managed lanes are included, I-10 is quite the behemoth. Problem is, hardly anyone includes frontage roads when measuring American freeways. Get rid of the frontage roads and the Katy drops to 13 lanes at its widest, not much different than several other freeways across the country. As for the rest of the world, we found a wider freeway in Canada, and a reported 50-lane highway in China that makes the Katy look like a country road. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972CF440>],/factchecks/2016/apr/13/sylvester-turner/worlds-widest-highway-not-where-sylvester-turner-t/

A look at Hillary Clinton's claim about Vermont's gun pipeline to New York
","As the April 19 New York presidential primary approached, Hillary Clinton sought to draw a contrast with rival Bernie Sanders on gun policy. During an April 11 appearance in Port Washington, N.Y., for what was billed as a ""conversation on gun violence,"" Clinton took issue with Sanders’ characterization of his home state, Vermont, in the gun policy debate. Sanders has said that Vermonters have a more tolerant attitude toward guns than more urbanized states like New York, because of their state’s small, rural nature. In Port Washington, Clinton said that doesn’t excuse Vermont from being part of the problem for cities grappling with the spread of out-of-state guns. ""Here's what I want you to know,"" Clinton told the audience, according to CBS News. ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont. ""So this is not, 'Oh, you know, I live in a rural state, we don't have any of these problems,' "" she added. ""This is, you know what, it's easy to cross borders, criminals, domestic abusers, traffickers, people who are mentally ill, they cross borders too and sometimes they do it to get the guns they use. This has to become a voting issue for those of us who want to save lives."" This talking point was several days in the making; PolitiFact attempted to fact-check a similar claim she reportedly made during a closed-door event on April 4. But we were unable to nail down the wording through a recording -- until Clinton offered the version in Port Washington a week later. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Clinton’s claim Three Pinocchios out of a maximum of four -- not a very favorable score. But we’ll take a fresh look here. When we asked the Clinton campaign for evidence, they pointed us to a report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives covering calendar year 2014. The report looks at firearm ""tracing"" data, an investigative and statistical tool used by the ATF to discern how a gun traveled from its point of origin to its ultimate destination, at which point the gun is often involved in the commission of a crime. A chart in the report included Vermont in the top 15 ""source states"" for guns, with 55 guns from Vermont ending up in in New York. Here’s that chart:  That’s actually one of the smallest raw numbers of any of the 15 highlighted states -- beyond New York itself, the biggest states in raw numbers of guns were Virginia, Georgia and Pennsylvania. These states, especially Virginia, are more commonly associated with the ""Iron Pipeline"" that some analysts have described in which guns flow up Interstate 95, from southern states with looser gun laws to northern states with stricter laws. But it’s important to note that Clinton said ""per capita."" So we divided the per-state gun haul by the state’s population and confirmed that Vermont does indeed have the highest rate per capita, thanks to its tiny population. (Guns from elsewhere in New York ranked second, followed by South Carolina, Georgia and Virginia.) So we have no quarrel with the accuracy of Clinton’s numbers. Instead, the dispute is about whether this per-capita number has any relevance to the gun-policy debate. In a statement, the Clinton campaign said that the per-capita number is ""critically important"" because ""it shows just how dangerous Vermont's laws are relative to other states. If Vermont had the population of California, it would source roughly 3,800 crime guns each year to New York -- far more than the top 15 total source states for New York crime guns combined."" However, the academic experts we checked with echoed the concerns from the Fact Checker article -- that the raw numbers matter much more than the per-capita numbers do. John Roman, a senior fellow in the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, told PolitiFact that ""many guns used in violent events come from a very small number of dealers, usually unlicensed gun show folks or shady businesses. That's the problem with this denominator -- the size of the state's population doesn't matter, the number of bad dealers does."" The strongest support we found for using the per capita data came from Ted Alcorn, research director at Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun-violence group. But even he was even-handed about the comparative usefulness of the two measures. If you were a policymaker, Alcorn said, and you ""had the ability to turn on off the spigot, of course you’d want to reduce the top-source states"" as measured by raw numbers, he said. At the same time, he added, having an analytical tool along the lines of a per capita measurement is valuable for deciding where to pinpoint law enforcement resources. ""If you’re looking at the state level, and if you’re just concerned with the absolute numbers, you’ll only focus on the big states and never focus on the small states,"" he said. That said, Alcorn said other types of measurements will often be more valuable than the state per-capita data Clinton is pointing to -- particularly if you can drill down to whether specific stores are seeing a disproportionately large share of the guns they sell end up in New York. Experts we checked with offered a couple other concerns with Clinton’s statement: • The ATF’s trace data is not random or comprehensive. In fact, this point was made in the very same report the Clinton campaign cited. It said: ""Not all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced are used in crime. ... The firearms selected do not constitute a random sample and should not be considered representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe."" Jay Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida who studies gun issues, said this is an important caveat. ""The ATF tracing data is the best we have, but for a gun to show up in the data set, it has to be recovered by the police and the police have to make the decision to have the source of the gun traced,"" Corzine said. ""Nobody really knows what the level of bias happens to be. It may be minimal or it may be substantial."" • Traced guns have not necessarily been trafficked. This is the case even though Clinton used the specific word ""traffickers"" in her comments. ""If Joe Gunowner moves from Vermont to New York, gets burglarized and loses a gun, and that gun is used later in crime, is recovered by police, and is traced by ATF, it will show up as a crime gun that originated in Vermont -- but it most definitely did not involve gun trafficking,"" said Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University. It’s impossible to know how common this scenario is, but Kleck believes it’s substantial. The flow of guns across state borders is ""a reflection of the very mobile character of the American population,"" he said. • Geography matters. The question of geography cuts both ways when measuring the validity of Clinton’s claim. On the one hand, a small-population state with relatively loose gun laws that happens to share a long border with New York may carry added significance than a larger-population state with equally loose gun laws that’s located much further away. On the other hand, it may be the case that the guns from Vermont are flowing into the neighboring areas of Upstate New York, rather than higher-crime areas around New York City that are more supportive of restrictive gun laws. (Corzine is one who thinks that’s quite possible.) We don’t know the answer to this question for sure, however, due to laws restricting the public release of data with greater detail. Our ruling Clinton said ""the state that has the highest per capita number of … guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont."" Clinton’s specific statistical computation is accurate. But beyond the numbers, Clinton’s claim is misleading for a varied number of reasons. From a policy perspective, experts say raw numbers of gun flows are likely a better measure. And while the ATF data set is the best we have, Clinton’s bold comment glosses over some important caveats about the data, including whether the guns it captures are representative and whether they line up with ""trafficking."" These caveats call into question whether Vermont’s gun policies are having the effect Clinton suggests. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C236EC0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/12/hillary-clinton/look-hillary-clintons-claim-about-vermonts-gun-pip/

 Barack Obama says wind power cheaper in Texas than power from 'dirty fossil fuels'
","Barack Obama, exhorting Dallas Democrats during a March 2016 Texas swing, called Republican claims that the country and planet are in sorry shape a ""false narrative."" ""America is pretty darn great right now,"" the Democratic president said. And among great things, Obama said, Democrats believe in science and that climate change is real -- and that wind is a better bargain in Texas than traditional oil and gas. Come again? ""Right now, here in Texas,"" Obama said, ""wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels."" Wind power sure has sizzle. In 2015, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found Mostly True Obama’s claim that ""America is No. 1 in wind power."" China led in overall wind-power capacity but the U.S. was generating more electricity from the wind. Earlier, in 2010, we rated True a declaration that Texas had ""installed more wind power than any other state, and all but four countries."" As of 2009, Texas boasted 9,410 megawatts of wind power — enough to power two million homes. More recently, FactCheck.org, based at the University of Pennsylvania, dug into Obama’s claim in his 2016 State of the Union address that ""in fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power."" Nationally, average coal and gas prices were running less than average wind power costs. Yet in Iowa and Texas, wind energy proved cheaper, according to an Energy Information Administration analyst. Meantime, an American Wind Energy Association blog post talking up Obama’s Iowa-Texas SOTU claim noted a 2015 study by Lazard LLC, a financial services firm, stating the cost of wind production in Texas, not counting government subsidies, runs from $36 to $51 per megawatt-hour while an average national cost for coal-fired electricity ranges from $65 to $150 per MWh and for gas, depending on the type of plant, from $52/MWh to $218/MWh. White House cites DOE report We asked the White House about the basis of Obama’s statement in Dallas. By email, spokesman Frank Benenati said a federal report shows that in 2014, the ""average executed price of wind power purchase agreements"" was $23.50 per MWh and according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a non-governmental outfit, ""the levelized cost of energy from wind in Iowa and Texas, even without subsidies, is lower than the"" levelized cost of energy ""of coal at $59/MWh."" Congress in 2015 extended the federal Production Tax Credit for five years. That action, recapped in North American Wind Power, means ""wind developers"" get a credit of $23 per MWh for electricity generated to the power grid though the credit is set to diminish from 2017 through 2019. The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest annual report on wind technologies, which affirms Texas as the No. 1 wind-power state, states that based on research compiled by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the ""national average levelized price of wind PPAs,"" or Power Purchase Agreements, ""that were signed in 2014 (and that are within the Berkeley Lab sample) fell to around $23.50/MWh nationwide—a new low, but admittedly focused on a sample of projects that largely hail from the lowest-priced Interior region of the country."" Absent from the report: A direct wind-to-fossil-fuel cost comparison, though the report says that based on the agency’s sample, ""wind PPA prices are most competitive with wholesale power prices in the Interior region. The average price stream of wind PPAs executed in 2013 or 2014 also compares favorably to a range of projections of the fuel costs of gas-fired generation extending out through 2040."" The Interior region takes in the middle-of-the-country states running north from the Texas-Mexico border to Canada. Levelized costs represent the per-MWh cost (in inflation-adjusted dollars) of building and operating a generating plant over an assumed financial life and duty cycle, the EIA says, counting capital and fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs, financing costs and ""an assumed utilization rate for each plant type."" So, Obama’s claim has a basis. Still, the report also cautions against comparing long-time purchase agreement prices for wind with shorter-term fluctuating prices of electricity from fossil fuels like coal. An ""important note"" says the presented prices don’t reflect ""the full social costs of power generation and delivery."" That is, the report says, the cited wind purchase agreement prices are driven down by federal and, sometimes, state tax and financial incentives. Also, the wind prices don’t ""fully reflect integration, resource adequacy or transmission costs,"" the report says. On the other hand, the note continues, ""wholesale electricity prices (or fuel cost projections) do not fully reflect transmission costs, may not fully reflect capital and fixed operating costs and are reduced by virtue of any financial incentives provided to fossil-fueled generation and its fuel production cycle as well as by not fully accounting for the environmental and social costs of that generation."" ""In addition, wind PPA prices—once established—are fixed and known, whereas wholesale electricity prices are short term and therefore subject to change over time,"" the note says. ""Finally, the location of the wholesale electricity nodes and the assumption of a flat block of power are not perfectly consistent with the location and output profile of the sample of wind power projects. In short, comparing levelized long-term wind PPA prices with either yearly wholesale electricity prices or forecasts of the fuel costs of natural gas-fired generation is not appropriate if one’s goal is to account fully for the costs and benefits of wind energy relative to its competition. Nonetheless, these comparisons still provide some sense for the short-term competitive environment facing wind energy, and how that environment has shifted with time."" Energy department cites Bloomberg report Like Benenati, Dawn Selak, an energy department spokeswoman, told us the estimated cost of coal in 2015 was around $59/MWh, a figure she attributed to Bloomberg research. So, Selak said, ""the cost of wind (including in Texas) is less than the cost of coal even with the $23/MWh"" tax credit factored in. In a February 2016 report prepared for the pro-wind-power Business Council for Sustainable Energy, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said: ""Wind in Texas is among the cheapest in the country, with an unsubsidized levelized cost of electricity of around $50/MWh, due to high capacity factors (>50%) and low cost to build."" Capacity factor refers to the share of time a turbine (or plant) is actively generating power. A Bloomberg analyst, Stephen Munro, told us by phone and email that Obama was essentially correct per the latest costs of wind power generation in the Texas Panhandle. ""Since 2013,"" Munro wrote, ""we have observed that the cost of new Power Purchase Agreements for wind energy has fallen below the average around-the-clock wholesale prices in the wholesale pool that covers much of the wind power generation in the Panhandle. Average around-the-clock wholesale prices include power generated from fossil fuels, renewable sources and uranium. ""As of the second half of 2015,"" Munro wrote, ""we observed a levelised cost of power of $43/MWh in PPAs for wind in the utility region including much of the Texas Panhandle."" In comparison, Munro said, coal-fired electricity was costing $74.70 per MWh in most of East Texas and the Panhandle as well as Kansas plus parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas and Louisiana. Munro said the wholesale price of wind-fueled power is ""notably lower"" in the Panhandle and other parts of the region ""because that region features an extraordinary wind resource and because the costs of land and construction are lower than elsewhere. Developers have taken advantage of this to install advanced, large capacity turbines."" That is, it’s way windy a lot up over there, we (or maybe someone from Fort Worth) would put it. Texas analysts We also ran Obama’s statement past a staff spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the flow of electricity to most Texans. By email, Robbie Searcy said she’d grant the claim credence. a Mostly True rating. ""Within the ERCOT real-time wholesale energy market,"" Searcy said, ""all generation that is used in any interval technically clears at the same price, which is the highest price of all resources used to serve demand in each load zone at that time. During periods of high wind output,"" she said, ""wind generation resources are able to offer power into the market at very low, and sometimes negative, prices. This in turn drives down the settlement point prices for all resources operating during those intervals, especially when demand is low."" At our request, Searcy emailed a chart showing wind, coal and natural gas electricity ""price offers"" in ERCOT’s market at 7 a.m. Jan. 22, 2016. At that time, the chart indicates, coal and gas offers were priced higher than wind. She said the date was the most recent day of available public data when we inquired and agency experts chose the hour to reflect the period when demand, and therefore generation, peaked. Searcy said wholesale market prices at 7 a.m. that day were ""about $26.70 per MWh on average among all resources used at the time."" At that time, she said, average offers from gas-fired power producers were $23.37/MWh compared to $14.14 per MWh for coal and a negative $23.89 for wind power. (Perhaps wind power producers could afford that thanks to the federal subsidy.) Searcy said too it’s worth remembering that when ""we talk about natural gas-fired resources, that covers a broad range of technologies and efficiency levels, from older steam units to more modern combined-cycle units to quick-start combustion turbines."" The case for coal Even if Texas wind power may be cheaper for electricity than traditional fuels, other authorities told us there’s at least one smart reason to keep the other fuels handy. Winds can die down, keeping turbines from spinning. At the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas producers, Lauren Hamner, spokeswoman for Commissioner Christi Craddick, said by email that it’s worth remembering a coal-fired plant is capable of running longer at all hours than a breeze-dependent wind turbine -- so power capacity, she said, should be folded into any comparison. Similarly, Russ Keene, Austin-based spokesman for the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition, which says it represents consumers and coal producers, transporters and industrial users, pointed out a June 2015 study by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Energy Research, a free-market think tank. The study seems an outlier in saying that when ""all known costs"" are considered, the average U.S. cost of producing electricity from established coal-fired plants is far less than new wind-power generation. Still, we asked its lead author, Tom Stacy, to evaluate Obama’s claim. By email, Stacy said the president didn’t acknowledge that an established plant fueled by coal, gas or nuclear power can be available at all hours and that’s just not so for wind-dependent generators. It stands to reason, he indicated, that wind-generated electricity can’t (or shouldn’t) be price-compared to electricity generated by fossil fuels or nuclear sources. Availability at all times aside, we wondered, is it also so that wind-fueled power is lately cheaper in Texas than power drawn from fossil fuels? ""And dog meat in China is cheaper than Kobe beef in NYC,"" Stacy wrote, ""but it isn't the same thing, is it?"" Our ruling Obama, in Dallas, said: ""Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels."" Wind-generated electricity is offered for sale in Texas at lower prices than power fired by coal or natural gas. Unsaid: wind power, unlike electricity fueled by oil or gas, isn’t always available.

Nope. Most polls still don’t show Ted Cruz beating Hillary Clinton in November
","Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz brought his fiery calls for limited government and lower taxes to California on Monday, during stump speeches in Irvine and San Diego. The Texas senator also brought a claim, one PolitiFact recently rated Mostly False, about what the polls show in a general election matchup between him and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. ""The polling shows over and over again that, unlike Donald Trump, that with me as the (GOP presidential) nominee, we beat Hillary Clinton,"" Cruz told supporters at an Irvine rally.  Sen.

""My focus is on beating Hillary Clinton, and poll after poll after poll shows Donald losing badly to Hillary. And poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary."" The claims are substantially the same. When rating the statement Cruz made in Irvine, PolitiFact California will apply the same research used by national fact-checking website PolitiFact when it examined Cruz’ claim on CNN. Why PolitiFact rated this claim Mostly False PolitiFact found Cruz was right about polls showing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump losing to Clinton in a November matchup. It rated that statement True earlier this week. But PolitiFact found Cruz wasn’t accurate when portraying his own standing against Clinton in the surveys. PolitiFact examined recent national polls archived on RealClearPolitics.com and found that the Texas senator is off. It found: ""Of the nine surveys released in the last month, Cruz beats Clinton in only one — a Fox News poll where Cruz scores 3 percentage points higher than Clinton. The two were tied in the latest McClatchy/Marist poll and in a CNN/ORC poll. The margins of error were +/- 3 percentage points. In the other six polls, Clinton beat Cruz. In four of those surveys, Clinton's advantage exceeded the margin of error.    Cruz was looking stronger against Clinton in February, where he tied or beat Clinton in five of six surveys. But in only one of those polls was Cruz's edge greater than the margin of error.

Patrick Murphy praises Florida's payday law as 'stronger than almost any other state'
","Consumer groups have attacked Florida members of Congress, including Patrick Murphy, for defending a payday lending bill that they say traps the poor in a cycle of debt. Murphy, a Democrat who represents the Treasure Coast and is running for U.S. Senate, disagrees with those consumer advocates. ""The regulations on the (payday lending) industry are some of the strongest here in Florida, stronger than almost any other state,"" Murphy said in a conference call with reporters April 6. The position of Democratic lawmakers on payday loans has been a hot topic in Florida. We will fact-check Murphy’s claim that Florida’s payday lending law is ""stronger than almost any other state."" We found that consumer groups, independent researchers at Pew Charitable Trusts and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have raised multiple criticisms of Florida’s law. No expert we interviewed consider Florida’s law to be ""stronger than almost any other state."" Florida’s payday lending law Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. About three dozen states have their own payday laws, including Florida. President Barack Obama took a step toward regulating payday lenders when he signed a bill in 2010 that included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau released an outline of payday loan rules in 2015 and will release a more complete proposal this year. The bureau’s goal is to make sure consumers have the ability to repay their loans -- something experts say Florida’s law fails to do. (The bureau can’t cap rates -- something only Congress or states have the authority to do.) Nearly all of Florida’s congressional delegation, including Murphy, signed a letter in April 2015 asking the bureau to use Florida’s law as a model. U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican, filed a bill in November which would give precedence to state laws. Murphy is one of 24 cosponsors on the bill, which hasn’t had a hearing yet. Murphy’s Democratic primary opponent for the U.S. Senate, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, signed the April letter but now says he will oppose the bill in its final version because it contains a waiting period on federal regulations. Consumer groups, researchers criticize Florida’s law Consumer advocates say that Florida’s payday law is no model. More than 200 consumer or civil rights groups -- including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Consumer Federation of America -- wrote a letter to Congress arguing that the ""industry-backed Florida law"" would hurt consumers. Among nine groups from Florida fighting the law is the Florida Alliance for Consumer Protection. In Florida, ""In exchange for minimal regulatory requirements, the industry was permitted to issue predatory loans, extracting millions in exorbitant fees each year from the Floridians that can least afford it,"" stated the group in May 2015. Florida’s 2001 payday loan law included protections that were intended to help the poor. But the loans leave consumers stuck on a debt treadmill in Florida, where they have racked up $2.5 billion in fees since 2005, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. The center obtained data from the state Office of Financial Regulation to examine payday transaction data for a 10-year period. The average Florida payday loan had an annual rate of 278 percent in 2014-15, the center found. Pew Charitable Trusts, an independent organization, has researched payday laws for five years, including interviews with borrower focus groups. Borrowers consistently say they want small installment payments, lower prices and certainty of quick approval. Florida has quick approval, but otherwise doesn’t meet those benchmarks, said Alex Horowitz, senior officer with the small-dollar loans project. Colorado is the only state that achieves all three. ""Colorado has by far the best model for payday loans in the country,"" Horowitz said. In Florida, loans are due back in a lump sum by the borrower’s next payday that take up on average 35 percent of a borrower’s paycheck. ""That is much more than they can afford,"" Horowitz said. Colorado’s 2010 law led to more affordable loan payments, fewer defaults, and lower prices, according to Pew. A spokesman for Murphy, Joshua Karp, pointed to a 2014 analysis by Pew that placed states into three categories: 15 states have no payday laws, 27 states have permissive laws and nine states are ""hybrids,"" with requirements such as lower limits on fees or longer repayment periods. ""Florida's law is stronger than 27 of 35 states that allow payday lending,"" Karp said. But Horowitz said that in most cases there is insufficient research to know if the restrictions in the nine states improve consumer welfare. The Center for Responsible Lending doesn’t consider Colorado to be a national model because it allows high interest rates, said Diane Standaert, the center’s director of state policy. The best practice is a rate cap of 36 percent, which exists in 14 states but not Florida, she said. ""The data from Florida is it has some of weakest provisions in the country,"" she said. The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, disagreed with Ross, a Florida congressman, when Ross called Florida’s law the ""gold standard"" during a congressional hearing on March 16. In Florida, ""these loans are still being made above the 300 percent, and they are being rolled over on average nine times,"" Cordray said. Of course, Florida’s law could always be worse. For example, eight states including Wisconsin and Texas have no fee limits, while in Florida it is $35 to borrow $300 for two weeks. However, no academic or consumer expert we interviewed argued that Florida’s law should be considered any sort of national model. ""One can’t say across the board Florida is a state that has somehow reined in payday lenders in comparison with other states,"" said Auburn University professor James Barth who wrote a paper on payday lending. Our ruling Murphy said Florida’s regulations on the payday lending industry are ""stronger than almost any other state."" Consumer advocates, Pew researchers and the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have several criticisms of Florida’s law, including the high interest rate. Pew, an independent organization, says that Colorado has the best model law in the country. The Center for Responsible Lending points to 14 states -- not including Florida -- that cap interest rates at 36 percent as a better practice. There are ways in which Florida’s payday law is better than some other states, but there is not evidence that it’s stronger than almost any other state. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AEBC00>],/factchecks/2016/apr/12/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-praises-floridas-payday-law-stronge/

Ted Cruz ad revisits a controversy from Kasich’s governorship of Ohio
","Presidential candidate Ted Cruz’s campaign came out swinging directly at rival John Kasich for the first time in a TV ad. The attack ads are getting more direct, as the delegates in contention dwindle. This ad presents a series of facts to suggest that Kasich, as governor of Ohio, orchestrated shady deals to benefit his friends and campaign funders. ""Right before John Kasich was governor, he collected $611,000 from a Fortune 500 corporation,"" the ad says. ""After Kasich became governor, that same company received $619 grand in state tax breaks for job creation. But last year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans, even as its CEO cut a half-million-dollar check to Kasich’s super PAC. John Kasich, not for us."" To find out whether it’s fact or fiction, let’s take each allegation one at a time. Kasich took money from a Fortune 500 company According to news reports, in 2001 after leaving Congress, Kasich joined the board of directors of Worthington Industries, an Ohio steel processor and Fortune 500 company. Security and Exchange Commission filings show that Worthington board members were paid $45,000 per year as a retainer, and $1,500 per meeting attended. Worthington also reimbursed board members for travel expenses and other out-of-pocket costs. The Canton Repository reported that Kasich quit the Worthington board upon winning the governor’s race in 2010, but was still owed deferred compensation from the board. Kasich received $611,000 total in deferred compensation from Worthington, and at least $103,000 of the total came after he had been sworn in as governor. That same company received $619,000 in tax breaks after Kasich took office In the first bill he signed as governor, Kasich made good on a campaign promise to attract investment to Ohio. He nixed the Ohio Department of Development and created a private, nonprofit corporation called JobsOhio, explaining that in order to lure companies to the state, government needed to ""move at the speed of business.""   Kasich designed JobsOhio to be funded by a lease on state liquor profits. He declared it exempt from public records requirements and state audits. And he made board appointments for JobsOhio a responsibility of the governor.   To drum up job creation, JobsOhio reviews potential opportunities to offer incentives such as tax breaks, and sends its recommendations to the Ohio Tax Credit Authority for final determination. The tax credit authority has a five-member board, and three of its appointees, including the chair, are Kasich’s. An Associated Press investigation found that, less than a year after JobsOhio was created, it recommended a series of tax incentives totalling $619,000 for Worthington Industries’ subsidiaries, which the state tax credit board awarded. Last year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans In March 2015, Worthington announced it was cutting 555 jobs nationwide, which included 115 in Ohio. The company blamed the loss of these jobs --manufacturing cabs for large agricultural and mining equipment -- on industry-wide downturns. Worthington spokeswoman Cathy Lyttle told the Canton Repository that any incentives the company receives are only paid when the company delivers the jobs it promised. She said that pursuing tax incentives is standard business practice, and Worthington received $400,000 in tax breaks under the previous, Democratic regime of governor Ted Strickland. Company’s CEO donates half-million to Kasich’s presidential bid The Center for Responsive Politics confirms a $500,000 contribution from Worthington CEO John P. McConnell to the New Day 2016 PAC, via Internal Revenue Service records released November 30, 2015. Several of Kasich's board appointees stepped up with campaign donations as well. OpenSecrets.org shows that the wife of ethics committee chairman Merom Brachman, Judith, gave the maximum donation to Kasich’s campaign, $2,700, in August 2015. John C. Boland, the chair of JobsOhio, donated the $2,700 max to Kasich in July 2015. JobsOhio board member Gary R. Heminger and his wife, Jane, each donated $2,700 to Kasich on the same day in October 2015. JobsOhio board member Lawrence J. Kidd and his wife, Cindy, each donated $2,700 to Kasich on the same day in August 2015. All together now Cruz’s attack ad parrots a complaint filed with the Ohio Ethics Commission by Kasich’s Democratic challenger in the 2014 election, Ed FitzGerald. The ethics commission passed on investigating FitzGerald’s complaint. Chairman Brachman, who, like the other commissioners, was appointed by the governor, said that Kasich had provided enough information to conclusively rule out any conflict of interest. He added that actions by JobsOhio are not subject to the authority of the ethics commission. Rob Nichols, Kasich’s spokesman, dismissed this Cruz ad as a ""one-hit wonder"" that only ran briefly in Wisconsin and is no longer airing. The ad’s ""four accurate, provable data points,"" aren’t in dispute, Nichols said. But he has a beef with the insinuation that any of the described actions were wrong, or even out of the ordinary. ""They didn’t say, ‘The governor’s corrupt,’ because that you could fact-check,"" Nichols said. ""Everything there is 100 percent, entirely above-board, but when you say it with a snarly voice over scary music, people think it’s inappropriate."" Our ruling Cruz’s attack ad links a series of headlines to suggest that as governor, Kasich rewarded his former business ties in exchange for political contributions. The ad’s tone is ominous, but the text is factual. What isn’t explained is that everything in the ad has been the subject of prior complaints that did not provoke any regulatory action. It’s been suggested that an overhaul of state rules might prevent similar situations from arising, and similar allegations from dogging Ohio leaders. But that’s a different ad, for another day. We rate these claims Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C44A980>],/factchecks/2016/apr/12/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-ad-revisits-controversy-kasichs-governors/

Donald Trump fully flip-flops, lately opposes ban on assault weapons
","Before finishing second to Texan Ted Cruz in Wisconsin’s April 2016 Republican presidential primary, Donald Trump of New York retweeted a supporter’s message stating: ""Challenge to all WI gun owners. Vote @realDonaldTrump.The only candidate that will protect your rights!"" That was an opinion; we can't check it. But the declaration didn’t impress Josh Perry, an aide to Sen. Cruz, who responded the day after the primary with tweets characterizing Trump as a flip-flopper on restricting assault weapons. Cue the Flip-O-Meter. Has Trump flip-flopped on banning assault weapons? ""Remember when you advocated for stripping away my #2A rights?"" Perry tweeted about Trump April 6, 2016, referring to the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which says: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" Cruz’s aide earlier posted a tweet saying Trump had said: ""I support the ban on assault weapons"" and ""a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun."" Asked to elaborate, Perry told us in a Twitter message that he’d drawn Trump’s comments from the businessman’s 2000 book, ""The America We Deserve,"" in which Trump wrote: ""I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun."" The book came out as Trump mulled a possible run for president as a third-party hopeful. At the time, a 1994 congressionally-approved ban on the sale of semi-automatic weapons was due to lapse in 2004. Democratic attempts to resurrect the restrictions have not gained traction. Perry also pointed out a January 2016 news post on TheIntercept.com, which says it’s ""dedicated to producing fearless, adversarial journalism."" The post contrasted Trump’s support in 2000 for the assault-weapon ban and longer waiting periods with recent Trump proposals presented on his campaign website, including calls for law-abiding Americans to own the ""firearm of their choice"" and for state-issued concealed-carry permits allowing residents to carry handguns to be valid in every state. On his site, Trump also says members of the military should be able to freely carry weapons on bases and in recruiting stations. Trump also brings up assault-weapon restrictions, but not in a supportive way, saying: ""Gun and magazine bans are a total failure. That’s been proven every time it’s been tried. Opponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like ‘assault weapons,’ ‘military-style weapons’ and ‘high-capacity magazines’ to confuse people. What they’re really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans."" That policy position showed up on the site in September 2015, according to an ABC News story at the time, which said: ""The position on assault weapons represents a departure for Trump from a stance he held about 15 years ago."" Trump’s site includes a section on the criminal background checks that residents who purchase guns at stores must complete. In the section, Trump advocates mental health records getting tied into the system. He’s silent on favoring or opposing slightly longer waiting periods before purchases are allowed though he indicates he doesn’t like the background-check system, saying: ""When the system was created, gun owners were promised that it would be instant, accurate and fair. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case today."" In 2016, TheIntercept.com reported, Trump ""has vowed to undo President"" Barack ""Obama’s modest gun executive orders,"" per Trump’s remarks at a January 2016 New Hampshire stop, and also called for the elimination of school ""gun-free zones."" In Vermont in January, Trump said: ""I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones."" At the time, a Washington Post news story noted Trump had repeatedly said gun-free zones are a magnet for mentally ill shooters and that mass shootings in Paris and California could have been prevented if more citizens were armed to protect themselves and others. We used the text-search feature offered by Google Books to confirm Trump’s gun statements in his 2000 book. In the book’s brief section on guns, Trump said: ""Democrats want to confiscate all guns, which is a dumb idea because only the law-abiding citizens would turn in their guns and the bad guys would be the only ones left armed. The Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions."" Next, Trump wrote, ""I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today’s Internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record."" In a March 2016 debate, Trump was asked to speak to his published support for an assault-weapon ban. He replied: ""I don’t support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault"" weapons, he said. We asked Trump’s campaign if he’d flip-flopped and didn’t immediately hear back. Our ruling Trump supported the assault-weapon ban in 2000. He opposes restrictions now. We rate this a FULL FLOP.

Sanders is right: Migrant laborers in Malaysia are forced into working under 'slave-like conditions'
","Bernie Sanders lines up fairly close to Donald Trump when it comes to the topic of trade. To some, that means Sanders has some explaining to do. In an interview with the New York Daily News, Sanders attempted to detail his position. It’s about a fundamental inequity in labor standards, Sanders suggested, enabling human rights abuses at the cost of American jobs. ""I do believe in trade. But it has to be based on principles that are fair,"" Sanders said. ""So if you are in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 65¢ an hour, or you're in Malaysia, where many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions, no, I'm not going to have American workers ‘competing’ against you under those conditions."" Sanders has made trade a big topic on the campaign trail — highlighting Hillary Clinton’s comments and votes in favor of trade deals. (PolitiFact has documented a lengthy comparison of the two.) Here, we wanted to fact-check Sanders’ claim that workers in Malaysia — which would be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — are forced into working under ""slave-like conditions."" In a word, yes. Not only is forced labor widely documented by labor and human rights groups, it’s openly acknowledged by the U.S. government. From cell phones to sneakers to palm oil The Sanders campaign referred us to a 2014 report from Verité, an NGO that monitors labor standard compliance. Verité interviewed 501 workers in Malaysia’s electronics industry (the country’s leading sector), and found that 28 percent of them were coerced under both global standards and Malaysian law. ""This work has led us to conclude that forced labour in this industry is systemic and that every company operating in this sector in Malaysia faces a high risk of forced labour in their operations,"" Dan Viederman, chief executive of Verité, told the Guardian in 2014. The International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, defines forced labor using four dimensions: unfree recruitment, work and life duress, impossibility of leaving an employer and penalty or menace of penalty. The Malaysian electronics industry violated all these guidelines in some capacity.   Like the indentured servants who came to America in the 18th century, the vast majority of foreign workers — largely from other parts of Southeast Asia —  were charged excessive job-finding fees and had to take on debt to pay them off, effectively tethering them to the job (unfree recruitment).   One in five workers were also deceived about their wages or other employment conditions, and one in three lived in and often confined to crowded, unsafe housing provided by their employer or recruitment agency (work and life durres). Verité also found that 94 percent of workers had their passports withheld by the factory or agent (penalty), though the practice is prohibited by local labor laws . Fifty-seven percent said they couldn’t leave their jobs out of fear of getting slapped with high fines, losing their passport, being reported to the authorities or other forms of retribution (impossibility of leaving an employer). But forced labor is by no means limited to one sector. Malaysia has the fourth-largest migrant worker population in the world, and its 3 million to 6 million foreign workers ""all are vulnerable to exploitation in a variety of industries,"" said Abby McGill, the campaigns director for the International Labor Rights Forum. The State Department notes that passport confiscation was ""widespread and generally unpunished,"" and has placed Malaysia in its Tier 3 watch list for human trafficking — the rating reserved for the worst offenders — in 2001, 2007, 2009 and 2014.  In addition to electronics, the U.S. Labor Department currently lists the garments and palm oil industries where labor abuses occurs (palm oil is also cited for child labor). Human Rights Watch reported on exploited migrant domestic workers in 2011.  Amnesty International chronicled the stories of trafficked, trapped and physically and sexually abused workers in a variety of industries from agriculture to construction in 2010. ""They buy and sell us like cattle,"" a 25-year-old Bangladeshi working for a palm oil producer whose customers includes U.S. agricultural giant Cargill told the Wall Street Journal in 2015.   Free trade and chained work The debate over whether free trade stymies, improves or has no bearing at all on working conditions is an ongoing one. International labor standards are actually included in many trade agreements.The United States monitors worker conditions in partner countries, and has spent $275 million to support labor rights since 2001, according to a 2014 Government Accountability Office audit. But despite this, the GAO concluded that there’s still a lot of room for improvement. The USTR and Labor Department ""lack a strategic approach to systematically assess whether partner countries’ conditions and practices are inconsistent with labor provisions in (free trade agreements),"" according to the audit. Academics have also pointed out these provisions are often ambiguous, difficult to enforce or simply ignored. In other words, agreements on paper don’t necessarily translate to improved conditions in real life. Malaysia is actually a prime example of labor rights possibly taking a backseat to free trade. In 2015, it was upgraded to Tier 2 for human trafficking by the State Department over the objections of its own human rights experts. Many perceived the move to be politically motivated, as the improved rating made the country eligible to join the TPP. Because of Malaysia’s poor labor record, it also signed a bilateral agreement with the United States, promising to implement workers rights and protect against forced labor before obtaining trade benefits. Human rights and labor rights groups, however, are skeptical this will lead to actual reform. ""The devil is in the details of actual implementation, and Malaysia is a very corrupt place where those with connections and money can get away with not complying with the law – as both Malaysian and migrant workers have found out frequently over the past two decades,"" said Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Asia at Human Rights Watch. Said McGill of the International Labor Rights Forum: ""Given that they get everything they want upfront whether they change anything or not (not an ideal negotiating strategy), the labor enforcement provisions are so weak there isn't a stick to force them to comply. That approach has never worked in the history of free trade agreements. No reason to think it will start now."" Nonetheless, many have argued you can have your free trade and be humane, too. A 2010 study, for example, found that labor conditions have improved in Cambodia as a result of labor provisions in a trade agreement signed with the United States. But many argue that improved working conditions are actually a cascading effect of global trade, not regulation itself. ""The kinds of adjustments that go with free trade, while painful in the short run, lead to improved labor conditions in the long run,"" Stanford labor economist Robert Flanagan said in an interview about his book, Globalization and Labor Conditions. Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, acknowledged that some are certainly worse off as a result of global trade. He pointed out that working conditions were terrible in the United States a century ago, but improved when the economy developed and standard of living rose. ""Do we really think it would a good idea for the U.S. not to have been able to trade in 1916 or 1886?"" Burtless said. ""It is very hard to think of anything that has delivered a bigger improvement in the lives of poor workers than expanding their ability to sell to other countries. Period. End of story. To pretend otherwise, that you’re going to protect their workers by keeping their products out of our country, flips on its head policies most conducive to improving their lives."" Our ruling Sanders said, ""In Malaysia … many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions."" Forced migrant labor and passport withholding is widely documented across Malaysia by human rights and labor groups. The United States acknowledged the abuses in several government reports and databases. While there is a debate about whether free trade can help curtail these abuses, there is no debate to the veracity of Sanders’ claim. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C43F500>],/factchecks/2016/apr/12/bernie-sanders/sanders-right-migrant-laborers-malaysia-are-forced/

Has Wisconsin's Democratic Party leader flip-flopped on how she'll cast her superdelegate vote?
","The speeches, the balloons and the calls of ""the great state of"" (fill in the blank) -- all part of the pageantry of the 2016 Democratic and Republican national conventions -- won't fill the air until well after Independence Day. But already there are pitched battles among the presidential campaigns for delegates. Those are the folks who, in accordance with -- or perhaps in spite of -- the primaries and caucuses, will choose the party nominees. Ahead of the Democratic gathering in Philadelphia, Bernie Sanders is causing fireworks by trying to pry away superdelegates who have pledged to support Hillary Clinton. And Republican delegate leader Donald Trump has threatened to run as an independent if he is not treated fairly in Cleveland. All of which is to say there is significance attached to a delegate’s support -- particularly when the delegate, or in this case a superdelegate, is the head of a state party. On April 6, 2016, the day after Wisconsin's presidential primary, Wisconsin Associated Press reporter Scott Bauer tweeted that in 2015, state Democratic Party chairwoman Martha Laning told him she would give her superdelegate vote to the winner of the primary -- but that now she was telling him her vote would go instead to the presumptive nominee. So, has Laning flip flopped? That’s what our Flip-O-Meter is for -- to determine whether a political leader has been consistent on an issue. What she said In November 2015, in response to a question from the Associated Press, the Democratic Party sent a statement from Laning saying: ""I will be supporting the candidate who wins the primary in Wisconsin next year. The Democratic voters in Wisconsin will evaluate each candidate and pick the strongest one and I will cast my vote for the candidate that they pick."" As we noted, Sanders’ Wisconsin win was decisive -- he captured more than 56 percent of the vote, to Clinton’s 43 percent. At least one other Democratic superdelegate from Wisconsin has attributed the margin to the fact that Wisconsin holds an open primary, which allowed anyone -- voters who identify as Democrats or not -- to cast a ballot for the Vermont senator or the former secretary of state. Whether that influenced Laning isn't clear. But she did reverse her position, with her spokesman telling the AP after the primary she would back the presumptive nominee. She had also made such statements a few weeks earlier. At this stage, the presumptive nominee is Clinton, not Sanders. (As of April 10, 2016, Clinton is within 627 of the 2,383 delegates needed for the nomination. Sanders is 1,315 short, leaving him little chance of winning the nomination with the remaining primaries and caucuses. The tally, from the Associated Press, includes superdelegates.) When we asked the state party about Laning’s apparent change, we received this statement from Laning: ""As the party chair, I feel one of my main goals is to bring our party together to work together to defeat the Republicans.  As our primary race has evolved and I have had the opportunity to talk to many voters across the state, I concluded it would be better for me to remain neutral and thereby be supportive of all our members’ individual choice. Once we have a nominee I will work with Democrats across the state to create unity and ensure that candidate becomes our next president."" Our rating In November 2015, Laning said she would cast her superdelegate vote at the Democratic National Convention for the presidential candidate who wins the Wisconsin primary. But after the primary, which was won by Sanders, she reversed that position. She now says she will back whoever is the party’s presumptive nominee -- which at this stage is Clinton. We rate that a Full Flop. Editor's note: On April 12, 2016, after we published this item, the Wisconsin Democratic Party provided us examples of where Laning, before Wisconsin's primary election, said she had changed her position. For example, in one interview posted March 13, 2016, Laning said: ""I will be putting my support behind the nominee.""

National surveys show Ted Cruz isn't beating Hillary Clinton in poll after poll after poll
","A key selling point for Republican presidential candidates is that they're the one who can beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in November. With the New York primary coming up on Tuesday, April 19, that was part of the pitch Ted Cruz made when interviewed on CNN by Dana Bash. The Texas senator said five of the 17 original Republican candidates now support him, along with other prominent Republicans, ""and what we are seeing, that's the unity it's going take to win the nomination. It's also the unity it's going to take to beat Hillary Clinton. And my focus is on beating Hillary Clinton, and poll after poll after poll shows Donald losing badly to Hillary. And poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary."" That's a lot of polls. We just looked at how Trump does against Clinton after conservative commentator Glenn Beck said on the April 10 edition of Meet the Press that polls show ""Hillary Clinton wins every time with Donald Trump."" We rated that statement True. For this check, we wondered if Cruz was accurately portraying his standing in the national surveys. We went back to  RealClearPolitics.com and found that the Texas senator is off. Of the nine surveys released in the last month, Cruz beats Clinton in only one — a Fox News poll where Cruz scores 3 percentage points higher than Clinton. The two were tied in the latest McClatchy/Marist poll and in a CNN/ORC poll. The margins of error were +/- 3 percentage points. In the other six polls, Clinton beat Cruz. In four of those surveys, Clinton's margin exceeded the margin of error. Cruz was looking stronger against Clinton in February, where he tied or beat Clinton in five of six surveys. But in only one of those polls was Cruz's margin greater than the margin of error. If you use the most recent results from the various polling organizations since Feb. 4, Cruz wins in two, ties in two and loses in seven. We contacted Cruz's spokeswoman to ask about the results but didn't hear back. So when Cruz says he beats Clinton in poll after poll after poll, he's short a poll or two.

Does CBO report suggest U.S. economy faces a decade of 'protracted economic malaise'?
","Is the U.S. economy headed into the toilet if nothing is done to change course? Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said as much when he released his committee’s 2017 budget resolution, which he also posted on Medium. At one point, Price and the committee wrote, ""The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects economic growth over the next decade to average just 2.1 percent — a drop off of roughly one-third from the long-term historical average of about 3.0 percent growth. In other words, CBO is expecting a protracted economic malaise for at least the next decade under current policies."" For this state of affairs, the resolution blames ""the current administration’s insistence on higher taxes, burdensome regulations, restrictions on the production of affordable, American-made energy, and a preference for crony capitalism over free markets is exactly the recipe for economic turmoil many predicted."" We wondered whether Price was accurately quoting the CBO, so we looked at the original document. It turns out that he repeated CBO’s glass-half-empty comments while glossing over the agency’s alternate, glass-half-full interpretation. The CBO estimate comes from ""The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016 to 2026,"" released in January 2016. The number in question refers to inflation-adjusted ""potential output,"" which is CBO’s best guess at the maximum growth the economy can achieve without triggering significant inflation. CBO projected 2.1 percent average annual growth between 2021 and 2026. (This is not the full decade, as the resolution indicates. However, the actual decade-long projection -- for the period 2016 to 2026 -- was even lower, at 1.9 percent, so we won’t quibble.) Here’s the full chart CBO provided.  Beyond the numbers, CBO’s analysts offered both a darker interpretation and a rosier one. The darker interpretation was that 2.1 percent is low compared to long-term pattern of roughly 3 percent. The 2.1 percent figure ""represents a significant slowdown"" from the comparable growth rates that were achieved between 1981 and 2007,"" which was 3.1 percent, CBO wrote. But CBO also had a rosier interpretation -- that 2.1 percent ""is substantially faster"" than what has occurred since the end of 2007, which was 1.4 percent. The end of 2007 marked the start of the last recession. The House resolution also avoids mentioning a common belief among economists, which is that the United States is unlikely to see the rapid growth it experienced during the first few decades after World War II, when the country had fewer international competitors. For instance, when former 2016 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush laid out a goal for 4 percent growth, he faced skepticism. It’s also worth noting that calling growth rates around 2 percent ""protracted economic malaise"" would rope in quite a few Republican presidents. According to a July 2014 paper by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, GDP growth hovered around 2 percent during the second term of President Dwight Eisenhower; the combined second term of President Richard Nixon and the tenure of his successor, President Gerald Ford; and the one term of President George H.W. Bush. And the growth rate for the second term of President George W. Bush was well below 1 percent. Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com, said she considers the budget committee’s phrasing problematic. ""Calling 2.1 percent growth ‘economic malaise’ is a bit strong given our demographics,"" Sinclair said. ""It is frustrating that we never saw a bounce back of a recovery after the Great Recession to regain the lost output from that period, but at this point looking forward we wouldn't expect one now."" When we contacted Price’s office, they stood by their characterization of CBO’s analysis and said that ""economic growth projected to be one-third below the historical average is both cause for concern and emblematic of a poor-performing economy. … It is still underperforming, whether for a short while or long while."" Our ruling Price, in the resolution his committee produced, wrote that the Congressional Budget Office ""is expecting a protracted economic malaise for at least the next decade under current policies."" Even granting Price some leeway for his use of the subjective term ""protracted economic malaise,"" he cherry-picks what CBO wrote, offering its negative interpretation without acknowledging its positive interpretation. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C43F080>],/factchecks/2016/apr/11/tom-price/does-cbo-report-suggest-us-economy-faces-decade-pr/

Pants on Fire: Claim there were over 600 reports of Trump votes getting counted for Marco Rubio
","According to a super PAC supporting New Yorker Donald Trump for president, Texas Republicans just experienced a wagon’s worth of election fraud, all oddly to the good for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (who later dropped out of the race). We read the post on stopthesteal.org on April 6, 2016 while looking into a claim by Republican consultant Frank Luntz who had said in a tweet that Team Trump ""has accused Ted Cruz,"" the Texas senator battling Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, of fraud in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin. That’s Half True, we found. Luntz, by way of offering factual backup for his claim, guided us to a post on stopthesteal.org, the website for the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness, a super PAC created in December 2015 by Trump supporter and former campaign operative Roger Stone to back Trump and attack rivals, especially Rubio, according to a Reuters news story at the time. The web post aired concerns about fraud in seven states including Texas after stating the Trump Ballot Security Project was formed ""when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the"" March 2016 ""Texas Republican primary. This ultimately totaled over 600 reports in at least six counties including Dallas County and Travis County. In virtually every case,"" the post says, ""votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Sen. Marco Rubio."" Cruz handily won the state’s March 1, 2016, primary with 43 percent of the GOP vote. Trump finished second (27 percent) and Rubio third (18 percent); Ohio Gov. John Kasich landed fourth with 4 percent, according to the Texas secretary of state. We asked Stone about the basis of stopthesteal.org’s proclaimed Texas irregularities. By email, he initially noted the ballot security project had shifted to its own website though the provided address didn't lead to any web page just a few days later. Stone further said affidavits collected from voters in multiple states hadn’t been made public and, he said, such issues would be in the jurisdiction of a credentials committee at the July 2016 Republican National Convention. ""The form of evidence of voter irregularities the"" party’s ""credentials committee finds compelling is up to the committee and no requirement that a complaint with the state election board or report to party officials is required to make a claim,"" Stone wrote, adding that the affidavits would be submitted to the committee if and when Trump’s campaign or others on the panel ""elect to challenge the seating of delegations elected"" through ""a pattern of voter fraud."" Stone said the pro-Trump super PAC has ""collected over 2,200 individual SWORN affidavits documenting voter irregularities in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin, Hawaii and Arizona. 738 of these are in Texas in at least eight counties. We are NOT finished collecting affidavits in Utah and Wisconsin,"" Stone said. ""Making this material, which we have collected at some substantial expense, public at this time would merely guarantee harassment of these citizens by the Cruz campaign,"" Stone said. Before reaching Stone, we hunted for news reports about stopthesteal.org’s described irregularities and also looked for its declared 600-plus reports of Texas votes for Trump actually going to Rubio. Those searches came up empty save for an Austin radio host’s mention of unsubstantiated complaints. A video dated March 1, 2016 shows an interview of Todd Jeffries, co-host of KLBJ-AM’s morning ""Todd and Don Show,"" by a reporter for the conspiracy-minded InfoWars.com. In the interview, Jeffries said the show had surprisingly fielded about a dozen phone calls from Austin-area voters saying their Trump votes incorrectly showed up as Rubio votes; he didn’t indicate if the concerned voters uniformly fixed such errors before finalizing their ballots. Next, to our inquiries, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas and the chairman of the Travis County Republican Party each said he hadn’t heard or seen any reports of Trump votes being recorded for Rubio--or Cruz. Mike Joyce, the state party spokesman, said by phone said he hadn’t seen even one such news story. ""I would have heard about it,"" if so, Joyce said. ""It would have been brought to our attention."" Joyce said that when he heard about the calls to KLBJ-AM suggesting ballot problems, he checked with James Dickey, chairman of the Travis County GOP, who reported back that he’d heard no such reports from polling places. Dickey said by phone he heard ""limited reports"" about Trump votes showing up for Rubio, but nothing was confirmed. To our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the Texas secretary of state, the state’s chief elections officer, said she couldn’t comment on formal complaints pending review and investigation. That said, Alicia Phillips Pierce said, the agency didn’t receive 600 written complaints in connection with the 2016 primaries. Pierce said the agency fielded less than a dozen ""calls from individuals concerned that votes may have been changed from Trump to Rubio,"" but no one ""indicated they had experienced the supposed phenomena themselves or had any direct knowledge of what allegedly occurred. Instead, they were only responding to second-hand reports they heard on the radio or saw online,"" she said. Stone dismissed the lack of confirmation from Texas news reports, writing: ""Old media. Proves nothing."" He also put no stock in the responses we’d drawn from Pierce and on behalf of the state and Travis County Republicans. ""Why would they admit it?"" Stone wrote. Our ruling A pro-Trump super PAC said there were over 600 reports of Texas votes for Trump virtually all getting tallied for Rubio. If so, those reports are no longer public, which leaves us to speculate about the content of the unreleased affidavits described by Trump backer Stone.

Frank Luntz says 'Team Trump' has accused Ted Cruz of fraud in Texas, 8 other states
","In a tweet, Republican consultant Frank Luntz lofted a claim about Donald Trump poking at Ted Cruz that made us wonder. Luntz wrote April 5, 2016: ""States where Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud: Iowa Texas Colorado Oklahoma Louisiana Kansas Maine Utah Wisconsin"" That’s a passel of accusations. Did Trump or his surrogates accuse Cruz of fraud in all these states? We remember that after Sen. Cruz prevailed over Trump in the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses, the New York businessman maintained that Cruz had deceived voters in part with misleading mailers about personal voting histories. We asked Luntz about the basis of all his bulleted states. On Twitter, Luntz said first that he didn’t have insider information. Then he guided us to a post on stopthesteal.org, a website created for the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness. That’s a super PAC launched in December 2015 by Trump supporter and former campaign operative Roger Stone to back Trump and attack rivals, especially another aspirant at the time, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, according to a Reuters news story. The post noted by Luntz touts the Trump Ballot Security Project which, the post says, is ""investigating hundreds of complaints of voter fraud in the Utah Republican Primary won by"" Cruz. The post also suggests fraud concerns in up to six additional states, starting with Cruz’s home state of Texas, whose GOP presidential primary he won. But, according to the post, the ballot-security project started ""when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the"" March 2016 ""Texas Republican primary. This ultimately totaled over 600 reports in at least six counties including Dallas County and Travis County. In virtually every case,"" the post says, ""votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Sen. Marco Rubio."" The group’s Texas claim is unsubstantiated, we found. Pants on Fire! After the Texas primary, stopthesteal.org’s post says, the group ""established a toll-free number to collect further reports of voter irregularities. Almost immediately,"" the post said, ""there were over 300 complaints from Oklahoma. Only a week later the Kansas and Maine caucuses brought hundreds of more complaints including claims of double-voting by"" Cruz ""supporters."" The post further says the project is ""analyzing voter irregularities in Ohio and Hawaii. The Trump Ballot Security Project is committed to investigating all complaints of voter fraud. In the event a pattern can be determined, the seating of these delegations can and will be challenged before the Credentials committee of the Republican National Convention. We have dispatched lawyers and election-law experts to all of the states mentioned above to investigate and document voter fraud."" From all that, we count seven states having or possibly having voting irregularities unhelpful to Trump: Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Maine -- with the Trump ballot-security project looking into fraud reports from Ohio and Hawaii. To be fair, the pro-Trump post explicitly names Cruz as the beneficiary (and possible miscreant) only in Texas, Kansas and Maine. Still, we spotted indications that Trump or his supporters have accused Cruz of wrongdoing in other states and heard as much directly from Stone. Other analyses The day we asked Luntz about his tweet, The Daily Wire -- which says its goal is to ""unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public  and devastate their funding bases"" -- posted a story laying out instances of Trump expressing dirty-trick concerns about pro-Cruz results in states including Louisiana and Wisconsin. Its story starts with mention of Trump’s complaint about the Cruz campaign in Iowa tweeting incorrect information about then-candidate Ben Carson. Next, the story describes Trump later asserting Cruz’s camp had illegally coordinated with an anti-Trump super PAC on a Utah Facebook ad showing Trump’s wife, Melania, once posing nude. That coordination charge recently came out False on the Truth-O-Meter. Also, The Daily Wire story noted, Trump posted a tweet threatening a lawsuit after the Wall Street Journal reported that Cruz might pick up as many as 10 additional delegates in Louisiana despite Trump drawing more votes in its primary. In April 2016, Trump told a Wisconsin crowd that even though he outpolled the field in the Pelican State, Cruz was garnering more delegates. ""It’s not fair, folks, it’s not fair,"" Trump said. ""Because I’m the outsider. What they do is they want to knock out the outsider because they want to keep their little party going."" According to a New Orleans Times-Picayune news story, Cruz had a chance after Louisiana’s balloting to pick up uncommitted delegates plus delegates who had committed to dropout Rubio. Meantime, Jason Doré, executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, said party officials would be prepared if Trump sued. The Daily Wire story also said that after Cruz won Wisconsin, Trump issued a statement asserting an anti-Trump super PAC had coordinated its ads in the state with a pro-Cruz super PAC. In the statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Cruz was propelled to his win of the state by false advertising and he ""was coordinating with his own super PACs (which is illegal) who totally control him,"" Hicks said. The Daily Wire story noted too that Stone said in an April 2, 2016, appearance on the online Breitbart News Saturday: ""Having worked very hard to collect evidence of voter fraud and irregularities in Oklahoma, Kansas, Utah, Hawaii and Texas, frankly, they ought to put the handcuffs on him,"" referring to Cruz, ""because the Trump people can go to credentials,"" meaning the July 2016 Republican National Convention’s credentials panel, ""and challenge the seating of hundreds, literally hundreds of Ted Cruz’s delegates who were fraudulently elected."" ""Go to StopTheSteal.org,"" Stone instructed. ""For over a month we have had an 800 number up, a toll-free number. We have collected and documented with sworn affidavits thousands of claims of voter irregularities in the states where Ted Cruz has won. And we’re prepared to present them to the credentials committee."" Summing up, then, that’s eight states either named by Trump or advocate Stone as having voting irregularities that helped Rubio or Cruz, not counting Ohio and Hawaii, where stopthesteal.org says Trump backers are still investigating. Stone: ‘Over 2,200 affidavits’ Hoping for elaboration, we sent an email to Trump’s campaign and called the anti-fraud phone number on the group’s site. We didn't hear back from either. We had luck with Stone, though, who replied by email that the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness had no immediate plans to release what he described as over 2,200 affidavits documenting ""voter irregularities"" in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah, Wisconsin, Hawaii and Arizona. Stone said the sworn statements would be submitted to the convention’s credentials panel if and when Trump’s campaign or others on the panel ""elect to challenge the seating of delegations elected"" through ""a pattern of voter fraud."" ""Making this material, which we have collected at some substantial expense, public at this time would merely guarantee harassment of these citizens by the Cruz campaign,"" Stone wrote. Stone was dismissive when we told him Republican party officials in Texas had told us they were unaware of any irregularities affecting the results in that state’s primary. ""Of course not,"" he wrote. ""Why would they admit it?"" GOP officials: Nothing awry Mike Joyce, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas, had told us by phone that the party confirmed no irregularities in that state’s presidential primary. Also, our inquiries in a few other states, including searches of the Nexis news database, yielded no confirmed irregularities. At the Oklahoma Republican Party, spokesman Jake Parsons told us by phone there had been no irregularities in its March presidential primary or accusations by ""Team Trump"" against victor Cruz. Until we inquired, Parsons said, he hadn’t heard about any 300 phone calls (as mentioned on stopthesteal.org) suggesting pro-Cruz fraud. Parsons allowed, though, that individuals who failed to register as Republicans by a February 2016 deadline were upset at not being allowed to participate in the vote. ""We actually have a great working relationship with the Trump and Cruz campaigns,"" Parsons said. We heard a similar refrain from Jason Savage, executive director of Maine’s Republican Party. ""To my knowledge there were no claims of fraud made by Mr. Trump's campaign,"" Savage said by email. ""In fact, we enjoyed working with Mr. Trump's campaign and the other presidential campaigns for our caucus. Our process was fair, secure and each campaign had access to exactly the same information and opportunities."" Savage said individuals ""may have voiced complaints from one side or another, but none of the presidential campaigns raised concerns over fraud.""In fact, I believe each of the campaigns praised our team's work and process in written or verbal form in the days following the caucus. Clayton Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said no Trump complaints have reached the party. Barker said he had seen Facebook posts suggesting busloads of Cruz supporters were able to vote in one county’s caucus and then hustle to vote in caucuses elsewhere but those were unconfirmed and, he said, party officials reviewed voter lists to ensure no one voted in separate caucuses. Our ruling Luntz said: ""Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud"" in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin. Trump or Stone, his former campaign operative, have raised questions about the results in these states and more. But we didn’t identify ""Team Trump"" charges of fraud against Cruz in all the Luntz-listed states. The most pointed charges single out Cruz for supposedly misleading Iowa voters and later conspiring with super PACs in Utah and Wisconsin. Mentions of double-voting or unspecified ""irregularities"" in other states hint at a Cruz role without adding up to fraud accusations. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Sanders: U.S. multinationals would owe $620 billion on overseas profits
","Getting companies to pay more in taxes is one of the pillars of Bernie Sanders’ plans for America. The extra revenue plays a key role in everything from universal health care, to tuition-free college, to rebuilding the nation’s aging water mains, bridges and highways. How much does he think is there? ""The largest U.S. companies would owe $620 billion in U.S. taxes on the cash they store in tax havens,"" Sanders tweeted April 6, 2016. That’s a fair chunk of change, and we thought we’d see if it held up. By the way, there’s no single definition of a tax haven. The term covers both profits from overseas subsidiaries and the use of offshore accounts in places like Bermuda. The common thread is money is booked in places with lower taxes than the United States. The Sanders campaign directed us to a joint study from Citizens for Tax Justice and US PIRG, both left-leaning organizations. Their analysis began with the more than $2.1 trillion that Fortune 500 companies are holding in accumulated profits offshore for tax purposes. When the foreign subsidiary of a U.S. multinational turns a profit, the money is taxed at the rate where the subsidiary is based. Uncle Sam doesn’t get a penny until the multinational brings the money home. That gets a little confusing because the money might actually be in the United States, but it isn’t on the books of the U.S. parent. In any event, for tax purposes, most of those funds are not formally repatriated or brought back to the United States. The logic is simple: Why pay a higher rate in the United States, formally as high as 35 percent, when you might be paying a fifth that much in a foreign country, such as Ireland? The Citizens for Tax Justice/US PIRG analysts looked at the 57 corporations that actually told regulators how big their tax bill would be if they brought the money home. ""These 57 companies would owe $184.4 billion in additional federal taxes,"" the report said. The analysts made some assumptions and applied the results to the companies that didn’t release this information. The total for all Fortune 500 companies combined? ""They would collectively owe $620 billion in additional federal taxes."" We asked independent tax scholars what they thought of that estimate. Some of them said it was in the ballpark. Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, said Sanders might actually be underestimating. Harvey pointed to the foreign earnings that multinationals report as ""indefinitely reinvested."" Officially, the total is about $2.3 trillion. But Harvey thinks that overlooks a lot of cash. ""The total unrepatriated foreign earnings would be even higher because companies like Apple and Pfizer do not label all undistributed foreign earnings as ‘indefinitely reinvested,’ "" Harvey said. ""If one assumes that U.S. multinational corporations have approximately $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion of unrepatriated foreign earnings, and the average tax rate on most undistributed foreign earnings is less than 10 percent (in many cases close to 0 percent), then a $620 billion estimate is very reasonable, and may be low."" Edward Kleinbard, professor of law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff at the U.S. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation, took a different approach, and reached approximately the same conclusion. Kleinbard took the Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimate of how much revenue would come from a one-time 14 percent tax on those foreign earnings kept overseas. This is in fact what President Barack Obama has proposed in his latest budget. The net haul from that would be about $195 billion. Using that figure, Kleinbard estimated how much would come in if the rate were 35 percent, rather than 14 percent. ""You get to $488 billion,"" he said. ""That’s not perfect, because of how foreign tax credits (offsets to U.S. taxes) would have to be handled, but it’s the right ballpark."" That’s less than the $620 billion Sanders cited, but as Kleinbard put it, ""it's a honkin' big number."" The banking giant Credit Suisse estimated the total new revenues at $533 billion. Edmund Outslay, professor of taxation at Michigan State University, thinks Sanders overshot the mark. Outslay told PolitiFact that he questions a key assumption in the study behind Sanders’ number. The study estimates an average tax rate of 6 percent that all Fortune 500 companies are paying overseas today. Because any foreign tax bill is deducted from what a firm owes Washington, the lower the foreign tax rate, the higher the potential revenues for the United States. Outslay thinks 6 percent is unrealistic. ""Some studies I have seen estimate a foreign tax rate of about 16.5 percent,"" Outslay said. ""If this number is more accurate, the total tax to be gained (would be) $550 billion. At 25 percent, the net U.S. tax would only be $320 billion."" Outslay himself leans more toward a $300 billion figure. In addition to thinking multinationals are paying a higher rate overseas, he also said ""in most cases, the foreign earnings are actually invested in bricks and mortar."" Those dollars are not cash in the way Sanders talked about this. How the IRS would treat that money is unclear. All this leaves us with a range of estimates of the potential tax revenues, ranging from about $300 billion (Outslay), to $490 billion (Kleinbard), to $550 billion (Credit Suisse), to over $620 billion (Harvey). Our ruling Sanders said that if American multinational corporations had to pay taxes on the profits they made overseas, they would owe $620 billion. This is at the high end of the estimates we collected. Sanders also described the overseas holdings as cash. According to one expert we reached, a lot of that money might be invested in factories and other hard infrastructure and might not be available for tax collections. Still, the mid-range estimate from credible sources is in the $500 billion to $550 billion range. All the numbers cited were relatively high. We rate Sanders’ estimate Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1D2340>],/factchecks/2016/apr/11/bernie-sanders/sanders-us-multinationals-would-owe-620-billion-ov/
