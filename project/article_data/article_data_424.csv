No, the COVID-19 test is not going anywhere near your blood-brain barrier
","With 3 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. and counting, tests for COVID-19 are as important as ever. However, the nasal swab tests that determine if a person is actively infected with the virus have become the target of online misinformation. Social media users are circulating a post that claims the nasal swab tests are unsafe. ""The spot where they are ‘getting a sample’ for the COVID-19 test is called your Blood-Brain Barrier,"" the post reads. The post also claims a person could experience a number of other medical complications and conditions after receiving a COVID-19 test if the test compromised the blood-brain barrier. These symptoms include, the post alleges, ""autism, ADD, ADHD, heart disease, autoimmune disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, stroke, liver damage,"" and many more.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence to support these claims, and the Associated Press debunked a similar one. One of the most common COVID-19 tests requires a swab reach ""deep inside a person's nose and throat to extract sputum — the gunk that gets ejected through coughing, sneezing, spitting, and even singing,"" Business Insider reports. ""They have to go deep into the nose, and it’s called the nasopharynx,"" said Dr. Sandro Cinti, a University of Michigan professor who specializes in infectious diseases. Typically, a 6-inch nasopharyngeal swab is inserted ""into the cavity between the nose and mouth … for 15 seconds"" and rotated many times, according to UC Davis Health in California. Once one side of the nose is swabbed, the other side will be swabbed as well. Cinti explained that cells have to be collected to test for the coronavirus.  ""They have to go back there with a swab in order to get adequate cells because viruses live in cells,"" he said. ""So they go back there, and then they have to turn the swab a few times for about 15 seconds, which sounds fast but it’s a lot of time when they’re doing it in your nose."" An article from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center warns that the test can be uncomfortable and create ""a lot of very odd sensations."" This includes making a person tear up or potentially triggering a gag reflex. Getting a COVID-19 nasal test would not cause any serious medical complications. It could cause ""temporary irritation,"" Cinti said. There is no evidence the swab used to test for COVID-19 could compromise the blood-brain barrier. ""It is uncomfortable,"" said Cinti. ""But it doesn’t go anywhere near the blood brain barrier."" The term blood-brain barrier actually refers to ""unique properties"" found in the blood vessels that supply blood to the central nervous system, according to an article from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The blood-brain barrier’s purpose is to prevent pathogens and toxins in the bloodstream from reaching the brain, while also allowing vital nutrients through. Endothelial cells line the interior of blood vessels throughout the body, but ""in the capillaries that form the blood–brain barrier, endothelial cells are wedged extremely close to each other, forming so-called tight junctions,"" according to the Queensland Brain Institute. It is primarily these tightly-packed endothelial cells within the brain’s blood vessels that make up the blood-brain barrier.  It is simply not possible for the nasopharyngeal swabs used in COVID-19 tests to compromise the blood-brain barrier. ""The swab ""would have to go through layers of muscle and fascia, as well as the base of the skull, which is a thick bone, in order to get anywhere near the blood-brain barrier, and I would say that it is not possible,"" Dr. Morgan Katz, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, told the Associated Press. A social media post claimed, ""The spot where they are ‘getting a sample’ for the Covid-19 test is called your Blood-Brain Barrier."" It also went on to claim that after getting a test, a person could develop a number of medical conditions.  The nasal swab COVID-19 tests collect samples from the cavity between the nose and mouth, not the blood-brain barrier. It would not be possible for the 6-inch nasopharyngeal swabs used in COVID-19 tests to compromise the blood-brain barrier, which refers to the tightly packed cells inside the blood vessels of the brain.

Fact-checking the history on Iowa county's namesake
","What do you do when your county is named after a plantation owner from the 19th century who not only owned Black slaves but was married to one, had children with her, and then buried her in an unmarked grave before moving on to other enslaved women? And, this: the county’s namesake was vice president of the United States from 1837-1841. In Johnson County, Iowa, on the state’s east-central side and home of 151,140 people and the University of Iowa, some residents are petitioning to change for whom their county is named.  The Johnson County Board of Supervisors agreed on July 8, 2020, deciding to appoint an ad-hoc committee to determine a way to change the county’s namesake from former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson to someone else. ""Richard Mentor Johnson, a plantation-owning lawyer from Kentucky, inherited from his father an enslaved person named Julia Chinn,"" Ron McMullen, the University of Iowa’s Ambassador in Residence whose service included the U.S. mission in Eritrea, wrote in a June 23 Iowa City Press-Citizen Letter to the Editor. ""He fathered her two daughters; they openly cohabitated until Chinn died of cholera in 1833. Johnson was apparently fond of her, but it is impossible to know how she felt about the arrangement, as owners raped slaves at will.""  McMullen went on to write, as have others, about how Johnson forced himself upon other enslaved females, including a teenager who tried to run away to Canada but was caught and either punished, sold or both. ""That’s Johnson County’s namesake,"" McMullen wrote in his opinion piece. Who was Richard Mentor Johnson, that a county in Iowa would be named after him? How did he become vice president? And, significantly, who was Julia Chinn? First question first: Johnson was vice president under President Martin Van Buren in 1837-1841, before the Civil War. His election was controversial. He had served in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate and supported President Andrew Jackson.  But many in Congress did not like Johnson because he not only had a common law marriage with Julia Chinn, the couple lived openly and had two daughters, Adeline and Imogene. Chinn had a Black great-grandparent but other white ancestors, yet, she was a slave. Rumors existed that they secretly were married by a minister, but interracial marriage was illegal in Kentucky, so Johnson was known as the slave owner and Chinn was the slave. Also going on at that time: slave owners didn’t want their slaves to get ideas about equality, and northerners scorned Johnson’s openness of being with Chinn. Johnson became Van Buren’s vice president when the Electoral College split over four vice presidential candidates, refused to vote for Johnson because of what were called social reasons and forced the Senate to elect him.

""He proved to be a disastrous choice for a job that had virtually no responsibility,"" historian Tim Walch told the Johnson County Board of Supervisors on July 8. American voters showed Van Buren the door after one term when the Electoral College overwhelmingly elected President William Henry Harrison and Vice President John Tyler in 1840. Johnson wasn’t even on Van Buren’s ticket that year, having been dumped in the nomination process. Tyler succeeded Harrison after Harrison’s death a month into office. A record of when Julia Chinn was born does not exist, but she was raised in the Johnson household when Richard Mentor Johnson was young. Johnson inherited her when his father, Colonel Robert Johnson, died in 1815.  
Julia was educated and made sure that her daughters were educated, too, and married white men. Her interracial marriage was tolerated in the open, at least at home if not elsewhere. She died of cholera epidemic in 1833, but no marker exists for where she was buried.   ""The location of her grave has disappeared, just as her very existence was erased from the history books, and from the memories of her own descendants, in a nation still wrestling with its history of slavery and interracial sex,"" historian Amrita Chakrabarti Myers writes. Myers is a Ruth N. Halls Associate Professor of History and Gender Studies at Indiana University in Bloomington. Johnson County, Iowa, was founded in December 1837 and named after Johnson, the sitting vice president but who had no connection to Iowa. The county had been tabbed for Iowa's first capital, in Iowa City. but the capital didn’t stay in town long. The state’s seat of government moved to Des Moines and Iowa City got, instead, the state university. ""It is important to note that county names were often assigned casually and maybe even to some extent strategically, based on when they came into the union,"" Walch, retired director of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library, told Johnson County’s supervisors on July 8. ""And Richard Mentor Johnson, who most people have long forgotten, and perhaps for good reason, was chosen as the namesake for Johnson County, Iowa, just the way Martin Van Buren received the honor of having a county named for him in Van Buren County."" Walch, a Johnson County resident, has edited four books about U.S. presidents and written several books about Iowa history. He said it’s not known whether or not Johnson even knew any county in the United States was named after him, let alone the one in Iowa. ""It’s fully appropriate now, if it can be facilitated through Iowa Code, to change a namesake,"" he said. Interest in the county’s namesake grew in 2020 during the Black Lives Matter movement following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black people by police actions but Johnson County Supervisor Rod Sullivan had proposed changing the county’s name in 2017. ""I think to say it was not well received is an understatement,"" Sullivan said in a 2020 interview with The Daily Iowan. ""I do think there is one item that keeps getting missed. People keep looking at this through the lens of Black Lives Matter, which while appropriate, is only part of the story,"" Sullivan wrote to PolitiFact Iowa in an email. ""When Johnson was running for VP, he had two claims to fame: First, he was said to be the man who had killed more Native Americans than any other person. Secondly, he was said to have killed Tecumseh. Frankly, no one knows if either is true. But either way, it struck me as sickening."" Changing the county’s name would be difficult for a lot of reasons, but Ambassador Ron McMullen suggested a different tack: change for whom the county is named. His suggestion is that county supervisors revoke the county’s name but then instantly rename it Johnson County after someone else whose last name is Johnson.  One of McMullen’s foreign services posts had been in post-apartheid South Africa, where buildings named for white oppressors during apartheid -- legal segregation and discrimination -- were changed. ""Some name changes avoided controversy -- D.F. Malan International Airport became Cape Town International Airport, for example,"" McMullen wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. ""Not all were this non-controversial. Unity rather than divisiveness should be the rule of thumb here."" University of Iowa Archivist David McCartney has suggested Lulu Merle Johnson and created a Change.org petition for that change. She was an Iowa native, the first Black woman to earn a doctorate at the UI, and the second Black woman in the nation to earn a doctorate in history. Her dissertation was titled, ""The Problem of Slavery in the Old Northwest, 1787-1858."" Johnson taught history at several colleges until retiring in 1971. McCartney told PolitiFact Iowa he was motivated, in part, by McMullen’s letter to the editor but that he also had known of Lulu Johnson’s work in his role as an archivist. ""She died in 1995,"" he wrote in an email, ""and though I didn't have the opportunity to meet her, my understanding is that she was a remarkable lifelong educator and advocate for educational opportunities."" The Iowa Constitution does not state how a county should be named, only that its size should not have have ""less than four hundred and thirty two square miles; nor shall the territory of any organized county be reduced below that area; except the County of Worth, and the counties west of it, along the Northern boundary of this State, may be organized without additional territory.""  While all five Johnson County supervisors say they favor having the county named for someone other than the former vice president, Walch and Johnson County Attorney Janet Lyness said they’ve found nothing in state law or Constitution guiding how a county is named. Lyness said she would do more research. McMullen says he’s fine with Lulu Merle Johnson but that he’s heard other worthy potential namesakes, too. Lulu Merle Johnson drew a lot of initial support at the July 8 supervisors meeting. ""I don't have a particular preference, apart from getting Richard Mentor Johnson ‘de-designated,’"" McMullen told PolitiFact Iowa in an email. ""The Supervisors even might follow Martin van Buren's lead and decide to ‘de-designate’ but not pick a new namesake -- van Buren ditched RMJ as his running mate in 1840 and ran for re-election without a named vice presidential ticket-mate."" We’ll pass on the merits of changing the county’s name because it involves a political decision. But the statement that started a petition drive and built on concerns about the disgraced, former vice president -- that Johnson kept an enslaved wife and children and forced himself upon other Black female slaves -- happened. Historians tell us it was quite a scandal, albeit for different, race-based reasons than it would today. We rate the statement to be True. ",/factchecks/2020/jul/08/ron-mcmullen/fact-checking-history-iowa-countys-namesake/

Video shows outdated face mask guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci
","A video showing Dr. Anthony Fauci telling people not to wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is being taken out of context on social media. It’s an outdated video that ignores the fact that the CDC and Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, both recommend most people wear face masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. The video post from June 24 was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It shows footage from CBS’ ""60 Minutes"" on March 8, when Fauci said that, in general, people did not need to wear masks when they went outside. The video is framed by the words, ""Dr. Fauci: No reason to be wearing a mask.""  The 40-second clip starts off with Fauci saying, ""Right now, people should not be walking, there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask."" He said masks do not provide the ""perfect protection"" against contracting the virus that people think. The clip ends with Fauci saying, ""When you think masks, you should think of healthcare providers needing them."" The clip ends with Fauci wearing a mask. The Facebook user who posted this video in June said Americans are ""being toyed with."" It is not apparent to many viewers that Fauci’s statements were cherry-picked, and the video is four months old. The clip left out, for instance, one reason Fauci gave for some Americans wearing a mask: ""The masks are important for someone who’s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else.""  A lot changed after that interview. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. spiked in April and reached new all-time highs in late June and early July, according to Johns Hopkins University. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted its recommendations on face coverings for people over 2 years old when leaving their household. While the CDC previously discouraged people who weren’t showing symptoms from wearing face coverings, the agency said the switch came after studies about virus transmission by people who are asymptomatic. In a June interview with TheStreet, a financial news website, Fauci said that wearing a mask is better than not wearing one because it can prevent a person from infecting someone else through droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking loudly, for example. Fauci also said that masks can protect, ""to a certain degree,"" the person wearing a mask from getting infected. Fauci said that public health officials previously stated that face coverings weren’t necessary because they were concerned about a shortage for those who need them most, like medical professionals. ""Right now, unequivocally, the recommendation is when you’re out there, particularly if you’re in a situation where there’s active infection, keep the distance physically and wear a mask,"" he said on TheStreet. A viral Facebook post shows Fauci saying people did not need to be wearing face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is framed by text that says, ""Dr. Fauci: No reason to be wearing a mask."" The undated clip lacks significant context. The interview happened in March, amid shortfalls of face masks for hospital workers. The CDC and Fauci have since shifted their recommendations on face masks amid rising coronavirus cases, saying that most people should wear face coverings in public spaces to reduce the spread of the virus.  The all-caps summary text is an oversimplification of what Fauci said. He was speaking generally when he said people did not need to be wearing a mask in public in March. However, Fauci said in the same interview that infected people should wear a mask to prevent other people from catching the virus. The clip leaves that out. The video contains an element of truth but leaves the wrong impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/08/facebook-posts/video-shows-outdated-face-mask-guidance-dr-anthony/

It’s not against the law to carry a firearm while wearing a face mask

It shows a fictional exchange between Hart and Reeves. ""STOP! You have to wear a mask in here,"" the comedian says in the meme. ""I can’t, it’s a class 4 felony violating section 24-1(a)(9) prohibiting a mask while carrying a gun,"" the actor responds. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar posts have been shared tens of thousands of times, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool. (Screenshot from Facebook) We’ve previously fact-checked inaccurate claims about face mask rules and concealed-weapon laws, so we wanted to investigate this Facebook post. There is no federal law that bans carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask. The Facebook post comes from a blog post about an Illinois statute that prohibits carrying a firearm while wearing a face covering. But the Illinois State Police said that law does not apply to lawful concealed-weapon permit holders who abide by the state's COVID-19 mask requirements. The claim stems from an April 25 article on a website called Illinois Leaks. Illinois Leaks is run by the Edgar County Watchdogs, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization that aims to expose government corruption and waste. The article focuses on Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker’s April 30 executive order, which required the public to wear face coverings in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The order went into effect May 1. Illinois Leaks wrote that the order either ""strips a gun owner of his rights while complying with the executive order to wear a mask, or makes them a criminal if they exercise their gun rights while complying with the executive order to wear a mask."" It does neither of those things. The source of the Illinois Leaks article is a state statute that says it’s illegal for someone to carry a gun when ""hooded, robed or masked in such manner as to conceal his or her identity."" Violating that law is punishable by a class four felony, which comes with a maximum prison sentence of three years, or six years for an extended term. On its face, the article seems to have a point about the letter of the law and Pritzker’s executive order. But the spirit of those rules paints a different picture. A statement published in late April by the Illinois State Police says the executive order ""was not intended to negatively impact permit holders under the Illinois Concealed Carry Act while legally carrying firearms."" ""The executive order does not require or suggest that law enforcement should arrest or criminally charge conceal carry license permit holders for wearing protective masks while in public as long as they are complying with the other provisions of the Illinois Concealed Carry Act and are not committing any other violations of Illinois law,"" the state police said. The Illinois attorney general’s office told us that it would be up to the discretion of local prosecutors whether to bring charges against someone for violating the statute. The state police said in its statement that it expects police officers ""will use appropriate judgment"" and state’s attorneys ""will likewise exercise sound prosecutorial discretion.""  RELATED: No, wearing a mask doesn’t void concealed-carry permit According to some tallies, about 15 states, as well as cities and counties, have anti-mask laws on the books that pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. Some states, especially those in the South, enacted those laws around the turn of the century to combat the Ku Klux Klan, whose members don white hoods. One of those laws is in North Carolina. It prohibits people from covering their faces in public, but that law is currently suspended and does not mention firearms at all. We couldn’t find any other state where wearing a protective mask while carrying a concealed weapon is currently banned. A Facebook post says wearing a face mask while carrying a firearm in public is a class four felony. There is no federal law that bans carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask. There is a law against being ""hooded, robed or masked"" while carrying a gun in Illinois, but the Illinois State Police said the state’s COVID-19 mask requirements do not require law enforcement to arrest lawful concealed-weapon permit holders.

NRSC distorts Gary Peters’ record on veterans issues
","The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) launched the website profiteeringpeters.com as part of its campaign to unseat Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) this upcoming election. The website attacks Peters’ record on veterans issues.  Peters is a veteran himself and, in 2017, Vietnam Veterans of America called Peters ""Legislator of the Year."" But, the NRSC warns voters that Peters’ reputation as a champion for veterans belies his record. The NRSC’s list of attacks is long: ""Peters fought against funding for the VA, veterans housing programs, military pay raises, and health care and research for veterans and their families. He also fought against funding for processing veterans’ disability claims."" The NRSC repeats its claims that Peters fought against veterans housing and funding for disabled veterans as well as opposed military pay raises in a TV ad.  The attacks are misleading. The NRSC’s claims distort or ignore votes Peters has cast as a member of Congress and his own efforts to introduce and sponsor legislation to support veterans.  The NRSC disagreed with the findings of this FactCheck and defended its claims. ""It is unfortunate that the Detroit Free Press is using Democrat talking points to carry water for Gary Peters’ Senate campaign,"" said NRSC spokesperson Nathan Brand in response to a request for comment.  The NRSC points to instances when Peters voted against bills appropriating funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). But during his time both in the U.S. House and Senate, Peters has consistently supported the final passage of legislation funding the department.  The NRSC noted that in 2015, Peters voted against ending debate on an appropriations bill that the American Legion and President Obama said underfunded the VA. But Peters ultimately supported the final bill, which included a significant increase in funding for the department from the previous fiscal year. The NRSC also said that in 2016, Peters voted three times against shutting off debate on a conference report combining the House- and Senate-passed versions of an appropriations bill that would have restricted funding for family planning services. Preceding these votes, however, Peters supported the Senate-passed version of the bill that actually proposed a higher level of funding for the VA than the conference report.  After the conference report failed, the Senate considered another appropriations bill funding the VA that Peters voted against. Peters said he could not support the bill because it did not include any assistance for Flint residents during the city’s water crisis.  This was the second time Peters voted against a final appropriations bill funding the VA. In 2013, Peters — along with many Democrats — voted against a bill that contained large spending cuts across the U.S. government, including funding for implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  Besides these two votes, Peters has supported every appropriations bill funding the VA. During Peters’ time in Congress, the VA budget has grown considerably.  To support the claim that Peters fought against veterans housing programs, the NRSC points to Peters’ participation in a group that aimed to reduce the government’s deficit in 2010. Peters’ group wanted to introduce an amendment rolling back proposed spending for a veterans housing initiative contained in the House appropriations bill that year.  C.J. Warnke, the press secretary for Peters’ re-election campaign, said the program under consideration was the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Veterans Affairs and Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program, which provides housing and case management support for chronically homeless veterans.  HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan did not request funding for HUD-VASH, and Obama’s own budget that year did not include funding for the program.  The House appropriations bill, however, set aside additional funding for HUD-VASH, and at the urging of Democratic party leaders, Peters decided not to offer an amendment cutting the proposed funding for the program.  More recently, however, Peters has expressed explicit support for funding HUD-VASH. Ahead of the 2020 appropriations process, Peters signed on to a letter requesting funding for the program.  Peters has also requested funding for other veterans housing programs. Ahead of the last four appropriations cycles, Peters requested ""robust funding"" for the VA’s State Home Construction Grant Program, which provides financial support to state facilities for elderly veterans.  The NRSC notes that in the summer of 2016, Peters voted twice against shutting off debate on a Defense Department appropriations bill proposing a 2.1% pay raise for military personnel. However, several months later, Peters supported the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which included the same proposed pay raise.  With one exception, Peters has voted for every NDAA containing a military pay increase since he has been in Congress. The past four fiscal years have included military pay increases greater than 2%. In 2012, Peters voted against the NDAA, which included a 1.7% military pay increase. That year, Peters submitted a statement noting his opposition, including his concerns with the direction of the war in Afghanistan.  As a member of the Senate’s Armed Services Committee, Peters just recently voted to advance the NDAA for fiscal year 2021 to the Senate floor with a proposed 3% military pay raise.  The NRSC supports the claim that Peters has ""fought"" against funding for health care and research for veterans and their families by pointing to Peters’ 2016 vote against a final appropriations bill. While Peters noted his support for funding the VA, he opposed it because it did not contain aid for Flint residents. In addition to the VA appropriations bills Peters has supported, which have included funding for the Veterans Health Administration, Peters has co-sponsored legislation that proposes additional funding and services to meet the health care needs of women veterans. Funding for processing veterans’ disability claims The NRSC cites Peters’s vote against a joint resolution proposing appropriations for the 2014 fiscal year as evidence that he fought funding for processing veterans’ disability claims. The resolution proposed nearly $2.5 billion for the Veterans Benefits Administration, which oversees the department’s disability compensation program.  Peters was among the overwhelming majority of Democrats who voted against the resolution because it prohibited the use of federal funds to carry out the ACA.  But Peters ultimately supported the appropriations bill Obama signed into law that included the original $2.5 billion for the Veterans Benefits Administration.  Peters has also supported legislation to increase funding and expand eligibility for the VA’s disability compensation program.  In 2015, Peters co-sponsored the Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2015 to increase veterans’ disability compensation. In 2016, the companion House bill was ultimately passed by Congress and became law.  And in December 2019, Peters voted for a bill that included $125 million for processing disability claims from Vietnam War veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Peters had earlier co-sponsored legislation that expanded disability compensation to such veterans.  The NRSC claims that ""Peters fought against funding for the VA, veterans housing programs, military pay raises, and health care and research for veterans and their families. He also fought against funding for processing veterans’ disability claims."" Peters’ record reveals otherwise.  The NRSC’s statements rest on a handful of votes that don’t reflect Peters’ actual positions on the issues. Peters has supported the final passage of every bill funding the VA and its housing, health care, and disability compensation programs with the exception of two votes. One vote was because Democrats opposed spending cuts; another was because Peters wanted assistance for the Flint water crisis that wasn’t included.   Peters has also voted for every Defense Authorization Act that included a military pay raise with one exception because he was opposed to the direction of the war in Afghanistan.  Overall, the claims are not accurate. We rate its claims False. ",/factchecks/2020/jul/08/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-distorts-gary-peters-record-veterans-issues/

What’s the President’s Daily Brief? Not ‘like a mini novel,’ as Fox News host says
","Reports that Russia offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan have shined a new light on the daily intelligence report prepared before dawn for the president — and President Donald Trump’s willingness to engage with it. The White House has said Trump was never orally briefed on the threat, but warnings that a Russian intelligence unit placed bounties on American forces appeared in the President’s Daily Brief, called the PDB, according to multiple news reports.  The New York Times and Politico reported that the information was in a February PDB. The Associated Press said it appeared in 2019. Trump is not known to look through the PDB regularly or read it to completion, as several news organizations have reported since he took office in 2017. He relies instead on oral briefings that he receives from intelligence officials every few days. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton wrote in his recently released memoir that ""Trump generally had only two intelligence briefings per week, and in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand."" Now, as questions mount about Trump’s intelligence consumption habits — and whether he read the brief that discussed the Russian bounties — some of his cable news allies have stepped to his defense, suggesting the PDB documents are extraordinarily long. ""The president gets a President’s Daily Brief, which is like a mini novel, every single day,"" said ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Brian Kilmeade. ""So he gets verbally briefed, the highlights."" Kilmeade may have accurately described how Trump gets his intelligence information. But his claim that the brief is ""like a mini novel"" mischaracterizes the length and style of the classified document that is meant to keep the president up to speed on critical national security matters. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Fox News declined to comment. The PDB is a summary of high-level information and analysis on national security issues that is prepared daily for the president and other designated members of his administration, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  The final product weaves together material provided by spies, surveillance, satellites, news reports and other sources of intelligence gathering. ""It gets the president spun up on relevant national security issues not only for that day, but for the week, month, or even year ahead,"" said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation and former intelligence official who served in 2011 on the CIA staff that helped prepare the PDB for President Barack Obama. A version of the PDB has been furnished for every president since 1946, when President Harry Truman received what was then known as the Daily Summary, according to a history from the CIA. A number of PDBs from presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford have been declassified and are available on the CIA’s website. Today, the PDB is prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence with the help of the CIA. Presidents are also assigned briefers who address any questions they have. Beth Sanner, the office’s deputy director of national intelligence for mission integration, regularly briefs Trump, reports say. The style and format of the PDB have varied from one administration to the next based on each president’s preferences, experts said. Obama was the first to request a digital version. There is no set length for the PDB, but it has rarely been less than one page or longer than 25 pages, said David Priess, a former CIA intelligence briefer under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and the author of ""The President’s Book of Secrets,"" a history of the PDB. Jeffrey T. Richelson, who was a senior fellow at George Washington University’s National Security Archive, wrote in a 2016 book on the intelligence community that the PDB was ""rather lengthy"" under Ford but ""reduced to a maximum of about 15 pages under Jimmy Carter."" The PDB shrank to between nine and 12 pages under Clinton and then consisted of a half dozen or so one- to two-page articles under Bush, wrote Richelson, who died in 2017.  This April 10, 2004, photo shows a copy on display in Crawford, Texas, of the first page of the declassified brief that President George W. Bush received August 6, 2001, on terrorist threats. (AP) Nixon is the last president who may have skipped reading the PDB, Priess said on Twitter. Before Trump took office, he claimed — falsely — that Obama didn’t read his PDB. Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center for three years in the Obama administration, said he typically got through the version of the PDB he received in a few minutes. The brief is divided into ""articles,"" which Olsen said are often bulleted and cover various issues. ""The PDB articles were very staccato, short-form,"" Olsen said. ""I’d say a page, sometimes a page and a half. And just a handful of articles made the cut to be (in) the PDB on a given day."" The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and CIA declined to comment on the makeup of Trump’s written PDB. Citing two anonymous administration sources, USA Today reported that it can be anywhere from 18 to 75 pages and often features graphics, charts and bullets.  Trump told Axios before taking office, ""I like bullets or I like as little as possible."" ""My understanding is that the current PDB is comprised of very few words and mostly contains graphics to more effectively engage the president,"" said Grossman, the RAND analyst. While PDB articles can be dense, they don’t likely approach the length of novels and novellas. The PDB’s shorter length, coupled with the fact that it binds together reports on various issue areas, suggests that it would be more comparable in complexity to a magazine.  Multiple awards for works of science fiction consider novels to be greater than 40,000 words and novellas over roughly 17,000 words, for example. The PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction accepts only submissions over 80,000 words as novels. Grossman said he would not characterize the PDB as a ""mini novel,"" as Kilmeade did. ""The PDB is a series of articles (or graphics) that tell distinct and self-contained stories for the president and other recipients,"" Grossman said in an email. The PDB is ""definitely not a mini novel,"" added Olsen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. ""It’s written for somebody who is a busy person."" Kilmeade said the President’s Daily Brief ""is like a mini novel."" The PDB is the primary written intelligence product prepared for the president each working day. Little is known about the contents of Trump’s PDB, which reports say he doesn’t always read.  The top-secret document is written for quick consumption, experts said. It is not as long as a typical novel or novella. We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/07/brian-kilmeade/whats-presidents-daily-brief-not-mini-novel-fox-ne/

DNC calls out Romney’s evolving affection for Reagan
","
The Democratic National Committee is beating the flip-flop drum to attack Mitt Romney. A four-minute DNC video ad accuses the Republican presidential candidate of switching positions on a host of issues including President Barack Obama’s job stimulus package, abortion, global warming and health care reform.

Another topic on which the DNC says Romney pulled a switcharoo: his support for former President Ronald Reagan.

The ad, released Nov. 28, 2011, juxtaposes two clips of Romney talking. In the first, he says, ""I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.""

Next, he’s standing at a podium saying, ""The principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.""

It’s wrapped up with a clip of Reagan himself chuckling and saying, ""There you go again.""

We’re looking separately at several claims in the ad. Here we ask, is Romney really a flipper when it comes to the Gipper?

The video evidence

The DNC provided us with a fact sheet laying out the source of each claim in the ad. The first clip of Romney, in which he seemed to be distancing himself from Reagan, comes from a 1994 debate when Romney was challenging the late Edward Kennedy in a race for U.S. Senate.

The two were having a mostly philosophical discussion about poverty and families with Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claiming that child poverty rates rose when Republicans occupied the White House.

""Under the Reagan/Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know we’ve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs,"" Kennedy said. ""If you’re not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, you’re going to see the breakdown of the family as well.""

Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldn’t be used to score ""political hits,"" prompting Romney to fire back that he wasn’t politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was.

""I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all. I talked about what I’d do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush,"" Romney said, distancing himself from the popular former president.

In the second clip, Romney was speaking at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., in May 2010. He was talking about America’s position in the world.

""I have to tell you that I’m optimistic. I’m optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.""

Romney was interrupted by applause, and then continued by elaborating on policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families.

So the two clips are as the DNC presented them in the ad. They are not covertly edited or cut to leave a false impression about what Romney said.

But is it a flip flop?

The DNC ad is titled ""Mitt v. Mitt, The story of two men trapped in one body.""

It opens with ominous-sounding music and white letters on a black background saying, ""He wants to be president"" followed by ""but what does he really believe?"" Then a voice in the background asks, ""Who is this guy? Can you trust him?"" and the Romney images unfold.

The ad’s overt message is that Romney has changed his position on numerous issues, and that makes him an untrustworthy candidate.

But the Reagan matter is not so simple as a candidate voting in favor of a concrete issue, then voting against it. We looked and couldn’t find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan, beyond the 1994 debate comment. Prior to 1994, Romney was a businessman, not a politician.

It’s true that Romney was not registered with any party for several years in Massachusetts, and in 1992, he voted for former Sen. Paul Tsongas, a liberal Democrat, in the Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary, according to a McClatchy newspapers story. (Romney’s spokesman responded then ""that the vote for Tsongas was a vote against Bill Clinton and that not enrolling in either major party was common in Massachusetts."")

Later, during his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bush’s tax cuts.

""That's failing Reagan 101,"" Romney said, holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire.

In a debate that year, he was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, ""I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan.""

In the 2010 Reagan library address, Romney had more flattering words for the former president. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased ""that wonderful line"" of Reagan’s:

""(Reagan) said, ‘of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong.’ And he’s absolutely right,"" Romney said.

And again in that speech, Romney approvingly quoted Reagan taking a jab at the left, recalling Reagan’s words, ""it isn’t that liberals are ignorant, it’s just that what they know is wrong.""

Our ruling

The DNC ad casts Romney as a flip-flopper on his support for the policies of former President Reagan. In the first clip, Romney in 1994, as a candidate running against a liberal icon in a liberal state, says he’s ""not trying to return to Reagan-Bush."" Then, 13 years later, he’s speaking approvingly of the former president saying that Reagan’s principles ""are as true today as they were when he spoke them."" Romney’s affection for Reagan’s presidency has grown warmer over the years and as he appealed to a different electorate. In 1994, Romney needed to win votes from the middle while gunning for the Massachusetts Senate seat. Running for the Republican nomination for president, it’s politically wise for him (and any Republican presidential candidate) to speak glowingly of Reagan.

DNC ad accuses Mitt Romney of flip-flopping on assault-weapons ban
","
On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues. 
For this item, we’ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on an assault weapons ban. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items. 
Here’s the relevant portion from the DNC ad: 
Screen text: For assault weapons ban 
Video clip of Romney speaking: ""I just signed a piece of legislation extending the ban on certain assault weapons."" 
Screen text: Against assault weapons ban 
Video clip of Romney speaking: ""I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature."" 
We previously ruled Mostly True a charge by Republican candidate Jon Huntsman that Romney flip-flopped on gun control. But Huntsman’s charge was broader than the DNC’s, so we’ll take a look specifically at Romney’s views on assault-weapons bans. 
Using supporting material provided by the DNC, we went to the sources of both clips in the ad. The first clip came from the Aug. 4, 2004, edition of the Fox News program Hannity and Colmes. That interview was conducted roughly halfway through Romney’s single term as governor of Massachusetts. The second clip came from a Republican presidential debate held on Jan. 24, 2008, in Boca Raton, Fla. By then, Romney had left the governor’s office and was running for president. 
Upon reviewing this material, we find that the DNC’s choices for the specific quote and counter-quote in the ad are problematic. But we also found that other evidence not cited in the ad provides support for the notion that Romney has taken muddled positions on Second Amendment issues. 
The Massachusetts bill 
As we evaluate this claim, it’s important to know that when he was governor, Romney signed legislation that extended an existing assault weapons ban in Massachusetts. 
The 2004 bill enacted a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense,"" the Boston Globe quoted Romney as saying at the time. ""They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people."" 
Despite the assault-weapons provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry firearms. On more than one occasion, Romney described the bill as a ""consensus"" measure. 
The 2004 interview 
Now, let’s look at the full context of the clips shown in the DNC ad. 
In the Hannity and Colmes clip, guest co-host Pat Halpin asked Romney about the existing federal assault weapons ban, which was then on a path to expiring due to intentional Republican inaction. ""So are you in favor of that ban being extended or do you want to see it lapse?"" 
Romney responded, ""I believe the people should have the right to bear arms, but I don't believe that we have to have assault weapons as part of our personal arsenal. … In my state I just signed a piece of legislation extending the ban on certain assault weapons in our state."" 
Halpin continued to prod. ""Governor, would you like to see that extended again on the federal level, as well?"" she asked. 
Romney replied, ""It very well may be. In our state what we did is we got both sides of this issue to come together, because we relaxed a number of things, allowing people who hadn't been able to get weapons in the past to be able to purchase those. … There are hunters in the NRA and the gun owners' action league (who) backed the legislation that said, ‘Look, let's protect our citizens from dangerous assault weapons, but let's also make … regular weapons more available to our citizens.’ And we made a compromise that works."" 
Our takeaway is that Romney, at that moment, was arguing that ordinary Americans have the right to bear some types of arms but not assault weapons. He said it ""very well may be necessary"" to extend the federal assault-weapons ban, while adding that he acted on the state ban because it also included expansions on other types of gun ownership rules. 
The 2008 interview 
Fast-forward to the debate in 2008, when fellow Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee challenged Romney on his views about gun control. Huckabee asked, ""Do you support the assault weapon ban? And (what is) your position on exactly what restrictions government should put on Second Amendment rights?"" 
Here’s Romney’s full response: 
""I do support the Second Amendment. And I believe that this is an individual right of citizens and not a right of government. And I hope the Supreme Court reaches that same conclusion. 
""I also, like the president, would have signed the assault weapon ban that came to his desk. I said I would have supported that and signed a similar bill in our state. It was a bill worked out, by the way, between pro-gun lobby and anti-gun lobby individuals. Both sides of the issue came together and found a way to provide relaxation in licensing requirements and allow more people to have guns for their own legal purposes. And so we signed that in Massachusetts, and I said I would support that at the federal level, just as the president said he would. It did not pass at the federal level. I do not believe we need new legislation. 
""I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people. But I do not support any new legislation, and I do support the right of individuals to bear arms, whether for hunting purposes or for protection purposes or any other reason. That's the right that people have."" 
If you look closely, the DNC ad quoted one portion of Romney’s statement -- ""I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons"" -- that seemingly contradicted his support for the 2004 assault-weapons ban extension. But the DNC ad could just as easily have quoted portions of the statement that were consistent with Romney’s 2004 position -- specifically, that he ""would have signed the (federal) assault weapon ban,"" and that he ""signed a similar bill in our state."" 
The reality is that Romney’s answer in the debate was unfocused, even self-contradictory. He said that he would have signed a federal assault ban extension -- but he added that after it failed on the federal level, he felt he did not believe new legislation was necessary. 
Our ruling 
The DNC ad has some problems. It uses some deceptive editing, and it ignores the fact that Romney was pretty consistent in both of the comments to frame his support for an assault-weapons ban in the context of a compromise that also expanded other types of gun rights. 
The difficulty of analyzing this charge is that Romney's position on an assault-weapons ban in the 2008 debate was so muddled that it's hard to pin down whether he actually flip-flopped. It's more an example of an internal inconsistency than a flip-flop per se. In fact, the DNC might have made a more convincing argument simply by quoting the confilcting parts of Romney’s 2008 debate comment. 
So the DNC made some procedural missteps, but it's on to something about Romney's delicate dance on gun control. On balance, we rate the DNC’s charge Half True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/29/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-accuses-mitt-romney-flip-flopping-assault-w/

Did Gingrich say he supports amnesty for all illegal immigrants?
","
Former Georgia congressman and U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s rise in the Republican presidential polls has prompted some of his fellow GOP contenders to find ways to knock him off his newfound perch.

U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota criticized Gingrich’s position on immigration during a television interview on the PBS program ""NewsHour"" the day after the Republican candidates gathered for a debate on national security issues. Gingrich made headlines for what he described during the debate as his ""humane"" -- and critics call his soft -- approach on immigration.

""[Gingrich] has said that we should make the 11 million illegal workers that are in this country legal,"" Bachmann said.

Bachmann then argued that Gingrich ""probably has the most liberal position on illegal immigration of any of the candidates in the race.""

We wondered about what Bachmann claimed Gingrich said since he seemed to say something different during the Nov. 22 debate on CNN.

""I don't see how the party that says it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century,"" Gingrich said at the debate. ""And I'm prepared to take the heat for saying, 'Let's be humane in enforcing the law without giving them citizenship but by finding a way to create legality so that they are not separated from their families.' ""

Bachmann’s campaign website has a link to an article that seems to defend her statement on PBS. The December 2010 article, on Fox Nation news website, has a quote from Gingrich using the 11 million illegal immigrant number.

""We are not going to deport 11 million people,"" Gingrich is quoted as saying at a forum on Latino issues. ""There has to be some zone between deportation and amnesty.""

Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond pointed to the latter part of the candidate’s quote to argue Bachmann’s claim was misleading.

""Newt's quote about the need for a zone between deportation and [amnesty] is proof alone Bachmann's claim is false, an outright lie,"" Hammond told us via e-mail.

The Fox Nation article quotes Gingrich as saying his position is ""not a call for amnesty.""

On his campaign website, Gingrich has a 10-step plan on immigration. He talks about creating a system of committees that would determine which illegal immigrants can stay and which ones must return to their homeland. Gingrich also says illegal immigrants who are criminals and/or gang members should be deported promptly.

""We need a path to legality, but not citizenship, for some of these individuals who have deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties,"" Gingrich wrote. ""We also need a path to swift but dignified repatriation for those who are transient and have no roots in America.""

We sent a request for comment to Bachmann’s campaign but got no response.

Bachmann defended her position in a statement she released to news outlets last weekend. CNN reported the statement included a letter signed by Gingrich and 14 other conservatives in 2004 that was published in The Wall Street Journal that supported then-President George W. Bush’s guest worker program.

""The president has shown courage by calling on Congress to place reality over rhetoric and recognize that those already working here outside the law are unlikely to leave,"" the letter states. ""Congress can fulfill its role by establishing sufficient increases in legal immigration and paths to permanent residence to enable more workers to stay, assimilate, and become part of America.""

Bachmann said in her statement: ""I don’t agree that you should make 11 million workers legal here because that in effect is amnesty and will only encourage more illegal immigrants to come here.""

Gingrich -- through his comments at the CNN debate, his website and by signing the 2004 letter -- believes there are some illegal immigrants working in the United States who should be provided a path to legal status and others should be deported. He has not said all illegal immigrants working here ""should be made legal.""

Bachmann has implied something different when she said Gingrich ""has said that we should make the 11 million illegal workers that are in this country legal."" She has transformed Gingrich’s nuanced statement into an all-or-nothing pronouncement. And she has done so to win favor with a sector of the GOP base opposed to any compromise on illegal immigration.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich says key legislation has won bipartisan support
","
Gov. John Kasich often laments how partisan Ohio politics have become. The Republican leader typically blames Democrats for not having an open mind to at least consider his ideas.

Democrats, of course, beg to differ. They blame what they call the governor’s ultra-conservative agenda for causing needless division. And at the top of their list is Senate Bill 5, the controversial collective bargaining law that voters overwhelmingly chose to repeal earlier this month.

There’s no doubt that SB5, from the time it was introduced in February, has been the most divisive piece of legislation the state has seen in years.

After a bitter referendum campaign launched by Democrats and unions, voters trounced the Kasich-backed law on Nov. 8 by 22 points.

Since then, the governor has tried to quickly turn the page. He still won’t talk much about the defeat. But he is trying to heal the divide by reminding Ohioans that partisanship has not always ruled the day during his first 10 months in office.

""We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis,"" Kasich said on Election Night, conceding the loss of Issue 2, the Senate Bill 5 referendum. ""And you all know that I’m interested in trying to do things as often as we can with members of the other party.""

Was Kasich giving an accurate picture of the record, or was he trying to limit the potential political fallout from losing on a signature piece of legislation? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check.

Certainly, Republicans and Democrats have been far apart on a number of initiatives the governor has ushered through with the help of a compliant GOP-controlled legislature, including his controversial state budget that cut aid to schools and communities. Democrats also have opposed Kasich’s efforts to privatize some state operations, and they panned the governor’s rejection of more than $400 million in federal funding for a new passenger train system.

But Kasich will tell you that he has won bipartisan support on his proposals for prison sentencing reform, business regulatory reforms, business tax credits, and reining in so-called prescription pill mills. And indeed he has.

— House Bill 93 cracks down on pain management clinics and punishes doctors who over-prescribe prescription medication, a huge problem in Southern Ohio. Both the Ohio House and Senate unanimously passed the bill, which Kasich has signed into law.

— House Bill 86 will allow some felons to get out of prison early and others to skip prison altogether. Judges will have the discretion to send non-violent offenders to halfway houses instead of prisons and some felons who have served at least 80 percent of their sentences can be released. It passed the Senate 30 to 3 and the House 87 to 9, with support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

— House Bill 58 expands the job retention tax credit program and allows for other tax incentives for businesses. The governor used this program to help keep American Greetings in Northeast Ohio after the company said it was considering moving its headquarters to Illinois. With an emergency clause to allow the bill to become law immediately, it passed the Senate 31 to 1 and House 89 to 6.

The governor’s regulatory reform measure that, among other things, requires state agencies with a role in economic development to review and adjust rules that are considered a hindrance to business development, and his JobsOhio program that turns job creation over to a private board appointed by the governor also both received bipartisan support.

These are significant pieces of legislation. And each received a healthy dose of Democratic, as well as Republican, support. Some Ohioans may have forgotten about these new laws, which no one is trying to repeal. But the governor has not.

Did Mitt Romney flip-flop on health care reform? DNC says so
","
A 30-second ad from the Democratic National Committee mocks Republican candidate Mitt Romney for changing position.

""Two men trapped in one body. Mitt vs. Mitt,"" the ad proclaims, adding, ""Two Mitts willing to say anything.""

The ad highlights Romney’s former positions on abortion and health care, and teases to a web site the Democrats have created, MittvMitt.com, which claims to document even more changes on policy.

Here, we’re fact-checking the ad’s claims about health care. As governor of Massachusetts in 2006, Romney signed a law that intended for every Massachusetts resident to have health insurance.

As we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, the national health care law that President Barack Obama signed in 2010 bears a strong resemblance to the earlier Massachusetts law. Both plans leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. The plans reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering subsidies to help those with modest incomes buy insurance. When the plans are fully in place, everyone must have insurance or pay a penalty, a requirement called the ""individual mandate."" Employers that don't offer health insurance to their employees will have to pay fines, with exceptions for small businesses and a few other cases.

In interviews after the law passed, Romney said that the ideas in the state plan could be used in other states or even nationally.

""This is a Democratic ideal, which is getting health care for everybody but achieved in a Republican way, which is reforming the private marketplace and insisting on personal responsibility,"" Romney said in an interview with the Associated Press in 2006.

The DNC video shows two clips of Romney speaking. The first says, ""We put together an exchange, and the president’s copying that idea. I’m glad to hear that."" Words on the screen say ""pro-health reform.""

In the second clip Romney says, ""Obamacare is bad news."" Text says ""anti-health reform.""

So was Romney for health care reform before he was against it? We decided to check it out.

Romney’s supposedly positive comments on health reform are from an interview with CBS News in June 2009. Romney did say that he was glad the national law included an exchange, but he also had pointed criticism for Obama’s plan.

He was particularly critical of creating a government-run health insurance plan, the so-called ""public option.""

""One thing we did not do was put in place a government insurance program. We did not have a government plan where people bought government insurance. That’s a mistake. Going down that road would mean, down the road, hundreds of billions of dollars of additional costs,"" he said in the CBS interview.

Throughout 2009, much of Romney’s criticism of the health care law focused on the public option. In his book No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, which was released in early 2010 before the law’s final passage, he said the public option was ""simply a transitional step"" toward the creation of a single-payer health care system. (A single-payer system is one in which government pays the bills for health care using tax revenues. Medicare, the government health insurance program for those over 65, is an example.)

The public option became moot, though. A government-run health insurance option wasn’t popular enough among Democrats in the U.S. Senate, so it didn’t make it into the final version of the health care law.

Still, the demise of the public option did not cause Romney to embrace the law. Instead, he has continued to criticize Obama’s plan as an overreach of federal power. Health care reform should be left to the states, he has said.

""Our plan was a state solution to a state problem, and his is a power grab by the federal government to put in place a one-size-fits-all plan across the nation,"" Romney said in Michigan in May 2011, when he gave an extended presentation on his views on health care.

Our ruling

It’s true that the law Romney signed in Massachusetts in 2006 looks a great deal like the federal law Obama signed in 2010.

But the video implies that Romney supported the federal law. We looked, but we couldn’t find any instances when Romney endorsed the federal law. Instead, we found Romney criticized Obama’s plan repeatedly, usually over the public option. After the public option was left out of the law, Romney still criticized the law as a federal power grab.

Democrats could make an argument that Romney has changed position in opposing the type of plan he once supported. But in this ad, they imply he once supported Obama’s proposal. We don’t find that he did, and we rate the Democrats’ statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/nov/29/democratic-national-committee/did-mitt-romney-flip-flop-health-care-reform-dnc-s/

DNC ad says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on Obama stimulus
","
On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.
   
For this item, we’ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on President Barack Obama’s stimulus plan, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items.

Here’s the relevant portion from the DNC ad:

On-screen text: ""Opposed the stimulus""

Video clip of Romney: ""I have never supported the president's Recovery Act, alright -- the stimulus. No time, nowhere, nohow.""

On-screen text: ""After he was for it.""

Different video clip of Romney: ""I think there is need for economic stimulus.""

We asked the DNC for citations for these clips, and they responded that the first one came from a town hall at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., on Sept. 28, 2011, and the second one came from a Romney appearance on CNN’s Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer on Jan. 4, 2009.

Upon learning this, we immediately noticed that the CNN interview -- when Romney said, ""I think there is need for economic stimulus"" -- took place before Obama had even been sworn into office and therefore came before there was an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

To get the full context of the CNN interview, we looked to the transcript.

Blitzer said that Obama, then president-elect, was ""talking about a $750 billion economic stimulus package. He wants it to be passed as soon as possible. It's unclear if whether it can be passed before he's inaugurated on January 20th. What do you think about this proposal?""

Romney replied, ""Well, I frankly wish that the last Congress (had) dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president could have signed that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time. And that's one of the reasons why I think a stimulus program is needed.""

He continued, ""I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies. But let's not make this a Christmas tree of all of the favors for various politicians who have helped out the Obama campaign, giving them special projects. That would be wrong. You'll see Republicans fight that tooth and nail if that happens. Let's do what's right for the economy, and let's not do what's a political expedient move.""

The DNC ad has some support for its flip-flop claim. Romney did indeed say, ""I think there is need for economic stimulus,"" and at the time of the interview, there was in fact an outline of a stimulus plan from Obama.

But it’s misleading to say Romney flip-flopped on supporting ""the president's Recovery Act."" At the time of the CNN interview, no Obama stimulus bill had been introduced, much less enacted. With such complex bills, the devil’s in the details. Given that Romney outlined a whole list of conditions he’d impose on such a bill, we think it’s unfair for the DNC to say Romney once supported ""the president's Recovery Act.""

Our ruling

In the CNN interview, Romney expressed support broadly for ""economic stimulus"" -- not for a specific measure known as ""the president's Recovery Act."" And even as he offered his support for the concept of stimulus, Romney articulated a pretty specific vision of the kind of bill he’d support. Some of this vision did ultimately overlap with what the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act offered -- tax relief for ""middle-income families"" and businesses, for instance, and investments in infrastructure and energy. But Romney’s two comments can be easily reconciled by arguing that the dollar amounts in the Obama stimulus bill -- or the ratios of various provisions in the bill -- went beyond what he was envisioning.

DNC ad says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion
","
On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.

For this item, we’ll check one of the two claims from the 30-second version -- whether Romney has changed his position on abortion. We'll look at other aspects of the ad in separate items.

Romney, unlike the other GOP contenders, has attracted early attention from the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama, largely due to Romney’s status as the nominal frontrunner in the GOP primary. But Romney has faced years of accusations about being a flip-flopper, most recently in a television ad by one of his primary rivals, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman.

We checked Huntsman’s abortion-related charges from that ad, so we’ll recap them here.

First, let’s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position.
   
•  In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in every state, Romney added, ""I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.""
   
•  In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.""
   
We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career.
   
What about his views today? The ""issues"" portion of his website doesn’t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group.
   
""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.
   
""I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries.  This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world.
   
""I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.""
   
Our ruling
   
Abortion opponents may disagree on exactly where on the anti-abortion spectrum Romney falls, and questions have been raised about how fully and quickly Romney made his ideological transition after the event he cites as the spark -- a meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004.
   
Still, we believe these issues are outside the scope of the claim in the DNC ad. Romney’s views on abortion are vastly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. The DNC’s claim that Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rates a True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/28/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-abortion/
"['National', 'Social Security', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Newt Gingrich says Chile has 72 percent national savings rate
","
EDITOR'S NOTE: The following article has been updated since its original publication, based on new information received. In addition to the data we originally used to evaluate the statement, we have found another measure that more closely matches the percentage Gingrich used. We have changed the rating from False to Half True. 
During a CNN-sponsored Republican presidential debate in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 22, 2011, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., touted his proposal for overhauling Social Security, which he said is based on a pair of private-sector retirement-security programs -- one in the South American nation of Chile and one in Texas.

We looked at both plans in the past -- Chile here and the Texas plans (in Galveston and two neighboring counties) in this fact-check -- but here we’ll look at a statistical claim by Gingrich that we hadn’t heard before.

He said, ""In Chile, for example, they have 72 percent of the GDP in savings.""

Is the national savings rate in Chile really that high? In our quick data search as the debate was under way, we concluded no.

We found an international statistical comparison published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD -- a research group funded by most of the world’s affluent, industrialized nations.

OECD published a table listing gross national savings rates in a range of nations, defining the statistic as saving as a percent of gross domestic product. Between 1996 and 2009 -- the dates for which Chilean data is available -- Chile’s highest national savings rate was 25.1 in 2007. In 2009, it was 20.5 percent.

Both figures were well below the 72 percent rate Gingrich cited. Indeed, no country in the OECD’s table came anywhere close to 72 percent. Occasionally, a country approached 40 percent, usually Asian and Scandinavian nations.

After we published the item with a rating of False, a reader wrote us to say that in our prior coverage of the Chile plan, we had written that ""total assets in the system by the end of 2009 reached $107 billion in U.S dollars, or about 65 percent of Chile’s gross domestic product.""

Noting that that figure was much closer to what Gingrich cited, the reader asked us to take a second look.

We contacted Michael Tanner, an expert in pension systems with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that has been supportive of the Chilean plan over the years. He said that both numbers have merit. The number Gingrich cited in the debate is commonly used, he said, but the candidate’s phrasing in describing it was imprecise.

Tanner said Gingrich would have been accurate if he had said the savings held in the Chilean accounts are equal to 72 percent of the nation’s GDP. ""But that’s not the same thing as saying that Chile’s savings or savings rate is 72 percent of GDP,"" Tanner said. ""National savings is a much broader measure, including all sorts of ‘dis-saving,’ such as government debt, credit card debt and mortgages. That’s the OECD number. So Gingrich’s point was true, but phrased badly."" 
In other words, Gingrich's phrasing in the debate suggested that he was referring to what economists call national savings -- that is savings minus debt -- when in fact the number he used just accounted for assets, unadjusted for debt. The latter number is much bigger, and that explains the difference between what Gingrich said and the OECD's much smaller percentage. 
Final note: Gingrich said 72 percent, which is higher than the 65 percent we cited for 2009. Tanner said that he did not have any updated percentage from 2010 or 2011, but that Gingrich's number is ""certainly ballpark."" 
Our ruling

Gingrich said that in Chile ""they have 72 percent of the GDP in savings."" The number is basically right, but Gingrich erred in how he described the statistic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/28/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-chile-has-72-percent-national-s/

WEAC says state budget cuts led to nearly 4,000 educator layoffs
","
When schools reported a 1 percent drop in property taxes collected statewide, Gov. Scott Walker hailed the news as evidence his revenue freeze had worked.

But the state’s largest teachers union groaned, saying state aid cuts and the freeze were harming schools.

""Through a devastating state budget that cut $1.6 billion from Wisconsin public schools while at the same time tying the hands of local school boards from raising revenue to meet the needs of students, the governor has delivered a one-two punch to our schools,"" Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said in a news release.

The release added: ""FACT: 97 percent of school districts received less state aid this year than last, resulting in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs and larger class sizes.""

We previously checked the $1.6 billion claim and found an element of truth, but that $800 million to $900 million is the better number for education aid cuts under Walker. We rated that claim Mostly False.

But with education a key battleground in the recall drive against Walker, what about the union’s claim of ""nearly 4,000 educator layoffs""?

The claim was a bit surprising: In that same news release and in a previous statement by Bell, the union has presented the 4,000 figure in a more general way, without blaming it all on layoffs -- ""4,000 fewer educators"" on the job.

The source of the number caught our attention as well.

The union attributed it number to a widely reported survey of schools, released Nov. 10, 2011. But that survey -- of more than 80 percent of school districts -- showed about 3,400 fewer school staff in place now compared to last year.

Union spokeswoman Christina Brey told us characterizing all the staff losses as ""layoffs"" was defensible. She said it was a general term,  including reductions due to retirements and non-renewal of contracts as well as layoffs.

She also said the ""nearly 4,000"" figure came from WEAC’s estimates of what a 100 percent survey response would have showed, and from a separate state Department of Workforce Development report on public-sector job losses.

Is the union right?

The state Department of Workforce Development report prompted state officials to estimate a 4,000 worker drop in the local school workforce. But that’s not all ""educators."" It ""could range from teachers and administrators to support staff and janitors,"" the Capital Times reported.

The figure is an estimate based on the widely reported state job figures, but state officials do not get into layoffs or the other reasons for the drop.

Separately, the survey by the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators showed a total of 9,000 fewer jobs -- partially offset by 5,600 new hires. That’s the 3,400 net job loss. Again, it would include support staff and non-teaching positions.

Of those 9,000, we found about 1,500 -- a bit more than 15 percent  -- were from actual layoffs. About half were from retirements and about one third from non-renewal of contracts.

So the union claim is off.

""I can see where your question comes from, but to the general public, little distinction is made between the underlying causes behind whether or not something is a layoff, a retirement generated by a threat of layoff, a non-renewal, and so forth,"" Brey told us.

To be sure, some local school officials we talked to told us some of the retirees would have been laid off if they had not retired.

But there are problems with that line of thought.

Retirements did surge after the state budget made it easy for schools to impose higher pension and health costs and make changes in work rules for teachers. But there are significant numbers of retirements every year, so blaming the budget cuts alone for pushing them out overreaches.

The same holds for dismissal of educators for poor performance; there’s a baseline level of those every year.

As for the union’s notion the 4,000 is on target if you simply apply the pattern of the 80 percent of districts who responded to all districts, that is mathematically correct. It’s a ""reasonable layman’s approach,"" said Nancy Mathiowetz, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee statistics expert.

But to draw a precise conclusion as the union did would require study of why some districts didn’t respond, according to Mathiowetz and Marquette University survey research expert Robert Griffin. Griffin said he would use extreme caution before making the leap to 4,000. 

So, the 4,000 figure is debatable even if you accept the union’s logic.

Our conclusion

WEAC, the state’s largest teachers union, calls the school staffing losses layoffs, putting the number at 4,000.

That shorthand is very misleading given that layoffs were only a fraction of the job losses. Even if you grant that a significant number of retirements were a form of indirect layoff, it’s inaccurate to lump all the departing staffers under that banner.

"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'John Wisniewski']","
John Wisniewski claims New Jersey is not seeing new jobs being created
","
If state Assemblyman John Wisniewski and his fellow Democratic legislators want to spur economic growth in New Jersey, he could start by counting the jobs that already have been created.

With about seven weeks left in the Legislature’s lame-duck session, Wisniewski said in a recent NJToday interview that creating jobs should be the Assembly’s number-one priority. As it is, new jobs are not being created in New Jersey, according to Wisniewski, who also is chairman of the state Democratic Party.

""We’ve seen far too long the governor’s rhetoric doesn’t match his actions,"" said Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) during the Nov. 21 interview. ""While he talks about job creation, we don't see jobs being created in this state.""

It didn’t take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to realize Wisniewski’s claim made no sense.

The state’s economy may not be gaining as much speed as we’d like, but the state has still seen an increase of nearly 40,000 private-sector jobs since January, according to the most recent seasonally adjusted data released by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

Let’s see how the labor statistics break down.

A few days before Wisniewski made his statement, state officials released preliminary employment figures for October.

Compared with October 2010, public-sector jobs saw a year-over-year decrease of 5,600. But that loss was offset by an increase of 28,100 private-sector jobs since October 2010.

Thus, total non-farm employment in October stood at 3,868,700, marking a year-over-year increase of 22,500 jobs, or about 0.6 percent.

So, what was Wisniewski talking about?

The assemblyman’s communications director, Tim O’Donovan, told us Wisniewski was referring to figures released last month. O’Donovan pointed out how those figures show month-over-month decreases in total non-farm jobs in August and September.

But the latest data was available when Wisniewski made the claim. Also, according to Rutgers economics professor Joseph Seneca, one month is not a good indicator of employment changes, because single events can distort a given month.

""The standard approach would be to consider job changes over the past year (Oct 10 to Oct 11) or on a year to date basis (i.e. from Dec 10 through the latest month). Both of those measures indicate NJ is adding private sector jobs at a reasonable pace,"" Seneca told us in an email.

""The problem is that the recession losses were so large, the state has a long way to go to recover all the losses, but a start has been made in terms of private sector jobs,"" he added.

In a statement, Wisniewski said: ""If the Ledger wants to credit the Governor with job creation when unemployment has barely budged over the past year that's out of my control, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's far too premature to be giving anyone credit for creating jobs given our chronic unemployment and fragile economy.""

We’re not saying Republican Gov. Chris Christie is responsible for this job growth, but it’s worth noting that since he took office in January 2010, New Jersey has seen an increase of 41,600 private-sector jobs.

Our ruling

Blasting Christie for his ""rhetoric"" about job creation, Wisniewski claimed ""we don't see jobs being created in this state.""

The economic recovery may not be moving fast enough, but New Jersey has seen an increase in total non-farm jobs over the last year, driven by growth in the private-sector. Wisniewski should know better than to suggest otherwise.

Susan Combs U-turns on advancing state money for Formula One race
","Years before the Formula One racetrack agreement became public knowledge in Central Texas, state Comptroller Susan Combs was a strong supporter. Yet on Nov. 15, 2011, she hit the brakes: Texas would not disburse $25 million in advance of the first race, she announced.

We put her statement through PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter. Did Combs do a high-speed turn?

Combs’ statement says she has supported bringing a Formula One race to Texas ""since 2008."" And when the deal became public in May 2010, Gov. Rick Perry praised her efforts. In the 2010-11 budget, approved in 2009, lawmakers sent $25 million to Combs to be placed in the Major Events Trust Fund, whence she could distribute the money under the terms of a 2003 statute.

Combs’ agreement to pay in advance was spelled out in a May 10, 2010, letter:

""With the understanding that the first Formula 1 United States Grand Prix race will be held in Texas in 2012, full funding on the entire sanction for 2012 will be paid to Formula OneWorld Championship Limited (‘FOWC’) no later than July 31st, 2011.""

The sanction, reported by the Statesman to be $25 million under the original contract, is the first of ten $25 million annual payments Texas committed to in writing. Payment was delayed when Austin’s race date was put back from June 17, 2012, to Nov. 18, 2012.

But Combs’ Nov. 15 statement was the first official notice that Texas would not pay until after the race was held. It unequivocally says, ""The state of Texas will not be paying any funds in advance of the event.""

Does her announcement constitute a flip flop?

Combs says no. Specifically, Combs spokeswoman Brooke Botello told us, ""It is not a change of position; rather, it’s adhering to the statute.""

""The ability to advance funds, according to the statute, is discretionary,"" Botello emailed us Nov. 22. ""Considering the events of late, we used that discretion and decided – due to the events outlined in the attached – it would not be prudent to advance the funds.""

In the attachment Botello mentions, which is Combs’ Nov. 15 statement, the comptroller lists the recently announced Formula One race in New Jersey, set for 2013; slowed construction at the Central Texas site; and disagreements between Formula One and race promoters that ""prompted speculation about whether the Austin race will even occur.""

Our ruling: Combs may have been justified in her recent statement that no state money would go to the race in advance. Still, it’s a reversal of her earlier promise. This is a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2011/nov/28/susan-combs/susan-combs-u-turns-advancing-state-money-formula-/

Is HOPE fund on pace to run dry?
","
Hope can bring about many things. At the Georgia Capitol, hope springs debate.

In this case, we’re referring to the HOPE scholarship, which countless Georgia students have used to pay for their college education and is currently in a funding crisis.

The state Legislature made significant changes to the HOPE program earlier this year to keep it sustainable, but some lawmakers are still not pleased with some of the new measures.

State Rep. Stacey Evans, a HOPE scholar, recently penned an op-ed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution outlining her concerns about the program’s future. It first ran in the AJC’s Get Schooled blog. One line caught our interest.

""By fiscal year 2013, the state is expected to wipe through reserve funds and be expected to make even larger cuts to the HOPE program,"" wrote the Democrat from Smyrna. ""This is why it is essential that Georgia consider all new revenue sources to supplement lottery funds.""

No more reserve funds for HOPE? We wondered if the reserves were in that much trouble.

Revenues for HOPE, which come from the state’s lottery, were usually comfortably more than how much the state spent and awarded in scholarships. But spending has caught up to revenues in recent years, as more Georgia students became eligible for the program.

HOPE previously funded all public college tuition if students maintained a 3.0 GPA. It also provided some money for books and fees. The changes to HOPE now mean only the state's most accomplished students, about 10 percent of recipients, get full tuition awards. For other students, the scholarship amount depends on lottery revenue. No one gets money for books and fees.

A report released on Nov. 4 suggested to us that Evans was way off the mark. The report, put together by the Georgia Student Finance Commission, showed the reserve fund would be at about $420 million by fiscal year 2013, which begins July 1, 2012, and ends June 30, 2013. The commission administers HOPE.

Evans pointed us to a portion of Georgia state code, 50-27-13 (b)(3), to explain her point. In essence, it says if the HOPE reserve fund is less than 50 percent of the prior year’s revenues, then the state cannot dip into the reserves.

The Nov. 4 report shows revenues, which the report calls ""deposits,"" would be about $853 million by fiscal year 2013, which is slightly more than double the projected reserve fund of $420 million.

""Essentially, $400 million is zero,"" Evans told us. ""[The state] won’t have any reserves … unless the lottery makes more money next year.""

Georgia Student Finance Commission President Tim Connell confirmed that the state could not spend from the reserves if they fall below 50 percent. If the reserve fund falls below 50 percent of revenues, then the state would cut spending to get back to that 50 percent level. For example, if the reserve fund is below 50 percent of revenues by $5, then the state would cut its budget by $5.

""Since you can’t use it, the reserves will be wiped out,"" Evans, an attorney, told us. ""I really think it would be more misleading to let the public think there’s $400 million in reserves. … The truth is the money available for scholarships is wiped out.""

Evans believes the state should lower the percentage of how low the reserve fund in relation to actual revenues could be before officials are prohibited from dipping into it to help pay for the HOPE program.

We better understand the lawmaker’s point about the potential inability to draw from the reserve fund, but it takes some work to get there. We believe her initial statement can confuse anyone who reads the commission’s most recent report and sees $420 million projected in the account by fiscal year 2013.

Her statement is technically accurate, but it needs some additional information. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/28/stacey-evans/hope-fund-pace-run-dry/

Sen. Rob Portman says the U.S. has the second highest corporate tax rate
","
Tax reform was an issue addressed by the Joint Select Deficit Reduction Committee, aka the supercommittee, in its failed quest to reduce the federal budget deficit. 
Partisans on both sides of the political aisle have complained for years about the way we are taxed. 
Republicans and some Democrats claim business taxes are too high and stifle growth. They argue that instead of handing over a share of profits to the government, companies could use the money to expand and hire more workers. Others argue the money is more likely to be passed on to shareholders. 
It’s a big debate among states. Those with higher corporate tax rates often complain they can’t fairly compete for investment with states that have lower rates. 
And when multi-national companies decide where they want to build a factory or invest their capital, one of the things they consider is a country’s tax rate. 
That’s the context for a recent statement by U.S. Sen. (and supercommittee member) Rob Portman of Ohio, who broached the subject of tax reform during a hearing Nov. 1. 
""We have the second highest corporate tax rate among our trading partners,"" Portman said. ""Japan’s is slightly higher, and they are intending to take theirs down."" 
Portman contends that corporate taxes need to be lowered to make the U.S. more attractive to investment, but that corporate deductions also should be reduced so as not to add to the deficit. Resulting growth would broaden the tax base and actually raise revenues. He also thinks multi-national corporations should be allowed to repatriate future profits to the United States without having to pay additional taxes on them here. 
Because corporate taxes are such a hot-button issue, PolitiFact Ohio decided to review Portman’s statement. 
Portman’s office said the senator based his comments on a report published in September by the Washington-based Tax Foundation called ""U.S. Corporations Suffer High Effective Tax Rates by International Standards."" 
The first sentence in the report speaks directly to Portman’s claim. 
""The United States currently lays claim to the second-highest statutory corporate income tax rate in the developed world. At 39.2 percent, the rate is only 0.35 percentage points behind OECD-leading Japan."" 
OECD stands for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and includes 34 countries. China, India and Brazil are not members but cooperate with OECD. 
The 39.2 percent figure is correct when you combine the statutory federal rate of 35 percent with the average statutory rate among states. But the statutory rate is only part of the equation. 
The statutory rate is what the tax code declares corporations must pay, but it’s much different from what corporations actually pay. That is called the effective tax rate, and it takes into account all the loopholes and preferences available to companies, such as depreciation of assets and deductions for things like research and development. Those can significantly lower taxable income and in some cases eliminate a corporation’s tax burden altogether. 
We felt it was important to examine Portman’s statement in view of the effective tax rate as well. And there the story is different — not much different according to the Tax Foundation, but a great deal so if you pose the question to the conservative Tax Foundation’s more-liberal think-tank rivals. 
The Tax Foundation report lists 13 recent studies that compare effective tax rates across countries. The United States ranks second in three of those studies, third in two of them, fourth in two, fifth in three, sixth in one, eighth in one and 23rd in one. 
But when you look at only those studies involving OECD countries, the United States never falls out of the top five. 
""Taken as a whole these studies indicate that the average effective tax rate for U.S. corporations — like the statutory rate — is one of the highest in the world,"" the Tax Foundation report states. ""By every available measure, the U.S. imposes a very high tax burden on its corporate sector, in comparison to other nations, even after credits and deductions."" 
Will McBride, an economist with the Tax Foundation, equates the statutory rate with the sticker price of a car, and the effective rate with the actual sales price once the haggling is over. Both rates are important, he said, because they affect behavior. 
But we’re not letting that be the last word. 
The left-leaning, Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy produced a report this month that sampled 280 of the Fortune 500 companies in the United States and found that they paid an average U.S. corporate tax of 18.5 percent. 
Of those 280 companies, 78 paid no federal taxes in at least one of the past three years.
One of the authors of that report, Rebecca Wilkins, senior counsel for federal tax policy at the Center for Tax Justice, argues that the Tax Foundation studies are misleading because they include both deferred and foreign taxes in their calculations. 
Not to complicate things further, but Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury official under the first President George Bush and now a New York Times blogger, argues that the broadest measure of a country’s corporate tax burden is to calculate corporate taxes as a share of gross domestic product. In that case, the United States is among the lowest in the OECD, he said, which begs the question; how can a country have such a high tax rate, but such a low tax burden? The answer: loopholes and deductions. 
Furthermore, a more precise debate would factor in the taxing of corporate dividends to shareholders, which is done at a comparatively lower rate in the United States than in most other countries, he said. 
Bartlett, who recently wrote a book on tax reform called ""The Benefit and The Burden,"" thinks the whole exercise is somewhat irrelevant because cutting taxes won’t necessarily lead to more investment, especially in today’s stagnant economy when nobody is interested in expanding. 
The upshot is that there are a lot of ways to slice the corporate tax apple, and the conclusion that can be drawn depends a lot on the question that is being asked. 
So where does all this leave Portman’s claim? 
The claim is irrefutable when looking at the statutory rate but arguable when considering effective rates. 
So Portman’s statement is accurate, but requires some clarification, which on the Truth-O-Meter means a rating of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/28/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-has-second-highest-corpora/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Walker says ‘overwhelming number’ of Wisconsin school districts’ staffs grew or stayed the same after 2011-2013 state budget
","
As opponents push to recall him, Gov. Scott Walker is working to douse criticism of major cuts in school aid approved in his 2011-2013 budget.

In the wake of media coverage of a survey of school districts that showed a net drop of 3,400 education staff spread across more than 350 local districts, he laid out his own view of the numbers. Not every district lost staff, but the cumulative effect was a 5 percent reduction overall.

On that point, Walker noted a majority of staff cuts came from just a few large urban districts -- including ones that couldn’t or didn’t take advantage of the change that eliminated collective bargaining with teachers’ unions over health and pension costs. Critics responded that those few districts educate a big share of public school kids.

Taking on the survey, Walker went further in a Nov. 15, 2011, interview on WTMJ-AM (620). Host Charlie Sykes asked Walker if his budget had resulted in ""significant educational cutbacks in school districts across the state.""

Walker responded:  ""No. This is myth vs. reality. You saw a rush to judgment when some folks put that information out. The media wanted to believe that … at least the more liberal biased media wanted to believe that so they immediately assumed it was true.""

He concluded: ""If you actually look at this, it shows just the opposite. It shows the overwhelming number of districts saw that staffing was the same or greater, that there were the same or fewer cuts than before, and in the few areas where they did see significant reductions in staffing, it was places like Milwaukee, Kenosha and Janesville...""

We’re working on several statements related to the survey.

Here’s our question for today: Did the survey -- done by the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators and analyzed by the state Department of Public Instruction -- show the ""overwhelming number of districts"" escaped a drop in staff?

Let’s start with this note: Walker doesn’t dispute the data in the survey filled out by more than 80% of public school districts -- just the way it was used. In fact, he uses the same data to make opposing points.

In the survey, ""staff"" referred not only to teachers, but to teachers aides, support staff and administrators.

Walker argues the raw data actually show a large number of districts where more new staff was hired than was laid off or dismissed by contract non-renewal.

We crunched the numbers and he’s right by that method of accounting: More than eight in 10 districts surveyed showed no net loss of staff, and most had gains.

There’s a big footnote, however.

You won’t find Walker’s numbers cited in the survey’s summary, because the survey calculated the staffing changes using a number -- a critical one -- Walker leaves out: retirements of staff.

In all, more than 4,700 school employees retired in the last year -- a level many school officials attribute to Walker’s own budget’s push to force them to pay more for pensions and health care.

For each district, the survey arrived at a staff loss or gain by adding up all the staff departures (retirements, layoffs, contract non-renewals) and subtracting the new hires.

The survey showed Racine schools, for instance, reported a net drop of 100 staff, mostly teachers aides. But by Walker’s method, Racine shows a net gain of 14, according to our calculations.

The reason for the difference: Walker doesn’t count the 114 retirements in the district.

When we analyzed the survey results using the complete statistics used to calculate the staff change, we found the opposite of Walker’s conclusion: Three out of four districts reported a net loss of staff, including all four categories of staff.

A reduction in teachers drove that result: Nearly two out of three districts (63 percent) reported a net loss of teachers. That trend was much less pronounced in the other categories: for teachers aides, 38 percent of districts saw reductions, we found. For support staff, 31 percent saw a loss. For administrators, 21 percent reported a loss.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor excluded retirements because a teacher can retire for any number of reasons unrelated to budgets.

True, but the same claim could be made about new hires -- something Walker includes. Indeed, new hires were often necessitated by the retirements. Pulling out just one of the categories unravels any attempt to get at what actually is happening.

""We would have had to lay off way more teachers"" if 28 hadn’t retired, said Burlington Area School District Superintendent David Moyer. The district rehired 20, according to the survey.

Most new hires in the Muskego-Norway district were replacing teachers who retired, said Superintendent Joe Schroeder. Retirements tripled over the previous year.

Werwie, the governor’s spokesman, said that ultimately Walker’s counting method shows ""new teachers had an easier time getting a job in Wisconsin.""

That seems like a safe statement, but it’s a different point than saying most districts had the same staffing or greater.

Werwie also argued that ""staffing"" should be judged by broader measures such as class size. It’s possible, he said, for class sizes to hold steady even if staff is reduced because the budget granted freedom from various work rules. In Kaukauna, for instance, the district required educators to teach six hours a day instead of five, as the Journal Sentinel reported.

It’s true that very large majorities of districts reported no increase in class sizes -- 74 percent in grades kindergarten to three, and 66 percent in grades 4-6, for example.

We think Werwie’s point about judging ""staffing"" by what happened to class sizes has some merit. Increases or decreases in class size can result from changes in teacher staffing.

But enrollment and other factors can affect class size too.

In the end, it’s a really a broader topic than the one in front of us on the breadth of the staffing cuts. In any event, Walker’s reference to staffing levels of ""the same or greater"" makes it clear he was quantifying staffing, not discussing class size.

Our conclusion

Walker referred to school survey results, saying ""the overwhelming number of districts saw that staffing was the same or greater.""

But he cherry-picked figures in his favor, leaving out a key factor -- retirements -- that formed the basis of the survey’s conclusions on overall staffing reductions. When they are included, the survey actually shows the opposite of what he said.

We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/nov/27/scott-walker/walker-says-overwhelming-number-wisconsin-school-d/

New Jersey Tea Party blames Barack Obama for unemployment of 540,000 blacks since January 2009
","
Black and recently unemployed? Blame President Barack Obama, says the New Jersey Tea Party.

""Since Obama took office, a net of 540,000 additional black Americans – Obama’s strongest supporters – have lost their jobs,"" the Tea Party retweeted to its followers on Sept. 2. The original tweet came from Ken Gardner, a junior fellow for The Right Sphere, a conservative website, and was retweeted by Jeff M. Weingarten, president of Morristown Tea Party Organization.

Pinning a race’s employment status solely on the president of the United States seemed rather strong so PolitiFact New Jersey checked the statement. Turns out the unemployment statistic in the tweet is accurate, but blaming the president is less clear.

First, let’s break down the different elements of the statement.

The number of employed blacks dropped by 540,000 people from January 2009 through August 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, DC. The number of employed whites for the same time frame dropped by 2.15 million.

But that doesn’t matter, Weingarten said in a phone interview, because the percentage of unemployed blacks is disproportionately higher than that of whites, which has a larger population.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People acknowledges the high rate of unemployment for blacks, but doesn’t blame Obama, said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy.

Both Shelton and the U.S. Department of Labor noted that initiatives such as education and more training and employment services could help blacks get more jobs.

But Weingarten said other issues need to be addressed. He said Obama ""is squarely to blame"" for the employment decrease among blacks because of programs such as ""Obamacare"" and unwillingness by corporations to spend money in a still-shaky economy.

""When you are the commander in chief and leader of the country, you are the one that promulgates and sees to it that policies are enacted or not,"" Weingarten said.

Issues critical to the black community, including jobs, has always been on Obama’s radar, according to a recent Associated Press article.

Appearing at a daylong White House summit of black business, community and political leaders on Nov. 9, Obama said the current 15.1 percent unemployment rate among blacks is ""way too high,"" and that other problems that plagued black communities before he took office, such as housing and education, have worsened.

The White House also disputed arguments that Obama has not targeted problems faced by blacks, according to the article.

""Since day one, the president has fought for the policies that matter to the African-American community,"" White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said.

Shelton said Obama has attempted to address unemployment for all races but a number of bills have stalled or failed in Congress, or couldn’t get committee hearings.

Given that, blaming the president seems disingenuous, Shelton said.
 
""It’s almost like someone deciding to knock you down and then blame you for falling,"" he said.

But blame can be placed on Obama, said Mychal Massie, chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives.

""Does Obama represent the government of the United States? If he represents the government of the United States then the answer is yes, unequivocally so, disgracefully and shamefully so, but not because he’s black,"" Massie said. ""He is a poor example of leadership, and his profound ignorance of what it takes to rally an economy and his even more vacuous understanding of free-market enterprise and how it contributes to the creation of jobs.""

Our ruling

The Tea Party blames Obama for an additional half million blacks being unemployed since he took office. The group’s number of 540,000 unemployed is correct, and the NAACP concurs that blacks are among Obama’s biggest supporters. We heard varying opinions on whether the president is to blame for that job loss and it’s clear there are a variety of factors at work -- some under the president’s jurisdiction, some not. Partially accurate claims that leave out important details fits the definition of our ruling: Half True.

Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed says 95 percent of the state's ozone pollution comes from out of state, particularly the Midwest
","
Pollution doesn't respect state boundaries. That was an underlying theme when the U.S. Senate debated whether to kill an Environmental Protection Agency rule that requires 27 Eastern states to curb smog and pollution that affect states downwind. 
Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who sponsored the proposal to eliminate the rules, characterized them as ""job-killing regulations."" 
Rhode Island Democrat Jack Reed was one of the senators who argued for keeping them in place. He used an economic argument, saying that electric rates in other states are lower because polluters there simply send their dirty air high into the skies, forcing downwind states to spend extra on antipollution equipment when they generate their power or drive their automobiles.

That increases energy costs here, which drives up unemployment, Reed said. ""We're effectively subsidizing lower electricity rates in parts of this country that are taking jobs from Rhode Island.""

""Now in Rhode Island specifically, only 5 percent of ozone pollution is from local or in-state sources. Five percent. Ninety-five percent comes from outside of our borders, particularly the Midwest,"" Reed said.

The Paul proposal was ultimately defeated 41-56, mostly along party lines.

But we wondered whether the amount of imported ozone pollution is really that high.

Ozone is a form of super-oxygen, made up of three oxygen atoms. Normal, less-reactive, oxygen has two. High in the atmosphere, ozone is good. It acts as a natural sunscreen that shields us from damaging ultraviolet rays, which explains the concern over the ""ozone hole"" when it was growing in the Antarctic. But ozone near the ground is bad, a pollutant that causes breathing problems.

But is 95 percent of it blown in from other states?

The issue is complicated because the chemistry is complicated. Individual ozone molecules don't last long. They're generated by the right combination of sunlight, carbon-containing gasses (often called volatile organic compounds) and nitrogen-based pollutants (often called oxides of nitrogen or NOx). And the same pollutants that create it can, under the right conditions, destroy it.

""Consider the distribution of ozone around a source of NOx such as the interstate highway,"" said John Merrill, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Rhode Island. ""On a day when the sun is shining, if you go a mile or two downwind, there's usually less ozone because the NOx emitted by the cars on the highway actually destroys ozone because there is way too much NOx relative to hydrocarbons. But if you go 20 miles downwind, there's still a little bit of NOx left and now it's producing ozone instead of destroying ozone.""

When we asked Reed's office about the senator's claim, spokesman Chip Unruh sent us a 384-page technical document, released by the EPA in 1998, that deals with NOx emissions. It used wind data to see where that pollution came from, tracing it backward in time.

It reports that during high-pollution events, 5 percent of Rhode Island's dirty air comes from within the state and 95 percent derives from upwind states. Merrill said those are the most up-to-date numbers he could find. Those are the numbers Reed used.

Although the EPA report doesn't look at ozone directly and it's not accurate to equate NOx to ozone, Merrill said the percentages for ozone are pretty close because the pollutants follow the same wind-driven path. ""It's the most important variable factor, other than meteorological factors.""

So a cloud of ozone that grows on warm sunny days can migrate hundreds of miles before the sun goes down and the cloud starts to break down.

So which states are giving us all this pollution?

Reed said the primary source of the ozone is the Midwest.

Although Ohio, Michigan and some states to their west generate air pollution that drifts beyond their borders, the EPA report cited by Reed's office shows that the polluters that cause our ozone problems are much closer to home.

New Jersey is responsible for 30 percent of our air pollution; New York accounts for 24 percent, followed by Pennsylvania (12 percent) and Virginia (7 percent). Midwestern states such as Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan contribute no more than 11 percent.

""It follows the I-95 corridor,"" said Lenny Giuliano, an air quality specialist at the state Department of Environmental Management. ""The wind has got to be in the right direction for us to get it.""

Our ruling

Jack Reed said 95 percent of Rhode Island's ozone pollution comes from outside the state, and most of it is imported from the Midwest.

The percentages come from a 13-year-old EPA report -- the most recent available -- that looks at, not ozone directly, but the pollutants that generate ozone under the right conditions.

But the pollution sent into the air by smokestacks in the Midwest makes up only a small fraction of the pollution coming into Rhode Island, an amount overwhelmed by the dirty air coming from New York and New Jersey.

Because the first part of Reed’s statement is accurate and the second part is not, we’ll split the difference and rate his claim Half True.

"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Eileen Brady']","
How big of a role did Eileen Brady play in expanding children's healt care coverage?
","
In her bid to be Portland’s next mayor, Eileen Brady has been getting a lot of mileage out of her work on health care reform. Her campaign website calls her service on the Oregon Health Fund Board -- the board tasked with reworking the state’s system -- ""perhaps Eileen’s most important public service role.""

That theme keeps popping up again and again. Most recently, we spotted it in a Facebook ad, which said ""On the Oregon Health Fund Board, Eileen brought together business, labor and hospitals to give 94,000 Oregon children health care.""

She also brought the board up in her announcement speech back in early September.

""In 2009 Governor Kulongoski appointed me as vice chair of the Oregon Health Fund Board ... Today, as the result of the work we did on that board and the Legislature’s commitment we were able to provide health insurance to an additional 94,000 kids,"" she said. ""During this process I came to know insurance executives, hospital leaders, labor leaders, and activists. And I helped find the common ground that enabled us to put our differences aside and put our children first.""

We wondered whether the claim that she brought together these constituencies was true.

Brady’s spokesman John Isaacs, happy to help us reach a True rating on this fact check, sent us a long list of folks to get in touch with who would be happy to vouch for her leadership skills. ""I expect that you will call each of these people,"" he wrote.

Not so surprisingly, they all gave Brady rave reviews.

Tom Chamberlain, president of the AFL-CIO and a member of the board, said he and Brady pushed for a consensus-style committee process in which ""we got input from everybody."" Still, he said, ""when Eileen and I presented that, I don't recall a lot of push back.""

As for the general idea that Brady helped build agreement between groups, Chamberlain said ""that's fair to say,"" adding that as a vice chair of the committee, ""she probably deserves a little more credit.""

""All of us worked really hard and all of us went to town-hall-like meetings all over the state,"" Chamberlain said. Brady, he said, carried her own weight and might have gone to more meetings than anybody else, though he couldn’t remember for certain.

Next up was Alan Bates, a Democratic senator from Medford, and one of two authors of the bill that created the board on which Brady sat. After the committee had crafted their proposal, Bates said, he took Eileen with him to a meeting of the Senate’s Republican caucus. ""Eileen stepped up as a business leader and on a very emotional and solid basis really sold them,"" he said. ""Eileen was really germane to getting that done.""

Bates, it should be noted, has endorsed Brady. As has Jonathan Ater, who served as the other vice chair on the Oregon Health Fund Board.

Naturally, then, Ater had good things to say about Brady. ""I do not think the Legislature would have been able to adopt a children's health insurance program unless there had been a very substantial consensus built up,"" he said. ""I think Eileen was a critical part of bridging that discussion.""

The difficult thing with a statement like this is that we can’t base a ruling off personal accounts alone -- particularly personal accounts from supporters. It’s also hard to parse out exactly how essential any one person was.

What we can do, though, is offer some context.

The road to health care reform in Oregon has been a pretty twisty one, involving hundreds of people and meetings over the course of many years. The specific change that Brady touts on Facebook and in her speech has roots stretching back several years.

In June 2007, Sen. Bates and Sen. Ben Westlund, D-Bend, manged to get the Healthy Oregon Act through the state Legislature.

That act, the product of an 18-month effort that included hearings across Oregon, set ""essential health care benefits for all Oregonians."" It also allocated money for creating a seven-member Oregon Health Fund Board, which would turn the concepts outlined in the legislation into a workable plan.

Brady was appointed to that board. After more than a year’s worth of work and dozens of meetings, the board presented then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski with a fleshed-out plan. The Oregonian reported at the time that ""the panel crafted its plan during the past year with volunteer committee help from doctors, hospitals, insurers and others in the health care industry and testimony from more than 1,000 Oregonians across the state.""

Included in that plan was a recommendation for a 1 percent tax on hospitals and health insurance providers to increase the number of children and low-income adults on the Oregon Health Plan. The Legislature approved the legislation in 2009 and children have been enrolling since.

Given the long and involved history, it would be an overstatement to say that Brady was so integral to all of this that it wouldn’t have happened without her. That said, her position as vice chair of the board that ultimately suggested the provider tax to expand children’s health care is nothing to sneeze at. The board had to balance the needs and desires of several constituencies and Brady was one of the leaders during those talks.

The history, stretching back to when Bates and Westlund first traveled the state to put together their initial act, is important additional information, but the comment that Brady ""helped find the common ground"" can’t really be disputed. We find this one Mostly True.
