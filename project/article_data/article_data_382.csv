HBCUs likely to get smaller boost in federal funds, but that isn’t a $30 billion cut
","Amid tense federal budget negotiations among Democrats, social media posts made a false claim that President Joe Biden cut funding for historically Black colleges and universities by $30 billion. ""Biden Breaks Promise, Cuts $30B to Black Colleges & Universities,"" read the headline on a video that is shared to an Instagram post. Another Instagram post also made the $30 billion claim about what are known as HBCUs.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not clear how the claim arrives at $30 billion, but the suggestion that the HBCUs are receiving funding cuts is wrong.  ""It’s a lie,"" tweeted Walter Kimbrough, president of Dillard University in New Orleans, an HBCU. Biden proposed a $3.5 trillion spending plan, sometimes referred to as the budget reconciliation bill, now being debated by Democrats in Congress. It included $45 billion in new funding for HCBUs and other minority-serving institutions to update their research programs, create incubators to help students innovate and help traditionally underserved populations. The Associated Press reported on Oct. 5 that the latest iteration of the reconciliation bill includes only $2 billion that can go toward educational programs and infrastructure for Black colleges, and even that amount would be reduced to competitive grant funding rather than direct allocations. No final decisions have been made on the bill, but as it stands, HBCUs stand to gain funding, not experience a cut, said Kevin Miller, associate director for higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""It is not a cut. It will be an increase of $2 billion instead of $45 billion,"" said Harry Williams, president & CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, which advocates for HBCUs. ""It’s not a cut, because you can’t cut what we’ve never had."" He also noted that it remains unclear whether the $2 billion, if that ultimately is what is approved, will be set aside for HBCUs, or shared among HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions.   Responsibility for how much HBCUs ultimately get rests with Democrats in the Congress, which must agree on a final bill, although Biden would have to sign it into law. ""President proposes, Congress disposes,"" said G. William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

What’s in a name? Louisiana lawmakers wrongly say name change scuttles FDA COVID-19 vaccine approval
","In August, the Food and Drug Administration gave full and final approval to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer for people 16 and older. But 10 Republican Louisiana lawmakers allege ""there is no FDA approval for the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19."" The state representatives put that in bold at the top of a Sept. 29 letter to Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards. No, it’s not like those lawmakers didn’t get the memo on FDA approval. They saw it, but they tried to make the argument that it didn’t count. One of their main arguments focuses on the new name for the vaccine. The drug that had gone by the prosaic name of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is now called Comirnaty. The initial vaccine has been used for months under an emergency use authorization, or EUA. Going forward, the final approval applies to Comirnaty. For the Louisiana lawmakers, this changes everything. As they see it, the FDA approved Comirnaty, not the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.  ""These two drugs are legally distinct,"" they wrote. Aaron Lottes at Purdue University spent many years as an FDA regulator. Lottes told us the lawmakers didn’t read the fine print. ""This is an interesting legal argument, but from a scientific basis, the EUA-version and the Comirnaty version are identical,"" Lottes said. The FDA’s notice of final approval did include the words, ""the products are legally distinct,"" but then immediately noted that the differences ""do not impact safety or effectiveness."" ""The differences include things such as labeling,"" Lottes said. ""The EUA vaccines obviously have a different label and accompanying information than the approved version will have."" The Pfizer press office told us that the vaccine’s contents and the way it is made remain the same, but the manufacturing site and the sourcing of some raw materials might vary, subject to FDA oversight and approval. The lawmakers’ letter correctly stated that the FDA said the original version and Comirnaty could be used interchangeably, but then the letter went on to incorrectly state ""the FDA labeling on Comirnaty contradicts this statement: ‘There are no data available on the interchangeability of Comirnaty with other Covid-19 vaccines to complete the vaccination series.’"" Let’s parse what the FDA actually has said. The plain meaning of its guidance is that it doesn’t know about mixing Comirnaty with other vaccines, like getting one shot of Moderna, followed by a second shot of Comirnaty. The FDA did not, however, say it lacked data on swapping Comirnaty with the Pfizer vaccine in a two-shot series; in fact, it plainly said you can. Because so far as your body is concerned, the drugs are the same. The lawmakers’ letter makes another point: ""The approved drug Comirnaty is unavailable for distribution in the U.S.,"" it says. ""Drugs are experimental under EUA and cannot be legally mandated."" The lawmakers oppose vaccine mandates, and one of their arguments is that governments can mandate only those vaccines that have final approval. Unless clinics are stocked with a drug labeled Comirnaty, they say, no mandate is valid. But, as the lawmakers acknowledge, the FDA says that Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Comirnaty can be used interchangeably. According to Pfizer, when the country works through the current stockpiles of vaccine, boxes bearing the label Comirnaty will start arriving. Until then, the vaccines produced under the emergency use authorization remain in use.  ""If the EUA were revoked, then this product, which is identical in formulation to the approved product, would be legally unusable,"" Lottes said. ""I would expect this is easily on the order of tens of millions of doses."" The lawmakers’ letter also references the health warnings that come with the approved vaccine, saying approval was premature. Lottes said the FDA approves many drugs with guidance on when they should not be used. The vaccine approval is no different. We reached out to Louisiana State Rep. Kathy Edmonston, a key author of the letter, and did not hear back. The lawmakers that signed their name to the letter include: Reps. Beryl Amedee, R-Houma; Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City; Kathy Edmonston, R-Gonzales; Larry Frieman, R-Abita Springs; Valerie Hodges, R-Denham Springs; Dodie Horton, R-Haughton; Sherman Mack, R-Albany; Danny McCormick, R-Oil City; Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine; and Rodney Schamerhorn, R-Hornbeck. Christina Stephens, a spokesperson for Edwards, dismissed the letter. ""This letter is ridiculous,"" Stephens said. ""The governor hasn’t read it and he doesn’t intend to. It's rife with disinformation, which is particularly dangerous to share during a pandemic and could result in immense and irreparable harm to families across this state."" Ten Louisiana lawmakers said, ""There is no FDA approval for the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19."" This is wrong. The FDA approved that vaccine. The only change was in the vaccine’s name, but chemically and biologically, the vaccine called Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the newly named Comirnaty are identical.

There are no COVID medical kidnappings in Tennessee
","A TikTok video claims that the governor of Tennessee signed an executive order to authorize ""COVID medical kidnappings"" in the state. ""RED ALERT: Covid (sic) internment camps announced in America; Tennessee governor signs EO authorizing National Guard to carry out covid medical kidnappings,"" says a headline that the TikTok poster reads from as she points her video camera at her computer screen. TikTok identified this video and others with this message as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) That’s because it’s wrong. The headline comes from a blog post that appears on a website authored by someone named John C. Carleton. The blog claims Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee ordered the kidnappings in ""Executive Order 83"" — but a quick look at the actual executive order shows the blog’s assertion is ridiculous and completely off-base. Lee on Aug. 6 signed the nine-page order, which aimed to combat and respond to the spread of COVID-19 in his state by expanding the capacity of health care providers to meet the need. That month, the number of the state’s new daily cases rose from 1,962 on Aug. 1 to a high of 11,763 before the end of the month, according to data from Tennessee’s health department. Nowhere in the order is there a provision authorizing the National Guard to kidnap people. What the order does say, however, is that in certain emergency and health care settings that are struggling with capacity, the National Guard may perform authorized diagnostic testing, nursing and operate licensed ambulance service vehicles. As part of the TikTokker’s evidence, she clicks on a link that brings her to a page on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. The headline on that page reads, ""Interim Operational Consideration for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings."" But this is not proof of a plan to kidnap people either. As PolitiFact has reported before, the document didn’t recommend kidnapping anyone or putting anyone into ""camps"" but explored a method studied in London that aimed to protect people already living in refugee camps and other humanitarian settings who are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. The document’s creation predated emergency approval of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. And the CDC’s review of that study determined that there was ""no empirical evidence"" that the approach used in London would reduce mortality from COVID-19 infections. Ultimately, in fact, the document emphasized the method’s inherent challenges and risks. In an effort to confront false claims about the effect of Lee’s executive order, Brent Easley, the governor’s legislative director, wrote an Aug. 12 letter to the Tennessee General Assembly.  ""All of these examples, and related rumors, are demonstrably false,"" Easley wrote. ""It is critical that we allow the flexibility for our National Guard members to lean in whenever a need is identified."" A TikTok video claims that the governor of Tennessee signed an executive order allowing the National Guard to begin ""COVID medical kidnappings."" Nothing like this has happened. What did happen is that, faced with skyrocketing COVD-19 cases and limited capacity to treat these cases, the governor of Tennessee signed an executive order allowing the National Guard to help relieve strain on hospitals and medical providers by providing needed medical-related services where authorized. Nothing in the order would allow ""kidnappings."" A CDC document cited as evidence is simply a paper that analyzed a method that aimed to protect people already living in refugee camps and other humanitarian settings who were also at high risk for COVID-19. The CDC determined that there was ""no empirical evidence"" that this approach would reduce the risk of COVID-19 and highlighted the method’s risks and challenges.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2977C0>],/factchecks/2021/oct/07/tiktok-posts/there-are-no-covid-medical-kidnappings-tennessee/

Few religions ban vaccination, but that counts little for religious exemptions
","Coronavirus vaccine mandates are spreading, and with them, pushback based on religion. In Washington, D.C., about 1,500 city health care workers are seeking exemptions for religious reasons. Over 2,000 Los Angeles Police Department workers have filed a lawsuit objecting on religious or medical grounds.  When asked on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" about the number of religions that bar vaccination, infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci said there aren’t many. ""There are precious few religions that actually say, you cannot do that,"" Fauci said Oct. 3. ""I mean, literally less than a handful."" When host Dana Bash asked about people who said it was a matter of their personal faith, not formal doctrine, Fauci said it would be difficult to sort out who might be using that as an excuse. We were curious about the official positions on vaccination among organized religions. Fauci’s statement that very few religions ban getting the shot is accurate, but the law is less concerned with what religious doctrine states and more focused on the individual’s conviction and behavior. Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s review of immunization and religions identified a small subset of Christian faiths that oppose vaccination on theological grounds. There are five, a group that includes the Dutch Reformed Church, Church of the First Born, Faith Assembly and Endtime Ministries. The Vanderbilt list is largely a topline overview, not a comprehensive study of all religions worldwide. Many people might instantly think of Christian Scientists. While many Christian Scientists rely on prayer for healing, the Christian Science Church offered guidance to its members on vaccines in early 2019. It said that ""for more than a century, our denomination has counseled respect for public health authorities and conscientious obedience to the laws of the land, including those requiring vaccination.""  Church leaders impose no decision on church members, but they encourage them to recognize the seriousness of public health concerns. ""Church members are free to make their own choices on all life-decisions, in obedience to the law, including whether or not to vaccinate,"" the statement said. Protestant faiths, Islam, Roman and Orthodox Catholicism, Judaism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and more have no prohibition against vaccination. The Vanderbilt survey named 24 religions in this group. As a counting exercise, Fauci’s statement holds up. But formal doctrine doesn’t drive American law. The Constitution bars the government from getting involved in the establishment of any religion. That would include judging whether a religion held a formal status. Instead, the courts focus on the individual. ""The standard is the sincerity of the personal belief, not whether you're part of an organized religion that prohibits vaccines,"" said University of California Hastings Law School professor Dorit Rubenstein Reiss. Like most, if not all, vaccine mandates, the one for Washington, D.C. workers includes an exemption for ""sincerely held religious beliefs."" ""The problem, of course, is that it can be difficult to disentangle the reasons why someone objects,"" said Wendy Parmet, a Northeastern University law professor. ""States or employers that reject a requested exemption could be vulnerable to litigation.""  What a court has to decide is whether the belief is religious and whether it is sincere. ""A fervently held personal belief can be religious in nature even if it is not endorsed by any recognized or organized religious group,"" Lindsay Wiley, a law professor at American University. ""But not all personal beliefs are religious in nature."" Wiley pointed to a 2020 case when an employee at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia refused to get a flu vaccine. She was fired and then she sued, saying she had been discriminated against for her religion. The Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals didn’t buy it. In terms of religion, the court wrote that it was looking for beliefs that ""address fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters,"" and ""are comprehensive in nature."" The court said the employee had given inconsistent reasons, at one point having said that she thought the vaccine would do more harm than good. That, the court said, was a medical, not religious, belief. Courts might judge present religious sincerity based on past behavior. ""It's relevant if the person has never refused vaccines in the past,"" said Michelle Mello, a law professor at Stanford University.  A history of opposing mask mandates might also weigh against a claim based on religion. A federal court in Pennsylvania ruled against a woman who argued that a mask mandate at her child’s school violated her interpretation of the Bible. She said that she believed that ""people are made in the image of God and it therefore dishonors God to cover our faces."" The judge was unpersuaded about the sincerity of that belief when the woman said she relied on a specific biblical verse, and then was unclear on what the verse said. For the federal workforce, a group of managers from various agencies developed a questionnaire for federal employees seeking a religious exemption. It aligns very closely with the way courts have assessed religious belief and sincerity. The template asks employees to explain how getting vaccinated would ""substantially burden your religious exercise."" It asks how long they have held the specific belief, and whether, as an adult, they have been vaccinated before to prevent such diseases as tetanus or flu. If their religious objection is to the COVID-19 vaccine in particular, the questionnaire asks why this vaccine is different. Two legal frameworks shape how courts consider the intersection of vaccine mandates and religion. For employers, both private and public, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is key. That section prohibits discrimation based on religion.  When mandates apply to non-employment situations, such as school and college campus requirements, the Constitution and the right to the free exercise of religion is more important. And there are instances, such as state-level policies, where both the Civil Rights Act and the Constitution can apply. Under the Civil Rights Act, employers must offer a ""reasonable accommodation"" for a sincerely held religious belief. An accommodation is reasonable, so long as it doesn’t impose an ""undue hardship"" on the firm. ""Undue hardship is defined in Title VII in quite an employer-friendly way,"" said Mello at Stanford Law School. ""If it's more than a minimal burden on business operations, the employer can decline to provide any accommodation."" The legal experts we reached said the present interpretation of the constitutional guidelines is less clear cut. ""Ordinarily, an epidemic would justify restrictions that burdened religious beliefs somewhat, but the current majority of Supreme Court justices seem to be indicating that there are almost always accommodations that the government can give to religious practices,"" said Wendy Mariner, a Boston University law professor. Mariner highlighted the 2021 U.S. Supreme Court ruling against California’s limits on religious gatherings. The majority wrote that the state ""has not shown that ‘public health would be imperiled’ by employing less restrictive measures."" Fauci said that very few religions prohibit vaccination. A survey of religious beliefs by Vanderbilt University backs that up. The survey named five religions that stand against vaccinations, and 24 that accept them. Fauci acknowledged that assessing a person’s religious beliefs can be complicated. The standard for American courts is not a formal stance by a religious organization but whether a person’s belief is genuinely religious and sincere.  Fauci’s statement is correct, but there’s a lot more to unpack. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097205680>],/factchecks/2021/oct/06/anthony-fauci/few-religions-ban-vaccination-counts-little-religi/

Fact-checking Biden’s claim that raising debt limit is usually bipartisan
","Facing the prospect of the federal government running out of money to pay its bills in weeks, President Joe Biden said Senate Republicans are ""reckless"" and ""hypocritical"" by refusing to join Democrats in voting to raise the debt limit. ""Raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking, and it should be,"" Biden said Oct. 4.  Biden pointed the finger at Republicans, saying that they incurred debt during the Trump administration, and the Democrats helped them out at the time. ""Republicans in Congress raised the debt three times when Donald Trump was president and each time with Democrat support, but now they won’t raise it, even though they're responsible for more than $8 trillion in bills incurred in four years under the previous administration,"" Biden said. But Democrats haven’t always joined Republicans in voting to increase the debt limit, said Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader.  ""In 2003, 2005 and 2006, Mr. President, you joined Senate Democrats in opposing debt limit increases and made Republicans do it ourselves,"" McConnell wrote in a letter to Biden, referring to when the Republicans controlled the Senate during the George W. Bush administration. ""You explained on the Senate floor that your ‘no’ votes did not mean that you wanted the majority to let the country default; but rather that the President’s party had to take responsibility for an agenda which you opposed. Your view then is our view now."" Both Biden and McConnell are focusing on time periods that match their argument: Democrats did join Republicans in voting to raise the debt ceiling during the Trump administration, and there were times during the George W. Bush administration when Democrats stuck Republicans with that responsibility. What’s different this time is that Republicans are using a different tactic. While the parties duel over who’s responsible, the clock is ticking. In late September, the House voted to raise the debt ceiling, but Senate Republicans have blocked such attempts. If the debt ceiling isn’t suspended or raised within weeks, the United States won’t be able to cover its bills, which could ripple through the U.S. economy.  Congress has raised or suspended the debt ceiling about 80 times since 1960. For this fact-check, we will largely focus on the more recent time periods cited by Biden and McConnell. Biden was referring to votes between 2017 and 2019 when lawmakers agreed to raise the debt ceiling. The party split varied for each vote with lawmakers in certain factions of the parties objecting. But it’s fair to call these votes bipartisan, since at least dozens of lawmakers from both parties voted in favor of the legislation.  In September 2017, Trump reached a deal with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to extend the debt limit, continue funding the government for three months and approve aid after Hurricane Harvey. In the Senate, 47 Democrats and 33 Republicans voted in favor of the legislation; in the House, 133 Republicans joined all of the Democrats to support the legislation.  In February 2018, after a brief federal government shutdown, Trump signed a deal that included additional spending on defense and domestic programs, disaster aid and raised the debt limit. Lawmakers backed the bipartisan budget deal by wide margins. In August 2019, the Democrats controlled the House and the Trump White House negotiated a deal with Pelosi. Lawmakers from both parties helped pass the legislation.  But debt ceiling votes have not always been bipartisan. Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, in 2010 analyzed the previous five votes on raising the debt limit. He found that in 2004 and 2006, when the Republicans held the majority in the Senate, they delivered nearly all the votes to raise the debt ceiling. When the Democrats held the majority in 2009-10, their party delivered nearly all the votes to raise the debt ceiling. The only exception was 2007 when there was a divided government — a Republican president and a Democratic Senate — and a little more than half of the senators from both parties voted to raise the debt ceiling.   The bottom line is that the Senate holds the responsibility for raising the debt ceiling to avoid economic fallout. ""The Senate has to deliver a debt limit increase,"" Marron wrote in 2010. ""And that means that the Senate majority has to deliver the votes. As a matter of politics, then, debt limit votes are a tax on the majority. The majority has to take the hit for increasing the limit, while the minority gets a free ride."" McConnell pointed to a vote in 2003, when only two Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in voting for raising the debt limit. Biden voted ""no"" on the vote. But on the same day, Biden voted for a smaller increase in the debt ceiling.  In 2004, two Democrats joined Republicans in raising the debt limit. Biden missed the 2004 vote but said at the time, ""I would have cast a symbolic vote against an extension of the debt limit. Today’s fiscal mess, the transformation of historic surpluses into record deficits, is not an accident. It is the inevitable outcome of policies that consistently ignored evidence and experience."" In 2006, no Democrats joined Republicans in voting for the debt limit increase. Biden explained his no vote this way: ""Because this massive accumulation of debt was predicted, because it was foreseeable, because it was unnecessary, because it was the result of willful and reckless disregard for the warnings that were given and for the fundamentals of economic management, I am voting against the debt limit increase."" Partisan posturing between the parties over the debt isn’t unusual. But what is unusual this time is that Republicans are going further than the minority party has in the past by using the filibuster to force the Democrats to increase the debt limit. Democrats did not filibuster debt limit increases in 2003, 2004 and 2006, allowing Senate Republicans to raise the debt limit with a simple majority, said Andrew Carothers, a research analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""This time around, Senate Republicans have already filibustered one bill that would have suspended the debt limit, are likely to filibuster another, and have shown no indication that they will allow Democrats to pass stand-alone legislation to raise or suspend the debt limit outside of the reconciliation process,"" Carothers said.  Over the past decade, every increase in or suspension of the debt limit passed with bipartisan majorities, with the slight caveat that the 2014 debt limit increase passed the House with bipartisan support, but cleared the Senate on a party-line vote, Carothers said. Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, tweeted that while debt limit increases are often partisan, cloture ""votes to allow for debt ceiling increases were generally unanimous prior to 2013. In other words, no one used to filibuster a debt limit increase — at least once it was agreed to."" Biden said, ""Raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking."" Democrats did help pass bipartisan legislation to raise the debt ceiling three times during the Trump administration. Biden used the word ""usually"" here for a good reason. As McConnell noted, there have been times when Democrats largely didn’t join Republicans in raising the debt ceiling. In 2006, Senate Democrats — including Biden — rejected raising the debt ceiling to take a stand on spending. Biden missed a debt ceiling vote in 2004 but said he would have objected to it. An analysis from the Urban Institute in 2010 of votes in the preceding years showed that, when in the minority, both parties relinquished the task of raising the debt ceiling on the majority party. When there was a divided government in 2007, raising the debt ceiling was a bipartisan deal. What sets 2021 apart is the Republicans’ use of filibuster to force Democrats to increase the debt limit. We rate this statement Half True.

Johnson incorrectly claims there are no approved COVID-19 vaccines in America
","With COVID-19 still surging in parts of the country and booster shots being rolled out to strengthen immunity against the virus, many are still hesitant to get their first vaccine doses. A recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a main motivator for those who recently got vaccinated is concerns about the delta variant, which is driving the third wave of the pandemic. Into that mix comes U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, who in an Oct. 4, 2021 appearance on the Tucker Carlson show on Fox News made a series of statements trashing the federal government’s response to COVID, including one that is — at best — flat-out wrong. ""We do not have an approved vaccine in America,"" Johnson said. ""They did it for the Comirnaty — it's available, I guess, in Europe, but the Pfizer vaccine available in the U.S. is not FDA approved — it's got an emergency use authorization."" He went on to add: ""I wrote a letter to the FDA on August 26th — they have still not given me an answer of why didn't they approve it? Why are they basically lying to the American public? That's a serious question to be asked — as we are destroying our health care system with these mandates."" Of course, the Pfizer vaccine has been approved by the FDA. It is now marketed as Comirnaty. Johnson is wrong on that point. Carlson did not correct Johnson’s statement, instead offering: ""At some point, we’re going to learn the depth of the lies and I think it’s going to be shocking to everyone, even those of us who have a very low opinion of those making these decisions."" Let’s dig in a little bit more. The FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine in August The federal U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first COVID-19 vaccine — the Pfizer-BioNTech shots — on August 23, 2021.  Before that, each COVID-19 vaccine approved in the U.S. — Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — had received an emergency use authorization (or EUA) from the FDA, following an expedited process because of the public health emergency the pandemic triggered.   Due to the full FDA approval, the Pfizer vaccine is now marketed as Comirnaty; it’s the same vaccine as the Pfizer vaccines that were available under the emergency use authorization. Comirnaty had previously been authorized in the European Union on May 28, 2021, according to Pfizer. In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Johnson’s staff said the senator wrote a letter to the FDA on Aug. 26 asking for clarification on ""extending the EUA for the vaccine used in the U.S. and ... granting the FDA approval of the Comirnaty vaccine used in Europe and other countries."" That’s the letter Johnson referenced in the interview, saying of the FDA ""they have still not given me an answer of why didn't they approve it?"" But they had approved it three days earlier. Johnson’s confusion seems to extend from a footnote in the FDA documentation (one cited by his staff as evidence for the claim): ""Although COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is approved to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older, there is not sufficient approved vaccine available for distribution to this population in its entirety at the time of reissuance of this EUA."" Thus, the emergency use authorization was extended for those ages 12 to 15, and later for those eligible for booster shots. To be sure, the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have not yet been fully approved and continue to be under the FDA’s emergency use authorization.  But Johnson in his interview said there were no approved vaccines in the U.S. and specifically — and wrongly — said the Pfizer vaccine has not been approved. The emergency use authorization does not mean manufacturers skipped important steps or blew safety standards. The COVID-19 vaccines are proven safe and effective, evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For emergency use authorization, the vaccines had to meet the FDA’s scientific standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality. Moderna completed its submission for full FDA approval of its COVID-19 vaccine for ages 18 and older on Aug. 25, the company announced at the time.  In an interview, Johnson claimed: ""We do not have an approved (COVID) vaccine in America … the Pfizer vaccine available in the U.S. is not FDA approved."" That is entirely untrue. The Pfizer vaccine was approved for full use on Aug. 23, 2021 by the FDA, even though emergency authorization continues with some subsets of the population.

"['West Virginia', 'Energy', 'Trade', 'Carol Miller']","
Have U.S. natural gas exports exceeded their imports?
","How energy independent is the United States? And could the U.S. be losing that edge? Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., raised that prospect in a recent article. Miller and fellow Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington state co-authored an article for RealClear Energy on July 28, 2021, titled, ""Why Is the Biden Administration Attacking America's 'Energy Independence?'"" As evidence of what the United States had achieved in energy independence, the lawmakers wrote that the U.S. ""became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, and until recently, our exports have exceeded our imports."" Is that accurate? Mostly, except for the part about ""until recently."" (Miller’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) Miller is correct that in 2017, U.S. exports of natural gas began exceeding imports, according to annual data tabulated by the Energy Information Administration, a federal office.   Data from the same office shows that since 2017, all of the United States’ consumption needs for natural gas could be supplied domestically, without needing to import any natural gas.   Natural gas exports have continued to exceed natural gas imports during the first seven months of 2021.   What this means is that Miller is wrong to say that U.S. exports of natural gas have outpaced imports ""until recently."" On the other hand, oil has followed a different pattern from natural gas, and that may have been what Miller had been intending to write. The data for crude oil and petroleum products shows that U.S. exports exceeded imports until October 2019, and they have remained in negative territory during most months since then.   This provides some backing for the notion that U.S. energy independence is at risk, but not for the focus on blaming Biden’s policies. The lawmakers argued that President Joe Biden’s moves to pare back drilling in the U.S. and cancel the Keystone XL pipeline could endanger the United States’ hard-won energy independence. In addition, they wrote, the U.S. ""hit a record high"" for oil imports from Russia in June. PolitiFact previously found claims about a recent spike in Russian oil imports to be generally accurate, although we also found the notion that the Keystone XL pipeline could have replaced these Russian imports to be inaccurate. The data, meanwhile, shows that U.S. net imports for oil became negative more than a year before Biden took office. ""U.S. domestic production and consumption of oil both fell sharply last year,"" said Mark Finley, a fellow in energy and global oil at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""Consumption fell due to COVID, both from a weaker economy and from transport-focused policies to limit the spread of the virus. Production fell because the collapse in U.S. and global crude-oil prices caused investment to contract sharply."" This year, Finley said, oil consumption ""has recovered along with the economy and is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. And while production has also partially recovered, it has not come back strongly because companies, and their investors, remain cautious. So domestic consumption has recovered more rapidly than domestic production, pushing the U.S. back into being a small net oil importer. And while the new administration’s policies may over time affect the prospects for domestic production, that has not been the key driver this year."" Miller said, ""We became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, and until recently, our exports have exceeded our imports."" In 2017, U.S. exports of natural gas began to exceed U.S. natural gas imports, but exports of natural gas have remained larger than imports ever since, rather than reversing ""recently."" We rate the statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F4680>],/factchecks/2021/oct/05/carol-miller/have-us-natural-gas-exports-exceeded-their-imports/

No clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the US
","As variants of the coronavirus continue to take more lives in the United States — by and large, among the unvaccinated — an Instagram post blames the increased deaths on COVID-19 vaccines. ""New data shows that death is proportional to dose,"" the post states.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Research shows the unvaccinated are far more likely to die from COVID-19, and that there is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S. The post includes a chart that purports to show the ""relative fatality rate"" rising as second doses of the two-dose Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are given. The user’s source for the claim is an article on Medium that includes a slightly different version of the chart.  The author of that article indicates his expertise is in ""cryptocurrency, quantitative trading and trading technology."" He says in the article that the chart is based on his analysis of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. That analysis is flawed, in that VAERS data cannot be used to conclude that a vaccine caused a death. COVID-19 has killed more than 700,000 people in the U.S. The vaccines authorized in the U.S. — Moderna and Pfizer, along with the single-dose Johnson & Johnson — have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. A minuscule percentage of vaccinated people have died from COVID-19. As of Sept. 27, 2021, more than 183 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated and there were 5,226 breakthrough infections in which the person died, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That comes out to 0.0028%. Of those, 86% were people over age 65. And 17% were people who didn’t have COVID-19 symptoms or whose death was not COVID-related. (For example, someone who was hospitalized for injuries following an auto accident and tested positive for COVID upon hospital admission.) The CDC reported on Sept. 10 that, based on a study of more than 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states from April through mid-July, unvaccinated people were 11 times more likely to die than vaccinated people. There is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S. Researchers are still evaluating whether there is a connection between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and rare types of blood clots that have led to deaths, but such cases are few. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires health care providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, jointly run by the CDC and the FDA, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.  From Dec. 14, 2020, through Sept. 27, 2021, VAERS received 8,164 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. But reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. Anyone can submit a report of an adverse event but the reports themselves are not verified. Incomplete VAERS data is often used in conjunction with false claims about vaccine safety. In a part of the CDC website that addresses the topic of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC notes that ""a review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" An Instagram post states: ""New data shows that death is proportional to dose"" for COVID-19.

How much have W.Va. gas and milk prices increased in a year?
","Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., is expressing displeasure with Democratic spending priorities in Congress, arguing that the expanding federal budget has already resulted in inflation for such key commodities as gasoline and milk.  In an Aug. 12 op-ed for The Intelligencer, a Wheeling newspaper, Capito criticized the Democrats’ ""reckless tax and spending spree"" and suggested that middle-class American families and small businesses will suffer. She used price increases in West Virginia as an example. ""In West Virginia, a gallon of gas is nearly one dollar more than it was a year ago, and we’re paying about 30 cents more for a gallon of milk than we did at this time last year,"" Capito wrote. She added, ""This reckless tax and spending spree is filled with taxes on middle-class Americans and small businesses, and will ultimately be paid for by working families at gas pumps, car dealerships, and grocery stores."" When we looked into the underlying data, we found that Capito’s numerical claim was off somewhat, but not dramatically so.  According to AAA, on Aug. 12, 2020, the average price for a gallon of gas in West Virginia was $2.11. On that same day one year later, the average price for a gallon of gas in West Virginia was $3.05. This is a 94-cent change over one year, which is close to a dollar.   As for milk prices, Capito’s office cited information from data for West Virginia produced by Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. The report found that the price of a gallon of milk was $3.45 in August 2020. At the time of Capito’s statement in August 2021, a gallon of milk in West Virginia was $3.63. That’s an 18-cent increase, not 30 cents. The U.S. Agriculture Department publishes milk price data for selected cities, but none are in West Virginia. Two of the closer cities to West Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Louisville, Ky., saw more than 30-cent increases between August 2020 and August 2021.  It’s worth noting that several factors, including higher demand after business reopenings, have contributed to the price rises for key commodities, not simply government spending. For gasoline, for instance, Patrick De Haan of the gasoline-price service GasBuddy told PolitiFact that the recent rise ""has nothing to do"" with policies instituted by the current White House, although those policies could make a difference years down the road. The biggest factor, De Haan said, is that ""we're comparing to a time when demand was much much lower amidst COVID-19 lockdowns that brought lower prices."" Capito wrote, ""In West Virginia, a gallon of gas is nearly one dollar more than it was a year ago, and we’re paying about 30 cents more for a gallon of milk than we did at this time last year.""  Gas prices in West Virginia did rise nearly a dollar during the year prior to her op-ed. Milk prices also rose, but by less than she said, about 18 cents a gallon, rather than 30 cents.

Fact-checking Bernie Sanders on pharmaceutical lobbying pushback
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took a shot at lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry for blocking progress on a ""human infrastructure"" bill, particularly on a provision that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. During an Oct. 3 interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Sanders attacked drugmakers for spending lavishly to lobby Congress to fight an idea that polls have found is overwhelmingly popular.  ""The time is now for us to stand up to powerful special interests who are currently spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to prevent us from doing what the American people want,"" Sanders said. ""We want to lower, substantially, prescription drug costs in this country, so we're not paying 10 times more for certain drugs than Canada and other countries. And the pharmaceutical industry has 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now trying to stop us."" In the big picture, there’s little doubt that the pharmaceutical industry throws its weight around in Washington. But is Sanders correct about the number of lobbyists fighting the drug-negotiation provision? Not exactly. First, some background on the issue Sanders is referring to. Medicare, the federal program that covers health care costs for Americans over 65, is barred under current law from negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies. To the frustration of Sanders and his allies, the pharmaceutical industry is interested in preserving the status quo, which keeps prices higher than they would otherwise be. (The industry argues that cutting prices would hamper innovation by shrinking the amount of money available for research and development.) A May 2021 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 88% of respondents favored allowing the federal government to negotiate for lower prices on medications, including 77% of Republicans. But pharmaceutical and health products companies have significant sway, spending more than $171 million on lobbying during the first half of 2021, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for campaign finance and lobbying data. That easily ranked No. 1 for any industry over that period; the second-place sector was electronics manufacturing and equipment, which spent $87 million. Asked about Sanders’ source for the lobbyist figure, his office pointed to a database of lobbyists maintained by OpenSecrets. The database counts 1,469 lobbyists whose subject area falls under the definition ""pharmaceuticals/health products."" This figure needs some important context. For starters, the category in the database called ""pharmaceuticals/health products"" includes lobbyists representing more than just drugmakers. It also includes medical device makers, nutritional and dietary supplement companies, pharmaceutical wholesalers, and companies that make personal healthcare products, such as toothpaste, said Dan Auble, a senior researcher with OpenSecrets. These industries don’t necessarily have a dog in the Medicare drug negotiation fight. A different category in the OpenSecrets database is more narrowly focused on the kinds of companies that manufacture the types of drugs that would be affected by a new rule on Medicare negotiations: ""pharmaceutical manufacturing."" The ""pharmaceutical manufacturing"" category includes a smaller number of lobbyists: 794. It’s not clear that all 794 of these pharmaceutical manufacturing lobbyists would be lobbying against the drug-negotiation provision. One of the biggest such lobbying groups is the Association for Accessible Medicines, a group formerly known as the Generic Pharmaceutical Association. The group represents companies that make generic drugs, which would likely benefit from a provision like the one Sanders is seeking. According to OpenSecrets data, the Association for Accessible Medicines has 50 lobbyists. This doesn’t take into account other groups that might benefit from a drug-negotiation provision, such as individual companies that manufacture generic drugs.  It’s impossible to tell from the OpenSecrets database whether a lobbying group or lobbyist would support or oppose Medicare drug negotiation, so the bottom-line number of drugmaker lobbyists fighting the negotiation provision is uncertain.  Still, even if you add to the core ""pharmaceutical manufacturing"" category by including the biotechnology sector, the most recent number of lobbyists would be 1,098, Auble said.  Sanders said, ""The pharmaceutical industry has 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now trying to stop"" Medicare drug price negotiation. The pharmaceutical industry has a large and well-funded lobbying operation, but Sanders’ figure for lobbyists is exaggerated. The group of 1,400 lobbyists cited in the OpenSecrets database includes more than just those representing drugmakers, and the narrower category that covers just drugmakers includes some groups and companies that want to see the Sanders-backed provision pass.

No, a woman didn’t win a $2.5 billion ‘Matrix’ lawsuit over copyright infringement
","An old hoax that the lucrative ""Matrix"" and ""Terminator"" film franchises forked over billions of dollars to a woman who claims they ripped off her work has resurfaced online as the fourth ""Matrix"" movie, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is set to debut in Dec. 2021.  ""Sophia Stewart wrote books in the 70s that were stolen from her by Warner Bros. (Terminator 1-4 & The Matrix 1 & 2!)"" a Sept. 29 Instagram post said. ""Her lawsuit took 30 years but she won Hollywood's biggest lawsuit, $2.5 Billion."" The lawsuit is real, and Sophia Stewart, a writer and paralegal, continues to maintain that the films were based on her ideas. But her case was long ago dismissed, with no such $2.5 billion settlement — not in 2004 when the rumor was first shared, and not now. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On her website, where she describes herself as ""The Mother of the Matrix,"" Stewart claims that she answered a magazine ad in 1986 that said Andy and Larry Wachowski (who would go on to direct the Matrix films and now go by Lilly and Lana Wachowski) were seeking science fiction stories to be made into a comic book. She said she submitted her story ""The Third Eye,"" but never heard back and her manuscript wasn’t returned.   After seeing ""The Matrix"" in 1999, Stewart claimed that she recognized themes and characters from her story and said the same of the ""Terminator"" films. She filed a lawsuit in 2003 against several defendants including the Wachowskis, ""Terminator"" director James Cameron, producers Gale Anne Hurd and Joel Silver, Warner Bros., and 20th Century Fox. She accused them all of copyright infringement and racketeering, and sought over $1 billion in damages. The case was dismissed in June 2005 after the judge ruled that Stewart and her attorneys had failed to produce evidence to support her claims and did not demonstrate a striking similarity between her work and the films.  She later filed another lawsuit, this time against her attorneys who represented her in the case, accusing them of breach of contract and malpractice, among other things. In 2014, the judge ordered that she was entitled to $316,280 stemming from the costs and attorneys fees in the copyright infringement suit.  Stewart responded and sent us court documents but we didn’t see anything that substantiated the claim. The false rumors about the supposed settlement appear to stem from an October 2004 article by the Salt Lake Community College Globe newspaper. The story, titled ""‘Mother of the Matrix’ Victorious,"" mistakenly said that Stewart would recover damages from the films, receiving ""one of the biggest payoffs in the history of Hollywood, as the gross receipts of both films and their sequels total over 2.5 billion dollars."" The article was later found to be full of errors, with the student reporter mistaking Stewart’s successful counter of an early dismissal motion as her winning the case. The Globe issued a correction:  ""In reference to the recent article entitled ‘Mother of the Matrix Victorious,’ some information has been deemed misleading. Ms. Sophia Stewart has not yet won her case against Joel Silver, Time Warner and the Wachowski Bros. The decision on October 4th enabled Ms. Stewart to proceed with her case, as all attempts to have it dismissed were unsuccessful. Ms. Stewart’s case will proceed through the Central District Court of California."" By then the story had already been picked up by other websites, and continues to be shared. An Instagram post claims that Stewart won ""Hollywood’s biggest lawsuit"" over copyright infringement in the ""Matrix"" and ""Terminator"" film franchises and was awarded $2.5 billion. This is inaccurate. The case was dismissed in 2005, with no money going to Stewart.  We rate this claim False.

Gas pipelines didn't freeze during Texas' winter storm
","A week after last month’s deadly failure of the electric grid amid historically cold weather, state lawmakers sought answers from grid operators, energy regulators and oil and gas industry executives.   On Feb. 26, during the second and final day of hearings, lawmakers heard from Grant Ruckel, senior director of government affairs for Energy Transfer — one of the largest pipeline companies in the U.S.   Ruckel was asked about gas pipelines and their role in hampering the gas-fired power plants that struggled to generate electricity at optimal levels during the worst of the storms.   ""Just to be clear, you didn’t have pipelines that froze up — right?"" asked state Rep. Chris Paddie, R-Marshall, chairman of the House State Affairs Committee who has received $3,000 from Energy Transfer’s political action committee. ""Pipelines do not freeze,"" Ruckel said. ""They are naturally insulated. They’re buried beneath the ground.""  His response contradicts what others have said about how natural gas infrastructure faltered during Texas’ winter storm. Grid operators said last month that problems occurred up and down the natural gas production and delivery system — from frozen wellheads to frozen gas-fired power plants.   And Gov. Greg Abbott repeated those claims during a televised interview with WFAA-TV, the ABC affiliate in Dallas, on Feb. 16.  ""My team has been talking to all the natural gas producers and suppliers in the state of Texas all afternoon to accelerate the process of their ability to get (gas),"" Abbott said. ""Their answer is: ‘It's just frozen right now. It's frozen in the pipeline. It's frozen at the rig. It's frozen at the transmission line.’""  Did gas pipelines freeze during Texas historic winter storm? As with many things in the energy sectors, the answer to this question is tangled in technical complexity.  Oil and gas pipeline experts all agree that even the sustained freezing temperatures Texas experienced last month couldn’t freeze gas in pipelines the same way water would. For instance, to turn methane — a fuel commonly used to power gas-fired electricity plants — from a gas to a liquid state would require temperatures around negative 83 degrees Celsius. The process of freezing natural gasses to a liquid state using cryogenics is common for transporting gas products in large tankers, experts said.  ""To take it as literal, that natural gas is frozen in the pipelines, would require temperatures that I don't think have ever been found on the surface of this earth, outside of a cryogenic process,"" said Tony Scott, managing director of analytics at the industry research group BTU Analytics.  ""It’s just a misunderstanding of the system,"" said Chuck Fontenot, vice president of operations at WSP USA, an energy management and consultancy firm whose clients have included Energy Transfer. ""As a rule, natural gas does not freeze.""  It’s also true that natural gas pipelines are required to be buried underground by the U.S. Department of Transportation, and all of Energy Transfer’s 43,500 miles of Texas pipeline meet the U.S. Department of Transportation’s minimum depth standard of 3 feet, the company said.  Although this depth requirement is primarily meant to protect pipelines from damage or interference incurred from agriculture or digging, burying pipelines can serve a dual purpose of keeping temperatures stable. In many northern states, pipeline companies bury pipelines well below the federal minimum standard to dip below frozen ground.   ""Certain companies can choose to do even more for their use,"" Fontenot said. ""Up north they bury pipelines deeper in areas that stay frozen for months on end because the ground stays frozen down to a point. It kind of depends on where you are and where that typical frost depth is. This could be up to 6 feet in the northern U.S.""  An Energy Transfer spokesperson asserted that the company’s pipeline in Texas ""never stopped operating"" during the winter storm. But that doesn’t mean the storm spared mid-stream natural gas infrastructure from harm.  Mid-stream systems, the infrastructure that carries fuels from upstream oil wells to downstream refineries and power plants, include several stages that were compromised by Texas’ winter storm.   After natural gas is separated from the oil and water that are co-mingled in the stream flowing out of an oil well, the gas enters a processing plant where the natural gas is again divided into propane and methane, which is sent on to power plants.  But because many of these processing plants run on electricity and were also cut off from power, they struggled to supply the power plants with enough gas to produce electricity.   ""You end up in this very cyclical feedback where everyone’s out at the same time and they all need the other to get restored,"" said Scott. ""That's the cascading loop of failures when you have such cold temperatures in an area that's just not prepared.""  The sustained freezing temperatures hampered natural gas primarily in the upstream sector. Upstream producers in the fields struggled with things like frozen wellheads and icy roads that prevented trucks from servicing well sites.   Natural gas production in Texas fell from around 21 billion cubic feet of gas to less than 14 billion, and gas moving from more than two dozen West Texas processing plants to pipelines fell by 85%, according to the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.  A pipeline company executive testified before a legislative panel last week and pushed back on claims that pipeline infrastructure froze during Texas winter storm. Ruckel said that pipelines don’t freeze because they are ""naturally insulated"" by being buried underground.   Gas pipelines are required to be buried underground by the U.S. Department of Transportation, although the purpose of burial is more for protection than insulation from winter weather.   It’s also accurate that natural gas itself doesn’t freeze, and only reaches a liquid state under a cryogenic process. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280977094C0>],/factchecks/2021/mar/05/energy-transfer/gas-pipelines-didnt-freeze-during-texas-winter-sto/

Yes, marijuana can increase the risk of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders
","The debate over marijuana has lit up in Wisconsin. Gov. Tony Evers proposed legalizing recreational and medical marijuana in the 2021-23 state budget he unveiled in February. He contends the move would ensure safe products are available to users while providing a new source of revenue for rural schools and programs for marginalized communities.  Wisconsin is in a minority of states that haven’t legalized the drug for medical or recreational use. Republicans are likely to knock down Evers’ proposal after rejecting similar efforts in the previous state budget, though some may be open to medical marijuana. One GOP senator has already made clear why he won’t support legalization. ""The National Academy of Medicine points to a significant correlation between marijuana and psychosis, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders, particularly in teenagers where the risk of developing schizophrenia increases three fold,"" state Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, said in a Feb. 10, 2021 tweet. In response to Kapenga's claim, state Sen. Melissa Agard tweeted ""Youth usage of marijuana has actually gone down in states that have fully legalized."" We rated Agard's claim Half True. There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s dig in to Kapenga's claim.  First, a programming note: Marijuana has many purported impacts on health. Kapenga’s claim focused on schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, so that’s what we’ll address here. When asked for evidence to support his claim, the senator cited several articles that examined the relationship between marijuana and psychotic disorders. According to a definition from the National Institute of Mental Health, people experiencing psychosis have lost some contact with reality and can endure hallucinations or delusions.   We’ll start with the research Kapenga referenced in his tweet.  The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine created a committee to examine scientific literature on the health effects of marijuana, both positive and negative. The resulting 2017 report found ""substantial evidence"" that marijuana use can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, with the risk increasing among frequent users. On the other end of the spectrum, researchers indicated that people with schizophrenia or other psychoses and a history of marijuana use may perform better on cognitive learning and memory tasks. The findings in the National Academies report are cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a separate 2019 study in Europe found the odds of a psychotic disorder increased among daily marijuana users, particularly among those using strains with a higher THC content. (THC is the compound that produces a high.) So, Kapenga is right that a correlation exists between marijuana and psychosis — though it’s worth emphasizing that the chances are greater if you use it often.  What about the impact on teenagers? The National Academies report doesn’t directly discuss this aspect of the issue, as Kapenga’s tweet suggests. But he did cite a 2002 study in New Zealand that found ""a tenth of the cannabis users by age 15 in our sample developed schizophreniform disorder by age 26 compared with 3% of the remaining cohort."" That translates to more than 3 times the cases in early marijuana users.  According to another study, 15 and 16 year olds who tried marijuana were more likely to exhibit three or more early symptoms of psychosis, even when reachers controlled for previous behavioral symptoms.  Overall, researchers believe people who smoke marijuana regularly before age 14 have a 2 to 3 times greater risk of developing schizophrenia or a psychotic disorder, said Daniel Yohanna, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago. That figure aligns with what Kapenga referenced in his tweet.  ""We think that the earlier you smoke and the more you smoke, other factors being controlled for, you have an increased risk of developing schizophrenia,"" Yohanna said.  In a tweet, Kapenga said ""the National Academy of Medicine points to a significant correlation between marijuana and psychosis, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders, particularly in teenagers where the risk of developing schizophrenia increases three fold."" There’s extensive research that shows marijuana can lead to psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, particularly if people start using it as children or teenagers. That said, the risk is greatest among frequent users — not those who occasionally light up at a party.  We rate Kapenga’s claim True.     ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097712280>],/factchecks/2021/mar/05/chris-kapanga/yes-marijuana-can-increase-risk-schizophrenia-and-/

Biden wasn’t involved in Dr. Seuss or Mr. Potato Head changes. They reflect company decisions
","First, the Mr. Potato Head toy dropped the honorific from its name. Then, news broke that Dr. Seuss Enterprises would pull six of the famed children’s author’s books from publication. According to some claims on social media, there was only one person to blame: The new president of the United States. ""Trump took down ISIS,"" read a viral post on Facebook. ""Biden took down Dr. Seuss and Mr. Potato Head."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) President Joe Biden was not involved in the business decisions affecting these two classic children’s icons. Both Dr. Seuss Enterprises and Hasbro made internal decisions about their products on their own. Dr. Seuss Enterprises announced on March 2, the author’s birthday, that it would stop publishing and licensing six Dr. Seuss books that have been criticized for how they depict Black and Asian people. About three dozen titles from the author will remain on bookshelves, including the popular ""Cat in the Hat,"" ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" ""The Lorax"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!""  The company said it decided in 2020 to remove the six titles. ""Dr. Seuss Enterprises, working with a panel of experts, including educators, reviewed our catalog of titles and made the decision last year to cease publication and licensing of the following titles: ‘And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,’ ‘If I Ran the Zoo,’ ‘McElligot’s Pool,’ ‘On Beyond Zebra!’, ‘Scrambled Eggs Super!’, and ‘The Cat’s Quizzer’."" ""These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,"" the company added. For example, in ""If I Ran the Zoo"" men said to be from Africa are shown shirtless, shoeless, wearing grass skirts as they carry an animal. Another page shows men of Asian descent carrying a caged animal on their heads. The text beneath the characters describes them as ""helpers who all wear their eyes at a slant"" from ""countries no one can spell."" March 2 also marks National Reading Across America Day, which was established in 1998 by the National Education Association to encourage reading among children and teenagers.  The event is billed as the nation's biggest celebration of reading, with an estimated 45 million participants. Schools nationwide traditionally hold read-aloud celebrations featuring Dr. Seuss books and characters. In 2017, however, the NEA said it would begin shifting its focus toward a year-round promotion of diverse children’s books. ""Kids need books that are as diverse and complex as the society in which we live,"" an NEA spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email. ""NEA’s Read Across America has evolved since its inception 23 years ago. In 2018, the literacy program not only continued to emphasize the joy, fun, and adventure of reading but we shifted to focus on celebrating a nation of diverse readers by featuring books in which all students can see themselves."" In 2021’s Read Across America presidential proclamation March 1, Biden broke precedent with two previous administrations when he left out Dr. Seuss’s name. But Biden himself was not involved in the decision to remove the Seuss titles from publication or the plan to de-emphasize the author in the national reading celebration. The shift has been years in the making, and the organization has made multiple announcements about its new mission. Hasbro announced on Feb. 25 that it was rebranding its Mr. Potato Head toy by dropping the ""Mr."" from the product name. The company said it will retain the Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters and plans to release a ""create your potato head family"" toy set in fall 2021.  The company faced a backlash online over the change, and it clarified on Twitter that it would continue to sell the original toys. The difference is that the brand name and new family sets will be gender-neutral in order to promote more inclusivity. Hasbro released images of the sets, which portray different kinds of families including ones with two moms, two dads, as well as the traditional Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head couple.  The Biden administration was not involved in Hasbro’s decision or announcement. Facebook posts claim that Biden ""took down"" Dr. Seuss and Mr. Potato Head. This isn’t accurate. Announcements by Dr. Seuss Enterprises and Hasbro reflect internal company decisions. Biden wasn’t involved. Neither has been ""taken down"" by the president of the United States. Hasbro said that Mr. Potato Head will continue to be sold, and more than three dozen Dr. Seuss books remain in circulation. Efforts to move away from tying Seuss to National Read Across America Day preceded Biden’s time in office, as did the company’s decision to discontinue some titles.  This post is False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097240BC0>],/factchecks/2021/mar/05/facebook-posts/biden-wasnt-involved-dr-seuss-or-mr-potato-head-ch/

No, young children cannot take hormones or change their sex
","Misinformation about medical treatments for transgender patients has proliferated in recent weeks, as a spate of events brought transgender rights into the spotlight. The social media backlash was swift following executive actions from President Joe Biden to expand transgender rights, his nomination of a transgender woman for assistant health secretary and the U.S. House of Representatives’ passing of the Equality Act to prohibit discrimation based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  One Facebook post features an image of a father and son from the comic strip ""The Family Circus,"" with text that reads, ""Can I have a cigarette? No, you’re 5. Can I have a beer? No, you’re 5. Can I drive the car? No, you’re 5. Can I take hormones and change my sex? Sure! You know best.""  The onset of puberty is the baseline for medical intervention. Puberty typically occurs between ages 10 and 14 for girls and 12 and 16 for boys.  Guidelines for the medical care of transgender patients, developed by organizations such as the Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, begin with counseling and psychological evaluation by a team of medical professionals before any physical interventions are considered.  If patients have begun to go through puberty, and they have ""demonstrated a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria,"" then treatments such as puberty blockers can be considered, according to the standards of care for transgender people by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Gender dysphoria refers to distress people may experience as a result of the discrepancy between their gender identity and the sex assigned to them at birth. Puberty blockers, which suppress the release of testosterone and estrogen during puberty, allow adolescents ""more time to explore their gender nonconformity and other developmental issues,"" and can be used for a few years, the standards of care say. One guideline for giving the medication says parents or guardians must consent to the treatment and also provide support to the youth during the process.  If a patient decides to continue transitioning, hormone therapy for feminization or masculinization of the body can follow the use of puberty blockers. But, again, the Endocrine Society’s guidelines say patients should be at least 16 years old to receive hormone treatment, which is partly irreversible. Many hospitals, such as the Duke Health Center for Gender Care for Children and Adolescents, will only offer hormone replacement therapies for adolescents 16 or older. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health reports that gender dysphoria in childhood ""does not inevitably continue into adulthood."" One study showed that children who had not yet reached puberty who were referred to clinics for assessment of gender dysphoria had a 12% to 27% persistence rate of gender dysphoria into adulthood.  By comparison, adolescents with gender dysphoria are much more likely to have it persist into adulthood, the association reports, though no formal studies have been conducted for adolescents. A cartoon on Facebook implies that a child who is 5 can ""take hormones and change my sex.""  The information is unsubstantiated. The guidelines for the medical care of transgender patients, developed by organizations such as the Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, do not recommend puberty blockers for children who have not reached puberty; do not recommend hormone treatment for those under 16 years old; and typically restrict genital reassignment surgery to those 18 and older, who also meet other criteria.  We rate this claim False.

"['Elections', 'Mike Pence']","
Mike Pence is wrong that HR 1 forces states to shift to universal mail balloting
","As a Democratic-backed bill on elections and voting worked its way through Congress, former Vice President Mike Pence wrote an op-ed critical of the measure. H.R. 1 combines proposals for voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections. The House passed the bill on March 3, largely along party lines. On the same day, Pence raised multiple objections to the bill in a column that appeared in the Daily Signal, a publication of the conservative Heritage Foundation. The one we will check here is that ""the bill would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots."" That’s not what the bill would do. The bill’s focus is on lifting state restrictions on voters who voluntarily choose to cast their ballot by mail. Put simply, it merely requires states to give everyone access to voting by mail if they want to use it. ""Every state already uses some form of mail-in ballot,"" said Matthew Weil, director of the elections project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""The differences among states right now revolve around how many voters qualify to use them."" Voting experts told PolitiFact that Pence’s phrase, ""universal mail-in balloting,"" isn’t a commonly used term. The term ""all-mail elections"" is more common. This system is currently used in Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington state, and Utah. California recently moved to extend this policy temporarily. Other states that used this process for 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic have not extended it permanently. In all-mail elections, ballots are automatically mailed to every registered voter. ""The voter marks the ballot, puts it in a secrecy envelope or sleeve and then into a separate mailing envelope, signs an affidavit on the exterior of the mailing envelope, and returns the package via mail or by dropping it off,"" according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the all-mail election states offer an in-person alternative for voting as well, but they are used far less frequently than the mail ballots. This isn’t the only way to conduct mail voting. In many states, any qualified voter may vote absentee without offering an excuse. In the remaining states, an excuse is required. Some states offer a permanent absentee-ballot list: voters who ask to be added to the list automatically receive an absentee ballot for future elections. Nothing in H.R. 1 or the amendments that passed the House forces states to adopt ""universal mail-in ballots.""  The law says that states cannot ""impose any additional conditions or requirements"" on an eligible voter’s ability to cast an absentee ballot by mail in federal elections. In addition, the bill nixes state laws requiring identification for mail ballots beyond a voter’s signature, including notarized statements. The bill allows states to set a ""reasonable deadline"" for requesting a mail ballot and returning it to elections officials. And it requires states to treat a mail-in ballot application for one election to stand as an application for all subsequent federal elections. We contacted the Heritage Foundation, where Pence is a distinguished visiting fellow, to ask for their supporting evidence.  They said the bill would enact the ""essential equivalent"" of all-mail voting by requiring states to send applications to receive an absentee ballot by mail to all registered voters and by setting a preference for absentee ballot as the permanent default for voters who choose to do so.  Experts disagree. ""Nothing in H.R. 1 requires ‘universal mail-in ballots,’"" under the definition used in Oregon, Washington, and the other states, Weil said. There’s no question that these H.R. 1 provisions do make demands on some states -- those that require an excuse to vote absentee, those that mandate voter identification beyond signatures for mail ballots, and those that don’t have the option of choosing permanent mail voting. But none of these provisions amount to ""universal mail-in"" voting. Under H.R. 1, states are not required to send everyone a mail ballot. Instead, the bill makes voting by mail an option, not compulsory.  One section of the bill — ""Methods for Requesting Ballot"" —  makes clear that such ballots aren’t required to be sent automatically to voters.  In addition, voting in person won’t be eliminated under H.R. 1, either early voting or on Election Day. The phrase ""polling place"" appears 82 times in the bill, and it includes a section that would require each state to offer in-person early voting.  ""H.R. 1 requires early in-person and Election Day voting access,"" said Danielle Lang, co-director for voting rights and redistricting at the Campaign Legal Center. ""It merely requires all Americans to have access to a vote by mail option if they want to use it."" Pence said H.R. 1 ""would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots."" This is incorrect. H.R. 1 would not force every state to conduct elections almost entirely by mail, as several do now by sending ballots automatically to every registered voter.  Rather, the bill would ease the process of voting by mail for those who want to use it, by lifting rules that require an excuse to vote absentee and mandating proof of identification beyond a signature. It would not require anyone to stop using either early in-person voting or in-person voting on Election Day. We rate the statement False.

COVID-19 vaccine does not cause death, autoimmune diseases
","President Joe Biden says the U.S. will have enough coronavirus vaccines for all adults by the end of May. On social media, anti-vaccine advocates falsely say that effort could lead to autoimmune diseases and death. A Feb. 9 video features former Nevada City, Calif., Mayor Reinette Senum and Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an osteopathic physician. Over the course of an hour, the two women characterize the coronavirus vaccine as ""deadly"" and a ""bioweapon."" The video was published on Bitchute, a video platform similar to YouTube, but one that researchers say hosts large amounts of hate speech and disinformation. A PolitiFact reader asked us to fact-check the video. One claim in particular stuck out: ""Some people are going to die from the vaccine directly,"" Tenpenny said in the video, which has nearly 1 million views. ""But a large number of people are going to start getting horribly sick and get all kinds of autoimmune diseases, 42 days to maybe a year out."" The video was also flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared thousands of times on the platform — despite Facebook’s ban on anti-vaccine content. (Screenshot from Bitchute) Tenpenny is wrong. There is no evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. cause autoimmune diseases or death. Tenpenny is a licensed osteopathic physician based in suburban Cleveland and the author of ""Saying No To Vaccines: A Resource Guide for All Ages."" She runs an alternative health clinic and has previously said vaccines cause autism, a claim public health officials have debunked. Her Facebook page was removed in December for spreading misinformation, but her Instagram account still has more than 126,000 followers. During her interview with Senum — who stepped down from the Nevada City council in July after saying she would not enforce a statewide mask mandate — Tenpenny cited an article she published Dec. 28 on Vaxxter, an anti-vaccine website. In that article, Tenpenny linked to a study about a phenomenon in other coronaviruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, in which certain antibodies can actually worsen the disease. The study does not support her claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause autoimmune diseases, which include conditions like type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis that cause the body to mistakenly attack healthy cells and organs. Public health agencies say the coronavirus vaccine is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to three coronavirus vaccines: one from Pfizer-BioNTech, one from Moderna, and one from Janssen, a pharmaceutical company owned by Johnson & Johnson. Clinical trials — which lasted months and included tens of thousands of participants — indicated no connection between the vaccines and autoimmune diseases. The FDA found ""no specific safety concerns"" associated with any of the three vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that safety data does not apply to people with autoimmune conditions, but the vaccines are still recommended. Millions of Americans have received the coronavirus vaccines. If they caused widespread autoimmune diseases, those instances would be documented in the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. But the system indicates only a handful of self-reported autoimmune diseases, and even that data is unverified. ""While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness,"" the CDC says. ""The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable."" There have been reports of people who received the coronavirus vaccines and later died. But that doesn’t mean the vaccine killed them — the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people. We reached out to Tenpenny for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Her claim is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

GOP lawmaker misleads about HR 1 and removal of ineligible voters
","A common attack on H.R. 1, the Democrats’ voting rights bill, is that the legislation would open the door to voter fraud and allow ineligible people to cast ballots. In a tweet, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., made a series of attacks on the legislation, including that it would ""prevent removal of ineligible voters from registration rolls."" H.R.1 WOULD: ✖️Use taxpayer $ to fund campaigns✖️Ban voter ID✖️Prevent removal of ineligible voters from registration rolls✖️Allow felons and minors to vote✖️Allow 15 days of early voting✖️Accept absentee ballots 10 days after Election Day✖️Legalize ballot harvesting During the 2020 presidential election, some social media posts or allies of then-President Donald Trump spread misleading or false information about ineligible voters — dead people and pets among them — being on voter rolls. Election officials are required by law to maintain accurate voter registration lists. H.R. 1 includes steps elections officials must take before removing voters, but it’s wrong to say that the legislation would prevent removal of ineligible voters. The House approved the legislation March 3 and it now heads to the Senate. Known as the For the People Act, H.R. 1 combines proposals for voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections.  A spokesperson for Stefanik pointed to a section of the bill, Section 1071, that deals with prohibiting or interfering with voter registration. It states that it is unlawful for any person ""to corruptly hinder, interfere with, or prevent another person from registering to vote."" Violations could lead to a fine as well as up to five years in prison. Stefanik spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told PolitiFact that the legislation ""would criminalize the refusal to accept a voter registration application, even if the application does not meet the requirements,"" and that would lead to local officials not removing ineligible voters out of fear of prison time. But that distorts what the bill says. Experts who have analyzed H.R. 1 emphasized that the section highlighted by Stefanik targets corrupt efforts to prevent someone from registering to vote. The provision doesn’t ban election officials from their responsibility to remove ineligible voters. That section ""does not have anything to do with list maintenance and voter removal from the registration lists,"" said Matthew Weil, an expert on elections at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Federal laws currently require states to remove dead people from voter rolls, prohibit states from removing registrants within 90 days of an election, and require states to set basic requirements for maintaining voter rolls. Many states get help from a national consortium, the Electronic Registration Information Center, that shares information with states about voters who moved, or died or have duplicate registrations. But some ineligible voters have remained on the rolls, and in other cases election officials have wrongly purged otherwise valid voters. Mass removals of voters can result in removing largely African American or Hispanic voters. Sarah Brannon, an expert on H.R. 1 at the American Civil Liberties Union, said Section 2502 of the bill specifically allows election officials to remove ineligible voters.   ""The reform in H.R. 1 would be to require evidence that the individual is in fact not eligible before the removal,"" Brannon said. ""But this in no way would prevent the removal of ineligible voters from voter rolls.""   H.R. 1 attempts to improve the process of removing ineligible voters by requiring states to use what it calls ""objective and reliable evidence"" to remove voters.  The legislation states that voters can’t be removed just because they didn’t vote in a past election. Within 48 hours of removal, the state must send a notice to the former registrant, unless the person died, telling them why they were removed and how they can contest the removal. H.R. 1 encourages states to use ERIC, an interstate data crosscheck system, which allows states to share data about voters who moved out of state, as well as other data, said Danielle Lang, a voting rights expert at the Campaign Legal Center. The legislation says that when states are removing voters, they should have the relevant information to confirm the person’s ineligibility including the person’s name, date of birth and last four digits of their Social Security number.  ""Absent those standards, prior cross checks have been riddled with errors,"" Lang said. Whether the legislation would result in a change in the number of voters removed from the rolls is anybody’s guess. Bradley Smith, a law professor at Capital University Law School, said H.R. 1 changes the evidence required to determine that a registration is likely no longer eligible, and therefore will make it harder to remove names. But, Smith said, ""nothing in H.R. 1 prevents removal of ineligible voters per se."" The organization Smith heads up, The Institute for Free Speech, has  criticized H.R. 1. David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said election officials could still remove people for common, legitimate reasons. ""I see nothing in H.R. 1 that would significantly restrict the ability of a state to accurately remove a voter from the voter lists if they had moved out-of-state or died,"" Becker said. Stefanik said H.R. 1 will ""prevent removal of ineligible voters from registration rolls."" No section of the bill prevents an election official from removing an ineligible person on the voting rolls. One section of H.R. 1 details rules that states must follow for removing ineligible voters, including that it must notify the registrants.  We rate this statement False.

Would Congress’ New Voting-Rights Act H.R. 1 Allow ‘Violent Felons’ To Cast A Ballot?
","Would the Democratic-led voting rights legislation H.R. 1 allow murderers and rapists to vote?  That’s the dramatic message Republican California Congressman Doug LaMalfa of Northern California wrote in a recent email to a constituent.  The constituent asked PolitiFact to fact-check the congressman’s claims.  The U.S. House of Representatives passed the sweeping legislation on a party-line vote Wednesday, but the bill faces an uphill battle in the evenly divided Senate, where it will require 60 votes to pass. It includes provisions to require states to enact automatic and same-day voter registration and make it easier to obtain a mail ballot. It also has provisions to increase transparency in campaign financing. Republican lawmakers oppose the bill and have stepped up attacks against it in recent days in interviews and on social media as it moved closer to a vote. Last month, PolitiFact fact-checked several misleading claims about H.R. 1, including statements similar to LaMalfa’s.  The congressman was one of seven California GOP House members who voted to object to certifying last November’s electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Supporters of former President Donald Trump alleged election fraud and irregularities in the two swing states, despite a lack of evidence and legal challenges that went nowhere. Here’s the specific statement from LaMalfa on H.R. 1 that caught our attention:   ""H.R. 1 would also mandate significant changes in election processes that would overrule election practices that have been tailored to thousands of localities across the country. For example, it would force states to restore the voting rights of convicted felons—including violent felons convicted of murder or rape."" We focused on that last part for this fact check. Our Research  Language in H.R. 1 doesn’t expressly mention murderers or rapists. But LaMalfa’s statement is at least partially correct as the bill states that citizens convicted of a crime shall still be allowed to vote ""unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election.""  The congressman omitted that last part about needing to be out of prison.  His statement also ignores the fact that many states already restore voting rights to people convicted of felonies at the end of their sentence. In 18 states including California, felons lose their voting rights only while incarcerated and receive automatic restoration upon release, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 19 more, felons lose their voting rights while incarcerated but regain them after completing parole or probation. In Maine and Vermont, people who are incarcerated never lose the right to vote.  A spokesperson for LaMalfa did not respond to requests for comment. We asked voting rights experts to assess the congressman’s claim. ""I think it’s accurate, but also incomplete and out of context,"" said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, where he teaches constitutional law with a focus on election administration.  Myrna Pérez is director of voting rights and elections at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, which supports H.R. 1. Pérez called LaMalfa’s claim ""misleading,"" given that many states already allow convicted felons to vote after their sentence.  ""The criminal justice system has decided that these people are safe enough to be living and working among us,"" Perez said, adding that people convicted of crimes are expected to work, pay their bills and take care of their children upon release. ""Why is not one of the expectations voting and contributing to your society?"" Our Ruling California Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa claimed H.R. 1 ""would force states to restore the voting rights of convicted felons—including violent felons convicted of murder or rape."" His statement is partly correct but omits some significant points.  The proposed legislation would restore voting rights for all people convicted of a crime but only once they’ve completed their sentence and been released from incarceration.  LaMalfa also ignores the fact that the vast majority of states including California already restore voting rights for people convicted of a crime, either automatically upon their release or after a period of time.  Given these key omissions, we rated LaMalfa’s claim Half True.  HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CA3940>],/factchecks/2021/mar/04/doug-lamalfa/would-congress-new-voting-rights-act-allow-violent/

No, Rubio’s ‘red-flag’ bill would not allow gun confiscation without due process
","A bipartisan bill aimed at helping states curb gun violence is under attack from a national gun rights group claiming that it calls for confiscation of weapons ""based on unsubstantiated accusations"" and ""without due process."" The attack on the bill and its lead sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is made in an image shared on Facebook by the National Association for Gun Rights. The Colorado-based advocacy group has more than 4 million followers on Facebook.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Rubio’s bill would give grants to states to adopt and implement what are known as extreme-risk protection-order laws, or ""red flag"" laws. Under the bill, a court could order the immediate confiscation of a person’s guns on an emergency basis if the person is judged to be a ""significant danger"" to himself or herself, or to others, ""in the near future.""  But the post and the information it links to are misleading. The bill, in fact, spells out a process that calls for sworn testimony and court hearings.  The headline in the image in the Facebook post is: ""STOP ‘red flag’ gun confiscation."" The rest of the post says:  ""‘Red flag’ gun confiscation bills call for legally owned firearms to be forcibly confiscated from law-abiding Americans without due process, based on unsubstantiated accusations from disgruntled family members, neighbors, co-workers, and/or current or ex-romantic partners, or roommates. In other words: Gun confiscation without due process. Sign the petition to stop S.292!"" It links to a petition that claims the bill ""would use YOUR tax dollars to fund grants to bribe states into passing ‘Red Flag’ Gun Confiscation."" The group and Rubio’s office did not reply to our request for additional comment. This is Rubio’s second time proposing a red flag bill. The first was a month after the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in which a 19-year-old former student with a semi-automatic rifle killed 17 people and injured 14 more. News stories reported that there had been warning signs about the shooter, including calls about him to 911 and the FBI, threatening statements he allegedly made and the fact he had a gun. The original bill did not come up for a vote.  Rubio introduced a new version on Feb. 8, 2021. S.292, the Extreme Risk Protection Order and Violence Prevention Act, is cosponsored by Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; and Angus King, I-Maine. The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but no other action has been taken. Florida is among states that already have red flag laws; it took effect in March 2018. Due process broadly refers to the formal proceedings and rules that ensure that the law is administered fairly and reasonably.  Under due process requirements of a criminal case, for example, a person must be given notice of the charges, be allowed to present evidence on their own behalf and receive a decision from a neutral decision maker.  The due process requirements in a given case can vary, though, based on the circumstances or type of proceeding.  To get an extreme-risk protection order under the Rubio bill, a law enforcement officer, family member or household member would have to petition a court with a sworn affidavit stating why the person ""poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to himself or herself or others"" by possessing a gun.  The petitioner can be someone who has a child in common with the person, a current or former dating partner, or someone who lived with the person in the past year. An initial hearing would be held the same day or on the next business day to consider the evidence. The bill says a court could consider evidence such as:  A threat or act of violence by the respondent in the past 12 months; Evidence of a serious mental illness; Past convictions for violent crimes; Threats or use of weapons against himself or herself or others; Recurring use or threat of use of physical force or stalking another person; Corroborated evidence of drug or alcohol abuse; Other relevant information from family or household members; or, Sworn witness testimony. If the court finds ""clear and convincing evidence"" of significant danger ""in the near future,"" it can order that the guns be temporarily confiscated.  The person with the gun does not have a right to be present for the hearing, or even notified of it, said David Kopel, an adjunct law professor at the University of Denver and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute.  However, the court must schedule another hearing within 14 days to determine whether the order should be extended, for up to 12 months. The respondent has the right to participate in that hearing. The National Association for Gun Rights stated that ""Rubio's 'red flag' gun confiscation bill"" calls for guns to be confiscated ""without due process, based on unsubstantiated accusations."" The bill would provide grants to states to enact and implement red flag laws that would allow for courts to order the temporary confiscation of guns from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others because of their gun possession.  In an emergency, based on clear and convincing evidence, a court can order the temporary confiscation of a gun without the person possessing the gun attending a court hearing.  But the bill spells out due process requirements, including sworn testimony and evidence to be presented at the initial hearing, as well as another hearing that’s open to the respondent to determine if a confiscation order should be extended. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression — our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C13FD00>],/factchecks/2021/mar/04/national-association-gun-rights/no-rubios-red-flag-bill-would-not-allow-gun-confis/

What Trump said to encourage COVID-19 vaccine use
","One day after former President Donald Trump urged Americans to ""go get your shot,"" the New York Times reported that he and first lady Melania Trump had quietly received their own COVID-19 vaccines on their way out of the White House in January. The news rankled MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who criticized Trump as having failed to promote the vaccines during his time in the White House. ""While he was president, President Trump never encouraged Americans to get vaccinated,"" Maddow said March 1 on her prime-time TV show. ""Now we know that he himself took the vaccine in secret and never told anyone. What possible benefit was there to him to keep that secret from the public?""  ""I mean, think about all the good that could have done,"" Maddow continued, citing recent polling that showed vaccine hesitancy is disproportionately high among Republican voters. Trump had been a vaccine skeptic for years before he entered the White House.  His under-the-radar vaccination marked a divergence from the example set by other officials who got their vaccines in front of TV cameras, including President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former Vice President Mike Pence. But is it true that as president, Trump ""never encouraged Americans to get vaccinated,"" as Maddow claimed? In short, no. Trump’s public comments about the vaccines were typically in reference to his administration’s efforts to fast-track their development. But in several cases, he touted the life-saving potential of the vaccines. And in a tweet, Trump gave the encouragement Maddow said he never did during his time in the White House. ""The Vaccine and the Vaccine rollout are getting the best of reviews,"" Trump tweeted Dec. 17, one day before the Food and Drug Administration cleared a second vaccine for use. ""Moving along really well. Get those ‘shots’ everyone!""  A screenshot of former President Donald Trump's Dec. 17 tweet about COVID-19 vaccines. (Factba.se) MSNBC did not offer comment for this fact-check. But after PolitiFact reached out, Maddow showed Trump’s December tweet on air as part of a correction.  ""I thought when we reported last night that while he was president, he had actually never told Americans to get vaccinated,"" Maddow said March 2. ""It turns out he did say, in one tweet in December, that everybody should get their shots."" Maddow’s original comments echoed the New York Times’ report about Trump’s private vaccination. The newspaper wrote that Trump’s ""go get your shot"" comment at the Conservative Political Action Conference Feb. 28 was ""the first time he encouraged people to go get vaccinated,"" and that ""he never publicly encouraged people to take it while he was in office."" That is not accurate. The New York Times did not respond to requests for comment. PolitiFact reviewed months of Trump’s vaccine comments using Factba.se, an interactive transcript website that tracked his public statements throughout his presidency. Trump’s ""get those ‘shots’ everyone"" comment from December was a specific example we found of him publicly and explicitly urging people to get vaccinated. But the former president signaled his support in many other ways, expressing hope that the vaccines, once tested and approved, would end the pandemic and help bring about a return to normal life.  For months leading up to the arrival of the first vaccines, Trump feverishly claimed credit for their quick development. At campaign rallies, he told supporters a vote for Biden would ""delay the vaccine,"" while a vote for him would result in a vaccine to ""quickly eradicate the virus."" As clinical trials were getting underway, Trump said in a September press conference that he ""encourage(d) everybody to enroll, as many people as we can,"" in the trials. The vaccines, he said, should go first to frontline workers, the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions. They would not be mandated, he said, but they would be widely available. Trump attended a White House summit celebrating the expected approval of the first vaccines. ""Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine,"" Trump said Dec. 8. Even as he repeatedly claimed, falsely, that the U.S. was rounding the corner on the pandemic without vaccines, Trump continued to tout the progress on development, saying at one October rally: ""We have unbelievable vaccines that are coming out real soon."" By the time the first vaccine was cleared for use, Trump had lost his reelection bid, and his public comments focused more on promoting false claims about the election. A few weeks later, following the U.S. Capitol riot, Trump was barred from Twitter, his preferred communication tool. Top government officials publicly urged him to encourage people to get the vaccine, and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany promised he would do so because ""he wants to see all Americans get this vaccine."" But behind the scenes, Trump declined to be the face of the vaccination campaign, instead letting Pence handle the load, the Associated Press reported.  Trump was vague about when he would be inoculated, writing in a Dec. 14 tweet, ""I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time."" But Trump also celebrated the rollout of the vaccines on Twitter. He repeatedly said that the vaccine was a ""miracle,"" that it was ""safe and effective,"" and that it would end the pandemic. ""It will save millions of lives, and soon end the pandemic once and for all,"" Trump said Dec. 11, the day the FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use.  ""These vaccines are also very safe,"" Trump continued. ""American citizens participated in clinical trials that were far larger than normal, and had no serious side effects. The dedicated and independent experts at the FDA meticulously studied the results of the trials, and it has now passed the gold standard of safety.""  In remarks toward the end of the year, Trump said the world would benefit from the vaccines and held up the rollout as a historic medical achievement. Some health experts said Trump could have done more. Peter Hotez, from the Baylor College of Medicine, said on CNN that if Trump had regularly encouraged Americans to take the vaccine, it would have made a ""big difference,"" especially among his followers, who have relatively high vaccine skepticism, polling shows. ""If the president had been out there touting the impact of vaccines, we would have melted away a lot of that chunk of vaccine hesitancy and vaccine refusal, I believe,"" Hotez said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said he wasn’t aware that Trump got vaccinated. He called it a ""lost opportunity"" to persuade vaccine hesitant people to get shots. ""That would’ve been an extraordinarily good opportunity to get a signal to the people who would clearly have listened to him the way they listened to him in many other ways,"" said Fauci, who got his own shot on camera. ""He has a great deal of influence."" Maddow said, ""While he was president, President Trump never encouraged Americans to get vaccinated."" Trump expressed confidence in the vaccines and vaccination in many different ways — on Twitter and in public remarks — touting their life-saving potential and saying they would be safe and available to all.  We rate Maddow’s claim False.

No, unemployment is not a 'fake' crisis in Wisconsin
","The floundering unemployment system has been an ongoing thorn in Wisconsin’s side, as the outdated system has staggered beneath the weight of a pandemic-fueled surge in claims. It has provided yet another excuse for partisan finger-pointing, with Republicans blaming Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for not taking action to address the crisis, and Democrats noting Republicans haven’t pursued substantive upgrades for the system through the eight years they controlled state government — or throughout 2020. RELATED: No, Evers cannot unilaterally OK a new unemployment system The sides came together — a rare occurrence in recent Wisconsin politics — on the first steps of an overhaul plan, which Evers signed into law Feb. 25, 2021. The project is expected to cost around $100 million and take years to complete. But the runup to that agreement included an interesting moment on the Assembly floor, as Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, took the microphone and chastised his Republican colleagues for the lack of action to that point. ""You guys can try to spin this and try to play politics with something like unemployment insurance, but it’s cynical, and it’s contrary to what we’re here to do today,"" Hintz said Feb. 23, noting steps Republicans have taken in recent years to add requirements for collecting unemployment. ""We need to have some urgency, we need to depoliticize the pandemic, and we need to be honest. ""You need to be honest with yourselves about what the obstacles to UI have been and quit trying to create a fake unemployment insurance crisis because of your guilt over all the things that you did over eight years."" The last line jumped out to us. Is it reasonable to claim Republicans are ""trying to create a fake unemployment insurance crisis""? An audit released in September 2020 found fewer than 1% of calls to the Department of Workforce Development call centers were answered between March and June. That came shortly after Evers had asked the head of the agency to resign over the lingering backlog. RELATED: Evers right that unemployment benefits harder to access, but multiple factors involved in delays In November, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel detailed the devastating struggles of people who had been waiting months for their unemployment checks. For instance, Robert Johnson, a Milwaukee resident, had to sell a snowmobile, guns and a computer to pay bills, and he said his thoughts at one point turned to suicide. At that point in time, more than 74,000 Wisconsin residents were still caught in the backlog of unemployment claims, adding up to over 554,000 weekly claims in need of processing. In December, the Journal Sentinel reported 27,000 people were still stuck in the monthslong backlog. The article included the story of Angela Torres of Berlin, who had to file for bankruptcy while waiting since June for her claim to be processed. News outlets and legislators alike have been flooded with similar stories from people forced into impossible decisions by the system’s failure to do timely processing. The Journal Sentinel in January detailed stories of people still waiting for their checks after the department asserted in December the backlog had been eliminated. In short, there’s nothing fake about this crisis. Joanna Beilman-Dulin, a spokeswoman for Hintz, defended his phasing this way: ""To be clear: Rep. Hintz absolutely believes, and has consistently highlighted, that people not getting their unemployment benefits when they need them was and still is a crisis in Wisconsin,"" she said in an email. ""People not getting their benefits more quickly over the last nine months because legislative Republicans chose to try to make Gov. Evers look bad rather than taking legislative action to address the UI delays, on the other hand, is an artificially-created, or fake, crisis."" DOCUMENT: View a full transcript of Hintz’s remarks here That simply doesn’t ring true. There’s plenty of blame to go around in a discussion of why this crisis existed and persisted, but that doesn’t make it any less of a crisis. And it stemmed from an insufficient system that leaders from both parties failed to address for more than a decade. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle started a project to upgrade the system, but it was abandoned in 2007 after spending $23 million because of delays and cost overruns. His successor, Republican Gov. Scott Walker didn’t revive the project in his eight years despite having full Republican control of the Legislature and audits that showed significant deficiencies. Criticizing Republican inaction in the face of a staggering Wisconsin unemployment system, Hintz said they are ""trying to create a fake unemployment insurance crisis."" There’s a point to be made about Republican inaction throughout 2020, as the Wisconsin Legislature was one of the least active in the nation in the face of the pandemic. But Hintz’s claim went beyond that — to a description that flies in the face of what many Wisconsinites have experienced. This is a very real crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people around the state. We rate Hintz’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976979C0>],/factchecks/2021/mar/04/gordon-hintz/no-unemployment-not-fake-crisis-wisconsin/

Donald Trump will not be re-inaugurated as president on Mar. 4, 2021
","After President Joe Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, defying the predictions of QAnon supporters, some adherents of the conspiracy theory began to claim that his predecessor, Donald Trump, would actually be re-inaugurated as president on March 4, 2021. In recent weeks, social media posts have echoed this theory in posts.  ""The Constitution of the United States had established March 4 as Inauguration Day. Trump will be our 19th president soon,"" reads one from Feb. 23 on Facebook.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The advent of that date and mounting concerns about potential violence have led Washington, D.C. law enforcement to beef up security around the Capitol. During a hearing with defense officials, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., announced that 5,000 National Guard officers would remain in D.C. through March 12 out of fear that the online chatter around the date would translate into real-world violence. ""Some of these people have figured out that apparently 75 years ago, the president used to be inaugurated on March 4. Okay, now why that's relevant, God knows,"" Smith said.  Why does this date have relevance for some QAnon supporters? And how do their claims stack up against the evidence?  U.S. presidential inaugurations were originally held on March 4. Although not specified in the original text of the Constitution, the precursor body to the U.S. Congress picked March 4 as the date that it handed off power to the new government. The 12th Amendment officially set the date as March 4. And in 1933, the 20th Amendment to the Constitution changed the inauguration date to Jan. 20 in order to shorten the presidential transition.  But some QAnon adherents maintain that the 20th Amendment was never adopted and that any president sworn in on Jan. 20 is not a legitimate president, said Travis View, a disinformation researcher and host of the QAnonAnonymous podcast.  Their reasons for believing this are complex, but the general idea rests on a misreading of the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, also titled ""An act to provide a government for the District of Columbia.""  According to Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University, the act consolidated the different neighborhoods of Washington into a single governing entity called a municipal corporation. However, some QAnon adherents believe that the statute effectively dissolved the U.S. government and turned the entire country into a business. Adherents of this theory believe all laws passed after 1871 are illegitimate, including the 20th Amendment, and all presidents since Ulysses S. Grant have held office illegally.  As a result, some adherents maintain that Trump will return on March 4, the original inauguration date, and be sworn in as the 19th president of the restored United States. There’s no validity to the theory. The Organic Act of 1871 didn’t incorporate the entire United States.  ""None of (the Organic Act) has anything to do with the rest of the United States, or the validity of any constitutional amendments or laws enacted after 1871,"" said Michael Morley, a law professor at Florida State University. The belief that Trump will be re-inaugurated on March 4 is controversial within the broader QAnon community, View noted, saying that all of the high-profile QAnon influencers he is aware of have pushed back on the March 4 date.  ""They’re calling it a false flag operation,"" View said.  A Facebook post says Donald Trump will be re-inaugurated as president on March 4, 2021. This conspiracy theory rests on a flawed interpretation of an 1871 bill that consolidated the different neighborhoods of Washington, D.C., into a single entity.  The 20th Amendment to the Constitution changed the inauguration date from March 4 to Jan. 20. And on Jan. 20, 2021, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president for a term of four years. This claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Joe Biden wrong about fastest-growing population group in U.S.
","During remarks before a virtual meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President Joe Biden highlighted the two nations’ historical ties by noting that many Americans have Mexican ancestry. ""As you know, the fastest-growing population in the United States is Hispanic,"" Biden said on March 1. ""And 60% of the Hispanic population is Mexican American. They’re an integral part of our history."" But there’s a problem with the first part of his statement: Asian Americans are actually the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the United States. According to Census Bureau data, the number of Asian Americans grew by 28.7% from 2010 to 2019, the most recent 10-year period of the census. The Hispanic population ranks second for growth, at 20%, narrowly surpassing Native Hawaiian-Pacific Islanders, at 19.6%.   It’s important to note that Hispanics can be of any racial category; the figures we’re citing here are for Hispanics of any race. The totals for other groups do not include any individuals who also have Hispanic ancestry. The White House told PolitiFact that Biden misspoke, and that he should have said that between 1995 and 2020, Hispanics went from 14% of public-school enrollment to 27%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. By comparison, the Asian American percentage rose from 4% to 5%. However, Biden’s comments were not made within the context of discussing education or schools. Hispanics did register the largest numerical population increase of any group. From 2010 to 2019, the number of Hispanics in the U.S. rose by more than 10 million, outpacing the increase in white Americans, which was a bit under 8.6 million. That’s striking, since there are many more whites overall than Hispanics. The white population is 250 million, compared with a bit more than 60 million for the Hispanic population. The increase in Asian Americans was just shy of 5.2 million, reaching a total of 19.5 million.   Still, Biden said ""fastest-growing,"" which refers to the rate of growth, not the absolute number of additional people. Biden said ""the fastest-growing population in the United States is Hispanic."" That’s incorrect: The fastest-growing group is Asian Americans, with Hispanics ranking second. Hispanics did record the largest numerical increase in population of any group between 2010 and 2019, but that’s a different measure than ""fastest growing."" The White House said Biden should have referred to the fastest-growing school populations, even though his remarks overall did not address education.

No proof Trump requested 10,000 Guard troops for Jan. 6 or that Pelosi denied it
","Asked in an interview about the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, former President Donald Trump claimed that he had made a request for 10,000 National Guard troops to be deployed for the rally he led that preceded the attack, and that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it. His claim was widely repeated on social media. There is no clear evidence that Trump made such a request, and no evidence that Pelosi denied one. ""The Speaker’s Office has made it clear publicly and repeatedly that our office was not consulted or contacted concerning any request for the National Guard ahead of Jan. 6,"" said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill.  And that has been confirmed, Hammill pointed out, by the former House’s former head of security, under oath. Trump had encouraged his supporters to come to Washington on Jan. 6 to protest the results of his election loss to Joe Biden. At a rally on the Ellipse, outside the White House, he urged those in attendance to march to the Capitol, where a joint session of Congress was officially counting the electoral votes from the election. The proceedings were interrupted by a mob in an attack that left five people dead. In an Feb. 28 interview, Fox News host Steve Hilton asked Trump if he would have done any differently on Jan. 6. Trump said:  ""We said to the Department of Defense, the top person, days before we had the rally … I requested … I definitely gave the number of 10,000 National Guardsmen, I think you should have 10,000 of the National Guard ready. They took that number. From what I understand, they gave it to the people at the Capitol, which is controlled by Pelosi. And I heard they rejected it because they didn’t think it would look good. So, you know, that was a big mistake."" According to a Jan. 22 Vanity Fair article, Christopher Miller, then the acting defense secretary, said he met with Trump the night before the attack about a matter unrelated to Trump’s rally the next day. But then Trump asked Miller how many troops the Pentagon planned to deploy the next day in D.C., according to Miller’s account.  There is no clear evidence that Trump made a request for 10,000 National Guard troops, but based on what Miller told the magazine, it appears Trump wondered aloud about what was planned: The president, Miller recalled, asked how many troops the Pentagon planned to turn out the following day. ""We’re like, ‘We’re going to provide any National Guard support that the District requests,’"" Miller responded. ""And (Trump) goes, ‘You’re going to need 10,000 people.’ No, I’m not talking bullshit. He said that. And we’re like, ‘Maybe. But you know, someone’s going to have to ask for it.’"" At that point Miller remembered the president telling him, ""‘You do what you need to do. You do what you need to do.’ He said, ‘You’re going to need 10,000.’ That’s what he said. Swear to God."" A Defense Department spokesman said the department ""has no record of such an order being given"" by Trump. In June 2020, Trump did mobilize the National Guard, as well as other federal agencies, in Washington in response to protests over police brutality.  In testimony at a Senate hearing on Feb. 23, former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said he met on Jan. 4 with former House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who reported to Pelosi, and former Senate sergeant-at-arms Michael Stenger, and that Sund requested that National Guard troops be deployed on Jan. 6. (All three men resigned after the attack.) Irving testified that he did not take the discussion as a request. He said that Sund had said only that he had received an offer from the National Guard. Irving said all three men agreed that, based on intelligence reports, there was no need for troops. Irving said he had no discussion about the matter with any congressional leaders until Jan. 6. A spokesman for Trump did not reply to our emails. Trump said he requested ""10,000 National Guardsmen"" for his Jan. 6 rally, but Pelosi ""rejected it.""

Rachel Levine does not support gender confirmation surgery for all children
","Since being nominated for the post of assistant health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine has faced repeated attacks focusing on her identity as a transgender woman.  One of these attacks circulated on social media platforms in the form of a viral image, which features a picture of Levine photoshopped next to a group of prepubescent children.  ""Dr. Rachel Levine, US Assistant Secretary for Health, believes that all children should be allowed to select their gender and have access to government-funded sex reassignment surgery without parental notification or authorization,"" reads the text beside the image. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In support of their claims, Levine’s critics have surfaced a 2017 lecture she gave at Franklin & Marshall College, where she described professional standards of care for transgender youth. They have also referenced a tweet in which Levine cited a study that found that access to puberty blockers decreases the likelihood of suicide and mental health problems for adolecents with gender dysphoria. However, we could not find any instance where Levine advocated for children to receive government-funded gender confirmation surgery without parental consent. Performing genital surgery on prepubescent minors violates professional standards of transgender medicine.  During her lecture at Franklin & Marshall, Levine described the standards of care for transgender patients laid out by professional organizations such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Current U.S. health guidelines do not recommend surgical treatment for minors.  At one point of the lecture, Levine explicitly notes that the guidelines do not recommend any form of medical treatment for children prior to puberty. ""For prepubertal children (with gender dysphoria) there is no medical treatment,"" she says. ""The idea would be to see a counselor or therapist who is supportive and has knowledge about these issues, to work with the parents.""  At another point of the lecture, Levine discusses standards of care for transgender youth, laying out a three-tiered protocol drawn up by professionals in transgender medicine.  Before doctors prescribe any physical interventions, the guidelines require patients to undergo counseling and psychological evaluation by a team of health professionals, including psychologists, pediatricians and endocrinologists. This process also allows kids to begin the process of socially transitioning to another gender by using different names and wearing different clothing.  If a patient has begun to go through puberty and is determined to have experienced ""persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria"" for a long period of time, the youth becomes eligible to receive puberty blockers. These drugs suppress the release of testosterone and estrogen during puberty. The goal of this phase of treatment is to allow transgender youth more time to reflect on their decision. Different youth experience the onset of puberty at different ages, so the guidelines don’t provide a strict age threshold at which patients become eligible for the first stage of treatment. However, most studies of transgender youth have featured subjects at least 12 years old.  If the youth completes this phase of treatment, doctors can slowly start off with interventions such as hormone therapy to masculinize or feminize the body. Some of these changes (such as the deepening of the voice caused by testosterone) are irreversible. Others may require reconstructive surgery to be reversed. Many hospitals, such as the Duke Health Center for Gender Care for Children and Adolescents, will only offer hormone replacement therapies for adolescents 16 or older.  Genital surgery, the last phase of the process, is generally restricted to adults. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health guidelines state that genital surgery shouldn't be performed until the patient reaches the age of majority, which is at least 18 across the U.S. — and there are many other factors besides age that should also be considered. ""Genital surgery should not be carried out until (i) patients reach the legal age of majority to give consent for medical procedures in a given country, and (ii) patients have lived continuously for at least 12 months in the gender role that is congruent with their gender identity. The age threshold should be seen as a minimum criterion and not an indication in and of itself for active intervention,"" the guidelines read.  During her lecture, Levine noted that homeless youth could be eligible for an accelerated transition process. Since these youth lack parental support and are more likely to purchase dangerous black market hormones, she suggested that it might be necessary to skip the puberty-blocker phase of treatment and go straight to hormone therapy. However, at no point in the lecture did Levine state that homeless youth could be eligible for genital surgery before reaching the age of majority.  Facebook posts said that Rachel Levine supports ""government-funded sex reassignment surgery without parental notification or authorization"" for all children. There is no record of Levine supporting genital surgery for young children. In a lecture, Levine stated that ""there is no medical treatment"" for prepubescent children with gender dysphoria.  Performing genital surgery on prepubescent children violates the standards of care laid out by professionals in transgender medicine.  This claim is False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D98940>],/factchecks/2021/mar/02/facebook-posts/rachel-levine-does-not-support-gender-confirmation/
