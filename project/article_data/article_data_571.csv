Texas had highest number of rape offenses in 2020, but did not have highest rate per population
","When Texas adopted a near-total ban on abortion in 2021, the measure did not include exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Gov. Greg Abbott defended this decision during a September news conference after he was asked: ""Why force a rape victim to carry a pregnancy to term?"" Abbott replied: ""Rape is a crime, and Texas will work tirelessly to make sure we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas by aggressively going out and arresting them and prosecuting them and getting them off the streets. So goal no. 1 in the state of Texas is to eliminate rape so that no woman, no person, will be a victim of rape.""  In a June 27 Instagram post, O’Rourke posted a clip of this vow. In the post’s caption, O’Rourke wrote: ""Under Abbott, Texas leads the nation in rape offenses while the rate of arrests for rape has fallen by nearly HALF. What happened to eliminating rape in Texas?"" Before tackling O’Rourke’s claim, it’s important to note Abbott’s statement misconstrued the reality of most rape crimes.  Eight out of 10 cases of rape are committed by someone known to the victim, according to Department of Justice data shared by the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network, or RAINN, an anti-sexual violence organization. Among child and teen victims, that rate is even higher at 93%. Most of these crimes are not perpetrated by unknown assailants, as Abbott’s statement suggests by characterizing rapists on ""the streets."" O’Rourke’s claim about the number of rape offenses in Texas and the rate of arrests for those crimes is supported by data, but lacks important context.  Gina Hinojosa, O’Rourke’s director of policy and research, said the Democrat’s data on rapes in Texas came from a Statista data set that listed the ""Total Number of forcible rape cases reported in the United States in 2020, by state"" from the FBI 2020 Crime in the United States data. The list showed Texas in the top spot, with more reported rapes in 2020 than even California, the most populous state in the country. PolitiFact Texas reviewed the FBI data directly and found that in 2020, Texas had an estimated total 13,509 rape offenses — more than any other state, including California's 13,449 estimated total offenses. So, Texas led in the number of rape offenses in 2020. But it’s important to note that Texas is also among the most populated states in the union, second to only California and about 7 million people ahead of the third most populated state, Florida, according to 2020 Census data. Laura Hoke, spokesperson for the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, recommended over email putting the data in terms of rates. Hinojosa at the O’Rourke campaign noted California with about 10 million more people than Texas had fewer rape offenses than Texas.  Texas had a higher rate of rape offenses compared to California: the rate per 100,000 people was 34.2 rape offenses in California, compared to 46 offenses per 100,000 people in Texas. The rate of rape offenses in Texas was also higher than the national rate that same year, of 38.4 rape crimes for every 100,000 people. But there are several states with higher rates of reported rape crimes per capita. Alaska has a rate of 154.8 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants. And several other states also have higher rates than Texas, e.g. Colorado 62.9, South Dakota 67.1 rate, and Arkansas 73.5 rate. O’Rourke was correct that Texas has more reported rapes than other states, but it’s important to note Texas does not have the highest rate when population is taken into account. The second part of O’Rourke’s statement was that ""the rate of arrests for rape has fallen by nearly HALF"" under Abbott’s tenure in office. Abbott was elected in 2014 and took office in 2015. O’Rourke’s campaign pointed to the clearance rate for rape offenses in Department of Public Safety (DPS) crime reports as evidence to support his claim. The clearance rate is the ratio between offenses ""cleared"" relative to the total number of offenses reported. It encompasses both cases that reached an arrest or an ""exceptional clearance."" The latter is when the case is resolved but some element beyond law enforcement precludes arresting and charging the offender for prosecution. Exceptional clearances apply, for example, when the perpetrator is dead. The clearance rate for rape offenses was 20.3% in 2020 and 38.1% in 2015, when Abbott took office. The campaign was referring to the percent change between 20.3% and 38.1%, meaning the proportion of clearances relative to offenses decreased by 47%. That qualifies as ""nearly half,"" as noted in O’Rourke post. Dottie Carmichael, Texas A&M University Public Policy Research Institute director, said in an email the clearance rate can also be compared in terms of absolute change. There was an 18% decrease in the clearance rate from 38.1% to 20.3% — that’s nearly 19%, which would still be nearly half of the 2015 rate of 38%. This decline in clearance rates isn’t specific to rape crimes in Texas, according to Kim Rossmo, a criminologist at Texas State University. He said clearance rates for serious crimes, include rape and homicide, have been declining for decades. While exceptional clearances are only a fraction of the cases closed, clearances and arrests are not interchangeable. So, not every case included in the clearance rate signifies an arrest. There’s evidence that law enforcement in Austin improperly utilized ""exceptional clearances"" to clear rape cases. An independent audit conducted in 2019 found that the Austin Police Department improperly cleared sexual assault cases in 2017, including more than two dozen cases in three months. ""Even officially in Texas, in Austin, because we are aware already of some misfiling, mis-coding, miscalculation of data already around this topic. We know that there were cases that were exceptionally cleared by the police department and that should not have been coded in that way,"" Juliana Gonzales, senior director of Sexual Assault Services at The SAFE Alliance said. SAFE is an Austin-based organization that serves survivors of sexual assault and exploitation. But Rossmo said that while a fraction of the clearance rate are exceptional clearances, the clearance rate should be close to the arrest rate. The clearance rate is cited because the arrest of one person may clear several offenses, or multiple people may be arrested for one offense, according to the FBI’s webpage on clearances. There were 2,195 arrests in 2015 relative to 12,208 offenses and 1,828 arrests relative to 13,327 offenses in 2020, according to DPS Crime in Texas reports. To O’Rourke’s broader point about linking declining arrest rates to Gov. Greg Abbott: clearance rates are primarily the responsibility of local law enforcement who are investigating, Rossmo said. However, the governor can approve funding and resource allocation to investigating rape.  When reached for comment, Abbott’s campaign listed legislation Abbott signed regarding sexual assault, such as 2019 legislation to reduce the rape kit backlog and 2021 legislation to codify recommendations from The Sexual Assault Survivors’ Task Force, administered by the governor’s office. The O’Rourke campaign said the El Paso Democrat would push to extend the statute of limitations for sexual assault crimes and address the rape kit backlog persisting despite 2019 funding from the legislature. O’Rourke said, ""Under Abbott, Texas leads the nation in rape offenses while the rate of arrests for rape has fallen by nearly HALF."" The numbers in O’Rourke’s claim are correct, though for the first half of the claim putting offenses in terms of offenses per 100,000 people would be more accurate on how Texas fares compared to the rest of the union. For the latter half of the claim, O’Rourke's campaign included cases that did not end with an arrest as the FBI defines it, which includes an arrest, charge, and the offender turned over for prosecution.

","EDITOR’S NOTE: If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, dial 988 to contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. For those deaf and hard of hearing, TTY users should use their preferred relay service or dial 711 then 988. For tips on dealing with bullying, visit Stopbullying.gov.  WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner has long heard speculation and insults about her body. When you’re a 6-foot-9 woman, people tend to notice you. These days, she likely has more important things on her mind than her appearance after being sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges in Russia, where she is waiting to see if President Joe Biden’s proposed prisoner swap comes to fruition. But that hasn’t stopped social media users from making baseless assertions that the Olympic champion and six-time WNBA All-Star is a man posing as a woman, some of them using photos allegedly of Griner to make the claim.  Others have used an online meme template to create a false CNN screenshot saying that Russian officials wanted to perform a DNA test on Griner to determine in which prison she should be housed. These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that Russia has ordered her to undergo a DNA test. Newsweek fact-checkers pointed to a New York Times story that Griner was being held before her trial at a former orphanage used to house women. Nor is there evidence that Griner is a man, as social media users allege. Griner has posted photos of herself as a young girl on her Facebook page and has spoken multiple times about how she has overcome bullying because of her physical appearance. Griner spoke about other people’s reaction to her body and why she decided to pose naked for ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue in 2015. ""I'm sure people are going to have a lot of critical things to say [about these photos]. ‘Yo, she's a man!’ But hey, that's my body and I look the way I look. People are either going to accept me for who I am or they're not,"" Griner told ESPN. ""I don't know what people think I'm hiding. I've heard, ‘Oh, she's not a female, she's a male.’ I've been told, ‘Oh, she's tucking stuff.’ They thought I was tucking. I mean, it's out there. Let me show that I embrace the flatness! I just want people to see somebody who embraces being naked, embraces everything about them being different."" She also told ESPN that she was bullied as a child because of her size, her body and her deep voice. ""I've always been flat-chested. I remember around sixth or seventh grade the ‘cool girls’ would reach out and touch my chest: ‘Yep, nothing.’ I felt like less than a person,"" she said. In a 2017 ESPN video, she described having suicidal thoughts and cutting her wrists because of the bullying. She has since covered those scars with tattoos, she said. She also described being kicked out of a woman’s restroom as an adult in China by another woman who thought she was a man, and said that’s even happened to her in the U.S.  Griner also spoke out against bullying and her body image in an interview on the Mercury’s website in 2021. ""I just remember feeling like a weirdo, feeling like an outcast,"" she said. Griner also wrote about those topics in her 2015 book, ""In My Skin: My Life On and Off the Basketball Court.""

Rapper Fat Joe says no one is making sure hospitals post their prices
","Rapper Fat Joe takes on hospital industry executives in an advertisement, contending that many hospitals are disobeying a law that requires them to publicly post the prices they charge cash-paying patients and insurance companies for every service they offer. The ad, paid for by Power to the Patients, a nonprofit group, states, correctly, that hospitals must list their negotiated prices and asserts that the rule helps patients by making it harder for them to be overcharged. The ad also blames politicians and regulators because the price information is still not necessarily available. ""Nobody’s enforcing that law,"" Joe alleges in the foreboding commercial, which began running on television and social media in April and is still airing. The ad reflects a desire for accountability as policymakers increasingly view price transparency as a tool to lower health care costs. And because the law requiring the posting of prices went into effect more than a year ago, we decided to take a look: Is anyone enforcing it? Turns out there is some enforcement, although the process is more complicated and slower-moving than some observers would like. Under rules that took effect in January 2021, the nation’s more than 6,000 hospitals must post online the rates they’ve negotiated with every insurer for every service, from appendectomies to X-rays, and the prices they charge cash-paying patients. The requirement, which the hospital industry unsuccessfully went to court to stop, stems from the Affordable Care Act and an executive order from the Trump administration. Failure to post the required price information can result in fines of $300 a day, recently increased by the Biden administration to as much as $5,500 a day for the largest hospitals. The idea behind the rule is that consumers, including employers who pay a large chunk of the health insurance bills in the U.S., can use the information to shop for less expensive hospital care, which, in turn, might slow spending or reduce prices. At a minimum, the thinking goes, it will help patients know what to expect. In July, even broader rules went into effect for health insurers, which must post almost all the prices they’ve negotiated — not only with hospitals but also with every other kind of medical facility they contract with, as well as doctors. Hospitals have dragged their feet, and compliance is spotty. Studies have found that many hospitals have posted at least some data but that large shares of the facilities have failed to post everything required. The website of Power to the Patients, which is behind the ad and a broader campaign about health care costs, refers questions to an associated organization, Patient Rights Advocate. It is a nonprofit started by businessperson Cynthia Fisher, who founded two companies and serves on the board of the Boston Beer Co. Fisher saidshe is also the primary funder of Power to the Patients, which she described as a communications organization that has applied to the IRS for nonprofit charity status. In an interview, she cited no specific sources for the claim that no one is enforcing the law, but Patient Rights Advocate has released two related reports, the most recent of which said only 14.3% of 1,000 hospitals it reviewed had posted all the prices the law requires. She praised the Trump and Biden administrations for focusing on price transparency, but she said the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services had not evaluated enough hospitals or moved fast enough to sanction those that have not complied. When the ads began running in April, 15 months after the requirement went into effect, regulators had not fined any hospitals. In early June, CMS issued penalty fines of about $1.1 million against two Georgia hospitals — Northside Hospital Atlanta and Northside Hospital Cherokee, both of which are part of the Georgia Northside Hospital System — that are owned by the same company. Those were the first fines issued under the new rules. As of late July, the agency had sent 368 warning notices to hospitals and issued 188 corrective action plan requests to hospitals that had previously received warning notices but had not yet corrected deficiencies, according to a statement from Dr. Meena Seshamani, deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicare. ""CMS is actively enforcing these rules to ensure people know what a hospital charges for items and services,"" Seshamani said in the statement. But enforcement is neither a quick nor an easy proposition. Each step in the process gives both sides time to work out the details, said Ariel Levin, director of coverage policy at the American Hospital Association. The first step is the warning letter, which outlines the suspected violation, such as not having an accessible file on the website or not including negotiated prices or cash rates. Hospitals have 90 days to respond. For example, Levin said, a hospital might explain that its files have some blank spots because it has not negotiated rates for a particular service with a particular insurer. ""If CMS deems the response appropriate, the case is closed,"" she said. ""If CMS wants more information or doesn’t think it’s right, that’s when the corrective action plan comes in."" Fines are usually the last step. The nearly year and a half that went by before the first fines were issued wasn’t that long, Levin said, considering that both hospitals and regulators needed to learn what the files should contain, that hospitals were given time to resolve technology problems and challenges related to posting the pricing information, and that hospitals were stretched thin because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, the lag triggered impatience. ""Some stakeholders have been frustrated by the slow pace of the enforcement,"" said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. Even so, ""I don’t think it’s fair to say no one is enforcing"" the law, Keith said. CMS has ""issued monetary penalties against the two hospitals in Georgia, which they don’t do very often, and there have been hundreds of warning letters notifying hospitals that they have to fulfill their obligations."" Warning letters are a good step but ""need to be followed with meaningful enforcement,"" said Elizabeth Mitchell, president and CEO of the Purchaser Business Group on Health, which represents large employers that offer health insurance and has long sought more easily accessible price information. And with more than 300 warning letters issued, Mitchell expects ""there will likely be additional fines because we’re not seeing a readiness to comply."" Power to the Patients has thrown its resources into the campaign — Fisher said the ad ""cost millions,"" for instance — because they expect price data to unleash more competition in health care. Consumers will ""have choice, save money, and make their own health decisions based upon knowing prices,"" Fisher said. But that’s not a given, say policy experts, noting that price data alone may not sway patients, who often seek care from providers their doctors recommend and mostly don’t use the shopping tools already available. And until the enormous data files from the hospitals and, more recently, the insurers go from simply being publicly available to being accessible in consumer-friendly formats, they will be difficult for the average patient to use, Keith and other experts said. ""This idea that it will unleash a consumer revolution has not yet come to pass,"" Keith said. Hospitals have taken their time in posting the required price information. Many still need to provide some, or all, of what is required. And enforcement has proved to be time-intensive and bureaucratic. However, the transparency directive is a first-of-its-kind rule, so a learning curve was to be expected, for both hospitals and regulators, as they determined the types of data required and the format in which to post the information. Although it is correct to say that the enforcement has been slow and spotty, experts maintain that ramping it up takes time. And when the ad first aired this spring, enforcement was especially lackluster. However, the ad continues to run unaltered, even as enforcement efforts have started to gain steam. In other words, the statement is partly accurate but leaves out important context.

Barnes right that U.S. has more more oil and gas permits than ever before
","While Republicans argue that the United States needs to do more drilling for oil and gas to deal with rising energy prices, Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Mandela Barnes, a Democrat, has a different perspective on the matter. During discussion of the transition to renewable energy in a recent primary debate, Barnes said: ""This is not a light switch. This is turning the dial. And the fact is, we have more oil and gas permits than ever before right now. We need to focus on that transition to renewable energy."" Let’s dial in on that third sentence. Do we really have more oil and gas permits than ever before? In response to a request for supporting information, the Barnes campaign shared a Yahoo News article from March reporting that oil and gas permitting in the United States has increased under President Joe Biden’s administration. The article relies upon a data dashboard of onshore oil and gas leasing and drilling under the Biden administration from the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation and advocacy organization focusing on the American West. The dashboard, originally published on March 8, 2022, was updated July 21. It mostly relies on data from the U.S. Department of Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the department’s Bureau of Land Management, which is the agency responsible for approving oil and gas drilling permits on public land. Since Barnes said ""permits"" and not ""leases,"" we will focus on the former.  For context, oil and gas companies must obtain a lease for land they want to drill on before applying for a permit. Permits usually expire after two years, but the agency can grant extensions. We’ll start by noting the earliest available permit data tracked by the BLM is from 2010 — so that provides a very limited window for a most-ever claim like the one Barnes made. We’ll also look at the data in two ways — permits that are approved but unused, and all permits. According to the dashboard, as of March 2022, companies held nearly 9,000 approved, but unused, drilling permits. A Bureau of Land Management spokesperson confirmed this, saying that the number of such permits peaked at the end of fiscal year 2021 at 9,623. (The fiscal year ended Sept. 30.) That is the highest total in the last decade.  According to the BLM, the total number of approved but unused drilling permits was at 7,091 at the end of fiscal year 2020. As of May 2022, that total was at 8,920 permits. But what about the total number of existing permits, not just those that are currently unused? An analysis of data from the BLM’s online database shows the number of existing permits has dramatically increased since calendar year 2016, as more permits have been issued and the expiration dates of already issued permits have been extended. Indeed, the number of existing permits also peaked in 2021 at 16,096. Meanwhile, there are 14,427 overall permits so far in 2022, a number that could increase as the year continues. The above data only takes into account onshore oil and gas drilling – not any offshore operations, where oil and gas are extracted from below the Outer Continental Shelf.  Offshore drilling is managed by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is responsible for leasing, and its Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which is responsible for permitting. An analysis of that data, which goes back to 1996, shows the number of approved permits for new wells peaked in 2006 at 381. The number of approved permits has steadily declined since then — likely a result of legislative pressure at the state and federal level to restrict offshore drilling due to environmental concerns. So, the offshore data would have only a small impact on the overall picture. And that picture is one where Barnes is right on the current number, and may well be right on the historic one. But the data is too limited for him to make such a sweeping claim. During a debate, Barnes said ""we have more oil and gas permits than ever before right now."" The Bureau of Land Management confirmed that the number of approved but unused onshore drilling permits reached 9,623 at the end of fiscal year 2021, the highest it’s been in the past decade. The problem is there is no available earlier data, which would really be necessary to make such a sweeping claim. That puts an asterisk on what Barnes said, and means we’re nudging our rating down to Mostly True, which we define as: ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""",[<zip object at 0x000001A55064B880>],/factchecks/2022/aug/09/mandela-barnes/barnes-right-us-has-more-more-oil-and-gas-permits-/

Zick cited the landmark precedent in the case Marbury v. Madison. In 1803, the court wrote that ""it is emphatically the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is."" ""There is no question the court had the power to do what it did"" in overturning Roe v. Wade, Zick said. The White House told PolitiFact that Jean-Pierre misspoke. Legal experts we contacted generally cut her some slack. ""She probably meant to say just that the court’s decision was ‘unconstitutional’ in the sense of being wrong, and a flawed interpretation of the Constitution,"" said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor. Jean-Pierre said overturning Roe v. Wade was an ""unconstitutional action by"" the Supreme Court. Ever since the 1803 Marbury v.

Galante made the comment on ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast in December 2019. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the claim isn’t true. Experts told The Associated Press there’s no documentation of bull sharks in the Great Lakes. The myth also has been debunked by organizations such as the Shedd Aquarium (on Lake Michigan) and the Great Lakes Echo, produced by Michigan State University’s Knight Center for Environmental Journalism. ""There have been no confirmed sightings or captures of bull sharks in the Great Lakes that I’m aware of,"" Jeff Tyson, the fishery management program manager at the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, told the AP in a story published Aug. 5. In the Instagram video, Galante — a biologist and television personality — also said, ""Sharks swimming 1,000 miles from, you know, Louisiana up rivers and getting stuck in the Great Lakes."" Sharks traveling from Louisiana would have to traverse the Mississippi River to reach the Great Lakes. But the Shedd Aquarium noted in a 2014 publication that although bull sharks ""have been known to ascend the Mississippi River from the Gulf of Mexico as far as St. Louis,"" locks and dams plus an electric barrier on the Illinois River ""would make it next to impossible for even a bull shark to enter the Great Lakes.""

No, Senate bill won’t strip $300 billion from Medicare
","As Senate Democrats race to pass what could be their final piece of major legislation before the midterm elections, critics have gone to the airwaves to blast the proposal as hurting older Americans who rely on Medicare. Here’s the narration of one ad, sponsored by a group called the American Prosperity Alliance: ""Higher gas prices, higher grocery bills, everything today is costing too much. Now, Congress is considering a bill that will strip $300 billion dollars from Medicare, money older Americans rely on for their medicine, their treatments, their cures. We are all paying more today, but stripping $300 billion from Medicare? It’s simply too much. So call Congress and tell them to oppose (President Joe) Biden's reckless spending package."" The ad misleadingly paints what is more accurately characterized as nearly $300 billion in savings for consumers and taxpayers. The American Prosperity Alliance has almost no online profile. Its website provides only a link to the ad, and no identifying information or even any pages beyond the homepage. When we asked a better-known group with a similar name, Americans for Prosperity, whether the American Prosperity Alliance was an affiliate, a spokesman, Bill Riggs, said, ""This is NOT our ad and we are not affiliated with this group.""  The ad echoes a theme seen in other attacks on the Democratic-backed proposal, including one the Washington Post Fact Checker gave three Pinocchios out of four in June, meaning it contains ""significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions."" PolitiFact rated a similar ad False in July. The bill, which also includes major provisions on climate change and corporate taxation, appears to be on track to secure the support of all 50 Senate Democrats, which when combined with the vice president’s tie-breaking vote, would be enough to pass even if all Republicans vote against it. The bill would be taken up under a procedural status known as reconciliation that allows bills to pass with a simple majority rather than requiring a 60-vote supermajority to proceed to a final vote.  The problem with the ad’s $300 billion claim is it frames the spending decline as hurting older Americans who are insured under Medicare. That’s not so. Rather, the $300 billion — technically, almost $288 billion, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office analysis — stems from a provision in the Democratic bill that would end the longstanding bar on Medicare from negotiating with drugmakers over the price of certain medicines. Not being able to negotiate prices has meant that Medicare — the pharmaceutical market’s biggest single buyer — could not leverage its weight to secure lower prices for taxpayers. The bill is projected to reduce federal spending by almost $300 billion, but that would reflect government savings and not benefit cuts; Medicare recipients would receive the same amount of medicines. ""In reality, the bill's prescription drug savings would save the federal government nearly $300 billion through 2031 without cutting benefits,"" wrote the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors deficit reduction and has been skeptical of many of Biden’s legislative efforts, citing their cost. ""Lowering Medicare costs is not the same as reducing benefits,"" the committee wrote. ""Quite the opposite — many measures to reduce costs for the government would reduce costs for individuals as well."" After combining the drug-cost savings with the bill’s other health care provisions, Medicare beneficiaries would see decreases in premiums and out-of-pocket costs, including through a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs, the committee projected. ""In addition to saving the government nearly $300 billion, the (bill) would save American families nearly $300 billion more,"" the committee has projected.  Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, another group that seeks to keep deficits low, told PolitiFact he agrees that the ad’s portrayal of the bill is problematic. ""Those are savings resulting mostly from the government negotiating prescription drug prices and limiting drug price increases to inflation,"" Ellis said. ""So rather than taking money out of Medicare, it is reducing Medicare costs."" The American Prosperity Alliance said in an ad that the Senate Democrats’ reconciliation bill ""will strip $300 billion dollars from Medicare."" The federal government would see its outlays reduced by about $300 billion as a result of a Medicare drug-price negotiation provision. However, that reduction wouldn’t represent cuts to Medicare beneficiaries. Rather, by leveraging Medicare’s market power, the government would be able to pay less to provide the same medicines.

ICE proposes ID cards for immigrants at border, but not for access to benefits
","Reports of a new proposal from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide an identification card for certain immigrants entering the U.S. illegally has prompted criticism from Republican lawmakers and social media users.  President Joe Biden ""wants to give illegals ID cards so they can start collecting American benefits,"" conservative commentator Tomi Lahren said July 25 on Twitter. ""Boy, I wonder if that could possibly lead to voter fraud.""  Biden wants to give illegals ID cards so they can start collecting American benefits. Boy, I wonder if that could possibly lead to voter fraud… Her comment was reshared in a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked into the proposed ID cards and found no evidence that these are intended for immigrants to access benefits or that they could lead to voter fraud.  Lahren’s team did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.  A pilot program being developed by ICE would provide Secure Docket Cards as forms of ID to some immigrants entering the U.S. illegally after undergoing a national security background check, according to an ICE spokesperson. Immigrants seeking asylum or apprehended at U.S. borders are detained or released into the U.S. while they await for their cases to be processed. The Department of Homeland Security provides them with a notice to appear, a charging document that explains why the U.S. government seeks to deport them. This notice and other documents are provided on paper, which can be easily lost and is susceptible to damage, according to a statement from ICE. The card would give DHS and recipients access immigration information digitally. A July 1 report from the House Appropriations Committee said $10 million had been allocated for the Secure Docket program, aiming to make DHS more efficient.  Although the program’s specifics are under development, according to an ICE statement, there is no evidence that the Secure Docket Card is being created to allow immigrants in the U.S. illegally to access benefits.  Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are ineligible for almost all federal benefits, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Immigration Forum.  Immigrants might be eligible for certain benefits, such as some health care and nutrition programs, if those benefits are deemed necessary to protect life or guarantee safety in dire situations. Immigrants who are illegally in the U.S. cannot vote in federal elections. Under federal law, U.S. citizenship is required to participate in a national election. States can check databases to verify a voter’s citizenship status. Anyone who violates this law can be deported, fined or incarcerated. The number of cases of noncitizens voting in federal elections is ""minuscule,"" Rutgers University professor Lorraine Minnite previously told PolitiFact. She said, in these cases, noncitizens are accidentally registered to vote when they go to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia currently provide driver’s licenses to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  ICE said the secure card is not an official form of federal identification. A few municipalities across the nation have allowed noncitizens to vote in local elections, such as for school board members or city council. Lahren claimed that ""Biden wants to give illegals ID cards so they can start collecting American benefits."" ICE is developing a Secure Docket Card program, which would grant ID cards to people to track and access information related to their immigration case. There is no evidence that the cards are being created to provide immigrants with benefits or to facilitate voter fraud.  Under federal laws, immigrants in the U.S. illegally are ineligible for most federal benefits, and only U.S. citizens can vote in national elections. If noncitizens vote fraudulently, they can be fined, incarcerated and deported.

No, these grocery list staples do not cause young people to get sick
","Rice, beans, cheese, milk, butter, eggs.  It sounds like a college student’s grocery list (give or take a case of beer). But according to a reel on Facebook, these staple ingredients are not your innocent pantry basics but rather a dangerous source of disease.  The July 27 Facebook reel was initially shared on TikTok in December 2021 and features a 30-second vintage clip of Alfredo Bowman, known online as ""Dr. Sebi.""  ""When someone consumes rice and beans, milk, cheese, butter and eggs,"" Bowman says in the grainy clip, ""by the time that person reaches the age of 30, there's already the manifestation of a disease. Why? The membranes, the mucus membrane has been compromised to the acid food we’ve been ingesting."" According to Dr. Scott Kahan, director of the Washington.D.C.-based National Center for Weight and Wellness, ""There is no reputable scientific evidence supporting this claim."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Physician-reviewed articles from WebMD report that rice, beans, and eggs are all healthy to eat regularly and are good fiber and protein sources.  Milk and cheese both have calcium, vitamins and protein — important building blocks for the human body. But because of the saturated fat in dairy products, consuming them in moderation or substituting low-fat and low-sodium versions can help minimize the risks of heart disease.  Even butter is fine to eat in moderation.  Bowman, who died in 2016, was not a real medical doctor. He was a self-educated herbalist who invented his own line of supplements and promoted an ""alkaline diet"" that permits an extremely limited list of foods based on his belief that diseases were caused by a buildup of mucus and acidity in the body. The foods he listed are prohibited in his diet.  The so-called healing properties of Bowman’s alkaline diet have been debunked numerous times, as has his claim that mucus is the cause of all diseases. Bowman was born in Ilanga, Honduras, in 1933. He received no formal education and was raised by his grandmother, who Bowman said inspired his natural healing methods. According to his website, he suffered from many ailments as a child, and after learning the ""limitations of Western medicine,"" he turned to herbalists who instructed him to follow an ""original African diet."" Bowman went on to develop supplements he would call ""Dr. Sebi’s Cell Food."" According to an obituary in The Telegraph, one of Britain’s three major newspapers, Bowman’s products began to break into the American market in the 1980s. But in 1987, he was charged with practicing medicine without a license after claiming that his methods could cure AIDS, herpes, lupus, sickle cell anemia, and leukemia. Another 1993 lawsuit from New York state prevented him from making therapeutic claims about his products.  His diet still attracted many celebrities, including Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes of TLC, Michael Jackson, and Nipsey Hussle. He continued to promote his diet and supplements until 2016, when he died of pneumonia in Honduran police custody after being arrested in connection with money laundering. But his website, Dr. Sebi’s Cell Food, still sells a wide range of supplements, some costing more than $100, and books continue to be published about his methods. Bowman believed that the key to a healthy body all came down to one thing: pH. His website explains his beliefs:  ""Dr. Sebi recognized that disease is a symptom of the accumulation of mucus and excess acid in the body. He believed that there is in fact only ONE disease, caused by eating acidic foods.""  Because of this belief, Bowman recommends an ""alkaline diet,""which prohibits ""acidic"" foods like meat, dairy, and most grains, and his own supplements, claiming that his method would return the body to its ""natural alkaline state.""  First, Bowman’s mucus theory is flawed. ""Almost all epithelia of the body can produce some form of mucus, usually to protect itself from an aggression like a virus or an irritant,"" said Dr. Benjamin Caballero, professor at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Mucus would be a consequence, not the cause, of the disease."" (Epithelia are thin tissues forming the outer layer of the body's surface and lining hollow structures such as the alimentary canal.)  And there is no scientific evidence to support the effects of an alkaline diet. This is because food can’t substantially change bodily pH, said Caballero. ""The rationale for the alkaline diet goes against all known facts about food, digestion, metabolism, acid-base physiology, renal function, and pathophysiology."" The body regulates acid-base balance on its own. ""Blood pH is one of the most tightly regulated variables in the body,"" Caballero said, maintaining a slightly alkaline pH of about 7.36 to 7.44.  ""We don’t tolerate large fluctuations, so our system prevents them with very strong controls,"" said Caballero. ""Blood pH outside of the normal range usually means there is a disease process going on.""  Our kidneys and lungs work hard to keep blood pH within a narrow range. ""By altering respiration rate, we can eliminate more CO2 and restore the acid-base equilibrium,"" Caballero said. ""And the kidneys can produce urine with variable pH, getting rid of alkaline or acid molecules as needed."" Digestion won’t allow wild pH swings, either, Caballero said; our stomachs contain very strong hydrochloric acid (pH ~ 2) essential for digesting large molecules in food.  ""By the time any food you eat reaches the stomach, its pH is determined by the stomach acidity, not by the original food’s pH,"" he said. And once the food has been digested into smaller molecules like amino acids, fats, and carbohydrates, ""the original pH of foods is totally irrelevant.""  Moreover, ""diseases caused by foods are surprisingly rare,"" said Caballero. Some people are born unable to digest certain foods, have food allergies, or require specific therapeutic diets. ""But these restrictions are not because of the food itself but because of the disease.""  Bowman’s diet does promote plant-based eating and consuming fewer processed foods, which can benefit the body. However, Medical News Today warns that the diet’s prohibition of beans, lentils and meat can make it challenging for followers to consume the protein and vitamins their bodies need. Bowman’s claim that rice and beans, milk, cheese, butter and eggs cause disease and his alkaline diet and theory of what causes illness are not supported by scientific evidence.  We also found no evidence that the foods enumerated in the video, if eaten in moderation, regularly cause disease in young people.  We rate this claim Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D83F440>],/factchecks/2022/aug/05/facebook-posts/no-these-grocery-list-staples-do-not-cause-young-p/

""In fact, research on the link between cancer and endodontic procedures like root canals shows that people who have had these treatments have a lower risk of certain cancers,"" the Guardian reported.

No, the IRS won’t take out $846.3 million in taxes from the $1.34 billion Mega Millions jackpot
","Could a winning Mega Millions ticket be not so lucky after all?  The one winning lottery ticket to the $1.34 billion Mega Millions jackpot in July was sold in Illinois, but whoever won will get to enjoy just a fraction of the winnings while the rest goes to the federal government — at least that’s what one Facebook post claims. The Aug. 3 post appears to be taken from Twitter, where a user posted a screenshot from a Forbes article with the headline, ""Winner of $1.28 Billion Lottery Gets $433.7 Million After Tax."" (The jackpot had risen from $1.28 billion to $1.34 billion by the time the winning numbers were drawn.)  ""Congratulations to the IRS on winning the $846.3 million Mega Millions Jackpot,"" the Twitter user said. The user appears to have based this assumption on a mistaken calculation based on the headline and not on the content of the article itself, which details how the lottery winnings get paid out and what taxes are owed. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook’s parent company, Meta. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Winners of the Mega Millions lottery can choose to be paid one of two ways: a one-time, lump-sum payment or an annual payout. The one-time payment is the amount of cash on hand in the prize pool and is lower than the advertised jackpot, which is an estimate based on projected lottery ticket sales and the current 30-year U.S. Treasury rate. The annual payout consists of 30 payments spread out over 29 years and is the full jackpot amount. Both forms of payment have federal taxes withheld, as well as any applicable state taxes. The $1.34 billion jackpot is the second-largest in Mega Millions history and the largest-ever lottery prize won in Illinois. The Forbes article operates under the belief that the lottery winner will choose the one-time payment, which went from $747.2 million to $780.5 million after the article published. People often choose the one-time payout over the annual payments, as it means getting the money immediately rather than waiting for 30 years for the full sum, although some do prefer the steady income over the years from the annuity. Before the winner can see that money, around 24%, or about $187.3 million, gets withheld for federal taxes, reducing the payment to $593.2 million. The winner will eventually owe more in April when it comes time to file their income taxes, because lottery winnings are considered regular taxable income and the current rate for single filers with incomes above $539,900 and joint filers with incomes over $647,850 is 37%. Because 24% would already be withheld, the winner will need to pay the Internal Revenue Service the remaining 13% in taxes that's still owed, or about $101.4 million. That would mean the Mega Millions winner will ultimately end up paying the IRS about $288.7 million in taxes — nowhere near the $846.3 million as mentioned in the social media post. Because the ticket was bought in Illinois, the winner will also be on the hook for the state's 4.95% income tax, meaning an additional $38.6 million will be lopped off from the winnings. The final payout for the lump-sum option ends up being around $453.2 million. Even if the full jackpot amount was taxed, the money the IRS will receive would be about $495.8 million based on the 37% income tax rate. As of Aug. 5, no one had come forward with the winning lottery ticket. The winner has one year from when the numbers were drawn to claim the jackpot.     A Facebook post shared a Twitter screenshot claiming the winner of the $1.34 billion Mega Millions lottery jackpot will have to pay $846.3 million in taxes to the IRS. The Forbes article used in the screenshot does not say this and explains in detail how the winnings will be taxed if distributed in a one-time, lump-sum payment that is lower than the advertised jackpot. The actual amount of money the winner will be expected to pay in federal taxes for the one-time payment is around $288.7 million million. If the full jackpot amount was taxed, it would still not be anywhere near the figure the post cites.

R.I. Gov. Lincoln Chafee says his administration created 11,100 jobs since 2011
","In his Jan. 15 State of the State address, Governor Lincoln Chafee noted that while the state’s economy still has a way to go to recover from the collapse of 2008, economic indicators such as the unemployment rate and the number of people working had moved ""in the right direction."" It’s easy to lose sight of the progress, he said, but the signs are there. He cited one statistic in particular. ""Since I took office in January 2011,"" he said, ""we have created 11,100 Rhode Island-based jobs.""    At the time he gave his speech, the state’s unemployment rate was 9 percent, tied with Nevada for worst in the nation. So we decided to check his numbers. The 11,100 figure was derived from statistics compiled by the state Department of Labor and Training. Donna A. Murray, the department’s assistant director of labor market information, said it came from subtracting the January 2011 Rhode Island jobs number - 459,500 - from the November 2013 number - 470,600. She qualified it somewhat by noting that the November 2013 figure is an estimate that will be refined later this year when the state has a chance to review all Rhode Island employers’ unemployment insurance filings. So the jobs number was correct. How about the ""we created"" part? Determining how much credit a political leader should get when jobs numbers go up -- or down -- can be tricky. Generally, they’re influenced far more by national economic trends than anything a mayor or governor does. During the period Chafee cites, the national jobs number went from about 139.3 million to 143.2 million, a gain of around 2.8 percent, while Rhode Island’s increase was about 2.4 percent. Did the number of jobs in the state increase because of efforts by the Chafee administration or because of the slow but steady improvements in the national economy? When we examined Cranston Mayor Allan Fung’s claim that his administration created more than 1,000 jobs in the city, Fung provided a spreadsheet of 37 companies that had been directly helped by the city. We checked with officials of some of those companies, who confirmed the city’s help, leading us to rule Fung’s claim Mostly True. We asked the Chafee administration for such specific examples. Spokeswoman Faye Zuckerman didn’t have a similar position-by-position count showing how the administration’s help create specific jobs. Instead, she pointed to Chafee’s Workforce Board, which spent about $10 million in 2013 on training and education programs on its own and in cooperation with hundreds of employers in the state. She also noted Chafee’s efforts to increase state aid to public schools, arguing that better-educated graduates would be better able to get jobs. Then we asked Edinaldo Tebaldi, assistant professor of economics at Bryant University, for guidance. Internal economic policies can have an effect on jobs, he said. But because Rhode Island’s economy is relatively small compared with the rest of New England, it is more sensitive to regional and national trends. Tebaldi said all politicians like to claim credit for job growth but it’s hard to tell how much they drove it and how much was floated by a tide that was coming in anyway. ""It’s really impossible to quantify,"" Tebaldi said. ""We know they have made a contribution, but we don’t know how much."" Our ruling Governor Chafee said ""we have created 11,100 Rhode Island-based jobs"" since January 2011. The number of jobs added in that period is correct. But the gains came at the same time the national economy was improving. The Chafee administration provided no direct evidence that its actions led to any of those jobs. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DA9C200>],/factchecks/2014/feb/02/lincoln-chafee/ri-gov-lincoln-chafee-says-his-administration-crea/

NFL's Goodell: Extra point is almost automatic
","An NFL.com host recently derided the extra point as the ""penny"" play of professional football. The smaller but surer choice of a team’s post-touchdown scoring options, it’s just kind of there. Some think it serves little purpose than being the perfect opportunity to run for the fridge or restroom. What’s an NFL exec to do to keep the game spicy and folks glued to their seats? One idea is to spike the extra point. ""The extra point is almost automatic,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a recent interview on NFL.com. ""I believe we had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd (attempts). So it's a very small fraction of the play, and you want to add excitement with every play."" Goodell mentioned a proposal that would replace the kicked PAT (point after touchdown) and award teams an automatic seven points for a touchdown instead. Then, a coach could gamble by going for an extra point with a run or pass play in the end zone. If they make it, they score eight. If they miss, their score goes back down to six. We are sports-, politics- and stats-loving nerds here at PunditFact, not game-callers, so we’ll conceal our two-cents on the proposal. The reason for it, though, left us intrigued. In honor of the Super Bowl, we wanted to know if Goodell was right about the rarity of missed extra points. Stats are widely available from places like ESPN and the NFL. In this case, they confirm Goodell’s point that the extra-point attempt is mostly a one-point gimme, with just five misses in 1,267 attempts in the 2013 regular season. Of the five missed attempts, four were blocked. Sept. 22: The Green Bay Packers blocked Cincinnati Bengals kicker Mike Nugent’s extra-point attempt in the fourth quarter. Cincinnati won anyway, 34-30. Sept. 22: The Pittsburgh Steelers stuffed a fourth-quarter attempt by Chicago Bears kicker Robbie Gould. The missed PAT was NBD for the Bears, who won 40-23. Nov. 3: Minnesota Vikings kicker Blair Walsh missed his third try for an extra point late in a close game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Vikings lost 27-23. Dec. 8: The Detroit Lions lost to the Philadelphia Eagles 34-20 in a matchup marred by heavy snow. The snow was so intense that Lions kicker David Akers missed his only attempt of the day. He slipped and fell, bringing to mind Charlie Brown, as the Eagles blocked his try. (GIF!) Dec. 22: Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee got a PAT blocked by the Tennessee Titans just before halftime. The Jaguars went on to lose 20-16. The missed PATs by the Jaguars and Vikings could have potentially made a difference in the outcome of the game. Instead of having to shoot for a touchdown to win, those teams could have fought for field-goal range and tried to tie up the game by closing the margin to three points. The league-wide record for missed extra points in 2013 was a low in recent years, down from six misses in 2012, seven in 2011 and 11 in 2010. The latter year was particularly memorable, with the Washington Redskins botching the snap on a PAT attempt that would have tied the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with just seconds to play. And even though it’s comical or crushing depending on your allegiance, let’s relive the notorious wide-right extra point by the New Orleans Saints in 2003. The Saints had the chance to tie up the game against the Jaguars after a near-miraculous touchdown of three lateral passes and no time left on the clock. But nope. Our ruling Let’s sum up our findings: Is the point-after touchdown attempt an almost pre-determined outcome that propels kickers to the top of scoring charts? Yes. More pertinently, did Goodell have his stats straight? Also yes. In football terms, Goodell’s claim is up and it’s GOOD! At PunditFact, we call that True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54C858180>],/factchecks/2014/jan/31/roger-goodell/nfls-goodell-extra-point-almost-automatic/

Sen. Tom Harkin says Cuba has lower child mortality, longer life expectancy than U.S.
","Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, recently spent three days in Cuba -- the longtime socialist adversary of the United States -- to learn more about the island nation’s health care system. For years, some health policy specialists in the United States have been intrigued by Cuba’s health care system. Cuba produces a disproportionate number of doctors, and it has posted relatively strong health statistics in international comparisons, especially considering the country’s shortage of material goods and economic wealth. For some liberals, Cuba’s health care system has offered an alternative to the one in the United States, where millions of Americans have struggled without insurance in recent years. Notably, Michael Moore’s 2007 health care documentary Sicko includes scenes where Americans in need of medical attention travel to Havana and are treated for free at a high-quality hospital. Critics have countered that such free, quality care is available only to the communist elite, not to ordinary Cubans. Harkin certainly saw something promising in Cuba’s health care system. During a press conference upon his return to Washington on Jan. 29, 2014, Harkin -- who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee -- said that Cuba is a ""poor country, but they have a lower child mortality rate than ours. Their life expectancy is now greater than ours. It's interesting — their public health system is quite remarkable."" We wondered whether these statistics are accurate, and what they say about health care in Cuba. Child mortality statistics On child mortality, we found a few data sources that are generally considered credible. According to the CIA Factbook, Cuba infant mortality rate is indeed lower -- an estimated 4.76 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013, compared to 5.90 for the United States. And more precisely given the phrase Harkin chose, Cuba also has a better child mortality rate -- that is, the likelihood of death under 5 years of age. According to the World Health Organization, Cuba had 6 deaths under age 5 per 1,000 live births between 2005 and 2010, compared to 8 deaths for the United States. So on child mortality, Harkin had his numbers right. Life expectancy statistics The data for life expectancy appears to be mixed. According to both the CIA Factbook, the estimated life expectancy for both sexes in 2013 was 78.62 in the United States, compared to 78.05 years in Cuba. And according to the World Health Organization, life expectancy in 2011 was 79 years in the United States and 78 in Cuba. By these sources, Harkin would be wrong. But when we contacted Harkin’s office, they pointed us to data from Pan American Health Organization that backed up their claim. For 2012, the group found that life expectancy was 79.2 years in Cuba, compared to 78.8 years in the U.S. So for life-expectancy numbers, the data is varied, with some supporting Harkin and some not. How reliable is this data? We wondered, however, whether the data from Cuba’s authoritarian government could be trusted. As we looked into it, we heard a measure of skepticism. We did find one area of agreement: Cuba puts a lot of emphasis on its health data. Richard H Streiffer, dean of the College of Community Health Sciences at the University of Alabama, said his conclusion from two visits to Cuba is that Cuban health practitioners are ""very compulsive about collecting data and reporting it regularly."" On a recent trip, Streiffer said, he spent time with a family doctor in a neighborhood clinic. ""Family doctors are mandated to collect certain data,"" he said. ""He had right on his wall a ‘dashboard’ of data characterizing his practice -- an age/sex distribution; an age/sex distribution of the top 10 chronic diseases in his practice; a map of where his patients lived in the neighborhood. You don't find that in the US."" However, some experts said that this obsession with statistics can be a two-edged sword when it comes to reliability. Some say Cuba is so concerned with its infant mortality and life-expectancy statistics that the government takes heavy-handed actions to protect their international rankings. ""Cuba does have a very low infant mortality rate, but pregnant women are treated with very authoritarian tactics to maintain these favorable statistics,"" said Tassie Katherine Hirschfeld, the chair of the department of anthropology at the University of Oklahoma who spent nine months living in Cuba to study the nation's health system. ""They are pressured to undergo abortions that they may not want if prenatal screening detects fetal abnormalities. If pregnant women develop complications, they are placed in ‘Casas de Maternidad’ for monitoring, even if they would prefer to be at home. Individual doctors are pressured by their superiors to reach certain statistical targets. If there is a spike in infant mortality in a certain district, doctors may be fired. There is pressure to falsify statistics."" Hirschfeld said she’s ""a little skeptical"" about the longevity data too, since Cuba has so many risk factors that cause early death in other countries, from unfiltered cigarettes to contaminated water to a meat-heavy diet. In a more benign statistical quirk, Carmelo Mesa-Lago, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Pittsburgh, suggests that the flow of refugees could skew longevity statistics, since those births are recorded but the deaths are not. Transparency would help give the data more credibility, but the Cuban government doesn’t offer much, experts said. ""I would take all Cuban health statistics with a grain of salt,"" Hirschfeld said. Organizations like the Pan-American Health Organization ""rely on national self-reports for data, and Cuba does not allow independent verification of its health claims."" Rodolfo J. Stusser -- a physician and former adviser to the Cuban Ministry of Public Health's Informatics and Tele-Health Division who left for Miami at age 64 -- is another skeptic. While Stusser acknowledges that Cuba has improved some of its health numbers since the revolution, the post-revolution data has been ""overestimated,"" he said. ""The showcasing of infant mortality and life expectancy at birth has been done for ideological reasons,"" he said. Our ruling Harkin said that Cuba has ""a lower child mortality rate than ours. Their life expectancy is now greater than ours."" According to the official statistics, Cuba does beat out the United States for both infant and child mortality, and on life expectancy, the data is mixed, with a slight edge to the United States. However, the combination of the Cuban government’s heavy-handed enforcement of statistical targets and the lack of transparency has led some experts to suggest taking the numbers with a grain of salt. On balance, we rate Harkin’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E740140>],/factchecks/2014/jan/31/tom-harkin/sen-tom-harkin-says-cuba-has-lower-child-mortality/

Marshawn Lynch is second to Terrell Davis for post-season yards per rush, Fox Sports host claims
","Meet the press, he does not want. Marshawn Lynch, the Seattle Seahawks’ Skittles-loving running back, openly admitted to reporters covering the leadup to Super Bowl XLVIII that he was only talking to them ""so I don’t have to pay the fine,"" referring to $50,000 the NFL said he would have to pay for not talking to the media. ""I really don't have too much to say, boss. I really don't,"" he said during his second seven-minute interview that week, according to CBSSports.com. ""I appreciate it, but I don't get it. I'm just here so I won't get fined, boss. That's the only reason I'm here."" The reluctance to talk from a player nicknamed Beast Mode gave sports pundits something new to discuss ahead of Sunday's big game. Was the media overreacting, or was Lynch kind of being a jerk? Joel Klatt, a host and analyst on Fox Sports’ Fox Football Daily, asked a panel of former NFL players Randy Moss, Brian Urlacher and Michael Strahan about Lynch’s wave-making in a Jan. 29 segment. The ex-players agreed that Lynch looked uncomfortable dealing with the media. Klatt said his reluctance won’t matter much to Seahawks fans by Sunday. ""Really, all they care about is that his production continues in the direction that it's going,"" Klatt said. ""When you talk about postseason, second all-time in terms of average yards per rush only to Terrell Davis. So this guy can definitely play."" We wanted to know if Klatt was right about Lynch’s postseason rushing prowess. (A spokesman for Fox Sports did not get back to us.) We turned to the Elias Sports Bureau, which serves up sports statistics for professional sports leagues, including the NFL, and media outlets like ESPN. Statistician Frank Labombarda kindly crunched the numbers for us. For the non-sports junkies, rushing basically measures the progress a team moves down the field. And yards per rush is simply rushing yards divided by rushing attempts. How has Lynch performed in the playoffs? He has rushed 109 times for 560 yards or an average of 5.1 yards per rush. (Nearly 12 percent of Lynch’s playoff yards came on one 67-yard run in the 2011 playoffs. That one run raises Lynch’s average rush by more than half a yard.) That is indeed less than former Davis, the former Denver Broncos running back, who averaged a whopping 5.6 yards per rush over 204 carries. But Lynch's numbers also fall below a host of other NFL players, we found. Here's a sampling: Former San Diego Chargers running back Keith Lincoln (23 attempts, 12 yards per rush); San Francisco QB Colin Kaepernick (51 attempts, 10 yards per rush); New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount (29 attempts, 5.9 yards per rush); Former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Merril Hoge (39 attempts, 6.3 yards per rush). And so on. Turns out, Klatt missed a key qualifier: players who have a minimum of 100 rushing attempts. ""You have to say minimum 100 attempts,"" Labombarda said. ""There are lots of guys who have higher averages."" Among players with a minimum of 100 attempts, Lynch is currently second, Labombarda said. The Seahawks running back is sandwiched between Davis -- at 5.6 yards -- and former Los Angeles Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs running back Marcus Allen, who played for 16 seasons and in 15 playoff games, averaging 5 yards per rush in the postseason. Our ruling Klatt said Marshawn Lynch is ""second all-time in terms of average yards per rush only to Terrell Davis."" When counting all NFL players, Klatt is wrong. But he is on solid ground when calculating for players who have run the ball at least 100 times in the playoffs. Klatt’s statement is partially accurate. So we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E16CDC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/31/joel-klatt/marshawn-lynch-second-terrell-davis-post-season-ya/

Does the NFL's most prolific passer struggle in the cold?
","It’s pretty much impossible to avoid talk about Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning and his career in cold weather. So we won’t even try. Blame the two-week gap between the conference championships and the Super Bowl. Blame ESPN for its non-stop coverage of the big game. Blame whoever decided a Super Bowl in New York (er, New Jersey — sorry, Sen. Booker) was a good idea. Blame the sports media that has exhausted nearly every angle of analysis before Sunday. Whatever the reason, Manning’s performance in frigid temps is one of the most talked about story angles heading into the first outdoor Super Bowl in a northern city. You can find a few examples here, here, here and here. People have come down on both sides of the debate. But is it true? We went deep into the future Hall of Famer’s numbers to find out. Small samples The biggest problem we found in drawing broad conclusions about Manning’s statistics in cold weather games is that the sample size is relatively small. Even for a quarterback who has dropped back to pass 9,300 times in his career including the playoffs, Manning has only played a small fraction of his 262 games in the cold. Much of that is because Manning spent the first 14 seasons of his career with the Indianapolis Colts, who played in the RCA Dome and later Lucas Oil Stadium, which are domed stadiums. It’s also due to Manning’s prowess. In leading perennial Super Bowl contenders to the playoffs, Manning’s Colts were often a top-seeded team. That means they got to play at home, instead of outdoors at a time when temperatures drop. Ten of Manning’s playoff games during his time in Indianapolis were at home in a controlled environment, while seven were on the road. And then there’s the comparison problem. What if all quarterbacks just play worse when it’s cold out? In those temperatures, the oblong ball is harder to throw and catch, the wind becomes a factor and you would expect teams to run the ball more. Not exactly conditions that make for prolific passing performances. Despite all of this, in the true spirit of sports punditry, let’s weigh in anyway, shall we? Manning in the cold Pro-Football Reference keeps a game log for NFL players. Included in each entry is the weather that day. Using that information, we broke down all of Manning’s performances, noting the temperature for each game and his stats. We won’t rely too heavily on his win-loss record, but rather his individual effort. There is a notable difference just comparing Manning’s passing numbers outdoor (136 games) versus indoor (126 games). The below numbers include playoff appearances and tally completions, attempts, yards, touchdowns and interceptions per game. So, inside, Manning completes a few more passes per attempt, throws slightly more touchdowns, slightly fewer interceptions and his quarterback or passer ratings (which factors in completion percentage, passing yards, touchdowns and interception to create a metric that compares quarterbacks) is much higher. The average QB rating for all NFL QBs in 2013 was 84.1 and a perfect score is 158.3, though anything over 90 is considered very good. So basically he’s amazing indoors and a little less amazing outside. Let’s breakdown the outdoor games even further by weather. Manning has played 97 games where its 50 degrees or warmer, and 39 games where it’s colder (as you can see, the sample sizes are getting smaller). There’s greater parity here. Completion percentage is relatively close regardless of the temperature, but the yards are down a bit when in games under 50 degrees, as are touchdowns. Also, interceptions are up when the temperature drops, and Manning’s QB rating dips below 90. Still a very good quarterback, but not his elite self. But what if it gets even colder, like it will be in East Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday. The high for the day is currently forecast in the mid 40s, but kickoff isn’t until 6:30 p.m. and temperatures will be lower then. So let’s assume it’s 40 degrees or less during the game. Manning has 26 games in that environment. It’s worth noting that all but four of them were on the road (hostile environment) and five of them were in the playoffs (good competition). What does it look like per game? Manning’s numbers continue to fall with the temperatures. And his record during that stretch is 12-14. But maybe Manning has improved. The early knock on the former University of Tennessee star was he choked in big games, and he now owns a Super Bowl ring that says otherwise. Perhaps he is better of late in the cold. With a sample size this small you can cherry pick dates that prove or disapprove that point. For example, since joining the Broncos, Manning is just 3-3 in games where it’s 40 degrees or colder out, but his numbers are stellar. Total
attempts Total yards But if you pick a different range of games and temperatures, you’ll get an entirely different result. For example, Sports Illustrated (citing ESPN numbers) notes that, ""Manning’s teams have lost seven of the 10 regular-season and postseason games in which the temperature was 32 degrees or colder. He has thrown 12 interceptions in those games to 11 touchdowns, his completion percentage is 59.4 in those games (career percentage: 65.4), and his 214.1 yards per game total is quite a bit below his career average of 269.5."" We can say Manning has been great as a Bronco in cold weather. Or we can say Manning has a recent history of not performing when it’s below freezing. And in both cases, we’d be right. That’s what happens when sample sizes are small. Manning vs. the league Analysis of Manning’s cold weather performance also often fails to include how other quarterbacks perform when temperatures drop. While league stats in cold weather aren’t readily available, we can try to piece it together ourselves, thanks to Yahoo!, which provides career regular season splits at various temperatures. We took the career passer ratings of the 34 quarterbacks in the league last year with significant playing time and compared it to their career numbers when the temperature is between 21 and 40 degrees, as it should be for Sunday’s Super Bowl. But many of those 34 quarterbacks have played just a game or two in those temperatures. That’s not nearly enough to draw a conclusion. So we also broke out the quarterbacks with 10 or more regular season games in cold weather — there are 12 of them — and compared their quarterback ratings. (This rating is an imperfect metric, but it does factor in completion percentage, yards, touchdowns and interceptions and is widely used.) Games 
in cold *Qualifying QBs averaged 14 pass attempts per teams’ games played, per ESPN Manning only has 10 games in the cold, compared to Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, who has played in 44. Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers has played in 36 cold weather games, twice as many as the next closest quarterback. Both Brady and Roethlisberger had very small dropoffs in their performance in cold weather versus their career numbers. Perhaps that’s a sign that with more games played, statistics will trend toward their career averages. Or maybe Brady and Big Ben, who both play in the Northeast, are familiar with the cold weather and it doesn’t affect them as much. Across the league, there is a significant drop off in quarterback rating when it gets cold out. The rating of the 12 players we focused on in 21-40 degree temperatures is more than 8 points lower than those players’ combined career quarterback rating. (We determined this by plugging all the combined career and cold weather stats of the quarterbacks into this handy calculator, which computed the complex passer rating formula for us. If you’re looking for an average drop off between the 12 players, it’s about -0.53 points, but that doesn’t factor in the number of games played in these conditions.) So there is reason to believe quarterbacks tend to play worse in the cold. Manning is not as good in his 10 regular season games played when the temperature is between 21 and 40. Among quarterbacks with 10 or more games in the cold, it’s one of the larger drop offs. Only his brother, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning and Carson Palmer of the Arizona Cardinals, saw greater discrepancies in their performances. But Manning’s rating of 92.6 is still the third highest of the 14. Only Brady and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers are better. All three are considered elite players and future Hall of Famers. For the record, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has a quarterback rating of 93.6 in two games in cold weather. Our ruling For the purpose of this analysis, we’re fact-checking some of the many tweets we saw this week about Manning and his struggles in the cold weather. So is Peyton Manning worse in the cold? Overall trends say yes, though the sample size is small. Manning’s numbers go down the colder it gets. But we also found that’s typical throughout the league. And since joining the Denver Broncos, Manning has been quite fantastic in conditions close to what we’ll see in the Super Bowl. And even at his worst, he’s still Peyton Manning. Claims that Manning struggles in cold weather are accurate, but require additional explanation. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E742940>],/factchecks/2014/jan/31/tweets/does-nfls-most-prolific-passer-struggle-cold/
"['Florida', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
Alex Sink 'supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies,' NRCC says
","In the special election for a U.S. House seat, Republicans are taking aim at Democratic nominee Alex Sink’s career in both the public and private sector. On a website called The Real Alex Sink Truth Team -- intentionally aping Sink’s own Truth Team page -- the National Republican Campaign Committee calls her out for allegedly supporting higher taxes while serving as Florida’s elected chief financial officer, or CFO. ""Alex Sink has consistently supported higher taxes, including property taxes, sales taxes, and taxes on water, sewer and cable television,"" the site reads. ""She even supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies."" We’ve seen all these claims often repeated during the campaign (so far, we’ve rated the one on water and TV Mostly True). But the one about whether she supported a tax on homeowners insurance deserves some attention. Avoiding a catastrophe To back up this claim, the the NRCC pointed us to a story in the Palm Beach Post from June 2008, after Sink had become CFO. The article detailed a Cabinet meeting between then-Gov. Charlie Crist and Sink, both of whom voted to extend a 1 percent assessment on private home, car, boat and motorcycle policies to cover a $625 million shortfall in the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, often referred to as the CAT fund. The assessment was put in place in 2007 to cover outstanding claims from the very heavy 2005 hurricane season. The purpose of the fund -- established in 1993 after Hurricane Andrew destabilized the state’s insurance market -- is to pay policyholders when insurers are unable to cover all their obligations. Because of the vast number of claims following Hurricane Wilma, the fund was falling short, so an emergency assessment was enacted to cover the lack of funds. By law, the fund only has to pay out claims to the extent of its cash balance, and it issues bonds to cover the difference should claims exceed that balance. To cover the repayment of those bonds, an emergency assessment is made on all policyholders to share the burden. The 2007 assessment was set to expire in 2012, but Crist and Sink changed that so the assessment would last until Dec. 31, 2014. The NRCC pointed to a partial quote from Sink, who said extending the assessment was ""really a tax on insurance policies."" But nuances keep this from being slam-dunk support for the NRCC’s claim. First, in a literal sense, the emergency assessment is not a tax. The state statute for the CAT fund says so. In addition, there’s evidence that Sink was not a fan of the process at work here. The fund was facing scads of new claims after Wilma, and Sink had been supporting changes in state law to shore up its finances. But state legislators hadn’t taken action on her recommendations before the extension. She and Attorney General Bill McCollum continued to press the Legislature for changes to Citizens after the extension, as well. ""It's certainly not a good time to be telling homeowners they've got a $600 million tax increase in addition to what they were already paying,"" Sink was quoted as saying about a month before the vote, referring to the onset of the Great Recession and again characterizing the assessment as a tax. She confirmed to us through her campaign that she ""believed it was not a good time to keep the assessment and was not an enthusiastic supporter of it."" Crist and Sink both voiced concerns that state policyholders were on the hook for potentially fraudulent claims, but agreed to extend the assessment because CAT fund director Jack Nicholson said there were only about 10 or 20 weeks worth of money still available for payouts. One alternative would have been to increase the emergency assessment, which happened when it was bumped up to 1.3 percent in January 2011, covering an additional $676 million in bond payments, and is slated to last until July 1, 2016. A big reason for the shortfall was the poor estimates from insurers about how much they would need to cover claims, a process that happened in 2006, before Crist and Sink took office. Nicholson told PolitiFact the fund now ""is in the best situation that it has ever been in financially,"" and that it would take storm claims in excess of $25 billion to force the state to issue more bonds. Our ruling The NRCC said Alex Sink ""supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies,"" and it used Sink’s own words as evidence. In casting her Cabinet vote to extend an emergency assessment on policyholders to pay for hurricane claims, she did use the term ""tax."" However, it wasn’t officially a tax. And Sink supported the policy grudgingly, saying it was unfair that consumers would have to continue paying for old storm damages. Sink had a history before and after the Cabinet vote of trying to scale down the state’s exposure to hurricane coverage and reinsurance to private companies The ad is wrong to call it a tax, but Sink’s vote -- grudging though it was -- did serve to maintain an increase in insured consumers’ out-of-pocket costs, which had the effect of seeming a lot like a tax to policyholders. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EBB7900>],/factchecks/2014/jan/31/national-republican-congressional-committee/alex-sink-supported-tax-homeowners-insurance-polic/

David Dewhurst appears to be first lieutenant governor with state security detail, but he's said he initially declined it
","Todd Staples, a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Texas, charged incumbent David Dewhurst, standing to his left, with a self-oriented achievement. At a Jan. 27, 2014, debate, hosted by KERA-TV, Channel 13 in Dallas, Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, said: ""I wish the lieutenant governor was more focused on what we’re spending in public schools rather than... being the first lieutenant governor in history to have a personal security detail. I would be more worried about what’s going on in the security of our schools rather than having a personal security detail that drives you from place to place and sweeps rooms before you go in."" Is Dewhurst, the lieutenant governor since 2003, making history with a security phalanx? Law enforcement agency confirms To our inquiry, Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, confirmed  that Dewhurst is the first lieutenant governor to have a state security detail. Asked if the detail is provided full time or on an as-needed basis, Vinger said the agency does not discuss security specifics. Generally, Vinger told us by email, the DPS ""is committed to protecting any state official that may be under threat conditions, especially considering that the threat environment has changed dramatically over the last decade,"" Vinger said. ""The Texas Government Code, Section 411.002(a) charges DPS with enforcing the laws protecting public safety and providing for the prevention and detection of crime. ""This includes any threat or attempt to physically harm any state official,"" Vinger wrote. ""The department deploys resources to detect and prevent such an act from occurring. Protecting the governor, lieutenant governor,"" Texas House ""speaker, attorney general and other state officials is a critical mission of the department, and DPS has a responsibility to perform these and other security related missions, such as protecting the state Capitol."" Dewhurst: 'I didn't request protection' Word of officials beyond Gov. Rick Perry getting greater security attention surfaced in early 2011, a year after a man fired shots on the south steps of the Texas Capitol before getting tackled by state troopers, according to a Jan. 21, 2010, Associated Press news story. On Jan. 12, 2011, a news story in the Dallas Morning News called Dewhurst the ""first Texas lieutenant governor to have a security detail, though governors have had them for years."" But the story quoted an unidentified spokesman for Dewhurst saying that Dewhurst did not request the security. In a political analysis published Jan. 14, 2011, Ross Ramsey of the Texas Tribune noted that Capitol security had been beefed up the year before in various ways including the placement of metal detectors at main entrances. An Austin American-Statesman news story published that day quoted Dewhurst as saying that the DPS ""came to me months ago and recommended security, but I have resisted. In December, because of some credible threats, I agreed to it when I am in public places, public functions -- not all the time."" Dewhurst did not elaborate on the threats. Dewhurst further said that his added security included an occasional DPS detail, driver and a state vehicle, a black SUV that had been in his parking spot outside the Capitol much of the week. The story further said that according to Dewhurst, House Speaker Joe Straus and Attorney General Greg Abbott had also been provided state guards. To our telephone inquiries, Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland said Abbott has a security detail, while Straus spokeswoman Erin Daly said Straus has not acceded to personal guards, though security was stepped up around the House in early 2011 in reaction to outside threats. Staples’ campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us by email that Staples would decline such protection. Staples ""keeps his protection in his boot,"" Black said, which we took as a reference to a firearm. Security teams for past lieutenant governors? And what of previous lieutenant governors? Black said Staples, a former state senator, has known four lieutenant governors dating back to the late Bob Bullock, who left the office more than a decade ago. Dewhurst, Black said, ""is the only one of the four who has utilized a full-time taxpayer-funded security detail. We have personally observed this detail,"" Black said. A state spokesman for Dewhurst, Andrew Barlow, reiterated what Dewhurst said in 2011, also saying that the ""expanded security detail is just one of the"" DPS’s ""many changes in security protocol in the post-9/11 era, including restricted Capitol driveway access, security gates at Capitol parking garages and metal detectors at Capitol entrances."" By phone, several Dewhurst predecessors told us they did not have security contingents. Bill Hobby, who held the gavel-wielding job from 1973 into 1991, told us he never had a detail. Former state Sen. Bill Ratliff said the same per his service as acting lieutenant governor from late 2000 through 2002. Ratliff added that Bullock, lieutenant governor from 1991 through 1998, ""almost certainly"" never had a security detail. Sen. Rodney Ellis, the Houston Democrat who briefly served in the post after Perry resigned to become governor in 2000, did not have a security detail, his spokesman, David Edmonson, said. Our ruling Staples called Dewhurst the first lieutenant governor of Texas to have a personal security detail. That appears so. Still, Staples’ statement could leave the impression that Dewhurst arranged for something unique for his own benefit. In contrast, Dewhurst was quoted years ago as saying that he did not initiate the protection and initially declined it. Also, Staples did not acknowledge that Capitol security was beefed up in various ways in 2010 and 2011 or that Dewhurst wasn’t alone in gaining a protective detail.

"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Brett Hulsey']","
Rep. Brett Hulsey says Wisconsin has created fewer jobs every year Scott Walker has been governor
","The state of employment in Wisconsin will play a key role in the 2014 race for governor. That’s because Gov. Scott Walker made creating 250,000 private-sector jobs his top campaign pledge in 2010 -- and our tracking shows he’s not on pace to meet the goal. In recent weeks, Democrats have criticized Walker’s record on jobs, highlighting comparisons between Wisconsin and other states, and a lack of growth in manufacturing jobs. A claim from state Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, stood out. He argued the state is actually backsliding on the jobs front. ""Every year since Gov. Walker and the Republicans have been in control of the Legislature we’ve created fewer jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,"" Hulsey said on ""The Devil’s Advocates"" radio show, broadcast on 92.1 FM in Madison. That caught our attention, because most signs indicate the economy is slowly recovering, and in tracking the jobs promise on the Walk-O-Meter we have seen the opposite trend, increases each year being a little larger than the previous one. So is Hulsey right? Have the new jobs been going down each year since Walker took office? When we asked Hulsey for his evidence, he cited Bureau of Labor Statistics private-sector job reports. Based on those figures, his office calculated it this way: 2011: 33,700 new jobs 2012: 32,300 new jobs 2013: 30,873 new jobs. The 2013 number is through November, the most recent month available when he made the claim. So, it seems like Hulsey found a downward trend. But there’s a catch -- actually several catches -- that affect the numbers and the trend cited by Hulsey. When it comes to jobs counting, the devil is in the details. How are the numbers calculated? Hulsey uses the monthly Current Employment Statistics, which come from interviews with a tiny sample -- about 3 percent -- of the state’s businesses. Those preliminary figures are estimates and carry a large margin of error. The numbers are made final the following month and often adjusted widely. How did Hulsey come up with his downward trend? Let’s examine each year. 2011: Hulsey says the state added 33,700 private sector jobs. He arrived at that number by taking the January 2012 jobs count of 2,362,100 and subtracting the January 2011 figure of 2,328,400 jobs. There’s one problem: this calculation doesn’t include the 10,100 jobs added in January 2011.  That was Walker’s first month in office. So the more accurate starting point would be to use the December 2010, the last month before Walker took office, through  December 2011. When you do that, you get an increase of 32,500. In short, Hulsey uses only 11 months of 2011 data for Walker’s first year. We’re off to a bad start. 2012: Hulsey says the state added 32,300 jobs. He got that figure by taking the January 2013 count and subtracting the January 2012 count. That’s 12 months, but that’s not the calendar year. He should have subtracted the December 2011 figure from December 2012. When you do, it comes to 23,800 for 2012. 2013: Hulsey says that through November the state had created 30,873 jobs. Again he was off with the months he used. When you subtract December of 2012 from November of 2013, you get 40,900 new jobs for the 11-month period. So here are the figures: 32,500 jobs, followed by 23,800 and then 40,900. That’s a bit of a mix, but does not match the three consecutive downward years Hulsey claims. We also note that the last full year under Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, the state created 30,700 jobs. Walker’s first full year topped Doyle by 1,800 jobs, according to the CES. But there’s another wrinkle. There is far better data available for 2011 and 2012. That’s the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a BLS survey of about 96 percent of all state businesses. Here’s what those numbers show: 2011: 29,800 new jobs 2012: 33,872 new jobs The final  figures for 2013 won’t be available until June, so the next best figures come from the monthly numbers. And as of November, those showed a 40,700 increase. So the trend is exactly the opposite of what Hulsey claimed. Our rating Hulsey says state employers have added fewer jobs every year since Walker and the Republicans took control of state government. His evidence is based on two years of calculations that don’t include the full calendar year, and a projection for the third year that doesn’t track with the figures he cites. Also, for two years, he uses data that’s been superceded by far more accurate data. Either way you cut it, the claim is wrong. We rate Hulsey’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D872880>],/factchecks/2014/jan/31/brett-hulsey/rep-brett-hulsey-says-wisconsin-has-created-fewer-/

GEMA chief wrong about traffic timeline
","The response from one state official at a news conference about the chaotic aftermath to Tuesday afternoon’s traffic-snarling snowstorm astounded many in the room. ""At two and three o’clock (Tuesday), it still had not gotten terrible on the roads,"" Georgia Emergency Management Agency director Charley English said at a midday news conference Wednesday that was aired live on several television stations. Gov. Nathan Deal, standing nearby, was asked if he agreed with English’s assessment. The governor politely said he did not. ""I was on the roads about that point in time, and it was getting to be gridlocked. The interstates were already experiencing major difficulties. Side roads that people were taking to get off were experiencing difficulties,"" Deal said at the Wednesday news conference. ""So we all have some lessons we need to learn here."" The PolitiFact Georgia team, like many, thought English had misspoken. But perhaps the GEMA director had a fact-based point. We searched for some answers. The snow began to fall over the Atlanta region shortly before noon Tuesday. According to Deal, area roads were showing green on real-time traffic maps at 12:15 p.m. Tuesday, meaning traffic was moving smoothly. At 12:36 p.m., the roads were red, meaning they were snarled, the governor said in Wednesday’s news conference. One important website supports the governor’s point. At 1:25 p.m. Tuesday, the Georgia Department of Transportation’s navigator site showed nearly every interstate in metro Atlanta as red. On the streets around Perimeter Mall, where The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and many large employers are located, firetrucks had trouble getting through. The roads were jammed with vehicles moving at a tortoiselike pace. In some parts of the region, such as Gwinnett County, traffic wasn’t as treacherous, officials said. But in others, motorists and their insurance companies would likely dispute that conditions were anything less than ""terrible."" Between noon and 3 p.m. Tuesday, the Georgia State Patrol reported being called to 341 crashes statewide and 91 in metro Atlanta. That was many times the number that state troopers worked just two Tuesdays before -- 28 statewide and six in metro Atlanta during that same three-hour period. Sandy Springs police Capt. Steve Rose said his city’s roads were gridlocked by shortly after noon Tuesday, and police were prioritizing and only working wrecks where people were injured. And it only got worse. At 5:39 p.m. Tuesday, the state Department of Transportation tweeted that motorists should ""stay off of highways as conditions continue to deteriorate overnight."" By that evening, the interstate highways were completely stalled, if you could drive on them at all. We contacted GEMA’s media affairs department around noon Thursday, asking for evidence to back up English’s statement. About an hour after our call, English was backing away from his earlier remarks in a news conference aired live on CNN from the governor’s office. ""I made some inaccurate and regretful comments at the press conference Wednesday,"" English told reporters. The director added in response to a follow-up question about road conditions, ""Sure it was bad. There was terrible traffic."" English also said he waited too long to alert the governor’s office that the National Weather Service had issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta, conceding he put Deal ""in an awful position."" A GEMA spokesman left us a message late Thursday saying English doesn't have any additional comments. The spokesman, Ken Davis, suggested we reference English's remarks from Thursday's news conference.  Traffic maps, reports from law enforcement agencies and what we witnessed show it was pretty bad on metro Atlanta roads by midafternoon Tuesday. The conditions were worse that evening. English might have had a better argument if he’d said the road conditions Tuesday afternoon were not as ""terrible"" as they were by nightfall. English said Thursday his earlier comments, which were broadcast to millions of viewers, were ""inaccurate."" He did attempt to walk back his initial error. That is the only thing that saves him from PolitiFact Georgia’s lowest rating. We rate English’s initial statement as False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E0A6E00>],/factchecks/2014/jan/31/charley-english/gema-chief-wrong-about-traffic-timeline/

McAuliffe says Virginia receives the most federal money
","The federal government has long been a gravy train for Virginia’s economy, but Gov. Terry McAuliffe is worried Washington is cutting the tracks. During his first address to the General Assembly in January, McAuliffe cited a list of natural attributes and state policies that have helped Virginia flourish. ""Much of the success I just described results from Virginia being the number one recipient of federal dollars,"" he said. McAuliffe said federal defense cuts and a 16-day government shutdown last year ""dealt a severe blow to our economy and our confidence in the future."" He said Virginia must diversify and become less dependent on U.S. largesse. We wondered whether Virginia really is No. 1 on Uncle Sam’s spending list. Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman pointed us to figures from the Center for Effective Government, a liberal non-profit group that tracks U.S. spending. They show that in fiscal 2011,  companies located in Virginia had federal contracts totaling $88.7 billion -- tops in the nation. California companies were second with $62.4 billion in contracts followed by Texas, with $45.2 billion. Data published by USA Spending.gov, a web site established by the Office of Management and Budget in the White House, shows Virginia has been tops in federal contract receipts during each of the last four fiscal years. A large reason is that Virginia -- home to world’s largest Naval base in Norfolk and the nation’s largest shipbuilder in Newport News -- receives more federal defense dollars than any other state, according to a 2011 analysis by Bloomberg Government. But contracts are only part of federal spending. Washington sends states grants, direct payments for programs and pays salaries to federal employees scattered across the nation. To fully assess McAuliffe’s claim that Virginia is ""the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars,"" we needed data that computed all of the federal dollars disbursed in Virginia. The U.S. Census Bureau used to tally the total amount of federal money flowing into each state in its Consolidated Federal Funds Report. Results from the final study showed that in fiscal  2010, Virginia ranked sixth among states in receiving federal largesse. Here’s a list of the leaders: Our ruling McAuliffe, in his maiden address to the General Assembly, said Virginia is ""the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars."" The governor’s office backs the statement by citing statistics showing Virginia is tops in receiving federal contracts. But McAuliffe, in his speech, never defined his terms and federal dollars come to states in many ways, including salaries, grants and payments for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. When it’s all put together, the most current data ranks Virginia sixth in receipt of federal funds and second when the largesse is broken down to an average per citizen. We don’t dispute McAuliffe’s gist that Virginia’s economy heavily relies on federal spending, but he illustrated his point with inartfully. Virginia leads the nation in receiving a few types of payments from Washington. Overall, Virginia is near the top of the list, but it’s not No. 1. So we rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E0CF080>],/factchecks/2014/jan/31/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-virginia-receives-most-federal-mone/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Families', 'Marriage', 'Texas', 'Wendy Davis']","
Wendy Davis never gave up parental role, though she agreed to daughter primarily living with father in family's home
","Wendy Davis told an Austin crowd that she’s had enough of people distorting her life story, especially in connection with her daughters. According to the text of her speech, which she gave Jan. 28, 2014, to the Travis County Democrats, the Fort Worth state senator and Democratic gubernatorial candidate said she was separated from her first husband at 19 and divorced at 21. Her second husband, she said, ""was generous and supportive when it came to my education,"" which extended to earning a degree from Harvard Law School while her two girls (one by her previous marriage) mostly lived in Texas with him. ""And when our marriage ended 10 years after my graduation, he and I remained partners, sharing the responsibilities of parenting and doing what was right for Amber and for Dru,"" she said. ""I am very proud of our family, and of the decisions we made together to do what was right for our daughters."" ""And for those who have mangled the story of my life – either carelessly or purposely – know this: I never gave up custody of my children. I never lost custody of my children. And to say otherwise is an absolute lie."" Davis once referred to herself as the ""noncustodial parent"" of her youngest daughter. Is it also correct that she never gave up custody? By email and telephone, lawyers steeped in family law told us it’s rare for a Texas parent to lose custody of a child in the sense of being barred from any parental role. They cautioned, too, that ""custody"" is an outdated word that obscures how state laws were revised in the mid-1990s so that splitting couples would divorce without one being presumed to have lost his or her parenting role and responsibility. As things stand, a parent may be designated the ""managing conservator,"" lawyers said, or both parents can be declared joint managing conservators. Davis spoke in wake of a news story Davis made her ""never"" declaration nearly two weeks after a Dallas Morning News news story, posted online Jan. 18, 2014, examined discrepancies in her biography as she has recounted it. For that story, Davis told the paper that her ""language should be tighter. I’m learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail."" The story noted first that Davis’ personal biography had been employed to draw voter support-- ""a divorced teenage mother living in a trailer who earned her way to Harvard and political achievement."" ""The basic elements of the narrative are true,"" the story said, ""but the full story of Davis’ life is more complicated, as often happens when public figures aim to define themselves. In the shorthand version that has developed, some facts have been blurred."" Specifically, the newspaper said, Davis was 21, not 19, when she was divorced. Also, it said, she lived only a few months in the family mobile home while separated from her first husband before moving into an apartment with her daughter. The story said that as a single mother working two jobs, she met Jeff Davis, a lawyer, married him and had a second daughter. He paid for her last two years at Texas Christian University and her time at Harvard Law School, the story said, also keeping their two daughters while she was in Boston. Past coverage of custody Custody came up as the story said the couple divorced in 2005 and Jeff Davis ""was granted parental custody, and the girls stayed with him. Wendy Davis was directed to pay child support."" The story quoted Jeff Davis as saying: ""She did the right thing. She said, ‘I think you’re right; you’ll make a good, nurturing father. While I’ve been a good mother, it’s not a good time for me right now.’"" The story further said that Wendy Davis declined to discuss the circumstances or terms of the divorce. ""When I decided to run for governor, I promised my girls we would not revisit a time that was terribly difficult for them,"" she told the paper. ""I will tell you it was very important to me that Dru stay in her childhood home. It was a very difficult time in our life."" Sen. Davis also said: ""I very willingly, as part of my divorce settlement, paid child support. That was at my request, not any court telling me I needed to financially support my daughters."" The Texas Tribune said in a Sept. 1, 2013, news story that when Jeff Davis filed for divorce, Wendy Davis moved to an apartment. The story continued: ""The (family) house, which was in her husband's name, is where Amber and Dru grew up, and that is where they wanted to stay, their mother recalled. ""The divorce decree in 2005 gave Mr. Davis primary custody of Dru, who was then 17, and"" Wendy ""Davis agreed to pay $1,200 a month in child support, records show,"" the Tribune said. ‘Joint managing conservators’ At our inquiry, Davis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña sent a copy of the agreed divorce decree, dated Nov. 15, 2005. In the 35-page filing, a Fort Worth state district judge ordered that Wendy and Jeff Davis be appointed ""parent joint managing conservators"" of Dru Davis, who was then 17. Amber Davis was no longer a minor. Acuña also emailed us a statement by the senator’s lawyer in the divorce, Terry Gardner, stating that Davis ""always maintained joint custody of her teenage daughter during and after her divorce from Mr. Davis. Both parties were appointed parent joint managing conservators by the court, and shared the responsibilities of parenting their child."" The order states that Jeff Davis has the ""exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the child within Tarrant County."" Both parents, the decree says, retained the right to consent to decisions involving the child’s education, health care and other needs. The decree includes a ""standard possession order"" specifying when each parent would have Dru Davis living with them--specifying certain weekends and holidays--followed by the stipulation that Wendy Davis pay $1,200 a month in child support. Davis called herself ‘noncustodial parent’ The 2013 Tribune story quoted the senator as saying she did the right thing: ''My girls wanted to stay in their family home. I did feel like as the noncustodial parent that that was my obligation.'' We ran Davis’ ""noncustodial parent"" comment past Acuña of Davis’ campaign. She did not reply. Earlier, we asked about letters to the Tarrant County district clerk, Thomas Wilder--one dated Dec. 2, 2005, and the other dated Feb. 24, 2006--listing Jeff Davis as the ""custodial parent"" and Wendy Davis as the ""noncustodial parent.""  We obtained the letters from Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer for the Austin American-Statesman, who found them in records of the divorce kept by the Tarrant County district clerk's office. Acuña, indicating the letters and attached forms were administrative paperwork, said by email that the ""divorce decree clearly states that Wendy and Jeff Davis be awarded joint managing conservatorship. The divorce decree is the controlling document."" Outside lawyers say senator didn’t give up custody At our request, Jack Sampson, a University of Texas law professor expert in family law, reviewed the decree, saying by phone that it shows Davis did not give up custody in the divorce. ""She’s a joint managing conservator,"" he said, who agreed her daughter would primarily live in the family home with her father. By email, Fort Worth lawyer Chris Nickelson, said that the divorce order shows Davis ""was appointed a joint managing conservator and was given possession and access to her daughter. She therefore shared joint custody with Jeff."" Similarly, Austin lawyer Jimmy Vaught, chair-elect of the Family Law Section of the State Bar of Texas, said the decree shows the senator and her husband having the same parental rights and duties except for control over where the daughter lives. Asked if making the family home where Jeff Davis lived Dru Davis’ primary home constituted the father gaining greater custody, Nickelson replied: ""There will always be a group who perceives having the right to determine the primary residence means you have ‘custody.’ But that is not true under Texas law."" He added: ""Non-lawyers often think that if one person has more rights or more possession time than the other person, then it means they have custody while the other does not. Despite family lawyers’ best efforts, we have never been able to beat this idea out of people’s heads."" Sampson and Nickelson each said the letters to Wilder in the county records reflected only on the senator not being her youngest daughter’s primary caretaker and being ordered, as agreed, to pay child support for about the last half year of Dru Davis’ years as a minor. Both lawyers said the letters do not mean Davis gave up custody. Daughters comment On Jan. 28, 2014, the Davis campaign released letters from the candidate’s daughters. Dru Davis wrote: ""My mom has always shared equally in the care and custody of my sister and me."" Amber Davis wrote that at the time of her mother’s divorce, ""I was a young adult in college and Dru was in high school and to be clear, no one ‘lost or gave up custody’ of either one of us. But no matter how difficult it was, both of our parents were there for us."" Our ruling Davis said she ""never gave up custody of my children. I never lost custody of my children."" Custody, it turns out, is an outdated term for what has evolved into ""managing conservatorship."" And in the senator’s divorce, she and her ex-husband agreed to joint managing conservatorship, which means that neither parent sacrificed custody. That said, her ex-husband’s home was designated as their daughter Dru’s primary residence in the divorce decree and Davis agreed to make child-support payments. Outside of the legal process, it’s not uncommon for the parent who’s not the primary caregiver to be considered noncustodial, which may explain why the candidate described herself this way less than five months ago. Still, it would be incorrect to say she legally relinquished her parental role. We rate this statement, which was missing this clarification, as Mostly True. CLARIFICATIONS, 5:50 p.m., Jan. 30, 2014: This story was amended to clarify that Tilove obtained described letters in the public records of Davis' divorce and that the letters were addressed to the Tarrant County district clerk, not to a lawyer for Wendy Davis.

Rand Paul says Barack Obama 'spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs.'
","Even though the stimulus enacted by President Barack Obama in 2009 has been phased out for a few years now, it remains a talking point for some Republican critics. During his response to Obama’s State of the Union address, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a shot at the stimulus when he said this: ""Mr. President,"" Paul said, ""where are the jobs? You spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs and still joblessness confronts the next generation."" We wondered whether Paul -- a potential 2016 presidential candidate -- was correct to say that Obama ""spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs."" First, some background on the stimulus, which was passed in 2009 with almost exclusive Democratic backing. When it was passed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expected more than 90 percent of the cost to occur within fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. It has found that those expenditures have proceeded more or less on schedule. So far, the stimulus has spent $816 billion. One could characterize that as ""nearly a trillion dollars,"" especially when you add in the debt incurred in order to make that spending possible. The estimate for the debt required to support the stimulus was $347 billion over 10 years, making the combination of the stimulus and the added debt a bit under $1.2 trillion. What’s more problematic about Paul’s claim is his charge that this money went toward ""make-work government jobs."" This claim is dubious on two levels. First, not all the stimulus money went to paying government employees -- only a modest (though uncertain) fraction did. The stimulus included three broad categories of spending, broken down below with the amount spent so far: • Tax benefits to individuals and businesses: $290.7 billion • Entitlements, including Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment benefits: $264.4 billion • Contracts, grants and loans in such areas as education, transportation, infrastructure, energy, science and health: $261.2 billion So right off the bat, more than two-thirds of the total -- tax benefits and entitlement payments -- cannot be fairly categorized as funding ""make-work government jobs."" These were payments and tax givebacks for individuals and businesses to spend as they saw fit. The third category, worth $261.2 billion, did include funding for some government jobs, such as teachers, but a sizable chunk of this money was used by the government to fund work carried out by the private sector, such as road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors. It’s also worth noting that neither the federal government nor government as a whole has seen a surge in employment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statsitics, the size of the federal workforce has declined by 69,000 since Obama took office, though it has risen by about 65,000 if cuts in the Postal Service workforce are not included. That’s about a 3 percent increase over a five-year period if you use the figures that exclude the Postal Service. The drop is even more clear in government jobs at all levels -- federal, state and local. Since Obama took office, government employment has plunged by 734,000 jobs, which is a decrease about 10 times bigger than the federal increase. Which brings us to the second concern: Not all of these government employees were engaged in ""make work."" Webster’s New World Dictionary defines ""make work"" as ""a job, project or assignment that serves no useful purpose other than to give an otherwise idle or unemployed person something to do."" The classic example is of paying an unemployed person to dig a hole, then to fill it up again. Whether something qualifies a ""make work"" is open to debate; critics of all ideological stripes can surely find examples of specific projects in the stimulus that they would consider unworthy of taxpayer support. Still, the biggest category of ""contracts, grants and loans"" -- accounting for more than one-third of this heading -- is education, and a big chunk of those funds, about $51 billion, went toward keeping previously employed educators from being laid off. Another $16 billion went to student financial aid, plus a combined $24 billion for educating disadvantaged and special-needs children. Since much of this funding went toward teachers who were already employed, and were in danger of being laid off, it seems hard to characterize their duties as ""make work."" When we checked with Paul’s office, aides offered a revised phrase to replace ""make-work government jobs"" -- namely, ""government-facilitated job growth."" This terminology would be more accurate; indeed, we’d expect to find little disagreement with this from Democrats who supported the stimulus. The stimulus was the keystone of Obama’s efforts to stop the nation’s economic freefall, while also accomplishing some other priorities in such areas as infrastructure and scientific research. Democrats tend to believe that government spending -- called ""Keynesian"" after its progenitor, the late economist John Maynard Keynes -- plays a major role in economic downturns in replacing vanished or reduced spending by the private sector. Some Republicans are skeptical of this approach, suggesting that tax cuts get more money into the hands of private individuals who can lead an economic recovery more effectively than the government can. We won’t referee that debate. Instead, we’ll note that we would have agreed there’s a good argument that Obama engaged in roughly $1 billion of ""government-facilitated job growth."" That, of course, begs the question of whether the payoff in job creation was worth the $1 trillion spent. Employment is up by 3.2 million since Obama was sworn in, but it remains almost 1.2 million below its peak, almost five years into the recovery.  Our ruling Paul said Obama ""spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs."" It’s plausible that through the stimulus, Obama spent nearly $1 trillion of taxpayer dollars in hopes it would create jobs. But Paul is wrong to suggest that all $1 trillion was spent on ""make-work government jobs."" Two-thirds of the stimulus was spent on tax cuts and entitlements, and of the remaining one-third, much was paid to private contractors. Only a modest fraction of the $1 trillion was spent on government jobs, much less on jobs spent doing nothing. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E8D3B80>],/factchecks/2014/jan/30/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-barack-obama-spent-nearly-trillion-/

Looking for a good bet? Super Bowl MVP is likely to be a quarterback
","The pre-game punditry is rampant ahead of Super Bowl XLVIII (A.K.A. 48). Who’s going to win? Who’s going to be the game’s most valuable player? Let’s hypothesize! NFL Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk says the MVP pick is ""already etched in stone."" Obviously, it’s going to be Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, he said during a face-off with Michael Irvin on the NFL Network. Faulk laid out pretty compelling evidence to make his case. ""Quarterbacks, they have won the MVP more than 50 percent of the time,"" he said. Someone on Twitter heard Faulk’s claim and asked us if it is correct. Turns out Faulk is right. Of the 47 Super Bowls, 26 quarterbacks have walked away with MVP honors, way more than any other position, according to an ESPN tally. Victors include multiple winners such as Green Bay’s Bart Starr, Pittsburgh’s Terry Bradshaw, and San Francisco’s Joe Montana, as well as recent repeat winners in New England’s Tom Brady and the New York Giants’ Eli Manning. Peyton Manning could join the two-time MVP club Sunday night. He won the award for Super Bowl XLI in 2007 after passing for 247 yards and a touchdown against the Chicago Bears. For his MVP pick, Irvin chose Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker. Wide receivers and running backs are the next most likely positions for MVP, but they far and away trail the quarterbacks.

Curtis Martin says he once played a game in 15 inches of snow
","Former New York Jets running back Curtis Martin took to ESPN’s Herald Square set recently with a message: Stop worrying about the weather for Super Bowl XLVIII. Martin said he was excited to see football’s big game being played outside in a northern city, and that the elements are part of professional football. He then told the audience about how things were back in his playing days. ""I played in a game here against the Pittsburgh Steelers where there was 23 inches of snow, and they couldn’t get all the snow,"" Martin said. ""We played in at least 15 inches of that. The only thing you could see on the field were the lines that they would clear out."" 1) That sounds like a lot of snow. 2) We’re not expecting anything close in East Rutherford, N.J., for the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos. 3) The story Martin told is pretty exaggerated. The Steelers did play Martin’s Jets in the snow in East Rutherford on Dec. 14, 2003. Martin had a statistically great game, rushing for 174 yards while adding 54 yards receiving.The Jets won 6-0 on two Doug Brien field goals. The size of the snow pile, however, apparently has grown in Martin’s mind since the game was played a decade ago. Most media reports say the teams played in several inches of snow before the snow became freezing rain in the second half. Weather history from Weather Underground, which relies on airport weather data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, says that about 4 inches of snow fell in the East Rutherford area on Dec. 14, not 23 inches. The New York Daily News also reported 4 inches of snow that day, saying: ""four inches of snow, then sleet turning to rain and 30-mph wind gusts."" And here’s how Jets kicker Brien described a second-quarter field goal at the time to New York’s Journal News: ""There was 4 inches of snow on the ground. I was fortunate that we had a timeout and the line was able to clear away a pretty good space for me, and that was big."" Lastly, while the NFL is very good about making sure videos of their games do not appear on the Internet, there is photographic evidence that there was not 23 or even 15 inches of snow that day. We have a photo of Brien’s 41-yard field goal, and we have an image of Martin in what appears to be a few inches.

ESPN's Schlereth says teams 'now' spend their money on offense
","ESPN's Mark Schlereth, a former offensive lineman for the Washington Redskins and Denver Broncos, says offenses get all the breaks these days in the National Football League. That’s one of the reasons Schlereth is picking the Broncos and quarterback Peyton Manning to beat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl 31-17. The offenses-first trend has spread from NFL policies to refereeing to the contracts teams award players, Schlereth said on Mike & Mike. ""We use to say defense wins championships? … Are we now at a place, Mark, with the way the game is played where the offense has the edge?"" asked host Mike Greenberg. ""Based on the way all the rules have been for the passing game and to protect the quarterback and you can't hit people, yes, certainly,"" Schlereth said. ""The rules are bent that way for the offense to have the advantage, I think, and that's why you see the majority of teams now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football."" We decided to dig a little deeper into how the NFL’s 32 teams allocate their salaries to see if Schlereth is correct. NFL teams this year have a salary cap of about $123 million, which is generally the maximum teams can spend on players. There are plenty of ways for teams to manipulate that figure, and several teams spend way below the salary cap. The NFL Players Association publishes a public report showing overall spending toward the salary cap for each team but not a detailed breakdown by offense vs. defense. To find that, we turned to Spotrac.com, which provides a much more detailed position-by-position analysis. Their reporting is used by USA Today, the Guardian and others to report about NFL spending patterns. In the end, it’s something of an estimate, but it’s the best information publicly available and considered reliable. So are NFL teams predominantly spending their money building offenses as Schlereth suggested? We’ll start with the big numbers and work backward. For the 2013-14 year, the NFL’s 32 teams spent a total of $1.7 billion on offensive players compared to $1.6 billion on defensive players. If you measured the money as a percentage, that would translate to 51.5 percent offense, 48.5 percent defense (the margin is actually closer once you consider that NFL teams spend money on a kicker and punter who are not part of either the offense or defense). For perspective, that’s closer than the popular vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Spending by individual teams varies greatly. The Philadelphia Eagles spent nearly $74 million on offensive players, compared to $38.5 million on defensive players. The Cincinnati Bengals, conversely, spent $69 million on defensive players and $45 million on offensive personnel. (Both of those teams made the playoffs.) The Seahawks and Broncos both spend more money on offense, by the way. But while the Broncos are considered the ""offensive"" team, the Seahawks actually spend a few extra million dollars on their offensive team. Team Offensive spending Defensive spending Seattle $69,386,205 $51,800,008 Denver $66,084,673 $47,763,533   Overall, of the NFL’s 32 teams, 11 spent more money on defense than offense, three teams spent just about the same amount on offense and defense and 18 spent more money on offense than defense. To put that in percentages, a little more than 56 percent of teams spend more on offense and about 44 percent do not. That gives the offenses the edge, though not decisively so. One last note: By saying ""now,"" Schlereth is suggesting that the move toward spending on offenses is a recent development. That’s not necessarily correct. While salary cap data is harder to come by for previous years, we did find a Sports Illustrated list of all NFL players from 2008 and their salaries. In 2008, offensive players made $1.7 billion (the same amount they made in 2013) while defensive players made about $1.52 billion. Part of the difference is simple numbers -- NFL teams paid 85 more offensive players in 2008 than they did defensive players. Our ruling Schlereth said, ""The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football."" We reached out to Schlereth through his chili sauce company (yes, really) but did not hear back. There’s definitely evidence that NFL teams are spending more money on offensive players than defensive players. It's part of the reality of NFL football, where the most expensive players are typically quarterbacks. But the disparity wasn’t that significant in 2013, and it’s actually less than it was in 2008. Schlereth's claim is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A55066F100>],/factchecks/2014/jan/30/mark-schlereth/espns-schlereth-says-teams-now-spend-their-money-o/

Only 3 Republicans in 19 Travis County races
","If you think most of Travis County’s next batch of elected leaders will be chosen in November, you’re wrong, according to Wayne Thorburn. The Austinite, a former director of the Republican Party of Texas whose book ""Red State: An Insider’s Story of How the GOP Came to Dominate Texas Politics"" comes out this spring, wrote in a Jan. 8, 2014, opinion column for the Austin American-Statesman: ""There are 27 county government offices up for election in 2014. Of these, only three have the potential of being settled in the November election. ... Nearly 90 percent of all county races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary"" on March 4, 2014. Travis County’s pretty blue, as Thorburn noted and as PolitiFact Texas explored in a recent fact-check of U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett’s claim that its surrounding counties are red (True). Is it so blue that most of the county’s votes cast in the Nov. 4 election won’t really decide anything? By email, Thorburn pointed us to the state elections website and said, ""Please realize that I did not say 90 percent of all races that will appear on the November ballot in Travis County (which would include state, multi-county district, and state legislative positions). What I specifically said is county offices, including county judge, commissioners from precincts 2 and 4, several justices of the peace, and several county court at law positions."" The only assumption he made, Thorburn said, is that no Libertarian or Green Party candidates will win. ""The secretary of state's web site does not include any Libertarian or Green Party candidates who may be nominated by a convention, rather than a primary,"" he said. County elections official Michelle Parker guided us by phone to a breakdown of races on the county’s election website. Next, from the state secretary’s elections web page of candidates who filed for the primary by the Dec. 9, 2013 deadline, we pulled the Travis County names. After setting aside the candidates for Congress, governor and other federal or state offices, we came up with 32 candidates running in 19 races and only three Republicans in the lot. District Judge 201st District Court Amy Clark Meachum DEM District Judge 250th District Court Karin Crump DEM District Judge 419th District Court Orlinda Naranjo DEM County Judge Andy Brown DEM County Judge Sarah Eckhardt DEM County Judge Mike McNamara REP County Court At Law Judge #1 Todd Wong DEM County Court At Law Judge #2 Eric Montgomery Shepperd DEM County Court At Law Judge #3 John Lipscombe DEM County Court At Law Judge #3 Paul Evans DEM County Court At Law Judge #4 Mike Denton DEM County Court At Law Judge #5 Nancy Hohengarten DEM County Court At Law Judge #6 Brandy Mueller DEM County Court At Law Judge #7 Elisabeth Earle DEM County Probate Court Judge Guy Herman DEM District Clerk Velva L.

Gomez DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 1 Yvonne M. Williams DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 2 Randall Slagle DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 2 Glenn Bass REP Justice of the Peace Precinct 3 Susan Steeg DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 4 Raul Arturo Gonzalez DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 5 Herb Evans DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 5 James Braxton Forrest DEM   After we inquired, Thorburn said he had miscounted the number of races, and now tallied 19. ""The percentages are still valid if 84.2 percent is acceptable as ""nearly 90 percent,’ "" he said. Travis County Republican Party spokesman Andy Hogue confirmed by email that three Republicans are running for three Travis County offices, though he pointed out that more are bidding for offices Thorburn did not include: state House districts 47 and 50, both within the county’s boundaries. Most Travis County candidates are, so far, unopposed, so that unless a Green or Libertarian files, Democrats are set to claim 12 offices without having to campaign for them. Four more races will be settled in the Democratic primary in March (unless a Green, independent or Libertarian files) because they feature two Democrats facing off: county treasurer; county commissioner Precinct 4; county court at law judge No. 3; and justice of the peace Precinct 5. The three races with a Republican contender: county judge, Precinct 2 county commissioner and Precinct 2 justice of the peace. Our ruling Thorburn said ""nearly 90 percent"" of the Travis County government races this year will be settled by the March Democratic primary, thanks to the paucity of Republicans who filed to run. His declared count was too high. Still, 16 out of 19 races for county office lack a Republican candidate, which suggests that 84 percent of the positions will be all but settled once the primaries are over.

Republican official says none of the 20 bills U.S. Rep. David Cicilline has sponsored has gotten out of committee
","It's never easy being a member of the minority party. Ask the Republicans in the Rhode Island General Assembly or in the U.S. Senate. Ask the Democrats in the U.S. House. Ian Prior, of the National Republican Congressional Committee, raised that point in a Jan. 14, 2014, Providence Journal commentary, saying that voters in Rhode Island can’t afford to have an all-Democrat delegation to the U.S. Congress. If the Republicans retain control of the House and win the Senate in the next election, he wrote, ""Rhode Island could well find itself with a complete loss of influence at the federal level."" To make his point, he focused on the accomplishments of U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat. (Prior was campaign manager for Cicilline's 2012 Republican opponent, Brendan Doherty.) ""To see what a lack of influence looks like, one need look no further than Representative Cicilline’s record in Congress. Of the 20 bills Cicilline has sponsored in his three years in office, not a single one has advanced past the embryonic committee stage. This is a testament to the lack of effectiveness a backbencher in the minority party has in Congress."" We decided to see whether Prior was accurately describing the number and fate of Cicilline's proposals. When we contacted him, he said he was not counting legislation Cicilline has co-sponsored because it's easy to add your name to a bill someone else has drafted. Prior sent us to the website GovTrack.US, which showed Cicilline has sponsored 21 pieces of legislation, not 20. However, his count was accurate at the time he submitted his commentary. But that same website says not all of the legislation has remained stuck in committee. One bill, H.R. 2027, was reported out of the House Committee on Natural Resources on Nov. 17, 2011. It never received a vote by the House, according to the website. (That bill involved the boundaries of four coastal areas, in Newport and Middletown. It was resubmitted as H.R. 277 in the current Congress and sent back to committee on Jan. 15, 2013, where it remains.) When we asked Prior about that legislation, he said, ""I did not say that he hadn't gotten a bill out of committee, but rather that it had not gotten past the 'committee phase' which includes the [House] Rules Committee."" By his definition, if it doesn't get past the Rules Committee, it doesn't count as going past the ""embryonic committee phase."" But the database Prior used to prove his point -- and others we checked -- don't use that standard. And here's nothing ""embryonic"" about a bill that makes it through a committee, which is usually where most of the hard work on a bill is done. Cicilline's chief of staff, Peter Karafotas, said that if Prior ""did understand the legislative process, he would know that the vast majority of bills that reach the House floor for a vote never go through the Rules Committee"" and in the current Congress, ""57 percent of the bills the House voted on never went through the Rules Committee. "" Karafotas also argued that just looking at the number of sponsored bills reported out of committee can be misleading and oversimplifies a Congressman's influence. Karafotas said Cicilline had also sponsored 10 amendments to bills on the floor of the House, 4 of which passed. In addition, he cited 11 Cicilline amendments that were incorporated into legislation when it was in committee. He said those are just examples. Prior's larger point is that a Democrat in a Republican-controlled House or Senate will have trouble passing legislation. Darrell M. West of the Brookings Institution said there is little evidence that states with both Republicans and Democrats in their congressional delegations fare better. And he said nobody should be surprised that a Democrat can't get bills out of committee in a Republican Congress. ""The Speaker (of the House) only moves bills from his own party, and that's true whether there's Republican or Democratic control,"" a fact that even more likely to be true ""because of the extreme polarization and hyperpartisanship. Republicans never want to see a Democratic initiative see the light of day,"" he said. Our ruling Ian Prior said, ""of the 20 bills [Rep. David] Cicilline has sponsored in his three years in office, not a single one has advanced past the embryonic committee stage."" In fact, one did. In addition, 4 of the 10 amendments Cicilline offered passed. Prior’s point is that legislators in a minority party have no influence. That's true to some degree. But he is ignoring other evidence of influence that a member of Congress can wield, including amendments to Republican bills. Because his statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we rate it Half True.
