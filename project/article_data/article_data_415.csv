Experts warn against homemade baby formula
","The Facebook post makes it sound deceptively simple: To circumvent a nationwide shortage of baby formula, just make your own. But experts strongly disagree. The May 11 post says people can follow a 1960 recipe for homemade baby formula as a workaround during the current shortage. It shows a photo of the recipe, with ingredients that include evaporated milk and Karo syrup. The caption says, ""Y’all, I felt this was pertinent information to share considering the shortages we are facing with our babies. I personally have not used this method yet but glad to have the details just in case!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Tiffany overstates report on shortcomings of Afghan vetting
","As Afghans resettle across the country and the United States examines how it evacuated and screened tens of thousands of refugees, U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany is among those who sees shortcomings in the process – and squarely blames the Biden Administration.  ""As I warned last year, the #BidenAdministration has been recklessly releasing potentially dangerous Afghans into our communities. The White House told us they were ‘fully vetted.’ They lied,"" Tiffany wrote on Twitter on Feb. 18, 2022. Tiffany, whose district includes Wausau, Marshfield and Minocqua, made the comments following the release of a U.S. Department of Defense inspector general’s report evaluating the department’s efforts in screening refugees when assisting the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Tiffany’s office did not return phone calls or emails from PolitiFact Wisconsin. But his tweet included a link to a news article about the analysis, so there is no doubt what he is referring to. For this fact-check, we are zeroing in on the most concrete aspect of Tiffany’s claim – whether, according to the analysis, the Biden administration has been ""recklessly releasing potentially dangerous Afghans into our communities."" With international attention focused on Russia’s war against Ukraine, and refugees leaving that war zone, it’s easy to forget about what Tiffany is highlighting. He is focused on the August 2021 evacuation of 76,000 refugees from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrew its forces and the Taliban re-seized control.  Republicans have argued from the start that the chaotic withdrawal – based on a timeline set by former President Donald Trump – meant it was impossible for U.S. officials to adequately screen those who boarded planes and arrived here. Let’s start with the verbiage Tiffany uses – ""potentially dangerous."" Nowhere in the inspector general’s Feb. 15, 2022, report does it categorize any of the Afghan refugees as ""potentially dangerous."" The description comes from a headline in the Washington Times – though, we should note, the body of that story doesn’t include that language either.  Rather, the report itself describes 50 people who had ""potentially significant security concerns"" and made it to the continental United States. The report does not say what those concerns involve, such as a prior criminal background or otherwise.  Separately, the inspector general’s office wrote that as of September 2021, of a sampling of 31 Afghans identified as possible security risks, only three could be located.  The report does not indicate what security concerns or ""derogatory information"" about the individuals was found in the review. The defense department defines derogatory information as information that would require additional investigation or clarification in taking ""administrative action"" against individuals. Administrative action in this case would be allowing someone into the United States Erin Barbato, a Wisconsin-based immigration attorney, noted that just because someone may have committed crimes in their home country doesn’t make them a national security threat in the United States. To imply the few dozen people with such backgrounds are risks is speculative and ""fear mongering,"" she said.  When refugees come to the U.S., they rely on work programs and government assistance to restart their lives. Refugees also were resettled from military bases by a resettlement agency responsible for them. Someone knows where they were placed – and likely where they are – even if the Defense Department couldn’t at the time of the report, she said.  To be sure, the vetting was done with only the information available at the time. The inspector general’s report notes the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol didn’t vet refugees with Defense Department biometric and other biographical data. The reason?  The information wasn’t available because of agreements made with foreign allies about who can access that data. It wasn’t until late 2021 when that data became available, according to the audit report.  The two agencies later entered into an agreement to share data and Afghans already vetted through the existing process, which contained other biometric data sources, were reexamined. The retroactive screening is what found those 50 Afghans with possible security concerns. Ultimately, the report amounts to identifying technical hiccups in the early vetting process during the evacuation, said Susan Martin, founder and retired professor at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University.  The report doesn’t explain whether what a derogatory comment is or whether that information was of major or minor concern, she said. To Martin, it’s clear Afghans were vetted and report highlights efforts to improve the system for how the U.S. vets refugees.  ""The issue is whether the vetting identified all applicants who might pose security threats before being released into the US,"" Martin said. ""No system is perfect in doing so. And, all systems can be improved.""  Citing a specific report, Tiffany said it demonstrated the Biden administration has been ""recklessly releasing potentially dangerous Afghans into our communities""  The report did not describe the Afghans as potentially dangerous. A Washington Times headline did. The inspector general’s report identified 50 people that had ""derogatory information"" in a defense department biometric database, but what that information involves is not known and was not included in the report.  The report did find holes and inefficiencies in the vetting process that were fixed before the report’s publication and Afghans admitted into the U.S. were retroactively screened with missing data. The bottomline: Tiffany overstates these findings in making his point.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.   ",/factchecks/2022/may/13/tom-tiffany/tiffany-overstates-report-shortcomings-afghan-vett/

There is no evidence that Heard used cocaine while in court. Heard has periodically cried during her testimony, and a longer video of the same proceeding shows that two minutes before the moment depicted in the Facebook clip, she wiped her nose with a tissue. In the longer video, at the 12:05 mark, Heard picked up a tissue and wiped her nose for several seconds, then lowered the tissue to her lap. At the 14:38 mark — the moment shown in the Facebook clip — she raised the tissue to her nose again. Also, those entering the Fairfax County Courthouse in Fairfax, Virginia, where the trial is being held, are screened for contraband.

Formula shortage isn’t related to Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg investment in artificial breast milk
","Even if you’re not a parent, you’ve likely heard about the baby formula shortage currently gripping the United States. The lack of supply has been blamed on a number of factors, including COVID-19 related supply chain issues and a recall that halted operations at a major formula manufacturer.  But some on social media claim there’s something darker at play: an intentional and strategic investment by some of the nation’s richest men.  A screenshot of a website called the Science Times shows a June 2020 headline that says ""Bill Gates, Zukerberg, other billionaires invest in environmentally-friendly artificial breast milk cultured from human mammary."" A May 11 Facebook post that shared the screenshot reads: ""Now you know why there’s suddenly a ‘formula shortage.’ The new age robber barons have conveniently invested in some unholy breast milk made from human organs."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that investments involving Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg in artificial breast milk have anything to do with the formula shortage. The story featured in the post was published on June 20, 2020, and detailed how a startup company called BIOMILQ is artificially producing human breast milk from cultured human mammary cells in an effort to limit greenhouse gases created in formula manufacturing. The company received $3.5 million from an investment fund co-founded by Gates, Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, the story said. The billion dollar fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, was established to help prevent the effects of climate change and is backed by some of the world's top entrepreneurs.  Neither BIOMILQ nor the fund’s investment in the company have anything to do with the current shortage. Leila Strickland, BIOMILQ’s co-founder and chief science officer, told CNN on May 3 that the company is still three to five years away from getting a product to market. The shortage is due in part to a February 2022 formula recall by Abbott, a major U.S. manufacturer of baby food, that halted production at its Sturgis, Michigan, plant. It’s also due to supply chain issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that were already impacting the infant formula industry. High inflation also appears to have compounded the problem.    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been working to increase supply in the country and reported that other infant formula manufacturers are meeting or exceeding capacity levels in an attempt to meet current demand.  ""Efforts already underway by several infant formula manufacturers include optimizing processes and production schedules to increase product output, as well as prioritizing product lines that are of greatest need, particularly the specialty formulas,"" the agency wrote in a May 10 news release. Some other things the FDA is doing to address the shortage include: Helping manufacturers bring safe products to market, particularly specialized formulas for medical needs. Compiling data on in-stock rates at both national and regional levels to help ensure appropriate supplies of formula are going where it is needed. Improving and streamlining systems to increase imports of permitted products from other countries. A Facebook post claims that the formula shortage was manufactured because Zuckerberg and Gates invested in a company that makes artificial breast milk.  There is no evidence that an investment in BIOMILQ by a fund Zuckerberg and Gates are involved in has anything to do with the current infant formula shortage.  The shortage unfolded due to a recall by a major U.S. manufacturer of baby food and existing supply chain issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Neo-Nazi and racial discrimination claims in AZ governor’s race are Mostly False
","In the race for governor in Arizona, one candidate went icepick-sharp with an attack that cut competitors on both the right and left. The TV ad from former state representative Aaron Lieberman, a Democrat, hit the two frontrunners, Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs. ""Right now, Arizona’s politics are a dumpster fire,"" Lieberman said into the camera, as flames rose from a trash container behind him.  ""Kari Lake has been appearing at rallies with neo-Nazis. And she’s beating Katie Hobbs, who two federal juries have found guilty of racial discrimination.""  The ad ends with Lieberman appearing to spray the dumpster with a fire extinguisher. There is only an element of truth in both parts of Lieberman’s attack.  We did not find evidence that Lake, a former anchor for Fox 10 News in Phoenix who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has been sharing a stage generally with neo-Nazis.  The ad cited a November CNN report that said Lake ""embraced"" three ""fringe far-right figures in her campaign events,"" including Greyson Arnold. The report said Lake posed for a photo and video with Arnold at one of her rallies in August. CNN reported that after Arnold posted a photo on Twitter, Lake replied, ""It was a pleasure to meet you, too."" The report called Arnold a Nazi sympathizer with a history of making white nationalist, racist, antisemitic and pro-Nazi statements. A previous CNN report also said Arnold repeatedly shared memes saying the U.S. fought on the wrong side in World War II. Months later, the Arizona Mirror reported that Arnold used his social media pages to post memes lauding Nazis as the ""pure race"" and lamenting the American victory in World War II. Arnold told the Mirror his posts were taken out of context, and he denied being a white nationalist or supporting Nazi ideology.  When we asked a Lake campaign spokesperson in emails about the Lieberman ad, the spokesperson did not specifically answer questions about Arnold.  Arnold himself told PolitiFact: ""CNN is fake news."" Hobbs, then the Democratic leader of the Arizona Senate, did have a role in the 2015 firing of Talonya Adams, an Arizona Senate policy adviser who won a racial discrimination lawsuit. But Hobbs was not personally charged in the matter. Adams, who is Black and represented herself, sued the Senate, alleging that she was fired for raising concerns about racial and gender discrimination because she was paid less than white male peers.  Adams alleged in the lawsuit that after she emailed a staff supervisor to discuss her job status, Hobbs told Adams that her email was inappropriate, because Adams had already discussed her status with Hobbs, the supervisor and another official.  A jury agreed with Adams’ discrimination claims and awarded her $1 million after a trial in 2019. But the Senate was granted a second trial after its attorneys argued that Adams could not claim retaliation because she did not first inform Senate leaders that she believed discrimination was taking place.  Adams won the second trial, in November 2021, when a jury found she was the victim of retaliation. The jury awarded her $2.75 million, though a federal cap law is expected to reduce that to $300,000. Hobbs testified at both trials that she participated in the discussion to terminate Adams, saying she had lost trust in Adams over her decision to take emergency leave to care for her son in Seattle, and because of other chain-of-command issues, according to news reports.  Hobbs reiterated that point in a November 2021 letter to her campaign supporters, writing: ""I take responsibility for my role in the decision to terminate Ms. Adams, and I stand by what I’ve consistently said, that this decision on my part was not based on gender or race."" Hobbs issued another statement in December 2021, apologizing to Adams. Unlike in her November letter, Hobbs said discrimination occurred, telling the Arizona Republic: ""I know that in proceeding in her termination, I participated in furthering systemic racism."" Hobbs issued the apology after Black community leaders and others criticized Hobbs' initial response to the second jury verdict, the Arizona Republic reported. Arizona’s primaries are Aug. 2. Campaign watchers rate the Nov. 8 general election as a toss up.  The major Republican candidates in the governor’s race include Lake; Karrin Taylor Robson, of an Arizona political dynasty; and former U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon. The major Democratic candidates are Hobbs, Lieberman and former Nogales Mayor Marco Lopez. Lieberman said that Lake ""has been appearing at rallies with neo-Nazis"" and ""two federal juries have found"" Hobbs ""guilty of racial discrimination."" Lieberman is exaggerating the facts to cast his opponents in the worst light possible. Lake posed for a photo and video at one of her campaign rallies with one man who is identified in news reports as a Nazi sympathizer, but there’s no evidence that this was anything more than a random interaction at a campaign event. Hobbs, now Arizona’s secretary of state, was the Democratic leader of the Arizona Senate when she participated in the 2015 decision to fire an Arizona Senate employee who later successfully sued the Arizona Senate for racial discrimination. Hobbs herself was not sued, which means no court made a finding specifically against her. Lieberman’s claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Tweets conflate Ron DeSantis’ massive campaign fundraising with his net worth
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has raised a large sum of money for his re-election bid, topping $100 million in April.  Those same fundraising talents have fueled several misleading claims on social media.  ""Is ANYONE asking how Ron DeSantis was worth $340,000 in 2020 and is now worth $52 million?"" a May 8 tweet read.  ""This is corruption for sure,"" one user replied. ""Kickbacks."" The tweet is wrong, but that didn’t stop it from being retweeted more than 20,000 times — including by Janet Long, Pinellas County commissioner and former Democratic member of the Florida House. Long, who did not respond to our request for comment, undid her retweet. Similar claims that DeSantis had dramatically increased his net worth have appeared on Twitter since at least late March. But they conflate net worth with how much he has fundraised for his re-election. State elected officials must file a financial disclosure to the Florida Commission of Ethics by July 1 each year. These filings detail the officials' assets, liabilities, and sources of income. The commission also asks that each elected official note their net worth, calculated by totaling the value of all their assets — such as cash and property — and subtracting any debt owed.  DeSantis listed his 2020 net worth at $348,832, an increase of more than $57,000 from the year prior. His gubernatorial salary of $134,181 was the only source of income recorded in the filing. DeSantis also reported assets in a USAA account, a government thrift savings plan and the Florida Retirement System. His increase in net worth is linked to these assets.  So, where were people getting an increase to $52 million? That figure appeared in news coverage about donations that DeSantis' re-election campaign raised in the first eight months of 2021. Friends of Ron DeSantis, his political committee, reported raising around $52 million as of Sept. 1, 2021. (He has since raised more than twice that amount.) ""Political campaign fundraising is NOT net worth,"" DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw tweeted on March 19. ""All of this info is reported in detail for Florida public officials."" Such fundraising dollars are not permitted to be used for a candidate’s personal expenses, according to state statutes. Florida’s Constitution also prohibits DeSantis from using his position to obtain a ""disproportionate benefit"" for himself.  DeSantis came from more of a middle-class background in Dunedin, Florida. His mother worked as a nurse, and his father installed boxes that monitored TV ratings for Nielsen.

Before DeSantis began a career in politics, he served in the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer. After his service, DeSantis worked as a federal prosecutor.  DeSantis' net worth is less than his Democratic gubernatorial opponents. According to the Florida Commission on Ethics, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried reported a net worth of $970,244, as of 2020. U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist had an estimated net worth of $1.4 million in 2018, according to data maintained by the nonpartisan research organization, OpenSecrets. State Sen. Annette Taddeo listed her net worth at about $1 million. A tweet said DeSantis ""was worth $340,000 in 2020 and is now worth $52 million."" DeSantis has not yet reported his net worth for 2021. PolitiFact found no credible evidence to substantiate the claim that he had such a massive financial increase.  The figure used in the tweet seems to be derived from campaign filings in September 2021, which indicated that DeSantis raked in around $52 million in donations.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/may/12/tweets/tweets-conflate-ron-desantis-massive-campaign-fund/

The adenovirus was not developed to kill kids, nor is it a combination of viruses including COVID-19
","A video posted on Facebook raised the alarm about a virus that may have caused severe illness in children. The video, which originated on TikTok, showed a CNBC headline about recent findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: ""CDC says adenovirus may have caused Alabama outbreak of severe hepatitis in children."" Hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver.  A woman in the video pointed to the headline and said, ""So while y’all are getting distracted, they’ve developed this … An adenovirus is a combination of viruses — gastrointestinal virus, ok, pneumonia, and COVID-19, mixed together to create a very deadly virus to kill our children.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim misconstrues what adenovirus really is —, and the notion that it was created to kill children is false.  Her explanation of adenoviruses is misleading and seems to suggest it has been ""developed"" with the purpose of killing children. That’s not the case. 
Adenoviruses are common and aren’t new. Medical organizations such as the CDC and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles describe them this way: They’re a group of viruses that can cause flu-like symptoms or a variety of common infections, such as the common cold. Pink eye is also classified as an adenovirus.  Adenovirus can also result in more serious cases, like pneumonia or bronchitis. The CDC has linked it as a possible cause for the cases of sick children in Alabama. In a recent report, the agency noted that nine children admitted to a hospital between October-November 2021 had severe cases of ""hepatitis and adenovirus viremia.""  ""Adenovirus was detected in whole blood specimens from all patients by real-time PCR testing,"" the CDC said in its report.  Public health officials have said that the Alabama cases bear similarity to cases of hepatitis that have been reported in other countries. The CDC said during a May 5 media briefing that it was investigating 109 cases of hepatitis of unknown cause in 25 states over the course of seven months  — out of those, five children had died.  While this is serious, none of this proves that the adenovirus was created. We fact-checked a similar claim in April that said hepatitis outbreaks were tied to the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which is a viral vector vaccine that uses an adenovirus. Officials from the World Health Organization and the UK Health Security Agency debunked that claim, reporting that the vast majority of children who were infected did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, the J&J shot is not authorized for anyone under 18.  In light of the recent hepatitis cases in children that may be tied to adenoviruses, a Facebook video claims that the outbreak was developed by mixing gastrointestinal virus, pneumonia, and COVID-19 in order to kill children. Adenoviruses are not new, nor have they been developed to kill children. They are a group of viruses that cause common infections, ranging from mild colds to pneumonia.

Yes, carbon dioxide is a pollutant
","The Republican Party of Virginia recently held a weekend bash at a Dulles hotel to celebrate its sweep in the statewide elections last fall and discuss its agenda. High among its goals is to repeal the state’s Clean Economy Act, a law that commits Virginia to joining a regional cap-and-trade program and achieving 100% carbon-free power by 2050. The law was passed in 2020 when Democrats controlled both chambers of the General Assembly as well as the governorship. The law was labeled ""wokeism"" at a seminar held by the Suburban Virginia Republican Coalition, an Alexandria-based group that says its weekly newsletter reaches 25,000 people. SUVGOP rejects that a climate crisis exists and that man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) is harming the environment. ""CO2 is not a pollutant,"" SUVGOP said in its presentation materials for the April 30 session. The statement contradicts piles of scientific studies showing increasing CO2 levels are contributing to rising temperatures across the globe, the efforts of industrial nations to reduce their emissions, a ruling by the Supreme Court and a statement by the Environmental Protection Agency. Let’s start with a trip back to middle school science, where we learned about  photosynthesis. Plants pull in carbon dioxide through tiny openings in their leaves where it combines with water and sunlight to create sugar, producing oxygen as a byproduct.  It may be hard to imagine something as life-sustaining as CO2 could be so damaging, but it’s what’s called a greenhouse gas. Those gasses, which also include methane, nitrous oxide and others,  produce an insulating effect that allows sun rays to enter the atmosphere but not leave after they bounce off the earth’s surface. When fossil fuels - such as oil, gas and petroleum - are burned to create energy, they release CO2. In the U.S., 76% of greenhouse gas emissions are CO2. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 47% since the beginning of the Industrial Age and 11% since 2000, according to NASA.  The Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gasses fall under the Clean Air Act’s definition of pollutants and can be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. (The high court heard oral arguments in February 2022 challenging the ruling but has yet to render a second opinion.)   In 2009, the EPA classified greenhouse gasses - especially from vehicle emissions - as a form of pollution. The gasses ""are the primary driver of climate change, which can lead to hotter, longer heat waves that threaten the health of the sick, poor or elderly; increases in ground-level ozone pollution linked to asthma and other respiratory illnesses; as well as other threats to the health and welfare of Americans,"" the EPA said. Why does SUVGOP reject these findings? We asked Collister Johnson, a senior advisor to the group who led the presentation as well as another one to the state’s Republican party in December 2021. ""I’ve been studying this for a long time,"" said Johnson, who lives in Alexandria and is a former chairman of the Virginia Port Authority and administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. ""We breathe in carbon dioxide. The notion that it’s polluting to human beings doesn’t hold up."" Johnson laid out his arguments in a 2020 article for CFACT, a conservative organization that disputes human-made climate change. He accurately noted that CO2 constitutes about four of every 10,000 molecules in the atmosphere - an increase of about one CO2 molecule since the mid-20th century.  ""Most importantly, the theory of man-made global warming does not pass the sniff test – the test of common sense,"" Johnson wrote. ""It simply does not follow common sense to believe that an increase of one human-caused atmospheric CO2 molecule out of ten thousand over eighty years should result in the ruination of the planet. Johnson’s logic, a talking point among climate-change doubters, is widely dismissed by climate scientists. They say the important point is that CO2 levels are increasing - not that they still compose a tiny part of the atmosphere.  ""It shouldn't be surprising that a small amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can have a big effect,"" wrote Jason West, a professor of environmental sciences and engineering at the University of North Carolina. ""We take pills that are a tiny fraction of our body mass and expect them to affect us."" Vickie Connors, an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Center for Environmental Studies, wrote in an email, ""The argument that common sense has any role to play in determining the ultimate outcome from our unabated release of fossil fuel emissions into our thin envelope of atmosphere is outrageous in this era of global data sets, measurements of temperature increases from any altitude above the surface to the tropopause, in the surface and upper layers of the oceans, in the upper soil horizon, in the measured melting [of] sea ice, glaciers, and snow at high elevation and polar latitudes."" Johnson has also noted that CO2 levels were once 10 times higher than they are today and ""animal life thrived and prospered."" But scientists told us that occurred before humans existed. ""‘Pollution’ is a term that is somewhat human-centric,"" John Reilly, co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, wrote in an email. Kevin Trenberth, distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, sent us an email labeling the CO2 claims by Johnson and SUVGOP ""misleading rubbish."" SUVGOP, in a presentation at a meeting of the state Republican Party, said ""CO2 is not a pollutant.""

Posts misattribute quote about the US needing a ‘domestic supply of infants’ to Alito, Barrett
","Following the Supreme Court draft opinion leak on Roe v. Wade, some social media users zeroed in on the document’s inclusion of an eyebrow-raising phrase: ""domestic supply of infants."" Many falsely attributed the words to Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Samuel Alito, claiming that the two said the U.S. needed this ""supply"" of babies to meet the needs of people seeking to adopt. ""BREAKING: In a brief re abortion, Supreme court Justices Amy Coney Barrett/Alito's Draft, said US needs a ‘domestic supply of infants’ to meet needs of parents seeking to adopt — that those who would otherwise abort must be made to carry to term — giving children up for adoption,"" reads one post that’s been shared over 21,000 times on Twitter. ""Two judges on the highest bench in the land actually wrote this line ‘domestic supply of infants for adoption’ as justification for taking away a woman's right to control her own body,"" another post on Facebook said. ""Actually wrote that line down, on paper, like it wasn't some insane Orwellian dystopia."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The draft opinion was authored by Alito, not Barrett, according to the document, which was first published by Politico. But the phrase referenced in the Facebook post appears in the opinion as a footnote and wasn’t written by either justice. It was a quote from a 2008 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document about adoption data.  The line, as it appears in the footnote, reads: ""Nearly 1 million women were seeking to adopt children in 2002 (i.e., they were in demand of a child), whereas the domestic supply of infants relinquished at birth or within the first month of life and available to be adopted had become virtually nonexistent."" The CDC quote is cited on the page 34 of the leaked draft in a paragraph that lists arguments from those opposed to abortion. The citation is made after a sentence that reads that ""a woman who puts her new- born up for adoption today has little reason to fear that the baby will not find a suitable home."" It followed another paragraph on page 33 that summed up the beliefs of people who support abortion rights. The opinion ends the section with this paragraph: ""Both sides make important policy arguments, but supporters of Roe and Casey must show that this Court has the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion may be regulated in the States. They have failed to make that showing, and we thus return the power to weigh those arguments to the people and their elected representatives."" Viewing the CDC’s quote about infant supply in its full context shows that the line is emphasizing that babies put up for adoption will likely find families. It’s not claiming that birth rates need to increase, or that abortion should be outlawed, in order to meet high adoption demands.

Photo does not show lithium mine — it’s a copper mine
","Seeking to simplify the complicated issue of  clean energy, social media posts have proliferated claiming to show pictures of the destruction left by lithium mining for hybrid and electric-vehicle batteries. The problem is that many of these posts have been wrong about what the images show. And a new one from a March 24 post follows that pattern with a photo it says shows ""one of Tesla's lithium supply mines where entire mountains are eliminated."" The post includes two images, of an oil well and a mine. The caption says the oil well is where ""100% organic material is pumped out of the ground, taking up around 500 to 1000 square feet,"" contrasting that with the mine, which it says ""came at a cost of entire mountains, thousands of square miles of land and billions of gallons of oil and fuel.""

Yes, Democrats do need ‘more than a majority ... to codify Roe vs. Wade’
","A leaked draft opinion that indicated the U.S. Supreme Court could soon strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision establishing the right to abortion has sent shockwaves through American political, religious and societal circles.  If the 1973 ruling is overturned, in Wisconsin an 1849 ban on nearly all abortions would go back into effect. Nationally, with Democrats controlling Congress and the White House, there has been a push to codify the right to an abortion in federal law. But that’s not as easy as it may sound. And that gets at a vexing issue that we wanted to use this fact-check to help address: Where does the Senate fit in a political world in which most everything else — including the Supreme Court — is majority rule? ""Because the U.S. Senate is a minority institution, meaning you don't have to get the most votes and still control the chamber, we need to have more than a majority of Democrats in control to codify Roe v. Wade,"" state Sen. Kelda Roys, D-Madison, said May 8, 2022, on ""Capital City Sunday.""  On Wednesday, Senate Democrats failed to advance legislation intended to protect abortion access nationwide even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. On a 51-49 vote, Democrats fell short of the 60 votes they would have needed. When we asked Roys for backup, she – unsurprisingly – pointed to the Senate rules, specifically the 60-vote requirement for ""cloture,"" or what is needed to end debate for a (majority rules) vote on the underlying bill. ""Without 60 votes, a minority of senators can filibuster any proposal to which they object,"" Roys told us. There are some exceptions to this rule, such as budget reconciliation measures, but those exceptions provide limited opportunities and would not apply to a proposed bill codifying abortion rights.  Republicans say the filibuster protects the rights of the minority party. In recent years, the focus on eliminating the filibuster has centered on federal court nominees. The filibuster used to apply to all judicial nominees, but Democrats eliminated it for many nominations under President Barack Obama, and Republicans eliminated it for Supreme Court nominees under President Donald Trump. Right now, the chamber is evenly divided, but Democrats have the tie-breaker vote in the form of Vice President Kamala Harris. Roys said the situation is compounded by the U.S. Senate’s ""unbalanced representation."" ""Right now, the 50 Democratic senators represent 41 million more Americans than the 50 Republicans,"" Roys said, a statement confirmed by a Nov. 6, 2020, Vox report. This is because Democrats typically garner more votes in high-population states, while Republicans fare better in states with lower populations. But each state gets two U.S. senators regardless of population. For example, Wyoming, with a population close to 600,000 and called the most Republican state in the U.S., has two senators; while California, with a population close to 39 million and considered to be a Democratic stronghold, also has two senators.  Norman J. Ornstein, an emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C., conservative think tank, said the Senate is a minority institution in two ways. ""Because each state, regardless of population, gets two senators, a tiny majority of the population can determine the outcomes,"" Ornstein said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""To give a contemporary example, we are almost at the point where 70 percent of Americans live in just 15 states. Meaning 30 percent of Americans will elect 70 senators.""  Ornstein, who serves as an election analyst for CBS News and writes a weekly column for Roll Call, also explained that the filibuster rule means that ""41 senators can block action on any bill except for those that are protected by rules like reconciliation.""  According to the U.S. Senate reference website, using the filibuster to delay debate or block legislation has a long history.  ""The term filibuster, from a Dutch word meaning ‘pirate,’ became popular in the United States during the 1850s when it was applied to efforts to hold the Senate floor in order to prevent action on a bill,"" the Senate site says.  In 1917, according to the website, in response to pressure from President Woodrow Wilson and the crisis of World War I, the Senate adopted a new rule establishing the ""cloture"" procedure. This allowed the Senate to end debate with a two-thirds vote (67 votes in a 100-member Senate). In 1975, the Senate reduced the number of votes required from two-thirds to three-fifths (60).  ""So, even if Democrats had 50 or even 59 votes to codify Roe v. Wade, so long as the filibuster rule remains as is, unified Republican opposition can block the bill,"" Ornstein said. ""Right now, all Republicans are opposed. The Democrats could find a way to alter the rule, as was done for confirmations, by majority, but right now at least two of their own won't agree."" Roys said due to U.S. Senate rules, Democrats need ""more than a majority ... to codify Roe vs. Wade.""  Roys was referring to Senate rules which require 60 votes for ending debate prior to a vote on a bill, which means it’s possible to have a party with control — in this case the Democrats — but without the ability to move measures forward that don’t have support from the other.

Video shows “Sister Cindy,” an anti-abortion preacher and TikTok star, speaking sarcastically
","An edited video of a woman who appears to be speaking enthusiastically about abortion is being falsely portrayed on social media. ""Absolute evil. Listen to her voice and the cheering..,"" read a May 7 Facebook post. The post shared a TikTok video where a woman tells a crowd, ""Ladies, if you get pregnant, run on down to the abortion clinic and have that little bastard sucked right out!""  A crowd of young people watching her cheer and laugh. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

He tweeted the video again a day later, calling it ""Truly Satanic."" ""Highlight reel footage for the midterms,"" conservative commentator Mike Cernovich tweeted on May 7. But the claim that this person is actually advocating abortion misses context about who the speaker is and what she has said she believes. The video appears to have originated on TikTok, where it amassed nearly 3 million views. ""This just in: Sister Cindy supports abortion,"" reads the caption, which is a clue that the video is not what it seems. ""Sister Cindy,"" whose real name is Cindy Smock, is a Christian evangelist from Indiana who travels with her husband to, she writes on the ministry’s website, ""share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the students of America."" The husband-and-wife team have been traveling to college campuses around the country for more than 40 years. Smock often uses inflammatory rhetoric, and sometimes comedy, in her speeches and commentary. Some of her comments have been criticized as being homophobic and racist.  ""My husband and I take the confrontational approach to Evangelism,"" Smock told Vice in a 2021 interview. ""We go out on the campuses and call the students to repentance and faith in Jesus."" Smock has become a TikTok star, amassing over 400,000 followers who watch videos of her campus visits and buy her merchandise or order videos of her ""roasting"" their friends.  Students can be seen in videos flocking to Smock’s campus appearances, cheering her on, perhaps ironically, jeering her or laughing at or with her as she welcomes them to her ""slut-shaming show.""  Some ask her to pose for selfies and others have joined her in a TikTok dance for her channel. She’s also drawn criticism from some who find her rhetoric offensive or hateful. In another video of her abortion comments filmed at Missouri State University on May 3, Gregory Holman, a reporter for KSMU, a local public radio station, tweeted that her remarks about women running down to abortion clinics were sarcastic and came in response to students chanting ""my body, my choice."" In response to students chanting “my body my choice”, the speaker sarcastically advised people to seek out abortions… The students went wild pic.twitter.com/twmrDpdwbU We reached out to Smock to find out more context about the video being widely shared but she didn’t respond. However, on her TikTok account, she shared the video where she spoke about abortion, with a text overlay that reads, ""When Gen Z, the masters of satire, are outwitted by Sis. Cindy.""  She then snapped her fingers in approval after hearing the line that has garnered so much attention online. A text overlay at the bottom of  the video reads, ""Your choice but, ‘Shall not the JUDGE of the earth do right?’"" Some commenters on her Tik-Tok video still seemed confused about her position on abortion.  One asked her what she thought of abortion as a live-saving procedure, and Smock replied it’s ""between her and God!!"" Further down, another commenter posted ""Jeremiah 1:5,"" to which she replied, ""exactly.""

Mehmet Oz supports abortion in limited cases, but wants Roe v. Wade overturned
","Some candidates for higher office moved fast to spotlight the issue of abortion in their TV ads and fundraising appeals after the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. In the race for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, former hedge fund manager Dave McCormick unveiled an ad that squarely attacked Dr. Mehmet Oz, McCormick’s top rival for the Republican nomination, on abortion. The minute-long video opens with a clip of Oz in a Senate debate saying: ""There isn’t, to my knowledge, evidence that I’m not ‘pro-life.’""  Then there are clips of Oz talking about abortion in a radio interview that the ad labels, ""Evidence from 2019.""  The ad ends with these words on the screen: ""Mehmet Oz. Pro-abortion. Anti-life. Hollywood liberal.""  Politicians often use ""pro-life,"" ""pro-choice"" or ""pro-abortion,"" even though the labels lack precise meanings.  In the 2019 interview, Oz, a heart surgeon and attending physician at New York Presbyterian-Columbia Medical Center, was ""pro-abortion"" in that he spoke in favor of access to the  procedure. But he also said he was personally opposed to the procedure and would advise his family members against having one. And while campaigning to win the May 17 primary, Oz has turned more ardently anti-abortion, touting himself as ""100% pro-life"" and celebrating the draft opinion by saying he supports overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that provides the national right to an abortion.  The draft opinion would return to the pre-Roe world, where states set their own laws. There could be small or significant changes in the draft as justices weigh in before a final decision, which is expected in late June or early July. McCormick’s ad relies on the Oz radio interview comments, which are shown in video clips. The clips are from Oz’s appearance on ""The Breakfast Club,"" a nationally syndicated show with a mostly Black audience, on May 21, 2019. At the time, Oz was a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist and hosted his own television show. Oz was asked about a law signed six days earlier by Alabama’s Republican Gov. Kay Ivey that would have banned nearly all abortions in that state. The law was later blocked in federal court. The question led to a seven-minute discussion about abortion. Oz said he didn’t want to interfere with other people’s decisions about getting an abortion, and indicated that states should decide laws on abortion. He expressed support for access to abortion, but opposition to abortion personally.  ""I think the law was really only passed to generate a Supreme Court challenge. But most people don’t know that they’re pregnant. It’s two weeks past your last period when you have to decide by….And it’s also banned in case of incest and rape. So, I don’t quite get it, as a doctor,"" he said. A host on the show said she was concerned that women would seek dangerous illegal abortions. ""As a doctor, just putting my doctor hat on, it’s a big-time concern,"" Oz said. ""Because I went to medical school in Philadelphia and I saw women who’d had coat-hanger events. They’re really traumatic events that happen, when they were younger, before Roe v. Wade. And many of them were harmed for life. Emotionally, there’s scarring anyway.  ""At a personal level, I wouldn’t want anyone in my family to have an abortion. I told my kids this, I love the lives that they’re creating so much that I personally wouldn’t want it. But I don’t want to interfere with everyone else’s stuff, because it’s hard enough getting through life as it is."" Oz warned that Alabama’s law could have economic consequences, saying, ""You want to ban abortion, make that loud and clear, but there’s going to be a big sucking sound of businesses leaving there."" ""If someone deep in their heart feels that the moment of conception is a human life, and they just can’t deal with that life being harmed, they got to be heard, they can’t get ignored. But that doesn’t mean that’s what the rule of the land is.""  Excerpts from the same interview are used in two other ads attacking Oz that were released after the draft opinion was published. One is a McCormick ad that also labels Oz as ""pro-abortion."" The other ad, from the pro-McCormick Honor Pennsylvania super PAC, questions whether Oz is ""pro-life."" On May 5, 2022, Oz was asked in a Philadelphia radio interview if he had changed his position since the 2019 interview. Oz replied that he said in the 2019 interview that he was ""pro-life,"" but supported the three major exceptions for abortions, to protect the life of the mother, and in cases of rape or incest. To back its ""pro-abortion"" claim, McCormick’s campaign pointed us to articles citing the 2019 interview and to a 2008 article in the National Review of Medicine, a publication for Canadian physicians.  In the 2008 article, Oz was quoted as saying he was ""not socially conservative,"" and that ""we should not be creating obstacles during the difficult time that women have when trying to terminate a pregnancy."" During the campaign, Oz has decried legislation that he describes as Democrats’ ""pro-abortion agenda."" Oz’s campaign website describes him as ""100% pro-life."" And he says ""life starts at conception.""  Oz campaign spokesperson Brittany Yanick told PolitiFact that Oz ""has never said that he supports abortions"" and that he is ""adamantly opposed to abortion."" However, Oz told a Pennsylvania TV station in December that he supports allowing abortions to protect the life of the mother, and in cases of rape or incest. He added: ""I’m OK with the Supreme Court making the right decision based on what they think the Constitution says.""  Oz praised the draft ruling, tweeting: ""The Court is right. Roe was wrongly decided. Abortion laws should be left up to the American people and their elected representatives. I look forward to supporting pro-life legislation that saves innocent lives in the U.S. Senate."" The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and decided not to seek re-election.  Besides McCormick and Oz, the major Republican candidates are commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate developer Jeff Bartos, Philadelphia attorney George Bochetto and Carla Sands, who served as Trump's ambassador to Denmark.  The leading Democratic candidates are Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb. The Nov. 8 general election race is rated as a toss-up and as ""tilts Republican."" The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. McCormick said Oz is ""pro-abortion."" Before his Senate race, Oz was more open to abortion access. He spoke against restrictive abortions laws, citing his hospital experience, though he said he personally opposed abortion. As a candidate, Oz describes himself as ""pro-life"" and supports overturning Roe v. Wade. But he supports allowing abortions in cases such as rape and incest.

Dave Weldon claims embryonic stem cell research is at a ""dead end,"" with no successful treatments
","Former Space Coast Rep. Dave Weldon wants to debate the front-runner in the GOP primary for Florida’s U.S. Senate seat, Rep. Connie Mack IV.

Mack, riding high in the polls with enviable name recognition, isn’t game. So in an unusual yet entertaining move, Weldon created his own six-minute debate with Mack and posted it on his website.

Though Mack’s responses were phony, Weldon used the ""debate"" to talk up his social conservative credentials.

Moderator: ""The government has been paying for stem cell research despite majority opposition. Mr. Mack?""

Fake Mack: ""HUH?!?""

Moderator: ""Okay, I see you voted for more spending. Dr. Weldon?""

Weldon: ""The truth is, research into embryonic stem cells is not only immoral but scientifically it has proven to be a dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment.""

It’s not the first time Mack has differed from fellow Republicans on the issue. Mack voted in favor of bills that would have expanded federal research on embryonic stem cells beyond limitations set by an executive order from President George W. Bush.

Bush vetoed the bills Mack supported, but President Barack Obama kept his promise to lift Bush’s restrictions that federal money not be used for research on embryonic stem cell lines created before 2001. Obama in 2009 talked of ""broad agreement in the scientific community that the research should be supported by federal funds.""

With that background in mind, we wanted to check Weldon’s claim that embryonic stem cell research ""has proven to be a dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment."" We should note that Weldon is an internist and a practicing physician.

Embryonic stem cell research involves experiments on live embryos obtained through extra eggs of in vitro fertilization patients, who must sign consent forms allowing for experimentation. These eggs were not fertilized inside of the women’s body, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Research on human, non-embryonic stem cells is older and less controversial. The key difference is embryonic stem cells can become all cells of the body, while adult stem cells are limited to the cells of their original tissue.

Weldon obviously disagrees, arguing the research is an affront to the sanctity of life because embryos are destroyed in the process. Proponents of expanding embryonic stem cell research say these embryos would be discarded anyway, and it’s worthwhile to explore more uses for embryonic stem cells.

The National Institutes of Health spent about $123 million on research involving human embryonic stem cells in the fiscal year ending in 2011, according to the NIH. The government spends more on other areas in this field, doling out $620 million in 2011 for non-human, non-embryonic stem cell research and $395 million on human non-embryonic work.

The National Academies of Science has also issued guidelines for stem cell research. In its 2008 revision of stem cell research guidelines, it noted that ""it is far from clear at this point which cell types will prove to be the most useful for regenerative medicine, and it is likely that each will have some utility.""

One group that doesn’t think embryonic stem cell research is at a ""dead end"" is the Genetics Policy Institute, which will host the World Stem Cell Summit in West Palm Beach, in December 2012.

The first isolation of embryonic stem cells happened just 14 years ago, said Bernard Siegel, the advocacy group’s executive director. It’s a huge discovery -- akin to ""nuclear fission in a petri dish"" -- that will take time for scientists to unravel, he said.

""I would say the United States could be much further along without opposition to stem cell research, and certainly Dave Weldon is a prime example of someone who has put the brakes on promising research,"" Siegel said.

A website for which Siegel is a spokesman, StemCellAction.org, lists ""recent advances"" in embryonic stem cell research across the globe. Yes, he said, Weldon is right that no successful treatments have emerged from these cells, but that perspective dismisses multiple research efforts across the world.

"" ‘Treatment’ means something that has gone through an approved clinical trial,"" Siegel said. ""And in fact, one of our very first approved clinical trials is going on now.""

That trial involves macular degeneration, which leads to blindness. A preliminary report released in January 2012 described improved vision for two legally blind patients through therapy using human embryonic stem cells. While the New York Times noted a few problems with the report, it was welcome news to proponents who were discouraged after the Geron Corporation called off the world’s first clinical trial around embryonic stem cells.

In announcing the end of its trial, which aimed to treat spinal cord injury, Geron said the company wanted to focus on cancer therapy experiments that were further along, and that it had not lost hope for the embryonic stem cell field.

Many scientists and politicians are hopeful about a recent development that may quell questions of morality. The technique reprograms skin stem cells with embryonic qualities without destroying an embryo. However, the resulting cells are not free of complications, and some studies show they may increase the risk of cancer.

""There’s a lot of potential for them,"" said Stephen Duncan, director of stem cell biology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. ""But human embryonic stem cells are the gold standard.""

University of Wisconsin developmental biologist James Thomson -- whose research team was first to derive embryonic stem cell lines from human embryos in 1998 -- was among researchers who in 2007 discovered the reprogrammable cells. Even with the discovery, he said it was not time to stop researching embryonic stem cells.

Thousands of stem cell researchers assembled in Yokohama, Japan, for the annual conference of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in June 2012, including Lawrence Goldstein. Goldstein is one of the society’s board members and director of the stem cell program at the University of California, San Diego.

""I wouldn’t be doing this if I thought it was a dead end,"" he said, referring to his own research that aims to develop a therapy for ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. ""The (academic) papers are not saying ‘we’re closing this area down because there are no interesting scientific leads.’ In fact, the area fuels research on embryonic stem cells and reprogrammed stem cell research. The area (Weldon) would support would be going more slowly without the work on embryonic.""

Our ruling

Weldon’s synopsis of embryonic stem cell research as at a scientific ""dead end"" does not appear to be widely shared by scientists. Research is ongoing, and scientists say it’s too early to call it quits on a discovery made in 1998.

Weldon’s second point about there being ""no one good successful treatment"" from embryonic stem cell research is accurate, though scientists say it is premature and unrealistic given the field’s bureaucratic constraints.

On the whole, we rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/31/dave-weldon/dave-weldon-claims-embryonic-stem-cell-research-de/

Democratic Wisconsin lawmaker helped GOP Gov. Scott Walker enact budget cuts, group says
","
A campaign brochure with a picture of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and headlines referring to Rep. Elizabeth Coggs, D-Milwaukee, claims ""millions of dollars in tax breaks"" were paid for ""by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs' help.""

In a word: Really?

Walker’s legislative changes in 2011 transformed him into a Republican star and one of the nation’s most divisive political figures. And yet the group circulating the material, We Are Milwaukee, claims a Democratic Assembly member helped make it all possible.

Distribution of it comes ahead of the Aug. 14, 2012 primary election in which Coggs and four other Democrats are seeking the seat being vacated by Coggs' cousin -- state Sen. Spencer Coggs, D-Milwaukee -- who was elected city treasurer in April 2012.

So let’s return to the wildly partisan times of 2011 and see what role Coggs played in advancing Walker’s agenda.

""Paid for""

We Are Milwaukee Inc., which says it works for social and economic justice, registered with the state Government Accountability Board as a political committee in March 2012. Its registrant was Peter Rickman, who has been active in public demonstrations against Walker and as part of the Occupy Wall Street movement.

The front of the We Are Milwaukee brochure against Coggs (which lists a return address in Wauwatosa) says: ""We need leaders who will stand up to Scott Walker.""

The attack on Coggs, on the back, cites three 2011 votes.

It says Coggs ""voted with"" Walker on one bill that the group says provides ""millions of dollars in tax breaks to big corporations and the super-rich.""

It goes on to say Walker and his allies paid for for the tax breaks ""by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs’ help."" Cited are Walker’s budget-repair bill and his 2011-2013 state budget bill.

Rickman referred our questions to We Are Milwaukee spokesman Eric Hogensen, who argued that the tax breaks bill ""opened the door"" to cuts made in the budget-repair and budget bills because they created a ""deficit.""

Hmmm. The budget deficit Walker faced exceeded $3 billion. Just how pivotal was the single tax breaks bill that We Are Milwaukee cited?

Let’s examine the three bills, all of which became law and are footnoted in the flyer.

1. Tax breaks

As we reported in analyzing a July 2012 claim made by state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, D-Madison, against state Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, in a congressional race, Assembly Bill 3  wipes away taxes for two years for businesses that move to Wisconsin. The state estimates the bill will mean $1 million over two years in lost revenue.

Coggs voted for the bill, but so did many other Democrats. It was approved in the Assembly overwhelmingly, 82-12, in January 2011.

So, Coggs did vote ""with Walker"" for a bill that could, over a period of years, create tax breaks amounting to millions of dollars. But her vote was hardly as decisive as the group portrays it.

2. Budget-repair bill

After a 61-hour debate in February 2011, the GOP-controlled Assembly adopted the budget-repair bill in a chaotic fashion. The bill gave Walker broad powers to reshape health programs, use borrowing and make employees pay more for benefits to fill a $137 million hole in the two-year state budget ending June 30, 2011.

As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported: ""Just after 1 a.m., Republicans cut off debate on Gov. Scott Walker's bill and in pell-mell fashion the body voted 51-17 to pass it. In the confusion, nearly one-third of the body -- 28 lawmakers including 25 Democrats, two Republicans and the body's lone independent -- did not vote on the bill at all.""

Coggs was among those who did not vote, Assembly records show.

But the lack of her vote wasn't an important factor, given the margin the bill was approved by. And the $137 million deficit far exceeded the estimated loss of $1 million in revenue over two years from the tax breaks bill Coggs did vote for.

Yet We Are Milwaukee says the $1 million paved the way for the $137 million -- and more.

3. Budget bill

As for the two-year state budget, the Assembly passed it, 60-38, in June 2011. Records show Coggs voted no.

The Walker-GOP budget cut spending on schools, local governments and public workers' benefits to meet the two-year shortfall -- which was more than $3 billion.

Indeed, it would have taken more than 3,000 tax breaks at $1 million each to ""pay for"" the cuts.

Our rating

We Are Milwaukee said ""millions of dollars in tax breaks"" were paid for ""by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs' help.""

The idea that some $1 million in tax breaks over a two-year period supported by Coggs and most other Assembly Democrats needed to be paid for by some $3 billion in budget cuts is false and ridiculous.

Calligraphers make more than national security directors in Obama White House, says Mike Huckabee
","Every year, the White House releases a list of its employees and their salaries. When the 2012 list came out, Mike Huckabee found fodder there to take a jab at the Obama administration.

Huckabee, a former presidential candidate and now a talk show host, wrote on on his Facebook page, ""If you want a good job, you should’ve gone into government."" He noted that the total White House payroll went up $700,000 from the year before; it now stands at $37.8 million. Then, commenting on the timing of the administration’s data dump -- late on a Friday afternoon -- he wrote, ""Maybe they just didn’t want to explain their priorities, considering that we now know the White House has three staff calligraphers making between $86,000 and 97,000 dollars each, and just one National Security Director. She makes $55,000.""

That seemed curious. For this fact check, we’re looking into whether the White House puts penmanship above managing foreign affairs. Huckabee’s post was recommended over 4,500 times and got over 5,100 Likes. On top of that, the same comparison showed up on a number of other blogs and Facebook pages.

We downloaded the salary spreadsheet from the White House website and found that Huckabee has his numbers right. There are three calligraphers and just one National Security Director, and they make what he said they make.

There is, however, an important issue about the job description for the National Security Director. Through Huckabee’s website we asked what he thought the National Security Director did. We did not get a response.

We did get a description from the White House. The National Security Director basically helps with human resources for the national security staff. The person in that job is Kinsey Casey. Casey makes sure that open positions are filled, which includes vetting and interviewing applicants. She helps new staffers transition and generally takes care of the details of personnel management. In short, she does administrative work.

Prior to this job, Casey had a mid-level position during the presidential inauguration managing credentials for participants and guests. During the 2008 primary, she was the Northeast Regional Political Director for the John Edwards campaign.

Huckabee might have confused the National Security Director with the National Security Adviser. This is a high-profile position currently held by Thomas Donilon, a lawyer who was once chief of staff to Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Clinton administration. Donilon helps shape strategy on major international issues such as the civil war in Syria, Iran’s nuclear program, and North Korea. He is part of a trio of advisers, one of whom focuses on preventing violent extremism in the U.S., and the other who deals with international economics.

All three advisers make $172,200 a year, nearly twice the salaries of the calligraphers.

Before the Huckabee Facebook post, we hadn’t given much thought to the White House calligraphers. It turns out they’ve been part of the staff for decades. They design and handletter the menus, invitations, and ceremonial declarations for formal events. C-SPAN profiled them in 2008.

The Huckabee post notes that the staff payroll rose $700,000 since last year. That is accurate but it’s also true that it is $1.3 million less than 2009, Obama’s first year in office. For the record, the median salary around the White House is about $65,700.

Our ruling

Huckabee said that the National Security Director makes less than the three White House calligraphers. That’s accurate, but the statement would have us believe that this particular national security job has a lot to do with policy. That is wrong. It is an administrative position and to suggest otherwise is misleading. Also, Huckabee singles out the Obama administration for having misplaced priorities when the White House has employed calligraphers for decades under both Republican and Democratic presidents. It doesn't mean the White House places penmanship above national security.

Florida education commissioner says the FCAT takes up ""less than 1 percent of the instructional time"" during the school year
","
The perennial cry from parents and teachers who criticize the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test is that students are spending too much time on those tests. And that cry grew louder when the state announced that FCAT scores plunged in 2012 after a revamping of the test.

Students take the high-stakes exam for math, reading and other subjects in grades 3 through 10. Third-graders who get low scores are at risk of being held back. Students ultimately must pass the FCAT -- or earn an equivalent score on the SAT or ACT -- to graduate with a standard diploma.

Gov. Rick Scott said in July that it’s time to take a second look at the FCAT after the state has received so many complaints from parents about the tests. Scott told a conference of newspaper editors that between the FCAT and other tests, students may be tested too much.

Scott’s education commissioner appointee, Gerard Robinson, has been playing defense about the FCAT since the state announced earlier this year that a new grading formula would result in a drop in school grades. Statewide, the percentage of A schools dropped from 58 to 48 percent.

Reflecting a backlash against testing, more than a dozen individual school boards in the state, including Broward and Palm Beach, have passed a resolution against the FCAT. The Florida School Boards Association passed its own version of a resolution criticizing the FCAT in June.

Robinson penned a June 15 response, which included these comments: ""The FCAT neither drives the curriculum nor narrows the educational experience of Florida students. ... These assessments average two to three per student per school year and account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year. ... It is worth noting that local school boards require students to take many more assessments than those required by the state.""

There are a few interesting claims in Robinson’s statement, but the one that caught our eye was that tiny figure: The FCAT accounts for ""less than 1 percent of instructional time."" Heck, we wonder if lunch or recess could add up to more than 1 percent. So we decided to research whether Robinson’s 1 percent claim was correct.

The Education Department’s explanation

Robinson’s chief of staff John Newman told us in a July 19 interview that the education department staff pulled together figures for Robinson about a month ago in response to the public’s concerns about the amount of time spent on the FCAT.

He sent us a copy of an excel spreadsheet showing how much time is spent taking the test. This refers only to the minutes to take that exam -- not the amount of time spent preparing for it during regular school hours or after-hour extra sessions that some students participate in.

By dividing the number of minutes spent on the FCAT by the number of minutes in a school year (54,000 minutes based on 900 minimum hours of school instruction a year), the education department determined that students spend anywhere from .26 to .90 percent of their time taking the test.

But Robinson used the phrase ""instructional time"" in his claim, which could fairly be interpreted to mean classroom time spent preparing for the test.

School districts aren’t required to track how much time they spend preparing students for the test. For example, multiplication and division are included on the FCAT for certain grade levels, but math teachers don’t have to document how many minutes the class spent on multiplication versus division. And an English teacher doesn’t have to document how many minutes are related to reading comprehension portions of the FCAT.

That’s why determining how much time is spent ""teaching to the test"" is somewhat subjective.

""I guess you could say the whole year is test prep,"" Newman, Robinson’s chief of staff, told PolitiFact.

We asked Newman: Why is it valid to only look at the minutes spent actually taking the test and not factor in how much time is spent preparing for the test?

He said it’s up to the school districts to determine how to teach those standards that are assessed on the FCAT -- and those methods can vary from school to school.

""If they choose to do that sitting there drilling practice tests all day, that’s their choice,"" Newman said.

A state law says that schools can’t suspend ""a regular program of curricula for purposes of administering practice tests or engaging in other test-preparation activities for a statewide assessment."" But the law also says that schools can administer sample tests, teach test-taking strategies and teach the skills that will be assessed.

What educators say 
We asked a few Florida teachers how much ""instructional time"" they spend on the FCAT. Our teachers from Miami-Dade included Alexandria Martin, an English teacher at Carol City High School, Whitson Carter, a math teacher at Filer Middle School, and Cassandra Harley, a third-grade teacher at North Beach Elementary School. In Broward we interviewed Angel Welsh, who teaches sixth-grade language arts at Nova.

All three of our Dade teachers said that FCAT preparation accounts for the majority of their school year -- or at least through the dates in the spring when the students take the FCAT. Students take practice tests at certain points during the year so schools can measure their progress toward the FCAT and prepare students to take timed tests. And FCAT prep isn’t limited to school hours -- districts have the option of adding extra help before or after school or on the weekends.

""The tests are always on the forefront of teachers’ minds, students’ minds,"" said Martin, who has taught for seven years.

Throughout the year, teachers have benchmarks to prepare students for the FCAT. So if Martin’s class is reading Othello, she makes sure they understand vocabulary, the author’s purpose, and reference and research skills.

""Hopefully I am preparing them for the real world, but the test is always at the forefront,"" she said.

Welsh, who has taught for 23 years, said that about six weeks before the FCAT she spends about half of each 90-minute period on FCAT preparation. But she also spends time throughout the year on teaching vocabulary and reading comprehension, which is assessed on the FCAT.

""I know what I’m going to cover and how I’m going to cover it, with or without FCAT,"" she said. ""I feel good teaching leads to a good FCAT score. … I know (the test) is in my peripheral vision back there. I really try not to let it guide my instruction, but does it sometimes? I’m sure it does.""

Our ruling 
Robinson said that the FCAT tests ""account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year."" This was a prepared statement, based on research done by his staff, in response to FCAT critics who say that schools devote too much time to the tests.

Readers could assume that by ""instructional time"" Robinson was including regular lesson time in the classroom preparing for the FCAT. He wasn’t. His office says that referred to the number of minutes taking the test out of the total minutes of instruction per year. But he didn’t provide that explanation in his statement.

In reality, there is no clear way to quantify how much time teachers spend preparing students for the test. Some teachers say they spend practically all their time on the FCAT.

Robinson’s goal was to deflect criticism that too much time is spent ""teaching to the test."" He is suggesting that the FCAT eats up only a smidgen of a school year. But for students, parents and teachers who spend months preparing for those tests, Robinson’s words are misleading.

We rate this claim False.

Tommy Thompson says he created enough smallpox vaccine for “every man woman and child"" in America
","
Defending himself against accusations he was a big spender in Washington, Tommy Thompson reminds audiences of the terrorist attacks in 2001 while he oversaw the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services budget.

""No secretary has ever had to deal with that,"" Thompson, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, told a tea-party audience on June 4, 2012 when a man challenged him on the federal debt.

Thompson spoke of the anthrax attacks that began shortly after 9/11 and the worries over biological warfare.

""At the time I was secretary, I had a few problems,"" he said. ""A few problems, like there was not enough smallpox vaccine (for) America. Donna Shalala left me with 12 million doses of vaccine, all 1955 doses. And I created enough. I created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man woman and child against smallpox in America.""

In this item we’ll examine whether the U.S. government ramped up the smallpox vaccine program as Thompson says -- and how much credit he deserves.

When asked for backup, Thompson’s campaign assembled an extensive history of the episode, including news accounts. Their math: 209 million new vaccine doses through contracts Thompson pushed for, plus 340 million old doses Thompson acquired from frozen storage at a private company, Aventis Pasteur.

The total would easily cover the population at the time, about 280 million.

Thompson is correct about how much vaccine he inherited. We found that 10 million to 15 million doses were on hand -- a stockpile that officials learned could be safely diluted to create five times as many doses.

And there is no doubt that events during Thompson’s time concluded with enough vaccine becoming available for all Americans. We heard that from Steven Adams, deputy director of the Strategic National Stockpile division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But Thompson’s claim went much further. He said, ""I created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man woman and child against smallpox in America.""

What was his role?

He can’t -- and doesn’t -- claim credit for the 10 million to 15 million doses the government already had on hand. But Thompson did indeed help make it possible for production of 209 million new doses.

So that makes the Aventis Pasteur donation of long-stored vaccine crucial.

Let’s look first at Thompson’s math on the Aventis vaccine.

The announced amount was about 85 million doses. Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said that number should be quadrupled to 340 million, citing a quote by an Aventis official who said he believed the doses could be diluted in the same fashion as the existing government stockpile.

Subsequent studies confirmed that and more: the Aventis doses could be effective at a 1:10 dilution ratio.

Nemoir said the government found the company, which had changed hands, so credit should go to Thompson.

But when the company and Thompson announced the deal at a March 29, 2002, news conference, both made it very clear it was Aventis that approached the government shortly after the 9/11 attacks to alert officials to the stockpile in frozen storage.

In fact, Aventis officials said they had years earlier alerted the federal government about the stockpile but officials had shown little interest, and the company was planning to dispose of it.

So this part of the total seems to fall more into the category of a lucky break.

But before we draw a conclusion, let’s hear from the key players of that era, including D.A. Henderson, who led the campaign eradicating smallpox in the 1970s, which eliminated the need for the vaccine.

In the late 1990s, in part as an adviser to Shalala, Henderson was among those pushing for production of 40 million doses of smallpox vaccine to control an outbreak in the case of the intentional release of the virus.

The move got support but moved slowly and did not come to fruition under either President Bill Clinton or President George W. Bush after his term began in January 2001.

One of Thompson’s first moves after the attacks in 2001 was to personally call Henderson and get him aboard to head the government’s bioterror preparedness response. Soon after, Thompson stunned Henderson and those pushing for 40 million vaccine doses.

Thompson wanted more, much more: enough to vaccinate every American.

Henderson was skeptical of the need but quickly realized that such a massive stockpile could help meet a broader goal of allowing the U.S. to help contain bioterror outbreaks in other countries.

The idea came from Thompson, who not only pushed it hard, but packaged it in a politically savvy way that inoculated the expensive effort from political attacks, Henderson said.

""It was a master stroke to sell it that way, for ‘every man, woman and child in America,’"" Henderson recalled.

Thompson’s agency, in coordination with other departments, moved quickly to get support for and contract for private production of new vaccine. Cost estimates ranged from $1 billion to $2 billion.

Two other top experts also praised Thompson.

Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said Thompson and Stewart Simonson, an assistant HHS secretary, took a pragmatic, hands-on approach. Thompson brought him on as a special adviser after 9/11.

Anthony Fauci, the famed AIDS researcher who joined the bioterror effort, credits Thompson for spurring the dilution study on the existing stockpile, and says it’s ""conceivable"" that Aventis Pasteur was spurred to come forward in part by Thompson’s public push for more vaccine.

The company portrays it in a different light, saying it took the initiative to ""remind"" the government it had the old vaccine in storage.

Thompson, we think, does deserve a bit of credit for negotiating with the company to acquire the 40-year-old vaccine, which by most accounts was donated. Henderson, though, said the government paid for it.

Our rating

Thompson accurately recounted how much vaccine was on hand and was on target in saying that on his watch enough became available for ""every man woman and child"" in America.

He didn’t technically ""create"" the stockpile, but he boldly shot for the moon on its size, seamlessly sold the idea to Congress and experts and then personally drove the public and private move to a successful conclusion in just a few years -- even if some of it carried the element of luck.

Chris Christie says almost 90,000 New Jerseyans are back to work since he took office
","
Optimism about New Jersey’s economy abounds with Gov. Chris Christie.

The Republican governor said regardless of a growing unemployment rate in New Jersey, which he argued is climbing because more people are actively seeking work,  the numbers show more New Jersey residents are finding jobs.

""What I look at every month is how many more New Jerseyans are back to work. You have another 9,900 last month that are back to work and over almost 90,000 that are back to work now since I became governor,"" Christie said during a July 23 news conference. ""That's a positive for the state.""

Christie repeated part of the claim during a radio interview the next day.

""So I absolutely believe the New Jersey comeback has begun. It hasn't arrived completely. It's begun. And ask the 90,000 people who are employed today in New Jersey who were not employed when I became governor whether the comeback [has] begun for them,"" Christie said on New Jersey 101.5 FM’s ""Ask the Governor"" program. 

During the press conference and radio interview the governor cited job numbers prior to the statements we’re fact-checking here. But he then characterizes those jobs gains as residents going back to work and that’s not accurate.

Jobs do not equal people. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics counts jobs by a different method than it counts employed residents.

So it’s possible for a state to gain jobs, but still have fewer employed residents  

That’s what happened in June. 

The state gained 9,900 jobs overall last month, including public- and private-sector employment. But 17,000 fewer New Jersey residents were employed in June than May. 

More people have found work since Christie took office, but not as many as the governor claimed. 

Christie said 90,000 people found work during his time in Trenton. That figure actually represents the number of private-sector jobs -- 89,700 -- New Jersey has added since February 2010, Christie’s first full month in office. 

Over the same time frame, nearly 39,000 New Jersey residents found employment, less than half the figure Christie cited. 

So what gives?

A job created in a state does not mean an unemployed resident returned to work. 

The federal labor department counts jobs through a survey of employers called the payroll survey. ""We don't know how many people that represents,"" said Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, because a person may hold more than one job.

To count the number of employed residents, the federal labor department relies on a survey of households. In that survey, individuals are classified as employed, unemployed or not in the labor force by their place of residence, even if their job is in another state.

And by that measure, Christie’s figures for the number of New Jersey residents who have returned to work are off.

Brian Murray, a spokesman for the state labor department, said: ""On every other occasion for the past week during which the Governor has addressed this topic in public, he has correctly stated that we gained 9,900 jobs in June and nearly 90,000 jobs since his first full month in office.  To pounce on this is ridiculous and petty.""

Our ruling

Christie said that 9,900 New Jerseyans returned to work in June and almost 90,000 residents are ""back to work now since I became governor.""

Christie wrongly represents job gains as individuals returning to work. The federal labor department counts jobs and employed people in separate surveys. It’s possible for jobs to go up while the number of employed people goes down. 

Some 17,000 fewer New Jersey residents were employed in May than June, despite 9,900 new jobs created last month. 

Since February 2010, the first full month Christie was in office, nearly 39,000 -- not 90,000 -- people found employment in New Jersey. 

We rate this claim False.

Memphis candidate George Flinn claims his patents “revolutionized modern medicine”
","  Dr. George Flinn is well known in Memphis as a radiologist, radio station magnate and a big-spending, self-funding Republican political candidate who is running for Congress again this summer, this time in Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District.

Fewer know him as an inventor with patents on file in Washington, but that’s what he claims in a commercial he’s airing as he seeks to defeat 2010 GOP nominee Charlotte Bergmann. The winner in Thursday’s Aug. 2 primary will face the winner of the primary between incumbent U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen and school board member Tomeka Hart.

The commercial boldly claimsthat Flinn is ""a doctor whose patents in ultrasound have revolutionized modern medicine, whose innovations have saved lives throughout the world.""

Based on the scant evidence we were able to discover and our lack of deep knowledge in the history of ultrasound technology, we are narrowing the focus to whether Flinn does indeed hold patents in ultrasound technology that might have revolutionized modern medicine.

The only Flinn patent we were able to find was awarded on July 3, 2007, and it is not for ultrasound technology. Flinn and two others received patent No. 7,238,370 B2 for their invention of a substance made of pumice and an aqueous surfactant (like a detergent) that experiments showed increased skin thickness and gave it a ""more youthful appearance."" It was also tested on shaved guinea pigs. Its claim is that it prevents and treats ""photoaging"" of skin.

Whatever the usefulness of this substance, we’re comfortable concluding it has not revolutionized modern medicine. It took Flinn’s campaign more than a week to provide information about other innovations the campaign believes backs up Flinn’s claims. OnThursday evening, July 26, campaign manager Kristi Stanley sent along three acknowledgement letters from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office confirming receipt of applications for patents.

Not patents, but applications for patents.

The letters state that the information Flinn provided (which was not provided to PolitiFact) ""will be examined for patentability."" The letters also extend Flinn the right under federal law to seek a patent in foreign countries. Nothing that Stanley provided indicates Flinn sought foreign patents. She did note that Flinn also was involved in obtaining patents while employed by the National Institutes of Health that are held, not by him, but by that government agency.

So let’s look at the three patent applications, according to the initial letters from the Patent and Trademark Office dated in May and June of this year.

One (Customer No. 062439) is for ""Chemotherapy Treatment Using Microspheres to Deliver a High Concentration of a Drug to a Tumor."" The letter provided by Stanley provides no other information about the patent itself, just details about Flinn’s rights. It does not appear to deal with ultrasound.

The second is titled ""Process for an Improved Galactogram Procedure,"" with, again, no supporting description or detail.

The third: ""Color Encoding Method for Ultrasound Images."" Again: No detail.

We could explain that galactography is the examination of the breast by mammography and, specifically, examination of the milk ducts, or that microspheres are particles smaller than one millimeter in diameter. But it seems we can make short work of this analysis by saying that, although Flinn claims to deserve the patent for them, these are not patented inventions and he only sought them after he was deeply involved in this congressional campaign.

If the technologies are being employed in medicine to demonstrative salubrious effect, it isn’t because they are his patents because the patents have not yet been granted.

When contacted initially, the campaign indicated it was eager for us to examine the claim but did not provide the kind of supportive documentation that would establish its veracity. Instead, the documentation establishes the application for patents.

But Flinn’s commercials flatly claim he his patents in ultrasound technology revolutionized modern medicine, when the record shows he he only applied for patents several months after this congressional campaign was under way. That kind of deliberate deception of voters earns this claim a Pants On Fire!",/factchecks/2012/jul/30/george-flinn/memphis-candidate-george-flinn-claims-his-patents-/
"['Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine says George Allen voted to raise his pay four times while in Senate
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen said in a recent debate that he’s always opposed ""wasteful spending"" in Washington.

That drew a rebuke from Democratic opponent, Tim Kaine, who said Allen was a big spender when the Republican served in the Senate from January 2001 to January 2007. Kaine charged that Allen was even a beneficiary of his own Senate votes.

""You voted four times to raise your own pay,"" Kaine said.

We looked into Kaine’s charge, made at a July 21 debate in Hot Springs.

The U.S. Constitution requires Congress to set its own pay. In 1789, members were paid $6 a day at the 1st Congress. Today, they receive $174,000 annually.

Congress, no doubt, is sensitive to the political fallout that comes when it increases its pay. So in 1989, it approved legislation that would allow salaries to increase every year without requiring members to record a vote, as our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida have noted.

Congress, that year, passed an ethics reform law that included an annual cost of living adjustment. The programmed raise was created in exchange for members not getting paid any longer for private speeches. The pay increase, based on a formula, became automatic unless Congress took a vote to stop it.

During Allen’s senate term, congressional salaries rose from $145,000 in January 2001 to $165,200 in January 2007. Adjusted for inflation, the level of pay stayed declined slightly.

Allen never supported a bill specifically crafted to increase congressional pay.

So how does Kaine back up his claim that Allen voted four times to raise his salary?

Not with votes to raise congressional salaries, as Kaine charged, but with votes Allen cast in the Senate against measures that would have prevented the the automatic raises from going into effect. This happened in three of the instances Kaine cites:

*On Dec. 7, 2001, Allen voted that an amendment to prevent the annual raise from going into effect in the 2002 fiscal year was ""not germane"" to a defense appropriations bill pending in Senate. The amendment was defeated.

*On Nov. 13, 2002, Allen voted against an unsuccessful amendment to the Homeland Security Act that would have prevented the annual raise from going into effect in fiscal 2003.

*On Oct. 23, 2003, Allen voted against an unsuccessful amendment to the transportation and treasury appropriations bill, that called for stopping the annual raise for fiscal 2004.

The fourth incident Kaine cites also occurred on Oct. 23, 2003, when Allen voted for the overall transportation and treasury appropriation bill that contained the congressional pay hike. The cost of the salary increase -- about $2 million -- came to just 1/450th of 1 percent of the $90 billion appropriations bill.

We contacted the Allen campaign but did not receive a response that pertained to the pay raises. 
It should be noted that Allen didn’t always vote to kill amendments to stop the raises. In 2005, he was among 92 senators who supported an amendment to a transportation and treasury spending bill that would have stopped the cost-of-living pay hike for the 2006 fiscal year.

The House, on its end, didn’t include an amendment to stop the raise in its transportation and treasury spending bill.  Ultimately, the Senate amendment was stripped from the appropriations bill and the pay hike went into effect in the 2006 fiscal year.

Our ruling

Kaine says Allen voted four times to increase his pay in the Senate.

None of the votes that Kaine cites was a simple question on whether lawmakers will increase their pay. Three of them were procedural votes in which Allen opposed amendments that would have kept an automatic, yearly cost-of-living increase from going into effect. Allen’s votes in those instances helped stop efforts to cancel the pay hikes.

The fourth instance Kaine lists was not a direct vote on congressional salaries. In that case, Allen supported a massive, $90 billion transportation and treasury appropriations bill that included $2 million for an automatic, cost-of-living pay raise.

Only three of the four votes Kaine cited specifically focused on congressional pay raises. So we rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jul/30/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-george-allen-voted-raise-his-pay-fo/

Scott Walker says a study shows the federal health care law will ""devastate"" Wisconsin
","
Gov. Scott Walker and his top health officials say Wisconsin has quality health care that’s available to more people than in most states.

But Walker argues President Barack Obama’s health care reforms, aimed at controlling the rising cost of health care and providing access to affordable health insurance, will ""devastate Wisconsin.""

And in an opinion piece published July 12, 2012 in the Washington Post, he says he’s got a study to prove it.

Here is part of the piece:

""The bad news is that, from a practical standpoint, Obamacare will devastate Wisconsin. An actuarial study commissioned by my predecessor, a Democrat, and completed last year found that if Obamacare is implemented in Wisconsin:

-- 100,000 people will be dropped by their employer-sponsored health insurance.

-- 59 percent of people who buy their own health insurance will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent.

--150,000 people will stop buying health insurance in the private sector and will instead become dependent on the government and taxpayers.

-- Between 2014 and 2019, Obamacare could cost Wisconsin taxpayers $1.12 billion; after all federal aid and tax credits are applied, the state’s portion of the bill will be $433 million.

-- Approximately 122,000 parents, caretakers and pregnant women with an income of more than 133 percent of the federal poverty level will no longer be eligible for Medicaid.

Walker concludes that he prefers more private-sector competition to try to hold costs down and insure more people.

Those are some startling claims, all couched in the certitude of ""a study"" -- and one ordered by a Democrat.

Is Walker right?

We’ll look at the four parts of his claim that Walker says come straight from a study authored in part by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, a leading health-care expert. We’ll save the $1.12 billion taxpayer-cost claim for another day, but note Walker attributes it to the study when it’s actually his administration’s own estimate, and that estimate has been challenged.

And because Walker so closely links his ""devastate Wisconsin"" characterization to the results of the study, we’ll look at whether the study found that Obama’s reforms would ""lay waste"" to or render Wisconsin ""desolate"" -- our dictionary’s definition of ""devastate.""

Let’s start at the end, and then take each claim in turn.

The Gruber study’s succinct conclusion starts with this fact: About 340,000 uninsured people in Wisconsin would become insured because of the law.

Walker’s op-ed notes that 91 percent of Wisconsin residents have health insurance, but does not mention that the number would rise when the reforms kick in.

The study does conclude that higher premiums would be a reality for some people who buy insurance on their own. Others in that group, it says, will see their premiums go down.

But the study is written in bland actuarial terminology, and offers no opinion, pro or con, on the changes that Wisconsin could face under Obama’s reforms.

Its primary author, Gruber, strongly objects to the way Walker characterizes the study, contending the governor distorted its findings on the impact of the health care reforms under the Affordable Care Act of 2010.

Let’s take a look at what Walker pulled out of the 56-page study, authored by Gruber -- who has worked has worked with both Mitt Romney and Democrats on health-care reform -- Gorman Actuarial, and Jennifer Smagula.

Part 1

Walker quotes the figure correctly: ""100,000 people will be dropped by their employer-sponsored health insurance.""

But he leaves out that an estimated 90,000 others will gain coverage through employers, for a net drop of 10,000 people with employer coverage.

Gruber said Walker failed to note that ""many more people in the recession alone have lost their employer coverage"" than would happen under the Affordable Care Act. Gruber notes the 100,000 people is just 3 percent of those with employer coverage.

Walker was trying to point out the negative impact of people having to switch doctors when they are dropped from their employers’ plan, said Stephanie Smiley, spokeswoman for the Department of Health Services.

Part 2

Walker takes this claim almost word for word from the study: ""59 percent of people who buy their own health insurance will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent.""

Walker correctly cites the impact on 59 percent of the relatively small group -- 160,000 people -- who lack access to employer insurance but are able to buy policies directly from insurance companies or through brokers.

The study notes that the health reform law creates both ""winners and losers"" among this group.

In the op-ed piece, Walker cites only the ""losing"" side of the equation.

The study prominently noted that the other 41 percent in this group would pay smaller premiums -- 56 percent smaller on average. That’s after taking into account the law’s subsidies for people in low-to-middle-income households who don't get health benefits from an employer.

And Walker did not note that some people would pay higher premiums by choice, because the subsidies will enable them to buy better coverage.

Smiley said she didn’t know why Walker singled out the losing side. She said that some people would be forced to buy richer benefits than they want. Experts say that will happen, but how many is not known.

Under the health care law, younger, healthy people will pay more, and older, less healthy people will pay less, Gruber and other experts say. The younger group in effect will subsidize the older group, including those with pre-existing conditions who will be able to get the same coverage as everyone else under Obama’s changes.

Typically people who buy insurance on their own are unemployed, self-employed or work for small companies. These plans in the current ""individual market"" tend to be costlier and less comprehensive than in employer-provided plans, and enrollees pay the whole tab, a Kaiser Health News story said.

Part 3

Walker’s asserts that ""150,000 people will stop buying health insurance in the private sector, and will instead become dependent on the government and taxpayers.""

But there are multiple problems with Walker’s wording.

The Gruber study does not say that 150,000 people will stop buying health insurance ""in the private sector."" It says the opposite -- they would buy insurance from private companies through the government-run ""exchanges,"" online marketplaces where people and small businesses will be able to shop for insurance from private companies.

Walker further asserts that those people ""will instead become dependent on the government and taxpayers.""

By ""dependent,"" Walker refers to the taxpayer subsidies, tied to income, that the law provides to people, Smiley said. But an estimated 60,000 of the 150,000 would not be eligible for subsidies, the study says

How those people would be dependent on the government -- much less taxpayers -- isn’t clear. Smiley said she didn’t know, either.

Part 4

Walker says Gruber’s study found that ""approximately 122,000 parents, caretakers and pregnant women with an income of more than 133 percent of the federal poverty level will no longer be eligible for Medicaid.""  Medicaid is state-federal health insurance for low-income families as well as the disabled and elderly who are impoverished.

That number is not in the study at all, even though Walker’s opinion piece indicated it was.

Smiley acknowledged it’s a Walker administration estimate.

The wording of Walker’s piece suggests that pregnant women and others will lose their health insurance. What Walker didn't mention is they instead will buy subsidized health insurance from private companies through the exchange.

Given Walker’s preface that his claims prove ""devastation"" of Wisconsin, we think some readers probably imagined he was suggesting that 122,000 people would be thrown off Medicaid and left without coverage.

""I don’t think it was intended to suggest that,"" Smiley said. ""It was just that they can’t get the plan they currently have.""

Walker here was referring to a group of people above 133 percent of the poverty line who currently get Medicaid coverage through BadgerCare Plus.

Overall, Gruber said Walker’s op-ed was particularly misleading because it focused on a small number of people (about 100,000) who will see premium increases, while ignoring that 340,000 more people would get insurance.

Our rating

In an opinion piece in the Washington Post, Walker said ""Obamacare"" will push people off employer-sponsored insurance, drive up premiums, increase dependency and make 122,000 people, including pregnant women, ineligible for Medicaid.

The context of his comments is his assertion that this will ""devastate Wisconsin.""

Walker pulls some numbers from an actuarial study of the impact of the law, but cherry-picks data, leaves out critical facts and mischaracterizes some of the numbers, creating a highly misleading impression. Indeed, some of the numbers he attributes to the study are really estimates from his own administration.

Chris Christie slammed by Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy for refusing to fund billions in pensions
","
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy have a mutual distaste for each other’s policies -- and they do not mind letting the public know it.

Last year, Republican Christie blasted a plan by Democrat Malloy to raise taxes. Malloy fired back in a July 23 radio interview, criticizing Christie for refusing to make pension payments in the Garden State.

During an interview on WNPR’s Colin McEnroe Show, Malloy charged that Christie ""has refused to fund pensions by billions of dollars,"" and got legislative approval allowing him to delay ""properly funding pensions"" until 2018.

It is accurate that Christie’s first spending plan outlined in March 2010 did not include billions in recommended pension payments, and the governor did sign legislation delaying a full annual contribution until fiscal year 2018. But Malloy failed to mention in his interview that Christie later started making partial payments.

""Gov. Malloy stands by what he said,"" his senior adviser, Roy Occhiogrosso, said in an e-mail. ""If Gov. Christie feels like delaying pension payments is what works for New Jersey, then it’s of course his right to pursue that as public policy.""

In March 2010, Christie outlined his proposed budget for fiscal year 2011, which did not include any pension payments. Soon after, he signed legislation requiring the state to make one-seventh of the full fiscal year pension contribution, starting in fiscal year 2012.

Under that legislation, state payments are to increase annually until the full amount is paid in the seventh fiscal year and each year afterward.

In keeping with the March 2010 law, the Christie administration made its first contribution in fiscal year 2012 and has scheduled an even larger payment in fiscal year 2013, which started July 1. But those payments are a fraction of the total recommended contributions.

In each fiscal year, the recommended contribution stood at more than $3 billion. However, the fiscal year 2012 payment was roughly $484.5 million and the scheduled fiscal year 2013 payment is $1.03 billion.

Andrew Pratt, spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury, argued that pension reforms approved by Christie will save billions in coming decades.

The bottom line ""is that after decades of neglect, Governor Christie led the state to passage of historic, bipartisan reforms that both reduced pension costs for taxpayers and put the funds on course for permanent solvency,"" Pratt said in an e-mail. ""Pension reforms will save taxpayers an estimated $122 billion over 30 years, greatly reducing the pressure on both state and local government to make drastic cuts in services or reduce taxes.""

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Malloy claimed Christie ""has refused to fund pensions by billions of dollars,"" and got legislative approval to begin ""properly funding pensions"" in 2018.

In March 2010, Christie introduced his first budget without including billions’ worth of recommended pension payments, and then signed legislation delaying a full annual contribution until fiscal year 2018.

Christie made a payment in fiscal year 2012 and an even larger payment is scheduled for fiscal year 2013, but those payments still fall short of full contributions by billions of dollars.

"['New Hampshire', 'State Budget', 'New Boston Republican Committee']","
New Boston GOP says Democrats left state deficit
","
If spring is lilac season in New Hampshire, summertime is election season, and campaign signs sprout like weeds on every corner.

One sign, posted recently around the Nashua area by the New Boston Republican Committee, boils down the upcoming state election to a simple, 11-word statement, describing the difference between recent Democratic and Republican legislatures.

""NH DEMOCRATS $1 BILLION DEFICIT,"" the sign reads. ""NH REPUBLICANS UNDER BILL (House Speaker William) O’BRIEN BALANCED BUDGET.""

Certainly, the recession has had its effect on New Hampshire, and state revenues have taken a hit. But did the Democrats, who lost the majority in the Statehouse in 2011, really leave a $1 billion deficit? We decided to crunch the numbers.

First, it's important to note that New Hampshire lawmakers are legally required to balance the budget. So it's not accurate to suggest that the last Democratic budget had a deficit.  And as you'll see below, they ultimately produced a surplus.

We found that the New Boston Republican Committee was using the same tactic PolitiFact National had seen in an attack against Mitt Romney, portraying an interim budget projection as if it was a final outcome.

To start our research, we reached out to the Republican committee in New Boston, a small farming community not far from Mont Vernon, the hometown of House Speaker William O’Brien.

Committee members confirmed that the sign refers to the last Democrat-led budget, for Fiscal Year 2010-11. That year, the Democratic legislature boosted state spending and accepted federal stimulus funding, according to committee chairman Patrick Murphy. But, the Democrats failed to cover the spending with corresponding revenue increases, leaving the state far in the hole, he wrote in an email.

To support his point, Murphy directed us to the Speaker’s office, which then pointed us toward a 2011 report by the Legislative Budget Assistant, a nonpartisan office that conducts investigations, analyses and research into the state government.

In January 2011, days after the current Republican-led legislature took office, Jeffry Pattison, the budget assistant, issued a report identifying about $845 million in spending items that could pose concerns for the new legislature if all fiscal policies and structures remained the same.

The report highlighted that the federal stimulus had provided $350 million that helped the state pay for schools and the Medicaid program. This was understood at the time to be a one-shot deal.The report also listed $141 million in state education payments set to go into effect if the legislature failed to act, as well as $92 million projected for municipal and school building aid.  

""I was talking about appropriations that would go up by virtue of formula driven things,"" Pattison said last week. ""Things that would happen if nothing was done about them.""

Add to the $845 million figure another $50 million shortfall, projected by the House of Representatives at the time, and you reach $895 million -- most of the way to the New Boston Republicans’ $1 billion figure and closer to the $900 million quoted often by O’Brien, the House Speaker.

""Combining these items left an anticipated, unresolved deficit, according to the LBA, for the FY2012-13 budget,"" Greg Moore, chief of staff to the House of Representatives,  wrote in an email to the Telegraph. ""That is where the Speaker identified that figure and why he uses ‘nearly $900 million’ number regularly.""

Still, whether $900 million or $1 billion, the numbers didn’t hold up over time.

Like in the numbers cited in past PolitiFact items, Pattison never considered his estimates as a final budget tally. Instead, he intended them to be a point-in-time projection to give legislators an idea of what could happen over the years to follow.

""These are snapshots in time,"" Pattison said last week. ""I wanted to make sure they had their eyes open, that they knew coming in what was ahead of them.""

This is a routine situation for both parties. Budget analysis predict when spending will exceed revenues and lawmakers have to balance them.

And legislators took note, crafting a 2012-13 budget that responded to the projected deficits.

""At the time of the implementation of the new budget, ALL parties expected that the budget would end in deficit,"" wrote Moore, the House chief of staff.

But, by the time the budget accountant office finished its formal audit early this year, the final report told a different story. In the end, the Fiscal Year 2011 budget didn’t show a billion dollar deficit, or any deficit at all. The Democrats actually produced a surplus in their last year.

That year, the state, which is required by statute to keep a balanced budget, took in $1.385 billion in revenues, spending $1.325 billion, according to the final audit.

Factoring the state’s $64 million surplus entering the 2011 fiscal year, and subtracting the $124 million contributed to the education trust fund, among other fund transfers, the state closed the Fiscal Year 2011 with a $17.7 million surplus. Legislators also maintained the state’s $9.3 million rainy day fund.

Some political leaders contend the numbers are skewed because lawmakers relied heavily on borrowing and federal funds to balance the budget, as required by state statute.

""It was not solved by any cuts the Democrats made but by a one time infusion of federal money,"" Murphy, the New Boston Republican chairman, wrote in an email. ""A ‘Hail Mary Pass’ thrown by Obama is what made the difference.""

Still, others say it came through a range of budget cuts and tax hikes common to the budget cycle.

""There was an increase in the tobacco tax. Programs were cut. … You have to make budget choices,"" added Pamela Walsh, an advisor for the state Democratic Party who served as deputy chief of staff to Gov. John Lynch at the time. ""The numbers they used, it was as if the state government was on autopilot with no revenue growth.""

That brings us now to the current budget, for Fiscal Year 2012. The House Republican leadership team have credited themselves with cutting more than $1 billion, nearly 10 percent, from the state operating budget, now totaling $10.48 billion. But, according to initial projections, the state is running about $17 million short of initial revenue projections, Pattison said.

""We’re in the process of closing the state books as we speak, but, as of right now, they’re a little off,"" he said. ""This is just starting. (The Fiscal Year) isn’t even 30 days old. We’ll see where it’s at at the end.""

But here, too, those are projections, not a final deficit.

Our ruling:

The New Boston Republicans’ sign makes some big claims in only a few words.

It wrongly describes a $1 billion interim projection as a deficit, ignoring the state law that mandates a balanced budget and the fact that the Democrats actually produced a $17.7 million surplus. 

The Republican group's sign is twisting the reality of the state budgets for partisan reasons and leaving people with a false impression. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/29/new-boston-republican-committee/new-boston-gop-says-dems-left-deficit/
"['Bankruptcy', 'Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Patrick Kennedy']","
Former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy says most bankruptcies in U.S. are due to health care costs
","
Former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy  went on the WPRO Morning News on July 13 to talk about the Middle East and the national health-care overhaul.

When asked about the ""political tension surrounding Obamacare,"" Kennedy said people such as his father, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, President Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney don’t have to worry about their health care.

""In other words, when my brother Teddy had life-threatening cancer, my father realized that they had to worry about his survival, but they didn’t have to worry about him being bankrupted because he was trying to save his son’s life,"" Kennedy said. ""Many Americans are worried that when an illness strikes the family, not only is it an illness, but it's a threat of bankruptcy. And the largest number of bankruptcies in our country are really as a result of health care.""

Given the continuing debate over the health-care overhaul, we thought that claim was worth checking.

When we asked what he based that statement on, Kennedy, a Democrat who served eight terms representing Rhode Island in Congress before stepping down two years ago, could not cite a specific study or group making that claim, but he said, ""I’ve been in a million rallies on health care. It’s the most well-versed thing out there.""

While job losses or foreclosures might have been big contributors following the 2008 financial crisis, Kennedy said, over time ""it’s pretty well understood that personal bankruptcy’s largest cause was because of the medical crisis,"" and ""no one has contended it’s anything other than that. Whether it is the cause of the final bankruptcy or a contributing cause, there’s no question it’s involved in a major way.""

To check Kennedy’s claim, we first called the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonpartisan research and education group based in Alexandria, Va. Public affairs director John Hartgen said anecdotal evidence indicates medical reasons are ""definitely a big cause"" for bankruptcies, ""but also death of a spouse, credit card debt, loss of a job, and you have a housing crisis now.""

He said the institute does not have its own data to quantify the reasons for bankruptcies, but he pointed us to a study by Harvard researchers and a report by the Institute for Financial Literacy.

The Harvard study, published in the American Journal of Medicine in 2009, has attracted a lot of attention in part because one of the researchers was Elizabeth Warren, the former Harvard Law School professor who is now the Democratic candidate challenging U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., for the seat once held by Kennedy’s father.

The study, which follows a similar Harvard study in 2001, was based on ""the first-ever national random-sample survey"" of 2,314 bankruptcy filers and it concluded that, ""Using a conservative definition, 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical.""

But ""that’s not the end of the story,"" as PolitiFact National said in 2009 when it gave then-Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a Half True for saying that ""62 percent of all personal bankruptcies were caused by medical problems.""

PolitiFact National noted that in the Harvard study, 29 percent of respondents attributed their bankruptcy to medical bills from illness or injury. But when respondents were asked if medical-related issues such as lost income due to illness or the mortgage of a home to pay medical bills contributed  to their bankruptcy, that figure rose to 62 percent, giving some support to Kennedy’s claim.

""The statistic that we think is most reliable is the percentage of people who say medical bills were the reason for their bankruptcy, and that number is 29 percent,"" PolitiFact National said.

But, again, that’s not the end of the story. The Institute for Financial Literacy, a nonprofit financial education and counseling organization based in South Portland, Maine, has been compiling a demographic profile of American debtors since 2006. It surveyed credit-counseling clients seeking bankruptcy protection, asking them to identify their  ""causes of financial distress."" They could choose more than one cause, so the percentages equal more than 100 percent.

In the most recent report, issued in September 2011, ""overextended on credit"" was the leading cause of financial distress at 70.5 percent, followed ""reduction of income"" at 64.9 percent, ""unexpected expenses"" at 56.6 percent, ""job loss"" at 43.5 percent, ""illness/injury"" at 30.9 percent and ""divorce"" at 15.5 percent.

""The institute has surveyed over 200,000 individuals in the past five years and what we find interesting is not so much what changed, but what has not,"" the report said. For example, it said that causes such as ""illness/injury"" have remained ""rather consistent,"" while causes such as ""job loss"" have become a bigger factor.

Our ruling

Patrick Kennedy said ""The largest number of bankruptcies in our country are really as a result of health care.""

While Kennedy didn’t cite any data to back his assertion, he could have relied upon the Harvard study to provide some support for his statement. But the Institute for Financial Literacy report undercuts the claim, with 70 percent of respondents citing credit problems  and only 31 percent  ""illness/injury"" as the leading cause of their bankruptcies.

Since the matter is not nearly as clear-cut as Kennedy presented it, we rate his claim ""Half True.""",/factchecks/2012/jul/29/patrick-kennedy/former-us-rep-patrick-kennedy-says-most-bankruptci/

Public input into transportation project list disputed
","

A group of metro Atlanta residents recently   hit the road -- literally -- to publicize its opposition to a 1 percent sales tax to help fund dozens of transportation projects across the region. They drove around I-285 with their vehicles decorated to signify their disapproval of the proposed tax.

Many of the reasons the group, Lights for Liberty, opposes the tax have been well-documented. But there was one claim on the list we hadn’t seen much of before.

Voters will decide the tax in a Tuesday referendum after a hard-fought campaign by supporters and opponents. .

""The tax proceeds will be spent to complete a project list in which the voting public had no say,"" Lights for Liberty said in a press release.

No say, you say?

PolitiFact Georgia took a ride on the information superhighway to see if the group’s claim is correct. We were particularly curious about this one since we rated True a statement several months ago that 200,000 residents had a chance ""to identify projects they preferred.""

The Georgia General Assembly voted in 2010 to allow a voter referendum this year that gives citizens the choice to increase the sales tax for projects that proponents believe will reduce traffic congestion. State officials and transportation planners in a 10-county region that encompasses and surrounds Atlanta came up with hundreds of ideas. Those 10 counties are Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale.

A regional ""roundtable"" of 21 elected officials was charged with winnowing the wish list to a final list of projects that could realistically be paid for during the 10 years the tax is scheduled to be in effect. The elected officials included the head of each of the 10 county governments, a mayor from each of those counties and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. Atlanta lies in both Fulton and DeKalb counties.

In October 2011, 18 of those 21 officials present unanimously approved the list of more than 150 projects.

A few months before that vote, in June 2011, roundtable staff held a telephone town hall meeting in each of the 10 counties. An estimated 1.3 million area residents were called (there are slightly more than 3 million adults in the region) and encouraged to ask questions. About 134,000 participated in the town hall meetings and were asked a specific question concerning transportation in their county.

In September 2011, roundtable officials held meetings in each county where maps of the proposed projects were shown. Attendees were able to take a survey about the projects and talk to the staff. Afterward, an hour-long question-and-answer session was held between the public and staff.

The Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network pointed out these and other efforts to engage the public when we fact-checked their claim that 200,000 people have the opportunity to identify projects they preferred.

Lights for Liberty is a grassroots group with about a dozen members. A Lights for Liberty member said he was aware of the outreach, but still believed the claim in the group’s press release is on target that the public had no say in completing the project list.

""Maybe, there was an attempt to talk to the people, but the people weren’t really involved in this,"" said Billy Wise, who lives in Gwinnett County and describes himself as a taxpayer advocate.

Wise argues there has been no cost-benefit analysis of the projects. He has decried the lack of public input in the referendum. Wise said telephone town hall meetings aren’t the best method to get public input from people who are busy raising a family and working and have had little time to digest the proposed sales tax.

""The guy out there mowing his lawn would absolutely have no clue (about the tax) and I think a lot of that happened here,"" he said. ""I’ve been a phone screener and I’ve gotten a lot of ‘What?’ or people hanging up.""

In Cobb County, leaders hit the brakes on plans for a light rail line from the Cumberland area to the MARTA Arts Center station in Atlanta after residents, tea party activists and others voiced their opposition to the idea. Meanwhile, many south DeKalb County residents have literally begged for a rail line to the Stonecrest area, with no success.

Wise makes an interesting argument that average voters haven’t had a fair shot at weighing in on a list that was approved by 18 elected officials.

The shift from the rail line in Cobb, however, shows the voting public has had a say in the project list. There have been varying degrees of public involvement on the list, much of it minor.

Still, there is a grain of truth in the Lights for Liberty statement.

Wes Riddle says the U.S. is giving seven Alaskan islands to Russia
","
Liberal magazine Mother Jones ran a news analysis July 24, 2012, picked up by HuffingtonPost.com, that linked a Texas congressional candidate’s claim to one that was earlier found false by a fact-checking outfit.

The article says Wes Riddle, who faces Roger Williams in a July 31 runoff for the Republican nomination in the state's 25th Congressional District, posted on Facebook in May 2012 that ""the State Department is giving away seven strategic, resource-laden Alaskan islands to Russia."" The story says his post resembled a question FactCheck.org had tackled two months earlier.

Riddle’s Facebook page did not have that post when we peeked, but we found Google’s cached version. The May 16 post said that once elected, Riddle vows to start impeachment proceedings against President Barack Obama and that the reasoning behind such action begins with the Alaskan island giveaway, as quoted by Mother Jones.

Six weeks earlier, in a March 27, 2012 item, FactCheck had addressed an ""e-rumor"" containing a similar statement.

""It is simply false to claim that Obama is ‘giving away’ islands to which no U.S. president has asserted a claim for more than 85 years, if ever,"" wrote FactCheck, which is a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.

The text version of the rumor that FactCheck examined gives several specifics that also appear in Riddle’s post. Among them: The seven islands and their many miles of ""rich oil seabeds"" were ""given away,"" the text says, in secret negotiations from which Alaska was excluded. But Obama or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could stop the process with a pen stroke, it says.

FactCheck’s findings: Although after a U.S. Navy survey in 1881, the U.S. Geological Survey listed five of the islands as being in the ""District of Alaska,"" the United States has never claimed them or disputed the Soviet or Russian claim to them.

""All lie on the Russian side of the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary set by a treaty that the U.S. Senate ratified overwhelmingly more than two decades ago, after being signed by President George H.W. Bush, and with the support of both of Alaska’s senators,"" FactCheck wrote, going on to explain that the treaty was made with the Soviet Union before its 1991 collapse and never ratified by Russia, but that Russia informed the U.S. it intended to abide by the terms.

Though this is an old issue, FactCheck said, it resurfaced in a Feb. 26, 2012, opinion piece by Joe Miller, a former Alaskan candidate for U.S. Senate. Miller’s piece on the conservative site World Net Daily is similar in wording and content to the ""viral"" text FactCheck examined and to Riddle’s item.

Like Riddle’s claim that the U.S. ""is giving away"" the islands, many versions of the rumor that we found online state or imply that Obama’s administration has an active role. White House spokesman Brandon Lepow told us by email that current U.S. policy in the Arctic is described in a 2009 State Department fact sheet, which says the U.S. and Russia are not discussing boundary changes. Lepow said there has been no change to the policy.

The 1990 treaty sets the modern maritime boundary at the line drawn when the U.S. bought Alaska from Russia -- or more specifically, the ""Emperor of all the Russias"" -- in 1867.    
  
  
  
By telephone, Riddle told us that he stands by his statement, but said, ""I wouldn’t be surprised if we didn’t get some bad information that we ran with. That’s possible. It’s a cautionary note for anybody."" 
Riddle said he did not know of the FactCheck.org item until we called him.

""It’s hard these days to judge the veracity of information,"" he said. ""Obviously, it’s important to do so, and before anyone develops specific policy, not only to develop positions but to check everything.""

He also pointed out that, as FactCheck noted, Russia has not ratified the 1990 treaty, and says he would favor renegotiating it.

Our ruling

Though Riddle took the item off his Facebook page, he stands by it, so we’ll ratify our colleagues’ findings and rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/27/wes-riddle/wes-riddle-says-us-giving-seven-alaskan-islands-ru/
"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Education', 'Jefferson Smith']","
Has Oregon lost out on Fortune 500 business because of lower education funding?
","
Portland Public Schools is eyeing a bond vote during the November election to help rebuild and refurbish aging school buildings. During a recent school board hearing on the issue, Portland mayoral candidates Jefferson Smith and Charlie Hales sat together and spoke out in favor of the idea.

Learning is the priority, they said, but the environment plays a big role in just how well students learn.

During his testimony, Smith sought to silence critics who might question the timing of the bond, given how depressed the economy remains. The fact is, he said, that education is inextricably tied to a healthy economy in the state.

The connection between the economy and education becomes clear, he said, ""when we understand and compare what's happened in Minnesota, when in 1980 they had 10 Fortune 500 companies and so did Oregon, and now they have 19 and we have two.

""And the biggest difference has not been tax rates -- they've been paying more taxes -- one of the most obvious differences is they've invested in their schools.""

Several studies have shown Smith’s larger point to be true: Education and economics are linked. But, we wondered, was his example comparing Oregon to Minnesota apt? We checked it out.

We started with the number of Fortune 500 companies. Those are easy to get; Fortune Magazine keeps an online list of them. Smith was right as far as the current numbers go. Oregon is home to two of the 500 companies -- Nike and Precision Castparts -- while Minnesota is home to 19. As for how things looked 30 years ago, Smith is off. Thirty years ago, Oregon was home to six Fortune 500 companies while Minnesota had 11.

Next up, we looked at state tax burdens. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research organization has numbers as recent as 2009 on its website. According to the foundation, Oregon’s tax burden is 9.8 percent of income which puts it at No. 17 nationally -- with No. 1 having the highest burden. Minnesota meanwhile has a burden of 10.3 percent, putting it at No. 7.

(When we contacted the Smith campaign, manager Henry Kraemer also pointed to the Foundation’s Business Tax Climate Index, which was updated this year. According to that index Minnesota is one of the worst places to do business and comes in at No. 45, while Oregon ranked far higher at No. 13.)

The last bit was education funding. For that, we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau. According to figures from the 2009-10 school year -- the most recent available -- Oregon spent about $9,600 per student, while Minnesota spent $10,700. Now, that $1,000 or so might not seem like a lot, especially given that New York State spends nearly $19,000 per student, but it’s enough to put Minnesota just over the national average while Oregon comes in just below.

Except for the discrepancy on the number of 500 companies in both states 30 years ago, Smith seemed to be right, as far as the facts go. A question lingered, however: Was Smith right to link the education being provided in Minnesota to its more robust business climate?

John Gallup, an assistant professor of economics at Portland State University, said that the link ""does have a good basis in terms of research … companies can't get their employees to move unless there are good school districts.""

He forwarded us an email from his colleague, James Wood, another assistant professor of economics, who cited one study from Paul D. Gottlieb called ""Residential Amenities, Firm Location and Economic Development"" done back in 1995 that shows ""positive influence of teachers and expenditures per pupil on firm location.""

We also tried Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economist. He agreed that education is a potential draw for companies as they seek to hire employees of a high caliber. That said, he wasn’t so sold on the idea that Fortune 500 companies might pick Minnesota over Oregon for the schools, however good they may be.

""I'd be willing to bet that most of that location is an accident of history,"" Duy said.

When we spoke to Smith, he said he didn’t disagree with that but added ""the importance of education is not merely to attract businesses ... but also to grow them and to help them adapt to a changing environment.

""If we meaningfully invested in education now, it would pay dividends.""

There are a number of points to consider when ruling on this one.

Smith was right on a couple things: Oregon has two Fortune 500 companies, while Minnesota has 19. Meanwhile, Oregon’s tax climate is friendlier to businesses and Minnesota spends more per student. He was off on the figures from 1980, however.

As for the connection between education and the number of 500 companies in a given state, that’s a little dicier. Certainly, there’s evidence that businesses consider education when locating, but would an extra $1,000 a year for the next couple decades mean we’d catch up with Minnesota? Probably not. Oregon used to be above the national average in per-student funding and we still didn’t rank high in the number of Fortune 500 companies. There are dozens of factors for a business to consider.

That said, Smith’s central point here is accurate -- better education is important to business -- and most of his numbers stand up. But we think it’s important to understand that improving education, while important, won’t necessarily lead to dozens of Fortune 500 companies locating in Oregon.

Jeff Wentworth says Donna Campbell pushing 35 percent expanded sales tax
","
State Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio says his opponent in a July 31, 2012, Republican primary runoff has a hankering to hike taxes.

A Wentworth campaign mailer tells residents of the Austin-to-San Antonio Senate district: ""Don’t be tricked: Donna Campbell,"" his New Braunfels runoff opponent, ""is pushing a 35% national-state-local sales tax on medicine, healthcare, groceries, water and real estate!"" Another Wentworth mailer presents her as saying: ""Texas needs a 35% sales tax on groceries, medicine, healthcare, water and ALL purchases."" And a July 18, 2012, news article in the San Marcos Daily Record quotes Wentworth as saying: ""My opponent's call for a 35 percent sales tax in Texas on medicine, groceries, water, real estate and all purchases is absurd.""

A refresher: The existing state sales tax of 6.25 percent applies to retail sales, leases and rentals of most goods plus 17 categories of taxable services including Internet access and security services. Also, Texas cities, counties, transit authorities and special-purpose districts have the option of imposing an additional local sales tax for a combined total of state and local taxes of 8.25 percent. Many items -- including water, groceries and medicine -- are exempted from the sales tax.

So, Wentworth is saying that Campbell both wants to more than quintuple the state sales tax rate and start applying the tax to some essential items.

One hitch for us in starting this fact-check was the absence of any public sign that Campbell has been campaigning for a 35 percent state-federal-local sales tax. Any such proposal goes unmentioned on her campaign website, where she says she will work to decrease taxation.

Asked how Wentworth unearthed his opponent’s double-digit tax-hike push, Wentworth’s consultant, Bryan Eppstein, pointed out that while Campbell was running for the U.S. House in 2010, Austin’s KVUE-TV quoted her as advocating the replacement of federal income taxes with a 23 percent federal sales tax on consumer goods and services, a position then pointed out by her Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett.

An online version of the Oct. 29, 2010, KVUE news story quotes Campbell as saying: ""Income tax, payroll tax, you wouldn’t pay any of that"" under the approach. ""If it’s a retail tax, and you buy something new you’d pay 23 percent,"" she said.

Eppstein further pointed out that an official with the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, Talmadge Heflin, testified afresh in May 2012 in favor of the state wiping out property taxes and making up the lost revenue with changes in the sales tax. He said that based on Heflin’s testimony, Wentworth concluded that Campbell favors a state sales tax rate of 12 percent.

Heflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, hearkened in his testimony to an April 2009 foundation report stating that revenue generated by property taxes could be replaced by money raised from the sales tax by setting the rate at 12.5 percent if the existing tax is extended to property sales or, he said, 9 percent if the tax is extended to property sales as well as all services that are taxed in at least one other state. The report says that if the sales tax is not expanded to additional items or services, its rate would need to be around 14.5 percent to raise revenues lost by eliminating property taxes statewide.

Eppstein also noted that Campbell has the endorsement of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, a group that asked candidates seeking its support to fill out its 2012 candidate questionnaire, including questions about phasing out property taxes in return for raising sales taxes.

One question on the survey refers to ""end-user consumption taxes,"" meaning sales taxes. The questions says: ""Would you support moving Texas away from property taxes in favor of the existing sales and use tax?"" Candidates are asked to support or oppose. The question is followed by this text: ""Note: Tax swaps, phase-outs or trade-offs are not considered tax increases unless the total tax burden is increased.""

Next on the questionnaire: ""Statement: Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes."" Candidates are asked to agree or disagree.

By email, Campbell spokesman Jon Oliver said that Campbell replied on the questionnaire that she supports moving Texas away from property taxes to the existing sales tax and also agreed that Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes.

But, Oliver said, in order to have Campbell’s support, a proposal to replace property taxes with sales taxes would have to lower the overall tax burden for Texas families and businesses; be limited to taxing items currently covered by the sales tax; be phased in gradually; and win voter approval at the polls.

Earlier, Oliver said by email: ""She is intrigued by the overall idea of a consumption tax instead of a property tax if it would truly lower the tax burden, but it's not part of her platform and she certainly wouldn't support a state sales tax in the form Sen.Wentworth has claimed she would -- that is, taxing items that are currently exempt.""

Oliver noted, too, that Campbell has signed three pledges disavowing higher taxes: the Americans for Prosperity Taxpayer Pledge in favor of requiring voter or legislative supermajority approval for tax and spending increases; Gov. Rick Perry’s ""budget compact"" pledge to oppose any new taxes or tax increase; and one to taxpayers, advocated by Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, stating she ""will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.""

We circled back to Eppstein, asking for evidence of Campbell talking up a 35-percent sales tax. By telephone, Eppstein said he has heard Campbell indicate as much, but did not record it.

Our ruling

Wentworth says Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate. She’s not, though we can see the threads behind this misleading claim.

While running for Congress in 2010, Campbell  spoke out in favor of a possible 23 percent federal sales tax in return for wiping out federal income taxes. In the same spirit, she now supports replacing property tax revenue collected across Texas with income from the state sales tax. By itself, that move could drive the state sales tax rate to 14 percent or so. Then again, the conditions her campaign lays out could be taken as signals she’s not ready to embrace any sudden surge or broadening of the tax.

Campbell’s two stances, taken years apart in campaigns for different offices, reflect on sales taxes at different levels of government.This claim distorts both positions by effectively combining the possible tax rates. All told, too, it’s ridiculous to assert that Campbell, who has signed no-new-tax pledges, is pushing or calling for an expanded sales tax set at 35 percent.

Ad says Mitt Romney had Olympic uniforms made in Burma
","
With the Olympics about to begin, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC aligned with President Barack Obama, released an ad that used Olympic images to attack Mitt Romney. 
The ad shows a beaming Romney at the Olympic opening ceremonies. As each national team enters the stadium, an announcer provides a corresponding quip. ""China, home to a billion people. Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney’s companies ... And Burma, where Romney had the uniforms made for the 2002 games.""

Olympic authorities moved swiftly to get Priorities USA Action to withdraw the ad because of unauthorized use of Olympic footage, but the ad got such widespread coverage that we are still fact-checking it.

PolitiFact has assessed that claim about jobs in China and and another one about Romney creating jobs in India. Both were rated Half True. In this fact-check, we look at whether Romney had the uniforms for the 2002 winter games made in Burma.

The Torch Bearer Uniforms

Burma, or Myanmar, is a country that until just recently was shunned for being a repressive regime that observed no fair labor practices.

Olympic games use many different uniforms -- for staffers, athletes and so forth and not all were made in Burma. But there is no question about the origins of the uniforms for the torch bearers. These were the 11,500 volunteers who relayed the Olympic torch some 13,000 miles to Salt Lake City. That’s a lot of jackets with the Salt Lake Olympic logo.

The Huffington Post reported this a couple of weeks ago, but the story received coverage in 2002. The day before the winter games opened, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sent a letter of protest to the International Olympic Committee.

""No responsible organization or body should make use of products originating in Burma,"" the letter said. ""Doing business with Burma, in effect, supports human rights abuses.""

The next day, according to an article in the Ottawa Citizen, the company that provided those uniforms, Marker Ltd, confirmed that the uniforms had come from a supplier in Burma. The article quotes Marker’s Olympic program managing director, Ralph Eeson saying the company is ""sensitive to to human rights issues and has no reason to believe the uniforms were made under conditions that violate international law.""

Marker, a Salt Lake City-based sports apparel company, was a co-sponsor of the games. In May of 1999 it had agreed to provide about $20 million worth of clothing. The company was the first new sponsor for the games in about a year because of turmoil over allegations of bribery. The timing of Marker’s sponsorship might be significant. Mitt Romney had just left Bain Capital in February 1999 to takeover the floundering Salt Lake Olympic Committee. Three months after he arrived, Marker signed on.

Burma’s Reputation

By 2000, Burma was a pariah. In 1997, the United States barred new investments in Burma by American corporations. The military dictatorship had been sanctioned by many international bodies for using forced labor on large irrigation construction projects and violating child labor standards.

""It was well-known that it was a hell hole,"" said Scott Nova with the Worker Rights Consortium, an agency that helps colleges and universities avoid buying from factories that abuse their workers. Nova’s group traces the roots of all those sweatshirts, T-shirts and hats that carry the college name.

The Worker Rights Consortium tracks more than 1,000 companies and each of the dozens of separate items they supply. ""On that entire list,"" Nova said, ""virtually nothing came from Burma in 2000. Maybe three items out of thousands. Every responsible manufacturer was long gone from the country.""

That may have been true for the companies Nova’s group watched, but many American firms continued to buy from Burma. A consortium of 15 European labor and human rights groups, the Clean Clothes Campaign, reported in 2000 that U.S. clothing imports from the country nearly tripled between 1995 and 1999. Companies cited in that report included Jordache, Nautica and Adidas. In 2001, a declassified State Department memo later corroborated that report. Marker was not alone in buying from contractors in Burma.

The Winter Olympics Budget

The ad suggests that Romney played a direct role in ordering the uniforms from Burma, but the only source provided by Priorities USA Action was the Huffington Post article which did not make that direct connection.

In assessing his possible role, it's important to note it was a large organization. The SLOC had about 2,000 paid staff. The total budget for the Salt Lake Games was about $1.3 billion. There were about 10 other sponsors like Marker, plus about another 15 firms with marketing contracts. The list included companies such as Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and Gateway Computers. Marker’s sponsorship represented less than 1 percent of the total budget.

We have asked the US Olympic Committee if the SLOC used any procurement guidelines and did not hear back. A recent Salt Lake Tribune article about the SLOC archives suggests that detailed information might no longer exist. Many internal memos were destroyed after the games ended.

Our Ruling

The ad from Priorities USA Action says Romney had the Olympic uniforms made in Burma.

The torch bearer uniforms, perhaps more than 11,000 of them, were made in Burma, but that’s not all the uniforms used in the games, particularly for the athletes, as the visuals in the ad suggest. And we've seen insufficient evidence to directly link the torch bearer uniforms to Romney.
