Wisconsin state Rep. Peter Barca says the Assembly voted to take funding away from public school districts and give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools
","
Although notable for cutting billions of dollars in spending and deficits, the new Wisconsin state budget also expands the nation’s largest and longest-running school choice program, which uses tax money to send nearly 21,000 lower-income Milwaukee children to private schools. 

The 2011-2013 budget, crafted by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature, cuts aid to public schools by nearly $800 million.

But it includes nearly $12 million to pay for 3,000 more Milwaukee students the administration estimates will join the choice program over the two-year period.

The expansion is one reason a Wall Street Journal editorial proclaimed 2011 ""the year of school choice"" in the United States.

Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, contends the expansion of choice, also known as the school voucher program, comes at the expense of public school districts throughout Wisconsin.

Commenting in an article published June 26, 2011, the day Walker signed the budget into law, Barca focused his criticism on Republican members of the Assembly who were elected in November 2010.

GOP freshmen who backed the budget, he claimed, ""voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee choice schools.""

Barca, a former congressman who has served 10 years as a state lawmaker during two stints in the Assembly, made a similar claim the next day in a blog, and previously in a news release and in a letter to Walker.

So, does spending more on the choice program take away money from public school districts throughout Wisconsin?

First, some background.

Size: The choice program, launched in the 1990-1991 school year, was created to allow low-income students in Milwaukee to attend private schools in Milwaukee at taxpayer expense. In 2010-2011, the nearly 21,000 choice students attended more than 100 private schools-- 84 percent of them religious -- according to the Public Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research organization in Milwaukee.

The new state budget expands choice in three ways: Income limits were raised, making more families eligible; a cap on the number of choice students (22,500) was eliminated; and choice students can now attend private schools outside the City of Milwaukee. (Although Barca’s claim doesn’t address it, the budget also extends the choice program to students in Racine.)

Cost: Private Milwaukee schools receive $6,442 in state aid for each choice student. That compares with $10,292 received in 2010-2011 by Milwaukee Public Schools, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

As we’ll see, the difference between the two per-pupil aid figures is key in the debate about the choice program’s effect on taxpayers.

Financing: The $6,442 per student in tax money spent on choice in 2010-2011 came to nearly $131 million. The state pays roughly 62 percent and recoups the other 38 percent by reducing aid to Milwaukee Public Schools, according to the fiscal bureau.

So, it’s clear the choice program takes money away from MPS; but whether choice is a net cost or a net gain for other public school districts is more complicated.

When asked for evidence about the claim the expansion takes money away from districts outside of Milwaukee, Barca aides made three major points:

The nearly $800 million in aid cuts affect only public schools.

Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin said the state budget changes choice funding such that choice schools ""are held harmless"" and the aid reduction ""is all taken from public districts across the state.""

But it doesn’t necessarily follow that the choice expansion was funded by cutting aid to public schools.

Indeed, when choice was created, the state appropriated additional money for the program -- it didn’t take money from other public school districts, said Anneliese Dickman, research director of the Public Policy Forum.

And when the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction detailed the nearly $800 million in what it called ""catastrophic"" cuts to public schools in the budget, it noted that only Milwaukee Public Schools -- no other public school districts -- lost money as a result of choice funding.

GOP lawmakers rejected a move to block choice expansion.

Conklin said all Republican lawmakers voted against a Democratic ""save our schools"" amendment to Walker’s budget that would have blocked the choice expansion.

That point underscores how the new GOP lawmakers supported the expansion of choice. But it doesn’t get at the key question of whether the budget moves money from public school districts outside of Milwaukee to private schools in Milwaukee.  

The choice expansion means less money for all public schools.

On this point, there is more debate.

Conklin cited a Legislative Fiscal Bureau report that estimates the expansion will cost the state nearly $12 million. The total cost to pay for the 3,000 new students is actually $19 million, but the state would recoup 38 percent of that amount by providing about $7 million less in aid to Milwaukee Public Schools. The remaining 62 percent is the $12 million.

Conklin argues that’s a $12 million cost to public school districts outside of Milwaukee. But the evidence doesn’t support her: 
Indeed, there is evidence the choice program saves money for other taxpayers around the state -- an assertion state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers calls debatable and another education researcher has criticized.

The savings is based on the fact that choice schools get roughly $4,000 less per pupil in school aids than MPS does: 
Costrell did new calculations for PolitiFact Wisconsin based on the 3,000 new students expected to enter the choice program in the next two years.

If 90 percent of the new choice students instead attended MPS -- a figure Costrell said is used in other choice studies -- the higher MPS per-pupil cost would cost property taxpayers outside of MPS nearly $9 million more over two years and taxpayers statewide nearly $7 million in state taxes.

But that’s based on the 90 percent assumption.

What if many of the students who will be in the program didn’t come from MPS at all and instead are already in the private schools, but don’t currently qualify for choice based on income or other factors? They could stay at their school and now have tuition paid.

Choice has been expanded twice before -- in 1998, when choice students were allowed to attend religious schools, and again in 2006, when the maximum number of students allowed in the program was raised. In the first year after both expansions, the Public Policy Forum found, roughly 40 percent of new choice students came from MPS schools and roughly 60 percent from private schools.

Dickman said she expects a similar trend under the new choice expansion, as does Evers, the state superintendent.

(One note: Walker’s budget proposal would have prohibited students who attended Milwaukee private schools in 2010-2011 from becoming choice students in 2011-2012. But that provision was removed by the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, said Mike Ford, research associate for School Choice Wisconsin, which advocates for the choice program.)

Costrell did another estimate, based on if only 40 percent of the 3,000 new students come from MPS.

That would require $3.5 million more in state aid, but property taxpayers outside of MPS -- the taxpayers Barca referred to in his statement -- would still save nearly $3.9 million over two years, according to Costrell.

The bottom line here is we won’t know until some time in the future how many new choice students will come from MPS or already be in a private school. But if this choice expansion plays out like the previous two, taxpayers outside of MPS would still save money as a result of the choice program, based on Costrell’s estimates.

So, where does that leave us?

Barca said that by supporting the 2011-2013 state budget, freshmen Republican Assembly members ""voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools.""

On a broad level, that is not true: the budget appropriates money separately for choice. To cover part of the cost, it reduces state aid to Milwaukee Public Schools, but not to other school districts.

It is possible that if large numbers of the new choice students come from private schools rather than Milwaukee Public Schools, there could be a net loss to taxpayers outside of MPS. But research indicates that if past experience holds and 60 percent of the new choice students come from private schools, property taxpayers outside of MPS would still save money.

To be sure, the full effect of the school choice expansion won’t be known for some time. But Barca didn’t state that depending on how the expansion plays out, it might cost other school districts -- he claimed that the expansion actually takes away money from those districts. There is no evidence of that.  

We rate Barca’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971B64C0>],/factchecks/2011/jul/13/peter-barca/wisconsin-state-rep-peter-barca-says-assembly-vote/

R.I. Rep. Trillo says 30,000 people have died because they used seat belts
","During the June 29, 2011, Rhode Island House debate over legislation to allow the police to stop motorists who are not wearing seat belts -- a bill that has now become law -- supporters said it would encourage more people to belt themselves in. Critics countered that the proposal was one more attempt to chip away at our personal freedoms and could encourage racial profiling.

Few will disagree that seat belts save lives. But this was one instance where House Minority Whip Joseph Trillo, who said he regularly uses his seat belt, couldn't restrain himself.

""There are 30,000 people that have been killed with seat belts, where they've gotten into accidents, the cars were on fire, they've been knocked out, they haven't been able to get out of the vehicle,"" he said. ""My point is, even if the majority of people are saved, why do we keep forcing people to do things that they feel it's their own individual right to make a decision?""

When we saw him make that comment on Capitol TV, we were intrigued. Thirty thousand people have lost their lives because they wore their seat belts?

We were driven to call him that evening to ask him for the source of that statistic. A few emails and another phone call later, he reported that he couldn't find the source.

""I know that I got it in an email. It brought me to a credible site. I don't remember what it was though,"" he said. ""I'm not sure whether it's cumulative or on a yearly basis.""

Undaunted, he cited a page on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- which we checked -- saying that in 2002, 2004 and 2006, the number of people who died while wearing a seat belt was 12,000, 13,000 and 12,500, respectively.

When we pointed out that being killed while wearing a seat belt doesn't mean they would have survived if they had been unbelted, Trillo argued that ""if 12,000 to 13,000 are dying with seat belts every year on a national level, even if 2,000 couldn't get out of the car, it still could cumulatively add up to 30,000.""

We tried to find the source of Trillo's statement. A Google search came up blank. But we did find a website that talked about ""23,000 people who run the risk of being trapped and fatally killed by a seat belt each year!"" It also warned against seat belt use because ""psychiatrists say that exposing young children to practices such as bondage from an early age can cause confusion during puberty."" Needless to say, it was a humor website.

So we decided to go the extra mile to look for some real data.

Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Consumer Product Safety Commission sent us to the NHTSA.

Its most recent estimate is that 12,713 lives were saved in 2009 by people wearing seat belts, and another 3,688 fatalities would have been prevented if every driver had used one. (In Rhode Island, 11 lives were saved because of seat belt use and 10 died because they were not belted in, according to that report.)

When we asked them for the number of deaths in which the use of seat belts was a contributing factor, they came up empty.

NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database of motor vehicle fatalities logs lots of causes of death, listed as ""most harmful event."" Wearing a seat belt isn't one of them.

After Trillo's comment about being trapped in a burning car, we searched the database and found there were 157 fire- or explosion-related fatalities in passenger vehicles in 2009 where the victims were using their seat belts. If you add people who died by immersion in water, the number jumps to 243.

Even if seat belts trapped the occupants in every case, that would represent less than one percent of fatalities and it would take 123 years (at the 2009 rate) to match Trillo's 30,000 figure. (Lap belts have only been mandatory in U.S. cars since the 1960s.)

We even put out a message to the 32,000 people who follow PolitiFact National on Twitter, asking people to email us if anyone had any reliable information on the question. One response led us to Sgt. William Mahoney, an accident scene investigator for about seven years with the Kansas City, Mo., Police Department, which handles about 65 to 75 traffic fatalities per year.

""I've never seen a death that's been classified as having been caused by a seat belt,"" he said. ""I'm not saying they don't exist. I've never seen one.""

When we asked Lt. Col. Raymond White of the Rhode Island State Police if, in his 28 years in law enforcement, he has ever seen an instance where someone probably would have survived a crash if they hadn't been wearing their seat belt, he said, ""That's never been the case.""

And William Hall, who manages the occupant protection program at the University of North Carolina's Highway Safety Center, said that in the 30 years he's been with the center he hasn't seen any estimate comparable to Trillo's.

""I have no clue as to where he may have gotten it,"" he said, noting that it's ""quite likely"" that, if the number was real, he would be aware of it.

Hall said that ""less than one half of one percent of all crashes involve a post-crash fire or going in the water. So that's a very low probability event. There are probably some extremely rare, rare circumstances where someone might have not been killed if they had been unbelted, but that's very, very hard to substantiate. It could mean it's just a non-survival crash and you're not going to make it, seat belt or no seat belt.""

In summary, when Trillo asserted that 30,000 people ""have been killed with seat belts,"" the context of his statement made it clear that he was saying that seat belts contributed to their deaths, not simply that 30,000 people who died happened to be wearing seat belts.

When we asked him for the source of his information, he couldn't produce it. ""When we're doing all those bills, I'm trying to assimilate a lot of information. I'm not taking notes on it. I'm just reading stuff,"" said Trillo.

In fact, when we suggested it might be wise to take note of his sources in case someone -- like PolitiFact, for example -- wanted to know where his facts came from, his response was, ""I could care less.""

But we care because, if seat belts are really that dangerous, we want to know. And if a politician is exercising his right to be fooled by an email, we want to know that as well.

With more than 30,000 fatal traffic accidents in the United States each year, we suspect there must be at least a few in which victims might have survived had they not been wearing a seat belt.

But a search of Google, a question to the 32,000 readers who get our Twitter feed and queries to three federal agencies, two law enforcement agencies and others with an interest in tracking the dangers of seat belts produced no evidence that 30,000 people have died from wearing seat belts. Ever.

Trillo's statement deserves to be strapped in for a one-way ride to Ridiculousville.

We award his inflammatory claim a Pants On Fire!

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Ralph Long']","
Georgia pol says Atlanta school board had no oversight power
","
An alarming state report released last week blamed teachers, administrators and former Superintendent Beverly Hall for a widespread test-tampering scandal in the Atlanta Public Schools system.

The report attracted national headlines and punchlines from some prominent comedians.

To our surprise, Ralph Long, a state representative from southwest Atlanta, added another group to the culpability list: the Georgia General Assembly, the body Long currently serves.

""The General Assembly took away the Atlanta Board of Education’s oversight of the superintendent,"" Long, a Democrat, said at a news conference.

Long was referring to Senate Bill 204, which passed in 2003, six years before he joined the General Assembly. The bill gave the superintendent the power to hire the school district’s general counsel and chief financial officer. It also imposed ethics guidelines for school administrators and the board. The bill’s chief sponsor: then-Sen. Kasim Reed, who is now Atlanta’s mayor.

Long has been critical of Reed’s role in the ongoing school district crisis. Long has accused the mayor, who by law has no oversight of Atlanta schools, of solely serving the interests of the city’s business community and the influential Metro Atlanta Chamber. Long was one of the few public officials to side with Reed’s opponent, Mary Norwood, in the 2009 Atlanta mayoral runoff election, which Reed won by less than 1 percentage point.

Reed defended the bill Monday in an interview with Channel 2 Action News. The mayor said it was an effort to streamline operations at a time some community leaders complained the district couldn’t keep a superintendent because of board micromanagement. Reed also took a verbal jab at Long.

""He’s looking for 15 minutes of fame out of the awful crisis that’s impacting our children,"" Reed said.

Long defended his point to PolitiFact Georgia, saying the legislation left the board essentially toothless. Stacking the deck, were the words Long used to describe the overwhelming influence that Hall was given over APS.

Long said he’s considering a bill that would revive the board’s authority to hire a general counsel and CFO.

""The board didn’t have any power,"" said Long.

We wondered if Long’s comments about the bill added up.

The state report outlines in exhaustive detail a ""culture of fear"" inside APS for teachers and administrators to produce higher student scores on statewide tests. Hall was named national superintendent of the year by one influential education group for Atlanta’s markedly improved test scores and higher graduation rates. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned irregularities in some scores as far back as 2001, and ramped up its investigative reporting into the matter over the past two years. The state report concluded 178 educators, including three dozen principals, participated in systematic cheating on state curriculum tests. Nearly half of them confessed to wrongdoing.

Senate Bill 204 supporters said the legislation was necessary to insulate the superintendent from micromanaging by the board. Atlanta board member Emmett Johnson, who is still on the nine-member board, made that argument to the AJC in 2003, noting that the city school district had five superintendents in 10 years. The board had overseen the chief financial officer and general counsel positions since the 1970s, as part of the so-called ""Atlanta compromise"" that brought the city its first black superintendent. Critics worried at the time that board ceded too much of its authority.

The bill still gave the board power to fire the superintendent. It also gave the board and the superintendent the dual authority to adopt districtwide academic standards. Additionally, they had the power to track progress toward ""student learning goals and the academic content and performance standards.""

Doesn’t this prove the school board had oversight power? No way, said Long.

Long maintained that some board members felt they couldn’t stand up to Hall, who was being supported by Atlanta’s business community, which typically bankrolled winning school board candidates through a political action committee called EduPAC.

""That’s a lot of intimidation, and people who don’t recognize that are naive,"" said Long, who called on Hall to resign in August.

Reed said the bill strengthened Hall’s power, but argued the board’s oversight ""remained exactly what it was."" He said many districts considered it a ""best practice"" to have the general counsel and CFO report to the superintendent.

We talked about this with Warren Fortson, who served as the general counsel to APS for 22 years, until he retired in the early 1990s. Fortson said he argued against SB 204 because ""it builds a wall between the board and the administration."" Still, he said, the APS board had oversight. Fortson said Long’s claim was too broad.

""They have oversight of the superintendent,"" Fortson said of the APS board. ""A board has the authority to call in the superintendent for almost anything.""

SB 204 gave more authority to the superintendent. However, it still gave the board the oversight authority over the superintendent. The board also had consent power over hiring and firing a CFO (Sec. 4-101) or general counsel (Sec. 2-111).

Long said state lawmakers ""took away"" the Atlanta school board’s oversight of the school superintendent. It did not. But it did somewhat diminish the board’s power.

Long’s statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that we believe would give people a different impression.

We rate his claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973BFF40>],/factchecks/2011/jul/13/ralph-long/georgia-pol-says-atlanta-school-board-had-no-overs/

Republican National Committee's ad says there are 2 million fewer jobs since Obama took office
","
The Republican National Committee unveiled a commercial July 7 critical of President Barack Obama’s economic policies.

The commercial, which will run in battleground states like Ohio the next several weeks,  illustrates the unemployment rate, tax issues, the national debt and the new health-care law with images of disaster: a fiery car crash, a train wreck, and an out-of-control roller coaster, among other things.

""Don’t let Obama drive us to disaster. Change direction,"" the announcer says as speeding car plunges into water.

The commercial also includes a half-dozen figures the RNC believes underscore its message that the $800 billion for the stimulus, trillions for government health care, 2 million jobs gone, 6 million foreclosures, 14 trillion in debt, $500 billion in higher taxes are killing the economy.

PolitiFact has examined many of these figures before. Jobs numbers, however, are among the most common statistics used in claims and have proven to be a potent issue in campaigns, including Ohio’s 2010 gubernatorial race. So, let’s look at how the RNC is using the 2 million job figure.

Specifically, the RNC commercial says, ""2 million jobs. Gone.""

To get started on any job figure, PolitiFact turns to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official score keeper of U.S. employment numbers.

When Obama took office in January 2009, 133.5 million Americans were working in non-farm jobs, according to the BLS. On the day the RNC ad was released, the latest job figures available were from May 2011 and totaled 131 million. That produces a net loss of 2.5 million. (June preliminary numbers have since been released and show the economy added 18,000 jobs that month.)

Case closed? Not yet.

Before we make final arguments, important caveats about job statistics are worth repeating.

As PolitiFact has frequently noted, slicing and timing make all the difference when framing job figures. If, for instance, PolitiFact, plugs into the RNC equation job figures from February 2009 – Obama’s first full month in office, when the U.S. had 132.8 million jobs – the total job losses through May 2011 equal 1.8 million. That’s a bit below the RNC’s claim in the commercial.

Democrats could easily produce a more favorable job picture by comparing the June 2011 figures to June 2010 figures. This comparison shows the country has added just over 1 million jobs in the last 12 months. Vice President Joe Biden made a similar claim that PolitiFact Ohio checked in April and rated Mostly True.
.
As always, context is the most important and is buried in the monthly figures. Job losses were worse in the early part of the Obama administration. Since then the country has been slowly climbing out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, one that began before Obama took office.

So where does this leave the RNC’s claim?

The RNC figure -- 2 million jobs gone -- actually underplays the number of jobs lost since  Obama took office.

But it also ignores the trend line which has bobbed up and down but is headed upward, albeit slowly. That there are 1 million more jobs now than a year ago is an additional piece of information that provides clarification.

Whether the administration is doing enough toward recovery is a policy debate we leave to others.

But on the Truth-O-Meter, a statement like this one that is accurate but needs some clarification rates Mostly True.

President Barack Obama says public sector job losses increasing as stimulus dwindles
","
President Barack Obama is negotiating with Republicans in Congress to increase the debt ceiling. Part of the deal could involve major cuts to government spending. 

At a press conference on Monday, Obama was asked whether cutting government spending was a good idea right now, given the high unemployment rate. 

""Our biggest priority as an administration is getting the economy back on track and putting people back to work. Now, without relitigating the past, I'm absolutely convinced, and the vast majority of economists are convinced, that the steps we took in the Recovery Act saved millions of people their jobs or created a whole bunch of jobs,"" Obama said.

""And part of the evidence of that is as you see what happens with the Recovery Act phasing out,"" he continued. ""When I came into office and budgets were hemorrhaging at the state level, part of the Recovery Act was giving states help so they wouldn't have to lay off teachers, police officers, firefighters. As we've seen that federal support for states diminish, you've seen the biggest job losses in the public sector -- teachers, police officers, firefighters losing their jobs.""

We were interested in fact-checking that last statement, that public-sector job losses have increased as the stimulus money has receded. Was there data to back up Obama's point? We decided to fact-check his statement, and what we found was more complicated than we expected.

First, we'll address the timing of the stimulus spending in the states, and then we'll turn to public-sector job losses.

To refresh your memory on stimulus spending: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act became law in 2009. It included $787 billion in tax cuts and spending designed to pump money into the economy and reverse the recession. The goal was to get the money out the door as soon as possible, and much of it was spent in 2009 and 2010. By the middle of 2011, the government reported that it had paid out 90 percent of the tax benefits; 78 percent of the contracts, grants and loans; and 83 percent of entitlement spending, such as money for Medicaid, unemployment benefits and food stamps. 

States received money for all sorts of projects and purposes, and the timetables were all different. For example: States got extra money to pay for Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor and disabled. This money ran out on June 30, 2011. States also got money for education, to keep school teachers on the job. The states were encouraged to spend that money as soon as possible, but they didn't have to. So every state had its own timetable for using these funds, according to Michael Leachman, an expert on state finances with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 

Next, we'll turn to public-sector job losses. Obama mentioned ""teachers, police officers, firefighters losing their jobs,"" and the logical inference is that these people were laid off due to budget constraints. Again, we were not able to find compiled data of jobs lost to state budget cuts. However, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps data on the size of the government workforce at the state and local levels. We ran the data using the department's database and found that both the state and local workforce numbers have been generally declining since the beginning of this year. 

We looked at both state and local workforce numbers because jobs like school teachers, police officers and firefighters would typically be included in the numbers of the local workforce. Teachers at the public universities, on the other hand, would be counted as part of the state workforce. Most states also have state police forces, such as the Florida Highway Patrol and the Texas Rangers.

To review some of the specifics of those numbers: Nationwide, the state workforce started 2010 with 5.140 million workers. For the rest of the year, the numbers jumped around, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing. By January 2011, the state workforce was down to 5.136 million workers. Since then, the numbers have declined every month, though May and June were preliminary numbers.

The local workforce, meanwhile, started 2010 with 14.482 million workers. It saw steady declines with the exemption of one month through the rest of 2010. By January 2011, the local workforce was down to 14.240 million workers. Since then, the numbers have also declined every month, with May and June preliminary. 
To sum up, we can say very generally that the stimulus was ending, and also the state and local workforces were in decline. 

We noted in a recent item on government employment that since the recession officially ended in June 2009, private payrolls have increased by more than 1 million workers, but government payrolls have declined by 493,000 -- cutting the number of jobs created almost in half. We also noted that the decline came from loss of employment at the state and local level, since federal employment had increased slightly.

Leachman, the state finance expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said there was little doubt that there's a connection between the end of the stimulus and public-sector layoffs. 

""The recession has just been a historic one for state and local governments. It’s very badly damaged their revenues, and they're still in a deep hole from the recession,"" he said, adding, ""It's clear that job losses are going to continue in the next year and beyond.""

Obama pointed to those job losses as evidence that the stimulus helped the economy. Now that the stimulus is going away, things are getting worse.

The conservative fiscal experts we spoke with were not impressed with Obama's claim, though they did not dispute it. The problem is that the stimulus didn't revive the economy, said J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""The point of the stimulus was to get the private sector going well enough to carry the job-creating load. It failed,"" he said via e-mail.

We're not going to assess here whether the stimulus ""worked,"" however. And as we've noted in previous reports, independent sources have concluded that the stimulus saved or created anywhere between 1.3 million and 2.6 million jobs. But the economic downturn has been particularly pernicious, so we think it's still too early to say whether the stimulus worked or not, and to what extent. We should note that here, Obama is in the odd position of pointing to increasing job losses as evidence that the stimulus worked. 

Here, we're checking Obama's statement, ""As we've seen that federal support for states diminish, you've seen the biggest job losses in the public sector -- teachers, police officers, firefighters losing their jobs."" The data tends to support that, but it's more of a correlation than a causation. Other factors, including continuing weakness in the economy and shrinking state and local revenue are at work as well. We rate Obama's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C493B00>],/factchecks/2011/jul/12/barack-obama/obama-says-public-sector-job-losses-increasing-sti/

Hasner claimed he co-sponsored ""only"" E-Verify bill to pass the Florida Legislature
","
In the first debate among Republicans running for the U.S. Senate in Florida, former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner used a question about illegal immigration to highlight his legislative record while taking a not-so-subtle swipe at the record of current state Senate President Mike Haridopolos. 
The topic: E-Verify, a federal employment background check system. 
The Legislature failed to pass immigration reform during the 2011 session despite solid Republican majorities. And the Senate -- under Haridopolos' leadership -- voted down an amendment to an immigration bill that would have fined employers who hire illegal workers. (The amendment and the attached fines were crafted so that employers would choose to use the system rather than face a penalty.) 
That gave Hasner an opening during a June 30, 2011, debate hosted by the Florida Society of News Editors. 
""E-Verify is a very commonsense reform that we can implement here in the state of Florida,"" Hasner said. ""I think I share a lot of Floridians' frustration that it didn't pass and a lot of the politics that were taking place behind the scenes. ... What's most important is to look back. ... some do, and some talk. I sponsored and was the co-sponsor of the only legislation that ever passed that had E-Verify provisions in it back in 2010 when I served in the Legislature. So I know that there's a will to pass these types of commonsense measures."" 
For this fact-check, we're checking if Hasner is right to say he co-sponsored ""the only legislation that ever passed that had E-Verify provisions."" 
First, some background about the program.

E-Verify is a federal database system that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to federal Department of Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers who use the program can weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the workers eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility.

E-Verify grew out of a pilot program by the federal government and got its name in 2007 -- the same year that federal agencies were required to start using E-Verify. As of 2011, more than 270,000 employers use E-Verify. 

E-Verify in the Legislature

During the 2010 legislative session, state Rep. Sandy Adams, an Oviedo Republican now in Congress, filed House Bill 219. The bill would have required state government contractors to participate in a program operated by the Department of Homeland Security that provides electronic verification of work authorization issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The staff analysis of the bill discusses Employment Eligibility Verification (EEV) -- that program was renamed E-Verify in 2007. The text of the bill itself use the term ""E-Verify,"" but we sent the description of the federal work authorization program cited in the bill to Bill Wright, a spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, and he said that the bill described E-Verify.

Hasner was one of about 20 co-sponsors and voted in favor. It passed the House unanimously but never received a vote in the Senate and died. Floridians for Immigration Enforcement gave kudos to Hasner for his efforts to pass HB 219. 
The issue of E-Verify remained in the spotlight. During the 2010 campaign for governor, Rick Scott promised to require all Florida employers to use E-Verify. Scott issued an executive order his first day in office requiring state workers to be checked through the system, though most agencies already used the system. (The order also extended to state contractors.) 
That spins us ahead to the 2011 legislative session. 
On the opening day, Haridopolos stood before a crowd which was chanting ""E-Verify! E-Verify!"" on the Capitol steps in Tallahassee, and said, ""I hear this word E-Verify,"" as listeners erupted in cheers. ""I'm here to verify it will be a part of our Senate bill.''  
The immigration bill, Senate Bill 2040 -- passed by the Senate 23-16 on May 4, 2011, three days before adjournment. It included a requirement that one-stop career center staff verify the employment eligibility of workers through E-Verify. Haridopolos voted in favor. It did not include, however, stronger E-Verify provisions that had been originally proposed and supported by Scott. 
The immigration bill then died in the House without coming to a vote. 
So not the bill many wanted. But a bill. With an E-Verify component. 
We asked Hasner adviser Rick Wilson why Hasner claimed to be the sponsor or co-sponsor of the ""only"" legislation with E-Verify in it when Senate Bill 2040 also included E-Verify.

""It's not that he was the only -- that he was the first to pass something and pass it with a governor that was hostile to it and a Senate that was hostile to it,"" Wilson said. ""In speeches it's always 'first' and not 'only.' He may have misspoken. ... We are not asserting that we are the only.""

Wilson also argued that Senate Bill 2040 was passed so late in the session that ""it was too late for the House to take it up.""

We asked spokespersons for the House and Senate (Katie Betta, spokeswoman for GOP House Speaker Dean Cannon; Michelle DeMarco, press secretary for the Senate Democrats and Mark Hollis, press secretary for the House Democrats; and Brandi Young, legislative analyst for the Senate majority office) if they could find any other bill with E-Verify provisions that passed at least one chamber in 2010 or 2011.  None could find any other bill.

E-Verify amendment

There's one other noteworthy thing we found. In a December 2009 special session, Democratic Rep. Janet Long filed an amendment to a passenger rail bill that required contractors bidding on rail projects to use E-Verify. Her amendment was withdrawn.

Hasner filed two amendments of his own -- one striking the E-Verify language. The amendments were later withdrawn. 

But why would Hasner -- a champion of E-Verify -- file an amendment to get rid of an E-Verify requirement?

Wilson told us that Hasner's amendment was a procedural move in response to Democrats -- that he had no intention to kill the implementation of E-Verify.

Long's amendment adding E-Verify, ""was a phony amendment intended to undermine anti-labor union amendments filed by Adam,"" Wilson said. ""The fact is while Mike Haridopolos broke his promise on E-Verify, Adam co-sponsored E-Verify legislation and has been a consistent supporter of it.""

Interesting part of the record, all the same.

Our ruling

Hasner said Floridians shared his frustration that E-Verify didn't pass and that he ""sponsored and was the co-sponsor of the only legislation that ever passed that had an E-Verify provision in it."" Hasner was one of 20 co-sponsors of a bill that would have required state contractors to use E-Verify -- which passed the House but not the Senate. 

But in 2011, the Senate also voted for a limited provision that had E-Verify in it. Hasner's campaign says he could have misspoken and usually says that the bill he co-sponsored was the ""first"" and not the ""only."" 

We aren't ruling here on whether Hasner is a cheerleader for E-Verify; a group in favor of cracking down on illegal immigrants has praised Hasner's efforts to try to get E-Verify passed in 2010. What we are judging is Hasner's claim that his bill was the ""only"" one that ""ever"" passed that had E-Verify in it. We rate this claim False.

Gov. Rick Scott says public pensions would have required taxes to climb
","
Gov. Rick Scott's Independence Day e-mail message to state employees offered thanks to servicemen and women for defending our freedom, a reminder to use care with fireworks over the drought-parched weekend — then support for pension reform. 
""I also want to share with you information I came across in a New York Times  article last week. A recent study revealed that, across the nation, taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year just to support the currently unsustainable public employee pension systems. In Florida, that dollar figure translates to $813 a year. 
""That means if we did nothing, every household in Florida would have to contribute more than $800 of their hard-earned money every year, for the next thirty years, just to meet our pension obligations for state and local government retirees. 
""As I’ve said all along, raising taxes is not an option. The pension reform we accomplished this year prevents tax hikes, and also protects the retirement of government workers."" 
A state employee asked us: Did a recent study in the New York Times actually say taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year nationally — $813 a year for Floridians — to support public employee pensions?  
We should mention the pension reform Scott recently signed was a law requiring state workers to put 3 percent of their salaries toward retirement and eliminating cost-of-living increases on benefits earned after July 1. 
We checked out the New York Times article, which focused primarily on pension challenges in Costa Mesa, Calif. A related graphic told the national story. Headlined ""Tax Increases for Government Pensions,"" it said that ""even if pensions are funded today, costs are expected to rise as promises come due. Though many pension funds dispute their findings, two economists, Robert Novy-Marx and Joshua D. Rauh, have calculated: How much each state needs to increase taxes per household per year to eventually fund its pensions 100 percent ... or the returns that state pension funds need to earn every year for the next 30 years to be fully funded."" 
A list of states followed. 
In Florida that annual tax increase was estimated at $813 — just what Scott wrote. Meanwhile, the abstract of the complete study — also linked to from the story — said it would take a tax increase of $1,398 per U.S. household per year to fully fund state and local pension systems over the next 30 years. So Scott's message actually used a slightly more conservative number. He could have rounded up to $1,400. 
So Scott accurately quoted both the state and national estimates for tax increases it would take to fully fund pensions, according to Novy-Marx and Rauh.  
But he also said taxes ""would have to be increased."" 
Even a quick look at the New York Times graphic shows that's not the case. The economists had in fact offered an either/or scenario. Either Florida would need to increase taxes each year by $813, or it would need to average a 12.1 percent return on its pension fund investments.  
We asked Joshua Rauh to clarify this for us. Hang with us for just a few moments of economist-speak. He said the baseline scenario for the tax increase calculation was an asset return of inflation plus today's long-run real Treasury bond yields — under today's conditions, an annual return of just under 5 percent. 
""If returns are more than that, required tax increases for Florida will be less than $813,"" he said. ""If returns are less than that, required tax increases will be more than $813. To eliminate the need for tax increases entirely, returns would need to be 12.1 percent a year."" 
A footnote to the New York Times graphic pointed out that historical returns nationally averaged about 8.8 percent a year. In other words, if over 30 years Florida pulled in the average historical return on its investments, it would still need to raise taxes. But it wouldn't need to raise taxes by a full $813 a year. 
Meanwhile, ""Tax Increases for Government Pensions"" wasn't the only graphic that accompanied the New York Times article. The story also included a handy map headlined ""A $176 Billion Gap for Public Pensions."" Sounds like it would support Scott's description of ""currently unsustainable public employee pension systems,"" doesn't it? Under the headline, the graphic reads, ""In general, many experts say pension funds should hold 80 percent of the funds needed for future obligations. Many states, however, have failed to put enough aside."" The map showed which states fall short of the 80 percent goal, and by how much — and which states exceed the 80 percent goal, and by how much. 
Given Scott's message to state employees, which category would you assume Florida is in? 
Well, it turns out that by this measure, Florida's fund is among the nation's most healthy. Its pension funds hold $5.9 billion over the traditional 80 percent benchmark, the graphic shows. 
And that's the story supported by a Pew Center study last year and the most recent annual state report on Florida's pension funds. While other states' funds entered the recession underfunded, Florida's was fully funded. And while it took a hit during the recent economic tsunami, in 2010 it gained more than 14 percent, ahead of the state's target. That added $9.8 billion to the bottom line. 
Ash Williams, executive director and chief investment officer for the State Board of Administration of Florida, which oversees the state's pension investments, declared in November, ""We are healthy."" 
He called Florida's plan ""a very positive exception to the rule"" that ""remains one of the best-funded, and therefore strongest, public plans in the country. 
Still, there have been plenty of voices saying Florida would need to raise taxes, increase returns or trim benefits to keep that plan strong. And Scott has made it clear he doesn't share Williams' sunny take. For example, he thinks the state's expected return of 7.75 percent requires too risky an asset mix for contributions that should be cautiously invested. So there's legitimate disagreement about the long-term health of even comparatively healthy public pension systems like Florida's. But we can still weigh in on the accuracy of Scott's characterization of the New York Times report to state employees. 
Scott told them that ""a recent study revealed that, across the nation, taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year just to support the currently unsustainable public employee pension systems. In Florida, that dollar figure translates to $813 a year."" But he left out that investment returns could also offset this need. He also failed to distinguish between states that have long struggled to meet their pension goals, and Florida's comparatively strong performance. We think those are important details, and rate Scott's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3E3F00>],/factchecks/2011/jul/12/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-taxes-would-climb-support-publ/
"['National', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Taxes', 'Timothy Geithner']","
Geithner says the top 1 percent have a tax rate in the low 20s
","
Even as they push Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling this summer, President Barack Obama and members of his administration argue that America’s richest citizens should sacrifice some of the tax breaks that substantially lower how much they pay. During a June 24 appearance at Dartmouth College, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said it’s not only a matter of fiscal responsibility, but also of fairness.

""We have to correct the biggest problem in our tax system today, which is that it’s just basically unfair,"" said Geithner, a 1983 Dartmouth graduate. ""If you are fortunate enough to be among the … most fortunate 0.5 percent, 1 percent of Americans today, your effective tax burden is in the low 20s, the lowest it’s been in decades and decades and decades — lower than somebody who might make substantially less money.""  

The wealthy have always been able to take advantage of tax breaks, so it's not like millionaires all pay the top tax rate of 35 percent. But is the disparity that large?

Let’s break Geithner’s statement down into its parts:

* The richest group is paying in the low 20s;
* That tax burden is lighter than it has been in decades;
* Their effective tax rate is lower than for people who make much less.

In his speech, Geithner was referring to income taxes rather than all taxes that individuals pay. Congressional Budget Office data compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan research group, show that the effective individual income tax rate for the wealthiest 1 percent was 19 percent in 2007, the most recent year available. Citing IRS statistics, Geithner’s office put the rate at 23 percent in 2008. By those measurements, Geithner is in the ballpark.  

Is the burden the lowest in decades? Geithner’s office points to a recent PolitiFact articlethat found Mostly True the president’s claim that wealthy CEOs and hedge fund managers are paying lower federal income tax rates than they have since the 1950s. That finding was based partly on two documents — the 2010 Economic Report of the President, and a 2007 study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanual Saez — that are cited by Geithner’s office and generally support his assertion.

The Urban-Brookings center, again using statistics from the Congressional Budget Office, found the same trend. In a table charting tax rates between 1979 and 2007, the CBO reported that the average effective income tax rate (that is, the percentage paid after deductions and credits) for the richest 1 percent of earners began at 21.8 percent in 1979, rose to as high as 24.2 percent in 1996 and 2000 and had dropped to 19 percent by 2007.

(Conservatives note that even though the rates are dropping, upper-income Americans still account for the lion’s share of the nation’s income tax revenue. ""So while it is true that tax rates … are significantly lower than they were 30 years ago, the rich are paying a lot more of the overall tax burden,"" says Cato Institute economist Dan Mitchell. Federal figures show that the top 5 percent of taxpayers accounted for more than half of the income tax dollars paid.)  

But what about Geithner's final point: that the rate for the top 1 percent is ""lower than somebody who might make substantially less money""?

In his talk, Geithner cited the example of super-investor Warren Buffett, who famously complained that the United States tax system is so upside-down that he paid a smaller share of his income to Uncle Sam than his secretary.

Speaking to wealthy donorsat a 2007 fundraiser for then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, Buffett said, ""The 400 of us (here) pay a lower part of our income in taxes than our receptionists do, or our cleaning ladies for that matter."" Buffett said that he was taxed at 17.7 percent on the $46 million he had made the previous year, while his secretary faced a 30 percent federal tax bill on her $60,000 earnings.

Buffett’s case provides a powerful anecdote about the extremes of a tax system that hands breaks to a small group of wealthy people, particularly those who take much of their income in tax-favored capital gains and dividends. And Treasury statistics support the assertion that the super-duper rich — the 120,000 taxpayers who comprise the wealthiest 9/100ths of 1 percent of the tax-paying population — pay slightly lower income tax rates than people just below them on the income ladder. 
But Geithner made a much broader assertion. He said the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers — about 1.4 million individuals or households — paid lower rates. And that isn't supported by the facts.

We began with a source provided by Geithner’s office: the 2010 Economic Report of the President. On page 154, a chart tracks the history of effective tax rates for people making more than $250,000 a year and the middle 20 percent of taxpayers who make considerably less. While the tax rate for the rich has clearly dropped, the chart shows, it remains visibly higher than the middle group.

The CBO figures paint a more specific, and stark, contrast. In 2007 (the most recent year listed), the top 1 percent of earners paid 19 percent of their income in federal individual income taxes, and for people earning less, the rate went steadily down, to a rate of minus 6.8 percent for people in the lowest 20 percent of taxpayers. (Because of the Earned Income Tax Credit, many working class families pay no net taxes and, indeed, collect refunds from the government to help them make ends meet.)

The CBO chart covers only the federal individual income tax, which is the one Geithner was discussing. But even if you fold in other federal taxes (corporate, estate, Social Security and Medicare), average rates remain higher for the richest group than for everyone else. The non-partisan Urban-Brookings center folded in the other forms of federal taxes for 2011, and found that the top 1 percent will pay 27.6 percent, and that rates steadily decline for the less-wealthy until they reach zero (a little less, actually) for the lowest one-fifth of earners.

While some of the very rich pay a lower rate than less wealthy Americans, said Eric Toder, the center’s co-director, ""We do find that the average rates go up by income.""

Our ruling

Geithner was largely correct when he said the top 1 percent pay rates in the low 20s, a  tax burden that is historically low. But he's wrong that the wealthiest enjoy effective rates ""lower than somebody who might make substantially less money."" We rate the statement Half True. 
UPDATE: This story was updated to clarify our characterization of Geithner's message about the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers. Our initial article said Geithner was wrong that their effective tax rate is lower than that of ""most Americans,"" including ones who earn substantially less. We have changed that to quote Geithner directly in saying that the wealthiest enjoy effective rates ""lower than somebody who might make substantially less money.""",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F9700>],/factchecks/2011/jul/12/timothy-geithner/geithner-says-top-1-percent-have-tax-rate-low-20s/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Taxes', 'Steve Oroho']","
Sen. Steve Oroho claims Democratic tax hikes are to blame for private-sector job losses in New Jersey over the last decade
","
Amid the recent budget battle raging between Democratic legislators and Gov. Chris Christie, Republican Sen. Steve Oroho offered an interesting lesson in how New Jersey had already made history when it comes to private-sector job losses during the last decade.

In a June 29 press release, Oroho criticized the fiscal year 2012 budget passed by the Democratic majority, but later scaled back by Christie and argued that Democratic tax hikes during the past 10 years contributed to those job losses. In fact, Oroho said the last decade was the ""first time in recorded history"" that the state had fewer private-sector jobs at the end than at the beginning of the decade.

""Over the past 10 years, the Democrat majority have been intent on pushing through dramatic tax increases, and irresponsible budget gimmicks to fund an insatiable desire to spend taxpayer dollars,"" said Oroho, who represents Sussex County and parts of Hunterdon and Morris counties.

Oroho added, ""It is no coincidence that during this same period it was the first time in recorded history where the state had less private sector jobs at the end of the decade than we had at the beginning.""

PolitiFact New Jersey soon learned that Oroho’s statistic is accurate -- New Jersey had a net loss of private-sector jobs in a decade for the first time since payroll employment statistics were first collected.

But the causes go beyond the tax increases imposed by Democrats, according to economic experts.

First, let’s talk about where Oroho received his information.

Oroho directed us to a May 3, 2010 article on NJ Spotlight written by James Hughes and Joseph Seneca of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.

The article points to a net loss of 156,100 private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2010, marking the first such reduction for a decade since 1939. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein school, told us their analysis was based on state and federal employment data from December 1999 to December 2009.

Following our own review of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we reached a similar conclusion. For non-seasonally adjusted figures, New Jersey lost 152,700 private-sector jobs between December 1999 and December 2009, or about 4 percent, according to the federal data.

Every other decade dating to 1939 saw private-sector job increases of between 8 percent and 26 percent, according to the federal data for non-seasonally adjusted figures.

""We’ve never had a decade where we lost private-sector jobs before,"" Hughes said.

So Oroho is right about that history lesson, but how much blame should be given to the tax hikes?

After talking to experts and taking a closer look at the private-sector job numbers between December 1999 and December 2009, we found a major element missing from Oroho’s statement: the recession.

According to federal data for non-seasonally adjusted figures, New Jersey saw private-sector job growth annually between 2003 and 2007. Then between 2008 and 2009 -- after the recession had hit -- the state lost 226,800 private-sector jobs, according to federal data.

Bill Rodgers, chief economist at the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, argued that the recession and the weak recovery preceding it had a greater impact on job losses.

""The taxes are not the main contributor,"" Rodgers said.

Oroho acknowledged that other factors contributed to the job losses, including the general downturn in the economy, but he said the tax increases turned away capital investment, leading to the private-sector job losses. Those tax hikes included increases in the income, sales and corporate business taxes, according to the senator.

""Capital’s like water,"" Oroho said. ""It follows the path of least resistance.""

Hughes agreed that the tax hikes increased the cost of doing business in New Jersey and affected job figures. He also noted the impact of corruption scandals, saying: ""Corporations don’t want to be near controversy.""

Michael Riccards, executive director of Trenton-based The Hall Institute of Public Policy, argued that tax hikes were not a major cause behind the job losses. The global economy and poor business practices in certain industries contributed to the loss of jobs, Riccards said.

Let’s review:

Pointing to Democratic tax hikes, Oroho said the last decade marked the first time since 1939 that New Jersey ended a decade with fewer private-sector jobs than it started with. He’s right, based on research by Rutgers professors and our own analysis of federal data.

But given the impact of the recession on job losses -- and as the senator acknowledges himself -- tax hikes are not the only factors involved. We rate his statement Barely True.

Sarah Palin says price of Slim Jims has risen 169 percent recently
","
In an interview with Newsweek, former Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin pointed to Slim Jims -- the iconic beef jerky snack sold in convenience stores everywhere -- as an example of how inflation poses a problem for the American economy.

The article explained that Palin has ""become conversant on the subject of quantitative easing"" -- a Federal Reserve bond-buying plan. The effort was designed to bolster a weak economy, but critics say it risks encouraging inflation. (We rated her on a related statement last November.)

In the July 10, 2011 Newsweek interview, Palin illustrated the issue with an anecdote about her husband: ""I was ticked off at Todd yesterday,"" she said. ""He walks into a gas station as we’re driving over from Minnesota. He buys a Slim Jim—we’re always eating that jerky stuff—for $2.69. I said, 'Todd, those used to be 99 cents, just recently!' And he says, 'Man, the dollar’s worth nothing anymore.' A jug of milk and a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs—every time I walk into that grocery store, a couple of pennies more.""

A reader asked us to look into whether Slim Jims have, in fact, been swept up in a huge inflationary spiral recently.

We’ll start by noting that Palin used an anecdote to draw broader conclusions. That’s not necessarily a no-no, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. (Or, perhaps, 430 mg of salt, the amount of sodium in a 0.97-ounce original Slim Jim.) Even if Palin’s anecdote is true, it may not support her larger points about food inflation and the dangers thereof.

So, let’s look at some of the broader trends in food inflation.

The term Palin used -- ""just recently"" -- is vague, but we thought the past year would be a reasonable yardstick. So we looked at federal inflation data for the period May 2010 to May 2011. For these figures, we turned to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Workers, or CPI-U-- the most commonly used measurement for inflation.

At the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website, you can dig out inflation figures for a wide range of consumer products. There’s no category for Slim Jims, of course, but we did find at least two relevant categories. Beef prices have risen 10.2 percent during the past year, and snack prices have risen 2.8 percent over the same period. (Okay, wise guys: Slim Jims also include other ingredients -- here’s an independent assessment -- but we won’t go there.)

For comparison’s sake, the inflation rate for all consumer products studied was 3.5 percent over the same period, and slightly less -- 3.4 percent -- for food products alone. So beef prices have indeed risen quite a bit faster than inflation generally, while snack prices have risen more slowly than overall inflation.

Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that inflation has been increasing somewhat in the food sector (as well as in the energy sector), but he added that those increases came after sharp declines during the last recession and that a broad range of consumer products have not increased at similar rates.

""Basic commodity prices have risen sharply,"" Burtless said, ""in no small part because (a) they are determined in a world market, not solely by what is going on in the USA; (b) the world market for basic commodities dramatically improved after early 2009, when it became clear that government actions to combat the recession and fix the financial meltdown were going to be successful and all of Asia except Japan enjoyed a big economic rebound; and (c) because those basic commodity prices were rebounding from sharp declines that occurred because of the steep world recession in 2008-2009.""

But even a 10.2 percent increase in beef prices -- a major ingredient of Slim Jims, even if not the only one -- does not explain a price rise of 169 percent, which is what Palin’s comparison would suggest.

Still, national statistics alone can’t settle this question. So we went directly to ConAgra, the food giant that makes Slim Jims.

Teresa Paulsen, a ConAgra spokeswoman, said that ""we admire Mr. Palin’s taste and appreciate his support,"" but added that ""we haven’t raised the price significantly on any Slim Jim products.""

She also offered a possible explanation for the confusion. ""Our iconic Slim Jim Giant Sticks are priced around $1.30,"" Paulsen said. ""Mr. Palin might have been reaching for one of our Slim Jim Monster Sticks, which offers double the meat for $2.30, or our Slim Jim Kippered Beef Steak, which typically sells for around $2.65.""

Finally, Paulsen said, ""If the Palins want to try something that brings a little extra heat, we’d invite them to try our new Slim Jim Dare sticks. We’d love to know what a seasoned Slim Jim connoisseur thinks.""

We’ll note that it’s also possible that Todd Palin happened to buy his jerky fix at a store that disregarded ConAgra’s suggested retail price. Paulsen said that the company’s suggested price is just that -- a suggestion -- and that retailers ultimately determine how much they charge.

So where does this leave us? Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that the Palins are correct and they recently paid two and a half times more for a Slim Jim than they used to. If that’s the case, it wasn’t because ConAgra raised the suggested price. It could have been because they bought from a particularly expensive retailer, or they could have been choosing a different and more expensive flavor of Slim Jim without realizing it.

Still, even if Todd Palin paid more for his snack food fix, it doesn’t support Sarah Palin’s argument that food prices are skyrocketing. Food prices -- an always-volatile sector -- are indeed going up, and that may or may not be a worry for the longer term. However, food prices are not rising by anything approaching 169 percent. Her anecdote offers spice, but not a lot of meat. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F9640>],/factchecks/2011/jul/11/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-price-slim-jims-has-risen-169-per/

Paul Krugman says government jobs have fallen by half million since January 2009
","In the July 11, 2011, edition of the New York Times, Paul Krugman -- a Nobel Prize-winning economist and liberal columnist -- noted a statistic about recent trends in government employment.

He wrote, ""Everybody knows that President (Barack) Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didn’t work. But what everyone knows is wrong. Think about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office.""

Has government employment really gone down in the past two and a half years? We looked in the databases for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official tabulator of employment statistics.

We found that between January 2009 (when Obama took office) and June 2011 (the most recent month available), Krugman was right for overall government employment -- the combination of federal, state and local government workers. Overall government employment declined by 518,000 workers, or about 2.3 percent of the January 2009 level.

So his statistic is correct. But the closer you look at the data, the more varied the data becomes.

First, let’s look at federal government employment, which accounts for just 13 percent of all government employment. The number of federal workers has increased by 38,000 over the same period -- an increase of 1.4 percent.

And if you separate out the U.S. Postal Service, the growth was even bigger. Non-postal federal employment -- about 10 percent of all government employment -- increased over the same period by 139,000 workers, or 6.7 percent.

The decline in government employment clearly wasn’t driven by job losses at the federal level. It came from state and local government. So we’ll look at the trends for those categories here.

State employment accounts for 23 percent of the government workforce. State government payrolls declined by 113,000 over the same period, or 2.2 percent. Within this category, state education workers -- who account for a little under half of state workers -- actually rose slightly over the period. The hits were taken in the remainder of the state workforce -- a decline of 115,500, or 4.1 percent.

But the biggest declines in the government sector came in local government. Local government -- which accounts for 64 percent of all government employment -- fell by 443,000 workers, or 3 percent. That accounts for a huge portion of the half-million decrease in jobs that Krugman cited.

Education workers at the local level fared worse than those at the state level. Local education workers declined by 204,800, or 2.5 percent.

Non-education workers in local government fared even worse -- employment was down 238,400, or 3.7 percent.

The decline in government workers has certainly had an impact on the overall employment picture. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, private payrolls have increased by more than 1 million workers, but government payrolls have declined by 493,000 -- cutting the number of jobs created almost in half.

So how does all this relate to Krugman’s comment? The fact that federal employment outside the Postal Service has risen by 6.7 percent in the past two and a half years is an important point to recognize for anyone studying employment trends. But Krugman was careful enough to avoid suggesting that federal employment declined by a half-million jobs. In fact, since a large chunk of the stimulus came in the form of aid to states -- specifically to help save jobs in education and other government sectors -- using total government employment figures as a yardstick seems reasonable to us. So we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968E3D00>],/factchecks/2011/jul/11/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-says-government-jobs-have-fallen-half/

Gov. Bob McDonnell says Virginia's crime rate continues to plummet
","
At a ceremonial signing of seven bills strengthening Virginia’s prisoner re-entry laws, Gov. Bob McDonnell touted the state’s achievement in combating crime over the years, offering tough talk for would-be offenders.

""There’s no place in society for those people that want to violate the rights of others,"" McDonnell said. ""They need to be taken off the streets and incapacitated for a significant amount of time. That’s why we abolished parole 15 years ago. Then you can see the enormous positive results in Virginia as our crime rate continues to plummet.""

Is Virginia’s crime rate in a free fall? We decided to take a look.

First, for context’s sake, let’s consult our old friend Merriam-Webster, which defines McDonnell’s verb of choice -- ""plummet"" -- as, ""To drop sharply and abruptly.""

Asked to support McDonnell’s claim, Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, directed us to two reports: The Virginia State Police’s ""Crime in Virginia"" and Department of Criminal Justice Services’ ""Virginia Crime Trends 2000-2009.""   

Using the data, there are a few ways to look at things. Crime rates are measured in two primary areas: violent crime, which includes offenses such as murder, manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault; and property crime, which includes burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft.

According to the state police report, violent crime in Virginia dropped 4.9 percent (per 100,000 people) from 2009 to 2010. Not too shabby, but actually less of a decline than than the national average, which showed a 5.5 percent decline, according to the FBI.

Property crime decreased 2.8 percent in Virginia from 2009 to 2010, on par with the national average.

But by mentioning the abolition of parole, achieved in 1995 by then-Gov. George Allen, the governor points to a long-term decline.

And he’s right, at least going back to 2000, when crime reporting standards changed to the current incident-based system.  

According to the DCJS report, violent crime in Virginia fell dramatically over the last decade, 19 percent from 2000 to 2009. That’s actually a sharper drop than the national average of 15 percent over the same time period.

Property crime rates in Virginia have also fallen significantly,12 percent over the decade, though that’s less than the national average of 16 percent for the same time period.

But what of the governor’s assertion that the decline is linked to the abolition of parole. Well, that’s less convincing.

""I’m not aware of any studies that connect the abolition of parole release to reduced crime rates,"" said Jay Albanese, a criminologist and a professor of criminal justice studies at Virginia Commonwealth University. ""The majority of the offenders on parole, when you look at the studies that have been done, do not commit new crimes.""  

What is clear, Albanese said, is that prisoner re-entry programs designed to ease the transition back into society, like the ones McDonnell was signing when he made his claim, have been instrumental in keeping the crime rate trending downward.

Other factors, he said, include evolving police strategies, a decline in crack cocaine and the rising median age of Americans.  

Nonetheless, Albanese said McDonnell’s core assertion was correct, regardless of the factors.

""Crime rates nationwide have continued to decrease,"" Albanese said. ""This is good news, and everyone’s taking their share of credit for it.""  

So let’s look back.

McDonnell’s contention is that Virginia’s ""crime rate"" continues its downward spiral since parole was abolished in 1995. And he’s right that overall crime has gone down significantly, not just here, but across the country.

Does it ""continue to plummet""? Not by the definition of the word. The declines have been steady but not sharp and abrupt. There have even been years with minor increases. We rate this claim Mostly True.      ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F1C080>],/factchecks/2011/jul/11/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-virginias-crime-rate-contin/

Ex-Mayor Franklin says former APS school chief improved district
","
As Beverly Hall’s beleaguered term as Atlanta Public Schools superintendent came to a close, former Mayor Shirley Franklin waxed elegiac.

Franklin’s June 23 post on Blogging While Blue cast Hall’s tenure as one of collaboration and accomplishment. Hall reached out to the entire community, she said, and APS experienced ""notable successes.""    

""She leaves the school district significantly better than she found it,"" Franklin concluded.

Wait a second. What about that cheating scandal?

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has written for years about allegations of widespread cheating at APS. Late Tuesday, the state released the results of a yearlong investigation that confirmed these reports, and then some.

The test score success that rocketed Hall to national acclaim was the result of widespread cheating that may have gone on for a decade, the report said. The investigation implicated 178 educators, including 38 principals, and more than 80 confessed. Investigators confirmed cheating in 44 of 56 schools they examined, they said.

District leaders knew or should have known about it, the report said.    

The scandal made national news. Time magazine called it ""likely the largest cheating scandal in U.S. history to date."" The Christian Science Monitor called it ""America's biggest teacher and principal cheating scandal.""

APS even became a punch line on Thursday’s ""Tonight Show."" Jay Leno said it’s so hot he’s been sweating like an Atlanta student trying to take a test on his own.

We contacted Franklin, who started her term in 2002, three years after Hall took office.
She said she could not respond to our questions by deadline because she no longer has staff to assist her.

""When my schedule is tight, I can't direct staff to handle one or the other of the requests,"" Franklin said.

APS did not respond to our calls and emails.

Undeterred, we switched on our Truth-O-Meter.  

Franklin’s post listed five reasons why schools are better off after Hall: 


First, we looked at the district graduation rate. Georgia Department of Education figures show it jumped from 39 percent in the 2001-2002 school year to 66.3 percent in 2009-2010.

But this dramatic increase, like the district’s skyrocketing test scores, may be fiction, according to the findings of an AJC investigation published Aug. 15.  

The surge took place between 2003 and 2005. During those same years, the district removed thousands of students from its rolls -- about 30 percent of all pupils in grades nine through 12, the article said.

That means the district no longer included them in the graduation rate.

Many were recorded as ""transfers"" to other systems, at times without proof they hadn’t dropped out. One consultant estimated more than one-third of those who left were not documented.

District officials denied they tried to get rid of low-performing students to boost their numbers, but their credibility is questionable. One of those officials gave investigators false information during the state’s cheating investigation, Tuesday’s report alleged.    

Now we turn to Franklin’s claim about new infrastructure. APS reports construction projects to the state Department of Education, but not its costs, so we cannot confirm her spending figure.  

Records do show that since 1999, the year Hall took office, the state Department of Education approved plans to build 15 new schools and update 61. This is very close to Franklin’s count.

As for Franklin’s scholarship and donation figures, the school district is not required to report them to the state, so we cannot confirm them independently.   

We do know that in light of the cheating scandal, there is reason to question whether APS won its donations fairly. APS received $125,000 in scholarships in 2002 as a finalist for the Broad Prize for Urban Education because of overall improvements, including test scores, according to an AJC article.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated money because it thought APS was on ""the leading edge"" in ""effective teaching,"" a foundation spokesman told the AJC in 2010. A spokesman told the AJC that it will continue to support APS.

How do we rule?

The data Franklin uses to demonstrate Hall left APS ""significantly better than she found it"" is flawed.

At least two of the statistics Franklin mentions are clouded by APS’ integrity crisis, and two are unconfirmed. That leaves school construction as the only clear-cut accomplishment of the Hall administration, and this does not outweigh the trouble the district now faces.  

The district has to re-educate students who received high scores they did not earn. It must replace the 178 implicated educators. Key administrators may face criminal charges, and court battles could drag on for years. A district culture that Hall shaped over 12 years needs to be gutted and rebuilt.

Confirmation of massive, widespread, coordinated school cheating is more than a bombshell. It’s the H-bomb of revelations. After Hall’s term, the district’s academic reputation, culture and integrity are in ruins. How can it possibly be better off?  

We rate Franklin’s claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D43B40>],/factchecks/2011/jul/11/shirley-franklin/ex-mayor-franklin-says-former-aps-school-chief-imp/

Biden, Harris distrusted Trump with COVID-19 vaccines, not the vaccines themselves
","President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been pushing Americans to get inoculated against COVID-19. But a video on social media suggests that they actually had reservations about the safety of the vaccines. ""Keep doubting, They actually said this, it’s not editing,"" says the heading on the video, which contains clips of statements made by Biden and Harris appearing to cast doubt on the vaccine while they were campaigning last year.  In fact, the clips are selectively edited to take the statements out of context. The parts that are left out make clear that Biden and Harris were raising questions not about the vaccines themselves, but about then-President Donald Trump’s rollout of the vaccines and the risk that the effort would become rushed or politicized. The TikTok video was posted on TikTok on May 11 and we found it was still being widely shared on Facebook in mid-July, more than a month after it was reposted there.  A June 15 Facebook post showing the video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Trump was publicly touting the promise of a rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccine as early as March 2020, when fears of a global pandemic were just beginning to flare, and said he was urging researchers working on the vaccine to ""speed it up."" Scientists and drug makers, meanwhile, were urging more caution on the timeline and said they were emphasizing safety and effectiveness over speed. Here’s a rundown of the Biden and Harris statements cited in the video. The video included only the parts that are in bold, but we’ve provided the fuller context around them. Harris was asked in a Sept. 6, 2020, interview whether she would take a vaccine if it was approved before the election. She replied: ""Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us. I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump. And it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he's talking about. I will not take his word for it. He wants us to inject bleach. I — no, I will not take his word."" Harris was asked in an Oct. 7, 2020, vice presidential debate if she would take a vaccine if the Trump administration approved one. Referring to the leading government epidemiologist Dr. Anthony Fauci, she said: ""If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it."" Biden’s statements on the campaign trail show that he was concerned that politics would influence the development and deployment of the vaccine, and that Trump could not be trusted.  In an interview for a journalism conference Aug. 6, 2020, he said: ""The way he (Trump) talks about the vaccine is not particularly rational. He’s talking about it being ready, he’s going to talk about moving it quicker than the scientists think it should be moved … . People don’t believe that he’s telling the truth, therefore they’re not at all certain they’re going to take the vaccine. And one more thing: If and when the vaccine comes, it’s not likely to go through all the tests that need to be done, and the trials that are needed to be done."" In a Sept. 2, 2020 TV interview, Biden referred to political influence over two federal agencies leading the fight against the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. He said: ""Look at what’s happened. Enormous pressure put on the CDC not to put out the detailed guidelines. The enormous pressure being put on the FDA to say they’re going, that the following protocol will in fact reduce, it will have a giant impact on COVID. All these things turn out not to be true, and when a president continues to mislead and lie, when we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, who’s going to take the shot? Who’s going to take the shot? You going to be the first one to say, ‘Put me — sign me up, they now say it’s OK’? I’m not being facetious."" In a July 28, 2020 campaign speech, Biden stressed the need for transparency in developing the vaccine. He said: ""How are you going to distribute the vaccine when it arrives, when it arrives, when it’s there? And the question of whether it’s real, when it’s there, that requires enormous transparency. You’ve got to make all of it available to other experts across the nation, so they can look and see, so there’s consensus this is a safe vaccine. Because already you have, what percent is American people saying if the vaccine were there tomorrow, they wouldn’t take it? And it’s not the usual anti-vaccine crowd. It’s beyond that because people are losing faith in what the president says. Think about it.""  In campaign remarks on Sept. 7, 2020, Biden outlined steps he would take to address the pandemic, including masks and contact tracing, adding:  ""Charting a clear path of science-based vaccines, free from politics. I get asked the question: ‘If the president announced tomorrow we have a vaccine, would you take it?’ Only if it was completely transparent, that other experts in the country could look at it, only if we knew all of what went into it. Because so far, nothing he’s told us has been true."" The following week, Biden restated his concern about politics intervening in vaccine development: ""Americans have had to endure President Trump’s incompetence and dishonesty, when it comes to testing and personal protective equipment. We can’t afford to repeat those fiascos when it comes to a vaccine. … Let me be clear: I trust vaccines, I trust scientists, but I don’t trust Donald Trump, and at this moment, the American people can’t either. Last week, Senator Harris and I laid out three questions this administration’s going to have to answer to assure the American people that politics will not play a role whatsoever in the vaccine process. If Donald Trump can’t give answers and the administration can’t give answers to these three questions, the American people should not have confidence."" A video on social media suggests that Biden and Harris distrusted COVID-19 vaccines. The video was selectively edited to leave out the context of their statements. Their full statements show they were raising doubts about Trump’s trustworthiness, his ability to roll out the vaccines safely and the risk of political influence over vaccine development.  We rate the video False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A358C0>],/factchecks/2021/jul/23/tiktok-posts/biden-harris-doubted-trump-covid-19-vaccines-not-v/

Paying taxes is not voluntary
","A video on Facebook takes a hacksaw to the old line about death and taxes being the only certainties in life. ""Income taxes are voluntary,"" reads the headline in the July 20 post. In the video itself, a moustachioed man with law books behind him says, ""There is no law that makes the average citizen liable for the income tax."" ""You will not see this story on any of the mainstream media — ABC, CBS, CNN, even Fox News is not going to cover this story,"" he says. They won’t cover this for good reason. It has no legal substance, and bad things happen to people who test this theory and don’t pay up. The claim that no law compels anyone to pay their taxes has been around for a long time. It’s so old hat, the IRS website includes a lengthy section debunking it on its page of ""frivolous tax arguments."" ""Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code clearly imposes a tax on the taxable income of individuals, estates, and trusts,"" the IRS wrote. That law is quite blunt. It begins with ""there is hereby imposed on the taxable income of,"" and then lists the kinds of filers — ""every married individual,"" ""every surviving spouse,"" ""every head of a household,"" ""every individual,"" and others who face taxes. In Section 6151, the law takes the next step and says people who owe a tax ""shall pay such tax."" Plenty of court rulings back this up. One benchmark case is United States v. Drefke in 1983. Paul Drefke made about $40,000 in 1980 and didn’t file a tax return. He argued ""that taxes are debts which can only be incurred voluntarily when individuals contract with the government for services."" The court called that ""imaginative … but totally without arguable merit."" It went on to cite several sections of federal law, including the ones mentioned above, sections 1 and 6151. ""The sections of the Internal Revenue Code imposed a duty on Drefke to file tax returns and pay the appropriate rate of income tax, a duty which he chose to ignore,"" the ruling said. Drefke was sentenced to two years in prison. Drefke’s fate in 1983 apparently wasn’t enough to deter Irwin Schiff. In the early 2000s, Schiff and two partners were pitching a tax scheme based on the idea that paying federal taxes is voluntary. Schiff was sentenced to 12 years in prison and had to pay $4.2 million in restitution to the IRS. The old saw about death and taxes holds.  A video on Facebook said income taxes are voluntary. Federal law and many court rulings says taxes are obligatory. People who have tested the law have ended up behind bars.

Texas GOP perpetuates debunked voter fraud claim in fundraising mailer
","The Texas GOP sent a mailer earlier this week that focuses on an election fraud claim out of Arizona in an attempt to attract donations for upcoming congressional races.  The claim stems from a recent audit of the November election in Maricopa County, which includes Arizona's largest city Phoenix, ordered by Arizona’s GOP-controlled Senate. The Senate held a hearing on the ongoing audit July 15 in which they announced preliminary results showing that 74,243 mail-In ballots were counted with ""no clear record of them being sent."" The number caught the attention of the Texas GOP. On July 20, the party’s chairman Matt Rinaldi latched onto it in an emailed donation plea.   ""Seventy four thousand... That’s how many mail-in ballots were recently found in Arizona that have NO clear record of being sent in,"" reads the first line of the mailer, sent Tuesday. ""That’s exactly why we are fighting so hard for election integrity in Texas.""  ""For months, the left called us conspiracy theorists, crazies, and even un-American for daring to raise legitimate concerns about the 2020 presidential election,"" it said.  The preliminary audit results also caught the attention of former President Donald Trump, who issued a statement repeating the same finding: ""it seems that 74,243 Mail-In Ballots were counted with ‘no clear record of them being sent.’""  PolitiFact previously rated that claim False, as have numerous other fact-checking teams. Politico called the 74,000 mail-in ballots claim a mischaracterization. CNN characterized the claim as baseless. The Associated Press called it a false narrative. And in a Twitter thread Maricopa County election officials published during the Arizona Senate’s hearing, they said that the audit results are ""not based in fact.""  In a statement sent to PolitiFact Texas, the Texas GOP spokesperson blamed Democrats for ""attempting to overturn election code nationwide.""  ""If the press and Democrats don't like the fact that 74,000 ballots have either major clerical errors or potential fraudulent backgrounds, they should be asking the Arizona Audit Chief for more information,"" spokesperson Luke Twombly said. ""The Texas GOP has always been committed to election integrity and full transparency. It has only been Democrats who have attempted to overturn election code nationwide and muddy the waters of an election that raised red flags across multiple states.""  The Arizona audit chief is Doug Logan, the chief executive officer of Cyber Ninjas, a cybersecurity firm hired by Arizona Senate Republicans. Cyber Ninjas had no prior experience in election auditing before it was hired, and Logan was an advocate of ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories.  During the Arizona Senate hearing, Logan said that a clerical error could explain the 74,243 figure.  ""We have 74,243 mail-in ballots where there is no clear record of their being sent. ... That could be something where documentation wasn't done right — there was a clerical issue, there's not proper things there — but I think when we've got 74,000, it merits, you know, knocking on a door and validating some of this information,"" he said, referring his suggestion to visit voters door to door as part of the audit. During the hearing, Logan said he based the 74,000 number on two types of early voting reports issued by Maricopa County. But his understanding of what the two files represent was contradicted by Maricopa County officials.  Logan said that the EV32 file records when mail-in ballots are sent, and the EV33 file records when mail-in ballots are received by the county. The discrepancy between the two files accounts for Logan’s 74,243 figure.   However, Maricopa County election officials tweeted that the EV33 and EV32 files are ""not the proper files to refer to"" for a complete accounting of all mail-in ballots sent and received.   A former Maricopa County election official said the two files are created for political parties to aid them in their get-out-the-vote efforts during early voting, according to the Associated Press. The county is required to provide this data to political parties per Arizona law.   Furthermore, the county records both mail-in ballots and early in-person ballots as early votes, and both are included in the EV32 and EV33 totals.  Lastly, the two files capture votes submitted during different time periods. While the EV32 file includes all requests that voters made for early ballots up to 11 days before Election Day, the EV33 file includes returned early ballots up to the Monday before Election Day, according to the AP.   County officials said that the auditors suffered ""a lack of election knowledge & a wealth of political bias."" An audit performed by the election officials earlier this month found 182 clear cases of voter fraud out of more than 3 million ballots cast in last year's presidential election, according to the Associated Press. Each of the 182 cases were referred to investigators and so far four cases have led to charges. President Joe Biden won the state by about 10,000 votes during the general election. In a political fundraising mailer, the Texas GOP perpetuated a voting fraud claim based on a partisan Arizona election audit, saying that 74,000 mail-in ballots were recently found in Arizona without a record of ever being sent.   The claim, which has been repeated by Trump and others, has been roundly debunked, both by past and present Maricopa County election officials.

Why masks for COVID-19 don’t need to go in biohazard bins
","A year-old Facebook post that questions why masks and gloves used to prevent the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus aren’t treated as a biohazard is drawing new attention from social media users. ""Why are there no biohazard bins for mask and gloves if this virus is so contagious and deadly,"" the post asks. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post implies that the lack of special disposal protocols suggests the virus isn’t as dangerous as it’s made out to be. But that’s based on a misunderstanding of how the virus spreads and what types of medical waste require special handling. The Environmental Protection Agency says biohazard bins, or medical waste containers, are generally used by health facilities such as hospitals, doctors’ offices, blood banks and veterinary clinics — not the general public.  ""Generally, medical waste is health care waste that may be contaminated by blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials and is often referred to as regulated medical waste,"" the organization states. Used needles are also listed as infectious materials. Such waste is treated and disposed of with alternative technologies according to state health and environmental agency guidelines.  Other types of protective equipment used by the general public do not require special handling, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.  Unless it’s contaminated with blood, feces or certain other potentially infectious materials, ""it can be discarded into a trash bag along with other household waste,"" the spokesperson said. But what if a person is at home, stanching their bloody nose with a tissue, for example? Dr. Paul Offit, an attending infectious-disease physician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, explained that when health workers dispose of waste contaminated by blood, it’s presumably because they’re treating someone with a virus such as AIDS, measles or Hepatitis A that is transmitted through blood, he said. But if a person at home treats their bloody nose, they usually aren’t infected with a virus, so that tissue can be thrown into the trash. The types of masks used to control COVID-19 can also be safely discarded because the coronavirus doesn’t spread or survive easily on surfaces, said Offit. It’s spread mostly through respiratory droplets carried through the air or by contact with hands.  Even surgical-style or N95 masks used by the general public can be safely discarded by putting them into a plastic bag and throwing them into the trash, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says. In most situations, gloves are not recommended by the CDC to protect against COVID-19 except when cleaning or caring for someone who is sick. In those cases, use disposable gloves and wash your hands after throwing them away.  A Facebook post suggested that the coronavirus is not so dangerous, because there are no biohazard bins to discard COVID-19 masks and gloves. The claim reflects a misunderstanding of how the virus spreads. The coronavirus spreads almost exclusively through respiratory droplets carried through the air. It does not live or spread on surfaces, so masks and gloves used by the general public to protect against COVID-19 infection aren’t considered medical waste that requires special handling.  Health experts say it’s safe to throw away disposable masks used to guard against infection. Gloves are not needed unless a person is cleaning or caring for someone who is sick, and they can be thrown away afterward.

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s figure on unvaccinated COVID-19 deaths
","During a CNN town hall, President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated for the coronavirus. ""We have a pandemic for those who haven’t gotten a vaccination. It’s that basic, that simple,"" Biden said during the July 21 town hall in Cincinnati, Ohio. ""Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn’t been vaccinated."" That works out to 99.5% of recent COVID-19 deaths occurring among the unvaccinated population.  This statistic has been cited frequently by health officials, though its sourcing is a little opaque. When we asked the White House for a database or peer-reviewed paper to support the statistic, they did not provide one. Instead, they pointed us to comments made at the White House by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During a July 1 White House press briefing, Walensky said the country has made ""incredible progress towards ending the pandemic"" but added that it’s ""clear that communities where people remain unvaccinated are communities that remain vulnerable. This is all true as we monitor the continued spread of the hyper-transmissible delta variant.""  The delta variant is able to spread faster than previous strains of the novel coronavirus, and now accounts for more than four of every five new infections in the United States.  Specifically, Walensky said, ""preliminary data from a collection of states over the last six months suggest 99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in these states have occurred in unvaccinated people.""  Walensky repeated that figure during congressional testimony on July 20, suggesting it was still the most recent CDC data available on this question.  During a hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., asked Walensky for data on the percentage of deaths involving people who were not vaccinated. She responded, ""In a five-month study from January to May in numerous states, five to six states, it was 99.5%."" Then, during the July 22 White House briefing, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy repeated the 99.5% figure. Journalists at the Associated Press conducted an analysis of raw data from the CDC to answer the same question. The analysis, published on June 29, found that 150 of the more than 18,000 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people. That’s about 0.8%, which is very close to the figure Walensky cited. The AP analysis also found that hospitalizations among fully vaccinated people accounted for fewer than 1,200 of more than 107,000 total hospitalizations for the coronavirus, or about 1.1%. Both data points suggested that increased vaccination rates would cut down the total number of hospitalizations and deaths.  The CDC did not respond to our inquiry for a database or other evidence in support of the 99.5% figure. That said, medical experts told us that they have a high degree of confidence in Walensky’s statements.  ""This sounds true,"" said Dr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco. ""The CDC is able to track deaths quite closely based on hospital records and coding."" Dr. Babak Javid, another professor of medicine at UCSF, agreed. ""I haven't seen any peer-reviewed, or even pre-print, data to support this statement, but I would be surprised if it was made up,"" he said.  Even from Walensky’s limited description, however, we do know that the data has limitations. Walensky said it is ""preliminary,"" said it included only a half dozen or so states, and added that it runs through May, which makes it about six weeks old. Looking ahead, Javid said that the percentage of deaths occurring in the unvaccinated population may not stay at 99.5% or thereabouts indefinitely, just based on mathematics. ""I expect pretty much everyone who isn't fully vaccinated to be infected by delta, or whatever variant supplants it around the corner, in the next year or two, but large numbers of the fully vaccinated will also be infected,"" he said. ""These infections will skew milder, but in the elderly and vulnerable, that doesn't guarantee that 100% of cases won't be serious.""  Biden said, ""Ten thousand people have recently died. 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn’t been vaccinated."" Biden is citing a figure that has been offered publicly on at least two occasions by the director of the CDC, Walensky. She cautioned that the data it is ""preliminary,"" is based on only a half dozen or so states, and is now about six weeks old. The CDC has not made public any detailed data or methodology. That said, experts told PolitiFact that they don’t doubt the figure’s accuracy. The figure is also in line with a separate analysis by journalists at the Associated Press. The statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E6880>],/factchecks/2021/jul/22/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-bidens-figure-unvaccinated-covid/

No, Joe Biden doesn’t want to ban handguns
","When President Joe Biden was asked in his Ohio town hall what he plans to do about rising homicides, House Republicans were quick to fire off a tweet to their followers. ""President Biden says he wants to ban handguns,"" the House GOP account tweeted July 21. 🚨🚨🚨 MUST-WATCH 🚨🚨🚨President Biden says he wants to ban handguns. House Republicans will NEVER allow this to happen the #SecondAmendment is a RIGHT. pic.twitter.com/rOq6wecQES The tweet included a video clip from the CNN town hall-style event where Biden was speaking. That clip doesn’t back up the GOP tweet, and the full transcript goes further to sink this claim. Biden’s response followed a question from Andrea Solis Canto, a Cincinnati paralegal, about the spike in homicides. ""Gun violence has taken the lives of so many young students and young people,"" she said. ""I’m tired, and I want to see change that’s going to make our cities, like Cincinnati, safer."" Biden first noted that while crime generally is down, murders and gun violence are up. There’s always a sizable lag in national crime statistics, but based on what’s known today, Biden is broadly correct. Many cities have seen trends like the ones in Cincinnati. In the past three years, homicides are up 17%, while other serious violent crimes such as rapes and robberies are down more than 20%, according to the city’s police department. Biden's main focus, though, was on guns. ""The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon, whether it’s a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it’s a rifle, is ridiculous,"" Biden said. ""I’m continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things."" Those numbers Biden used apply to assault-style firearms and high-capacity magazines. As recently as June, when Biden rolled out his strategy to bring down murders, he said he wants to ban both. Experts disagree over what is or isn’t an assault weapon. States set different thresholds for what qualifies as a high-capacity magazine. But regardless of the definition, neither term includes all handguns.  For example, the Sig Sauer P365 was ranked the most popular handgun in a 2020 survey of Alabama gun dealers. The NRA’s Shooting Illustrated Magazine named it the Handgun of the Year. The standard magazine for the P365 is 10 rounds, and depending on the model, the weapon can accommodate a 15-round magazine. Nothing Biden said would curtail the purchase of the Sig Sauer P365. Nor would his policies touch any of the 15 standard handguns in the Alabama survey. It is possible that some models of pistols would be affected. There are designs that bridge the gap between handgun and rifle, and are built to accommodate larger magazines. But they represent a subset of firearms, and barring them would not constitute a ban on all handguns. In the rest of his answer, Biden talked about his focus on black-market suppliers to stop the flow of illegal firearms.  ""It's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns,"" Biden said. ""They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law."" Again, that effort would not bar the legal sale of handguns. The House Republican video clip included none of Biden’s expanded answer. We reached out to the House Republicans and did not hear back. House Republicans said Biden wants to ban handguns. That is incorrect. Biden was talking about banning assault weapons and magazines that carry 20 to 120 rounds of ammunition. Those policies would not affect the most popular handgun models. Even if some smaller set of pistols came under such a ban, that would not translate to a ban on handguns across the board. We rate this claim False.  RELATED: Murders spiked in 2020.

Joe Biden exaggerates efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines
","President Joe Biden exaggerated when he spoke about the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine during a CNN town hall. ""You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,"" Biden said. It is rare for people who are fully vaccinated to contract COVID-19, but it does happen.  News reports the week of the town hall show that a White House official and a staff member for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi both tested positive for COVID-19, although both were fully vaccinated, as did a handful of Texas Democrats who recently traveled to Washington, D.C. to prevent passage of Texas Republicans’ election bill.   A White House spokesperson pointed to other comments Biden made during the July 21 town hall that less sweepingly characterized vaccinations as protecting people from serious illness or death. ""This is a simple, basic proposition: If you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in an ICU unit, and you’re not going to die,"" Biden said.  That, too, is a slight exaggeration, although hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated people are extremely rare.  Biden was more accurate when he said vaccinated people who catch COVID-19 are ""not likely to get sick. You’re probably going to be symptomless. You’re not going to be in a position where your life is in danger."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that COVID-19 vaccines are effective. But no vaccines are 100% effective at preventing illness. ""There will be a small percentage of fully vaccinated people who still get sick, are hospitalized, or die from COVID-19,"" the CDC said. Millions of people across the country have been vaccinated. As of July 12, more than 159 million people had been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. With 48 states and territories reporting, there were 5,492 confirmed breakthrough cases of COVID-19 among them. Those cases included 5,189 hospitalizations and 1,063 deaths.  That data shows that among vaccinated people, approximately 0.0033% were hospitalized and 0.00067% died, said Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida. ""So those are extremely rare events,"" Prins said. However, ""it’s not accurate that you won’t get COVID-19 if you’re vaccinated. We have seen enough breakthrough cases to know that for sure. And even the efficacy and effectiveness data show that the vaccines don’t prevent all cases of COVID-19,"" Prins said. It’s difficult to quantify the total number of breakthrough cases. The CDC stopped collecting data on all breakthrough cases in May and is now only collecting data on vaccinated people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized or die. A CDC spokesperson told PolitiFact in May that zeroing in on severe breakthrough cases is meant to provide vaccine researchers with more reliable data on the cases they’re most concerned about, since not all people with breakthrough infections can be identified, particularly those with asymptomatic or mild illness who do not get tested. But even when the CDC was tracking breakthrough cases broadly, they were rare. The data that the CDC collected before May 1 show that, of 101 million people vaccinated in the U.S., 10,262 (0.01%) experienced breakthrough cases, Prins said.  ""Bottom line: You can still get COVID-19 if you’re fully vaccinated, but that’s not common, and hospitalizations and deaths from breakthrough cases are very rare,"" Prins said. ""Being vaccinated absolutely helps to prevent COVID-19 infection, and definitely helps to prevent severe disease and death from COVID-19."" We heard similar comments from other experts including Dr. Amesh Adalja, an expert on infectious disease at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.  ""Breakthrough infections are extremely rare, and when they are detected are often clinically insignificant and/or the result of testing asymptomatic fully vaccinated (people) against CDC guidance,"" Adalja said. ""It is even more unlikely that you are going to develop COVID-19 symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization if you’ve been fully vaccinated."" Biden said, ""You’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.""   Biden exaggerated. CDC data shows that fully vaccinated people have gotten COVID-19, but these cases are rare. But it’s important to note that vaccinated people are far more likely to avoid hospitalization or death.   We rate this statement Half True.

Kristi Noem 'putting prayer back' in schools? No evidence of that
","At a Des Moines, Iowa, summit hosted July 16 by Christian lobbyist group The FAMiLY Leader, religious leaders and Republican politicians spoke on embedding Christianity into the government leadership and policy.  The general admission crowd paid as much as $75 to see speakers, including the first-in-the-nation presidential precinct caucuses state notable, and potential 2024 Republican presidential candidates such as former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. When Noem told the crowd, ""In South Dakota, I’m putting prayer back in our schools,"" she was met with applause from attendants.  But when PolitiFact emailed Ian Fury, Noem’s communication’s director, to inquire what legislation or policy she was referring to that would bring prayer into public schools, he did not provide a clear example.  ""Stay tuned for the Governor’s plans,"" Fury wrote in an email. Fury provided a similar response to a request for comment from KOTA, a television station in Rapid City, South Dakota.  No plan has been produced, though. In a phone call with PolitiFact, Fury said he didn’t have an approximate date of when more information about the governor’s plans would come out.  ""I don’t have anything more to share with you on those plans at this time,"" he said, when asked if those plans would be in the form of an executive order or a request to the South Dakota Legislature.  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a landmark 1962 case, Engel v. Vitale, that schools and their representatives could not organize or lead organized prayers in public schools. However, the ruling does not prohibit silent, private praying in a public school. South Dakota allows students a moment of silence, when they can feel free to pray or reflect, but officials in public schools are not allowed to impose prayer. Some Christian groups advocate for prayer spaces in schools, where students voluntarily can visit or teachers can hold lessons, but the specifics of how Noem would plan to put prayer in the schools are not clear.   Though Noem’s statement could be interpreted as sharing her agenda in the next legislative session, telling a crowd of Christians that ""I’m putting prayer back in our schools"" is misleading. No specific policy exists, nor does any specific proposal or a timeline for producing one.  That could change if Noem produces a proposal, the Legislature approves it, and it passes muster in court.

Proof has not emerged to change Joe Biden’s election or his wins in Ariz., Ga.
","A meme falsely suggests that reviews of the 2020 presidential vote in two swing states show that Donald Trump won the election. ""Arizona & Georgia now have the proof,"" says the post, which includes a photo of a smiling Joe Biden. ""You are not our elected president!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s understandable if the results in Arizona and Georgia were jarring to Trump supporters. He had won both states in 2016; in 2020, they were decided by a fraction of a percentage point. Arizona: Biden: 1,672,143 votes, 49.36%; Trump: 1,661,686 votes, 49.06%. Georgia: Biden: 2,473,633 votes, 49.5%; Trump: 2,461,854 votes; 49.26%. But months of multiple reviews have not produced evidence to change the result in either state, much less Biden’s election, which was certified by Congress hours after a pro-Trump mob’s Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Arizona’s Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, conducted a hand count audit of a sample of ballots as required by state law and hired independent firms to conduct a forensic audit of tabulation equipment. The county found no abnormalities.  But Republicans in the Arizona Senate hired a team including Cyber Ninjas, which has no prior experience auditing elections, to audit the Maricopa County results. The company’s head, Doug Logan, was part of the ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.  Claims arising from the audit that we’ve debunked include:  Trump said ""74,243 mail-in ballots were counted with 'no clear record of them being sent.'"" Our rating: False. The claim was based on confusion over the early voting process and a misuse of Maricopa County documents.  Trump said: ""The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED!"" Our rating: False. His claim was made after a tweet from the audit stated that the county ""deleted a directory full of election databases."" Three days after Trump’s claim, the head of a firm helping with the audit essentially walked back the database claim. Trump stated: ""Republican state senators"" who started an audit of 2020 election results in Maricopa County are ""exposing this fraud."" Our rating: False. The audit is ongoing and no official findings have been released. A post shared on Facebook claimed: ""A quarter of a million illegal votes found in Arizona’s audit."" Our rating: False. The claim was based on speculation by a former adviser to Trump, not any audit finding. Separate from the audit, county election officials across the state have identified fewer than 200 cases of potential voter fraud out of more than 3 million ballots cast, the Associated Press reported. Citing a history of election mismanagement in Fulton County, home to Atlanta, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on July 15 called for the firing of two of the county’s top election officials.  But the original count, plus the two recounts, all confirmed Biden’s victory in Georgia. We’ve debunked claims about Georgia, as well, including: Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson said: ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November. That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true."" Our rating: False. Carlson made several allegations — including about an elections warehouse alarm, double-scanned ballots and mail-in ballots without creases — that were false, misleading or unsubstantiated. A Facebook post claimed: ""4,255 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, were scanned multiple times"" and ""3,390 went to Biden."" Our rating: False. Some 200 ballots initially were double-counted. But the double-count, once identified, didn’t change the official result of Biden defeating Trump in Georgia, and there’s no evidence of thousands of double-counts. An article stated: ""Records suggest more than 100 batches of absentee ballots in Fulton County could be missing."" Our rating: False. There is no evidence of batches of missing absentee ballots. The claim in a viral image was that ""132,000 ballots in Fulton County, Ga., have been identified as likely ineligible,"" and Trump might win Georgia as a result. Our rating: False. The claim appeared to be based on a pollster’s own queries of voter files, with no indication that he attempted to verify the legitimacy of his claim with election officials.  Biden won more votes than Trump in what local, state and federal officials affirmed was a free and fair election. Recounts didn’t change the outcome. States certified their results. Judges in courtrooms across the country rejected dozens of lawsuits seeking to overturn the election on Trump’s behalf. The nation’s electors cast their votes and sealed Biden’s victory. Nothing has happened to change the results in Arizona and Georgia.

No evidence of 45,000 deaths from COVID-19 vaccines
","America’s Frontline Doctors, a group known for its false and misleading claims about the pandemic, first made headlines in 2020 when its viral video about hydroxychloroquine got millions of views and was shared by President Donald Trump and Madonna. Now the group is back in the news with a lawsuit that includes a new claim.  ""45,000 confirmed dead from the COVID-19 shots within three days… and they’ve covered it up,"" said a viral Instagram post that cited the lawsuit. The claim was shared in other posts, too.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The number of deaths appears to have been fabricated by an unidentified woman, who did not reveal her method for calculating it.  The lawsuit says whistleblower Jane Doe — who it says is not identified by her real name because of concerns about personal safety and losing her job — is ""a computer programmer with subject matter expertise in the healthcare data analytics field, and access to Medicare and Medicaid data maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."" The lawsuit and an addendum say that in order to calculate her estimate of deaths, Doe examined data from the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and compared it with medical claims related to vaccines and patient deaths from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The lawsuit says Doe determined that ""the number of deaths occurring with (sic) 3 days of injection with the Vaccines exceeds those reported by VAERS by a factor of at least 5."" It does not explain her method of calculation or how she arrived at that conclusion.  The lawsuit and the woman’s calculations do not acknowledge the fact that reporting a death in VAERS does not prove that a person died as a result of receiving a vaccine. VAERS is an open system that contains reports that can be submitted by anyone and are not verified.  The woman used the figure of 9,048 deaths as a starting point for her calculations, according to the lawsuit. That was how many deaths associated with the vaccine had been reported to VAERS as of July 9, the lawsuit asserts. The number appears to be inaccurate, though, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that through July 19, VAERS received 6,207 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.  And even though the agency has received more than 6,000 reports of death to its database, ""a review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" according to the CDC.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of America’s Frontline Doctors. The group’s 2020 viral video falsely claimed that the coronavirus has a cure and also made misleading claims about state hydroxychloroquine restrictions, coronavirus case numbers and the impact of nationwide shutdown orders. Dr. Simone Gold, a founder of the group, has made other false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines.  An Instagram post claimed, ""45,000 confirmed dead from the COVID-19 shots within three days… and they’ve covered it up.""  The number tracks back to a woman who did not reveal her method for calculating the figure and who has not been publicly identified. She based her calculations on reports of deaths in VAERS, according to a lawsuit. But the number does not align with data contained in VAERS — and even the reports of death entered into that system do not prove that those people died as a result of receiving a vaccine. VAERS is an open system that contains reports that can be submitted by anyone and are not verified.  Finally, the claim was part of a lawsuit by America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that has peddled many false and conspiratorial claims about COVID-19 and vaccines.

Scott falsely accuses GOP of defunding police
","In last fall’s campaigns, Republicans thundered often inaccurate charges that Democrats wanted to defund police departments. U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., is flipping the script and saying that all congressional Republicans voted to defund police this year when they opposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. ""Every Republican in Congress voted to defund police when they voted against the American Rescue Plan,"" Scott tweeted on July 12.  Scott represents Virginia’s 3rd congressional district, stretching from Norfolk and parts of Chesapeake north through Newport News and west through Franklin.  His claim, echoing a Democratic talking point, melts under scrutiny. Here’s why. The Facts The term ""defunding police'' arose after the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Many advocates say it does not mean abolishing police, but rather reallocating some of the money and the duties that have traditionally been handled by police departments. For example, instead of dispatching police for routine calls involving drug abuse or mental health issues, advocates say it would be better to send officials from social service departments who have training in treating people with those problems. Some of the funds going to police, they say, would be better spent treating mental illness and addiction. Theoretically, that would allow police to put more focus on violent crime. The defund police movement became an attack line for Republicans in 2020, and many Democrats, including President Joe Biden, repeatedly disassociated themselves from it. Moderate Democrats, including Sen. Mark Warner and Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, said progressives’ calls for defunding police were a large reason congressional Democrats didn’t win as many seats as expected last fall. The American Rescue Plan passed Congress in March 2021 with no Republican support. The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package provides aid to individuals, small businesses, nonprofits and the tourism industry. Included in that amount is $350 billion to help state, local and tribal governments recoup revenues they lost because of the coronavirus crisis. The law gives governments choices for using the money, including providing ""premium pay to essential workers or provid(ing) grants to employers of essential workers during the COVID-19 emergency."" In other words, the law does not require governments to spend the aid on essential workers such as police, teachers or medical technicians; it gives them the option to. When lawmakers voted on the bill, there was no guarantee that localities would funnel some of the money to police departments. And the bill did not cut funding to any department. So a vote against the bill giving the states and localities a one-time injection of extra cash was not tantamount to a vote to defund police. Republican leaders never mentioned police funding in their list of reasons for voting against the bill. They criticized the cost of the package, charged that it was filled with Democratic pet projects, and said only a small portion of the money was specifically designated for spending on the coronavirus vaccines. Scott’s explanation We asked Scott’s office to back up his statement. Austin Barbera, his press secretary, wrote in an email that the act ""was intended to replace lost revenue during the pandemic and to continue to keep emergency services and cops on the job – among other things."" Barbera sent an NBC article noting that communities in at least 10 congressional districts represented by Republicans who opposed the bill are using some of its relief funds to help their police departments.  He also noted that House Republicans unanimously voted against a separate, $1.9 billion bill to secure the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection. The measure passed the House on a 219-212 vote and is pending in the Senate. Among other things, it would cover costs the Capitol Police and other security forces incurred in quelling the riot. ""These are just two examples of how House Republicans have all voted against funding the police just this year,"" Barbera said. It should be pointed out, however, that the bill would offer one-time supplements to the security forces and pay for a long list of capital improvements. Opposing the bill does not rise to a vote to take away existing funding. Finally, we should note that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Cedric Richmond, a senior White House adviser, have also accused Republicans of defunding police by opposing the stimulus plan.  Our ruling  Scott tweeted, ""Every Republican in Congress voted to defund the police when they voted against the American Rescue Plan."" The $1.9 trillion stimulus dedicates $350 billion to compensating state, local and tribal governments for lost revenues during the coronavirus crisis. The law gives the governments wide flexibility in using the money, and one option is to spend it on essential workers or their departments.  But the bill never guaranteed that the money would go to essential workers — including police and their departments — when Republicans voted against it. And there’s a huge difference between voting against a possible one-time cash injection into police departments and cutting their existing funding, as Scott implied. We rate Scott’s statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AE7680>],/factchecks/2021/jul/22/bobby-scott/scott-falsely-accuses-gop-defunding-police/

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s well established in the United States that the COVID-19 vaccines, while not 100% effective in preventing the disease, have saved lives: A report published July 7 by the Commonwealth Fund found that without a vaccination program, there would have been approximately 279,000 additional U.S. deaths by the end of June 2021. More than 609,000 people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19. The Associated Press reported that only about 150 of the more than 18,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people, according to its analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That translates to about 0.8%, meaning 99.2% of the deaths were among people who were not fully vaccinated. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said July 1 that preliminary data from a collection of states over the last six months suggest 99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in these states have occurred in unvaccinated people.  The federal government bought vaccines from the vaccine manufacturers, and Congress mandated that the vaccines be provided free to all people living in the U.S. in an attempt to reach ""population immunity"" — to make it harder for the disease to spread.  According to the most recent Congressional Research Service report, as of March 31, the federal contracts for the vaccines that have received emergency use authorization were worth roughly $6 billion for Moderna, $5 billion for Pfizer-BioNTech and $1.5 billion for Johnson & Johnson.  Vaccine providers signed agreements with the federal government not to charge patients; they can seek reimbursement of their costs through Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance. Federal funds reimburse health care providers for administering the vaccines to people who don’t have health insurance. With regard to insulin, rising prices are a problem for the millions of Americans who rely on the medication to manage their diabetes. The high costs have been driven largely by the business practices of manufacturers, health plans and pharmacy benefit managers, PolitiFact reported.

Marjorie Taylor Greene says HIPAA shields her from vaccination questions. It doesn’t.
","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has been an outspoken critic of vaccines and masks to stop the spread of COVID-19. After she tweeted that the disease was a threat only to people who are obese or over 65 — very inaccurate medical guidance — Twitter banned her for 12 hours. Greene held a news conference and was promptly asked if she herself was vaccinated. ""Your first question is a violation of my HIPAA rights,"" Greene said July 20. ""You see, with HIPAA rights, we don’t have to reveal our medical records, and that also involves our vaccine records."" HIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and it contains rules governing the privacy of medical information.  But the law has no bearing on whether Greene can be asked about her medical history, according to both legal experts and official HIPAA guidelines. Whether she answers is a matter of personal choice, not the law. The U.S. Health and Human Service Department summarizes HIPAA as setting ""rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information."" This mainly targets insurance companies and health care providers, which are among the parties the law calls ""covered entities."" These entities can’t share your health records without your permission. If they do, they face stiff penalties.  Notably, employers are not on the list of covered entities. Greene described HIPAA as though it conferred a special protection against being asked about her medical history. Mark Rothstein, a University of Louisville law professor specializing in HIPAA, said Greene is mistaken. ""It is not a general shield that permits individuals to avoid disclosing their own health information,"" Rothstein said. ""Individuals often must disclose their health information, or authorize the disclosure by a HIPAA covered entity, when applying for employment, life insurance, etc.,"" Rothstein said. ""The individual does not have to release the health information, but then they may not be hired or offered insurance."" On the specific matter of vaccination status, employers are free to ask workers if they have gotten the shot. That means any member of the public, including the media, can ask the question of a government official who works for them. ""That is not a HIPAA violation, and employees may decide whether to provide that information to their employer,"" the HHS said. Greene’s director of communications, Nick Dyer, told us, ""Congresswoman Greene’s medical records, including her vaccination status, are none of the media’s business."" Greene said questions from reporters about whether she’s been vaccinated violate her HIPAA rights.  That’s not true. HIPAA gives people the right to control how hospitals and insurance companies share their medical records, but it gives no blanket protection against being asked health questions, or having to answer them.  Employers may ask employees if they are vaccinated, without running afoul of HIPAA, according to federal guidelines.  Greene can sidestep the question as a matter of personal choice, but not because of HIPAA.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF1500>],/factchecks/2021/jul/21/marjorie-taylor-greene/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-hipaa-shields-her-vacc/

No, Canada isn’t banning pilots from flying if they get a COVID-19 vaccine
","On July 19, Canada announced that fully vaccinated Americans could resume visiting the country beginning Aug. 9. So it seems odd that the government would prohibit vaccinated pilots from flying, but that’s what a recent blog post claims.  ""Canada prohibits all vaxxed pilots from flying,"" reads a July 11 headline of a post on a website called ""Alt News.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post includes a screenshot of a page about COVID-19 vaccines on the website of Transport Canada, the country’s transportation department. The page said in part: ""Transport Canada Civil Aviation Medicine does not restrict or limit aviators from taking vaccines that have been approved by Health Canada. Transport Canada (TC) Civil Aviation Medicine (CAM) does not impose grounding periods for aviators who wish to take vaccines approved by Health Canada."" It also said: ""While TC CAM places no restrictions or limitations on vaccines approved by Health Canada, it remains the general position of TC CAM that participation in medical trials is not considered compatible with aviation medical certification."" The blog post claims that because ""the corona vax is a ‘medical trial,’"" COVID-19 vaccinations ""are ruled to ground all pilots.""  But that misstates facts.  Transport Canada said pilots wouldn’t be restricted if they took vaccines approved by Health Canada, the country’s health department.  According to Health Canada’s website, it has received 21 applications for drug and vaccine authorizations related to COVID-19. Several vaccines have been authorized for use in Canada, including the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Others, such as one from a company called Novavax, are still under review.  Transport Canada did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s questions about the post, but as of July 21, its website no longer included the language about medical trials that was highlighted in the post.  The site now says, ""COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved by Health Canada (Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson)) are considered compatible with Transport Canada Aviation Medical Certification."" The site still says the department doesn’t ground pilots who wish to take those vaccines.  The earlier wording on the site about medical trials was in response to pilots asking if they could take part in vaccine trials Health Canada had organized before some vaccines were approved for general use in the country, a spokesperson for Transport Canada told AFP.  ""Now that Health Canada has approved the vaccines, the comment regarding medical trials is less relevant and we have elected to remove that statement,"" the spokesperson said to AFP.

Old Obama-era letter edited to take aim at Biden
","A long letter critical of AARP, the nonpartisan organization that lobbies on behalf of Americans who are 50 and older, is circulating on social media and takes aim at President Joe Biden.  It’s addressed to Barry Rand, who is described as the executive director of AARP. But Rand retired in 2014, and he died in 2018.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A version of this letter, signed by Walt and Cyndy Miller in South Carolina, has been online since 2009, when Rand was the CEO of AARP. Snopes investigated its origins back then and confirmed with Cyndy Miller that she did write the letter to Rand. It was in response to a letter they had received encouraging them to renew their lapsed membership. According to the letter that appears in the Snopes fact-check, the Millers said that ""AARP gave us a sense of belonging which we no longer enjoy.""  ""The Socialist politics practiced by the Obama administration and empowered by AARP serves only to raise the blood pressure my medical insurance strives to contain,"" the original letter went on to say. But the version that is being shared on Facebook now has been edited and embellished. It criticizes the ""Socialist politics practiced by the Biden Regime"" and  refers to ""illegal perpetrators"" and ""amnesty (aka-make voters out of the foreign lawbreakers so they can vote to continue the government’s free handouts).""   While much of this letter is the same as the Millers’ version, it is being shared as if it’s a new attack on Biden’s policies. In reality, it was written more than a decade ago, when its authors were frustrated with then-President Barack Obama’s administration.  Biden, of course, served in that administration as vice president, but this message has been edited and altered in the years since to mislead readers into believing it is current. It’s not. We rate this post Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A48F8C0>],/factchecks/2021/jul/21/facebook-posts/old-obama-era-letter-edited-take-aim-biden/
