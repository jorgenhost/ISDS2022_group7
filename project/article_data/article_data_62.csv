No, the alkaline diet doesn’t cure cancer
","Anyone confronting a cancer diagnosis is eager to find information that might help their prognosis. But the internet can be a tricky resource, with some less-than-accurate advice for people desperate for ways to stay healthy. A recent Facebook post falls into that misleading category, claiming that ""alkaline foods"" can heal a number of ailments, as vague as pain as serious as cancer. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The so-called alkaline diet sometimes comes up in connection with cancer treatment and prevention strategies. It’s based on the theory that some foods cause your body to produce more acid, which is harmful.  Because some studies have shown that cancer cells thrive in highly acidic environments, the idea behind this diet is that consuming certain foods and drinks can change your body’s acid level, making it inhospitable for cancer.  But there are a couple big catches.  First, according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center, the studies that suggest acidic environments help cancer cells grow relied on cells in a dish — ""they do not represent the complex nature of how tumors behave in the human body.""  Second, ""there’s no way the foods you eat can alter the pH level of your blood,"" senior clinical dietitian Maria Petzel says on the center’s website.  UC San Diego Health nutrition expert Traci Roberts said on the university’s website that the lungs and kidneys are largely responsible for controlling the pH levels of our blood. What that all means is that while the diet can improve your overall health, and even help lower your cancer risk — it encourages healthy eating like consuming more vegetables and fruits, drinking lots of water and cutting back sugar, alcohol, meat and processed foods — it won’t heal your body of cancer, as the post claims.    There’s no one diet or food that can cure cancer, according to MD Anderson. But what you eat can affect how you feel with or without a cancer diagnosis.  We rate the claim that an alkaline diet can cure cancer False.",/factchecks/2022/apr/28/facebook-posts/no-alkaline-diet-doesnt-cure-cancer/

Conspiracy theories about Disney abound after Florida law controversy
","Myths and conspiracy theories about Walt Disney and his namesake Disneyland have long abounded on the internet, but they’ve heated up recently since the Disney company’s chief executive criticized a Florida law that curbs classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity.  Among other claims about ""Walt Disney the dark occultist"" and ""Disney’s magical Kingdom,"" a recent Facebook post said that ""Disneyland estates have been used for MK-ULTRA mind control, human trafficking, occult rituals, and parading sexual deviants."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While Disney biographer Neal Gabler once said ""the truth about Walt Disney seems much more complicated and nuanced than either his enemies or supporters would have you believe,"" we couldn’t find credible evidence that Disney is using its theme parks for MK-Ultra, a Cold War-era CIA mind control program, human trafficking, occult rituals, or sexual deviancy.  In March, news broke that four Disney employees were among 108 people arrested in connection with an undercover human trafficking operation in Florida. One of those employees is accused of sending inappropriate pictures of himself and messages to an undercover detective posing as a 14-year-old girl, and two others were charged with prostitution. But there was no indication these alleged crimes occurred at Disney resorts.  We’ve previously fact-checked and found false the claim that Disney CEO Bob Chapek was arrested for human trafficking.  Under scrutiny, these theories are just that.

Attack ad twists JD Vance’s words on racism and Trump voters
","Of the five Ohio Republicans hoping to be their party’s nominee for U.S. Senator, four openly angled for the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. Trump picked ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author and venture capitalist J.D. Vance. Less than a week before the May 3 primary, Club for Growth Action, a super PAC backing one of Vance’s competitors Josh Mandel, ran an ad that said Trump got it wrong with Vance.  Here’s the transcript: Vance on video: The elites were right about Donald Trump, right. I'm a never Trump guy. Male actor: Has Trump seen this? Newscast clip: President Trump tweeting a surprise endorsement of Mitt Romney for his run for … Female actor 1: How'd that turn out?  Male actor: Look, I love Trump, but he's getting it wrong with J.D. Vance, too.  Vance on video: I might have to vote for Hillary Clinton.  Vance on video: People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons. Male actor: Where does he get off saying that? Female actor 2: We've got our own eyes in our own ears. Female actor 1: J.D. Vance is a fraud. The clip that caught our ear was of Vance saying, ""People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons."" There’s an obvious video edit in that section, and we wanted to see what the ad left out. Turns out, it was a deceptive edit that changed the meaning of Vance’s words. The video comes from an on-stage discussion with Vance in 2017 at the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics. The theme was America in the Trump era, and it’s worthwhile to see both how the interviewer teed up his question, and how Vance answered it. ""Where do you think race played into all this?"" the interviewer asked. ""Because I think the sort of myth is that all these Trump supporters are vehement racists and anti-immigrant. And so where do you think it played in?"" ""Race definitely played a role in the 2016 election,"" Vance said. ""I think that race will always play a role in our country. It's just sort of a constant fact of American life. ""And definitely some people who voted for Trump were racists, and they voted for him for racist reasons. I always resist the idea that the real thing driving most Trump voters was racial anxiety or racial animus, partially because I didn't see it."" Vance goes on to say that the primary reason most people voted for Trump was his focus on jobs. ""That was the core thesis of Trump's entire argument,"" Vance said. ""And so it strikes me as a little bizarre to chalk it up to sort of racial animus. Because, one, the country is less racist now than it was 15 years ago. And we weren't electing Donald Trump 15 years ago. And two, that wasn't the core part of his message, and that wasn't what a lot of his voters were really connecting with."" The Club for Growth attack ad made small but telling edits in Vance’s words. Someone watching the ad heard, ""People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons."" The full version was, ""Definitely some people who voted for Trump were racists, and they voted for him for racist reasons. I always resist the idea that the real thing driving most Trump voters was racial anxiety or racial animus."" First, the ad cut his first word, ""some."" That made it sound like Vance was talking about all Trump voters. The next edit is subtle. It deletes ""were racists, and they."" This makes the statement more blunt. But the most misleading edit was dropping Vance’s very next sentence: ""I always resist the idea that the real thing driving most Trump voters was racial anxiety or racial animus."" Club for Growth vice president for communication Joe Kildea rejected the idea that the edits changed Vance’s meaning. A Club for Growth Action ad said Vance had said, ""People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons."" In the full interview from which those words were drawn, Vance allowed that some people voted for Trump for racist reasons, but he said most people voted for Trump for his policies on jobs. Vance rejected the idea that racism played much of a role in Trump’s win. The edited version of Vance’s words gave a very different spin than what he actually expressed.

Fact-checking claim about the Red Cross and blood sold to hospitals
","Regular blood donors probably don’t think twice when they receive texts or calls from the American Red Cross encouraging another donation, but they may raise their eyebrows at claims on social media that suggest the Red Cross is making a profit off those donations. ""Today I learned the Red Cross sells your donated blood to hospitals for $150 and then that hospital charges you thousands for a blood transfusion,"" read a screenshot of a tweet shared on Facebook. ""I hate it here."" The April 18 post about the nonprofit was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Red Cross sells donated blood to hospitals, but the fees the Red Cross charges hospitals are used to recover the costs related to the blood collection, said Emily Osment, a Red Cross spokesperson. ""The Red Cross charges hospitals and plasma manufacturers the costs associated with the recruitment and screening of potential donors, the collection of blood by trained staff, the processing and testing of each unit of blood in state-of-the-art laboratories and the labeling, storage and distribution of blood components,"" she said. Osment did not confirm whether the Red Cross sells blood to hospitals for $150, as the social media posts claimed.  Dr. Claudia Cohn, the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies’ chief medical officer, said hospitals pay centers that collect blood, such as the Red Cross, based on private contracts.  In 2019, hospitals paid, on average, $215 per unit of red blood cells, according to data from the 2019 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey, which asked community-based blood collection centers and hospitals about blood donors, donations and the use of donated blood.  Ge Bai, a Johns Hopkins University health policy and management and accounting professor, said the exact price a hospital pays the Red Cross for a unit of donated blood ""depends on the price negotiated between a specific hospital and Red Cross.""  ""In order to stay financially sustainable, Red Cross cannot afford to lose money when selling blood to hospitals,"" she said. Donated blood is rarely offered to hospitals for free, she said. The price that blood collection centers charge hospitals also varies across cities and states. Labor costs and office space rents are higher on the coasts, for example, and those costs get passed on to the hospitals, Slate reported in 2006. The Red Cross says the average red blood cell transfusion is about three units of blood.  Cohn said that for hospitals, the cost of a transfusion reflects the expenses of procuring the blood itself and the costs for the labor, equipment, laboratory tests and subspecialized medical services required to administer blood to patients. Bai said that blood storage and the overhead costs of the hospital also influence the cost of a blood transfusion. Ultimately, Cohn said, for a routine blood transfusion a hospital could charge a patient approximately between $1,000 and $3,500, ""depending on the specific medical needs of a patient."" Yale Global Health Review in 2016 reported that for some organ transplant recipients, the charge for blood transfusions can exceed $3,800. Johns Hopkins Hospital in 2017 estimated that the average charge to patients for its blood transfusion service was about $3,671. These fees don’t necessarily mean that patients will pay thousands of dollars for a blood transfusion. ""For publicly insured patients, the price is statutorily determined and hospitals cannot change it,"" Bai said. ""For privately insured patients, the price is negotiated between the hospital and the patient’s insurance plan."" For uninsured patients, George Washington University Hospital’s patient cost estimator indicated a patient would likely be charged about $1,269 for a blood transfusion — although they’re more likely to pay $508 out-of-pocket after a ""self-pay"" discount. A ""self-pay"" discount often refers to the price a patient without insurance is asked to pay for common outpatient procedures, and it can be lower than the price negotiated by insurance companies.  A Facebook post claimed that ""the Red Cross sells your donated blood to hospitals for $150 and then that hospital charges you thousands for a blood transfusion."" The Red Cross did not confirm to PolitiFact whether it charges hospitals $150 for blood it has collected from donors. The nonprofit charges hospitals for the blood so that it can cover the collection costs. In 2019, hospitals paid blood collection centers about $215 per unit of red blood cells. What hospitals charge patients for transfusions varies, but that figure can be in the thousands of dollars. What patients end up paying out of pocket can vary, depending on their health insurance plans and insurance status. The post isn’t that far off in terms of dollar amounts, but needs clarification and context.

Claims that Oprah condones pedophilia take her comments out of context
","A recent Facebook post, which describes talk show host Oprah Winfrey as a ""satanic death cult high priestess,"" claims that she condones and promotes ""pedophilia and sex trafficking.""  As evidence, the post points to a TikTok that opens with a clip that shows Winfrey describing the confusing point of view of a seven-year-old child being physically molested and manipulated by their molester. ""Even if you don’t have a name for what that is, it feels good,"" Winfrey said, ""And when I first said this years ago people were like, ‘you're crazy,’ because everyone wants to believe that it’s like sexual assault and you’re being thrown up against a wall and you’re being raped, and I have said for years if the abuser is any good, you won’t even know it’s happening.""  The TikTok video was shared on Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Winfrey’s comments are authentic, but they’ve been taken out of context. She wasn’t condoning or promoting the sexual assault of children — she was condeming it, and discussing how some children may not even realize they were being abused until years later because they were groomed by their abusers. She made the comments during a 2019 HBO special called ""After Neverland,"" in which she interviewed Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who accused singer Michael Jackson of sexually assaulting them as children. (Jackson’s estate has denied the allegations.)  Winfrey had previously said something similar when she talked to People magazine about being sexually abused when she was a child.  ""It happened to me at 8, and then 10, and then 11, and then 12, 13, 14,"" she said. ""You don’t have the language to begin to explain what’s happening to you. That’s why you feel you’re not going to be believed. And if the abuser, the molester, is any good, they will make you feel that you are complicit, that you were part of it. That’s what keeps you from telling."" The TikTok goes on to mention João Teixeira de Faria, better known as John of God, a Brazilian man accused in 2018 of sexually abusive behavior at his ""healing center."" Before those allegations emerged, he was the subject of a 2010 profile on Winfrey’s show, and she interviewed him at his center in 2012. In a statement to the New York Times in the wake of the sexual abuse claims involving de Faria, Winfrey said: ""I went to Brazil in 2012 to tape an episode of ‘Oprah’s Next Chapter’ that explored the controversial healing methods of John of God. The episode aired in 2013. I empathize with the women now coming forward and hope justice is served."" The TikTok also highlights Winfrey’s friendship with entertainment mogul and sex offender Harvey Weinstein. After news about allegations against Weinstein broke in 2017, Oprah wrote on Facebook that she was ""processing the accounts of Harvey Weinstein’s hideous behavior"" and that she hadn’t ""been able to find the words to articulate the magnitude of the situation.""  She also said: ""Thanks to the brave voices we’ve heard this week, many more will now be emboldened to come forward EVERY time this happens.""  But none of this amounts to evidence that Winfrey condones and promotes pedophilia and sex trafficking. To the contrary, she has repeatedly spoken out against it and, as is the case with ""After Neverland,"" sought to raise awareness of its harms.

U.S. Cabinet secretaries did visit Kyiv, despite claims otherwise

Attack on Senate hopeful Oz is wrong that he was spokesman for group that wanted to defund police
","A super PAC that opposes Dr. Mehmet Oz’s run for the U.S. Senate ran two TV ads portraying Oz as a liberal.   One of the ads claims that Oz ""was a spokesman for a group who wanted to defund the police."" The Pennsylvania Conservative Fund’s attack distorts the facts.  The attack ads cite California Endowment, a health-focused foundation, and a July 2021 Philanthrophy.com article about foundations pushing efforts to overhaul police departments in the wake of the May 25, 2020, police murder of George Floyd. California Endowment is one of those organizations supporting changes to police departments. Oz appeared in an ad for California Endowment — but that was in 2010 and for an issue related to health care, not about policing. Pennsylvania Conservative Fund is a super PAC formed to oppose Oz’s campaign. Super PACs can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to advocate for or against candidates. From Jan. 1 through March 31 the fund raised $3.5 million and spent $3.2 million, according to the Federal Election Commission. All the expenditures were in opposition to Oz. The expenditures put the fund among the top eight super PAC spenders in the 2022 cycle, according to the nonprofit Open Secrets. Pennsylvania Conservative Fund doesn’t have a website. It lists its physical address and email address with the commission as those for a campaign finance consulting company in Athens, Ga.  We messaged that email address but didn’t get a reply. The two ads list footnotes indicating sources for the four parts of its claim.  Oz in 2010 appeared in an ad sponsored by California Endowment that promoted the Affordable Care Act, signed into law that year by President Barack Obama.   ""The new health care law has so much in it that can help Californians get better and more affordable health care,"" Oz said in the ad, urging viewers to go to the endowment’s website for more information. The ad had nothing to do with ""defunding the police."" Oz’s involvement with the California Endowment was limited to that one ad; he did not work directly for the group. Oz was never hired as a spokesperson for California Endowment, said Sarah Reyes, a spokesperson for the endowment. Oz’s campaign also told PolitiFact that Oz was not a spokesperson for the group. The meaning of ""defund the police"" varies. Following Floyd’s death, some protesters called for eliminating police departments entirely, while others wanted to reexamine the functions of police departments and redirect some of their funding to other services. Oz is campaigning against defunding the police, saying it ""doesn’t make any sense at all."" Oz is ""a strong supporter of our law enforcement and will give them a powerful voice in Washington,"" his campaign website says. ""He believes our law enforcement has a hard enough job on the streets and that they shouldn’t have to fend off calls to ‘defund’ them from radicals and the extreme left."" His website also says Oz will support efforts to give police the resources they need and opposes ""anti-law"" proposals, citing as an example ""cashless bail."" The Philanthropy.com article from 2021 reported on California Endowment giving $5 million in grants to ""Black-led organizations working on law-enforcement issues."" Those grants were part of a 10-year, $225 million pledge by California Endowment to support racial justice, the article said.  California Endowment president Robert Ross said in the article: ""We need to have better health services, more behavioral-health services, more substance-abuse treatment, more job training and housing support, and fewer jails and police on the street. But that’s not going to happen overnight."" Asked whether the endowment supports defunding police, Reyes said the endowment ""believes that prevention and healing are a key part of the justice system and need to be prioritized"" to allow young people ""to heal and move forward"" in a productive manner. ""Research shows that enforcement alone does not bring down crime,"" she said. Reyes told FactCheck.org that as a private foundation, California Endowment is ""prohibited from taking a position on any issue and thus we don’t take a stand on ‘defunding the police’ or any other issue"" and that ""prevention must be a part of the discussion in order to prevent young people from going on the prison pipeline."" The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and decided not to seek re-election.  Besides Oz, the major Republican candidates are commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate developer Jeff Bartos, Philadelphia attorney George Bochetto, former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick and Carla Sands, who served as former President Donald Trump's ambassador to Denmark.  The leading Democratic candidates are Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb. The primaries are May 17. Overall, the Nov. 8 general election race is rated as a toss-up and as ""tilts Republican."" The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. Pennsylvania Conservative Fund claimed that Oz ""was a spokesman for a group who wanted to defund the police."" This is not accurate. The claim is tied to a group called California Endowment. Oz did one ad sponsored by the group, but it was to promote the Affordable Care Act in 2010, not in favor of defunding the police. Oz’s involvement was limited to that one ad; he did not work directly for the California Endowment. California Endowment has not endorsed defunding the police, but its president has advocated for transferring resources from police to other services. Regardless of the organization’s stance on police funding, the ad in which Oz appeared was unrelated to this issue. We rate the claim False.

No, this photo of intact windows in Bucha doesn’t prove the war in Ukraine is a hoax
","An image of overturned cars in front of what looks like a building is spreading online as evidence that the war in Ukraine is a hoax.  ""I want to buy Ukrainian windows,"" text under the image says. ""I would like to place an order for these high quality super tough windows from Ukraine, that remained intact and unmarked after the explosion of a Russian bomb that turned over all these cars.

There, he wrote: ""Ukrainian soldier walks with a group of kids next to destroyed cars."" A blast radius is not infinite — the damage stops somewhere — but there’s evidence that these cars were destroyed by Russian military forces on the ground in Bucha, not by an explosion. Photographer Emanuele Satolli, who took photos at the same scene pictured in the Instagram post, told the Greek fact-checking outlet Ellinika Hoaxes that he ""met several citizens and everyone told me that the cars had been overturned by Russian tanks.""

Walt Disney World was not tax-exempt in Florida, contrary to social media claims
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill to repeal a decades-old agreement that allowed the Walt Disney Company to operate as an independent government around its 25,000-acre theme park complex. The April 22 move came after Disney, the state’s largest employer, voiced opposition to legislation barring classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, which could affect students in older grades as well.  It is unclear whether Florida’s actions could have financial implications for Disney that stretch beyond its Orlando-area theme parks. Still, social media users were quick to make conclusions.  We follow the facts and share what we learn so you can make your own decisions. Support our mission today.  ""DeSantis erases Disney’s tax exempt law. Will cost Disney $200 Mil in taxes. Per year,"" read an April 21 caption alongside a photoshopped image of DeSantis standing in front of a trash can with Mickey and Minnie Mouse’s heads peeking out. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The grammatically problematic statement propped up many inaccuracies about the impact of the new law, and it mischaracterized the privileges the tax district originally awarded Disney.  Disney did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.  Reedy Creek, a special taxing district for the Walt Disney World Resort that acted with the authority of a county government, was created in 1967 to lure the entertainment giant to Orlando.  Under the agreement, Disney was responsible for building and maintaining municipal services like power, roads, and fire protection — which ensured that the residents of Orange and Osceola counties would not have to pay for such services.  Disney's most significant benefit from the arrangement was not financial but rather the autonomy to develop the 25,000 acres it owns in Central Florida without much of the oversight other developers typically have.  Though the deal provided Disney with several privileges, it did not make the theme park tax-exempt. Disney World contributed more than $780 million in state and local taxes in fiscal year 2021, according to a company disclosure. The Facebook post’s claim that Disney will now have to pay $200 million in taxes annually appears to be based on the false premise that Disney wasn’t already paying taxes. The $200 million figure seems to be derived from state Rep. Spencer Roach, a Republican from North Fort Myers. He told NBC News that Disney had avoided around $200 million in property taxes that surrounding counties could have collected.   The article noted that Roach’s Democratic colleagues and officials in Central Florida questioned his math and the claim that Disney has not paid property taxes.  Roach did not respond to our request for comment. ""There’s this perception that Reedy Creek somehow gave Disney property tax breaks,"" said Scott Randolph, Orange County’s tax collector. ""It does not do that."" Under the new law, Disney’s deal with Florida ends June 1, 2023. The dissolution of the Reedy Creek district will likely have financial consequences for Orange and Osceola counties unless officials take future action, according to the state Senate’s financial impact analysis. For example, the district’s bond debt could be transferred to those counties, the analysis said. Fitch Ratings, a credit rating provider, estimates that debt is $1 billion. The new law might also make those counties responsible for services previously covered by the company, like fixing roads or providing law enforcement. Disney paid $105 million for those services, according to tax filings submitted to Florida’s Department of Revenue.  ""The bill will have an indeterminate fiscal impact on residents and businesses currently served by a special district dissolved by the bill,"" the Senate analysis said. ""Such residents and businesses may experience a change in services previously provided by the special district and related assessments and taxes imposed."" At a news conference, DeSantis rebuffed these concerns. He said he has ""everything thought out,"" alluding to future legislation. A Facebook post said DeSantis ""erased Disney’s tax exempt law. Will cost Disney $200 Mil in taxes. Per year!"" DeSantis did not ""erase"" any tax-exempt status for Disney. That misconstrues the special taxing district status that is in the process of being removed.  We could not find evidence to substantiate the $200 million tax figure cited in the claim. The financial impact of the legislation on Disney’s tax bill remains unclear.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/apr/27/facebook-posts/walt-disney-world-was-not-tax-exempt-florida-contr/

No, Fox News is not snubbing Mueller’s testimony
","A popular liberal Facebook page claimed Fox News would not be providing live coverage of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony before Congress. But the meme posted by Occupy Democrats, a progressive advocacy group, was based on false information that fooled social media users and TV talking heads alike. ""Fox ‘News’ just announced that they will not air Mueller’s testimony about his report, which they claim ‘exonerates’ Trump,"" said the meme, which was posted to Facebook on July 22. That’s demonstrably false, as Fox News anchor Bret Baier pointed out on Twitter.  A Fox News press release issued earlier that day said Baier and fellow Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum will be leading the network’s live coverage of Mueller’s testimony before both the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee on July 24. Occupy Democrats eventually updated the meme, setting the record straight with a correction in its caption. But the meme had already been shared almost 5,000 times on Facebook. The rumors claiming Fox News would be snubbing Mueller’s testimony are a textbook example of how misinformation spreads online.  It began with a now-deleted July 21 tweet from MSNBC contributor Joyce Vance, who said Fox News was not airing the testimony because President Donald Trump ""is afraid of what will happen if his base gets to hear Mueller’s testimony for themselves."" Hours later, Vance deleted the tweet, saying it was ""intended ironically"" and apologizing for ""unintentionally misinforming people."" But the tweet had already left its mark, having racked up thousands of retweets from social media users, including some with large followings such as author Stephen King. The rumors also made their way to the TV screen, with GOP strategist Rick Wilson telling MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace on July 22 that Fox News would be tuning out. ""Fox isn’t covering the hearings, which should also tell you how scared they are of what could happen on this morning,"" Wilson said. ""It’s going to be a very interesting and consequential moment. They’re apparently not going to take them live. Everybody else is taking them live."" ""Really?"" Wallace replied. Shortly after he got off air, Wilson corrected himself on Twitter, and Wallace retweeted his correction. The next day, former Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards repeated the claim again on MSNBC, only to have anchor Stephanie Ruhle correct her. ""Actually, I don’t believe that’s true, I think they are going to air it,"" Ruhle said. Occupy Democrats did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. A meme from Occupy Democrats said, ""Fox ‘News’ just announced that they will not air Mueller’s testimony about his report."" Fox News announced its plan for airing the testimony live in a July 22 press release. We rate this statement False.

Yes, children at Homestead facility get far less time to call family than federal prisoners
","Children housed at a migrant facility in Homestead, Fla., are crammed in with harsh conditions and rules, and in some respects, are treated worse than prisoners, says a South Florida congresswoman. U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., criticized conditions at the Homestead facility in a July 21 interview with CBS Miami’s Jim DeFede. ""They get 30 minutes over a month to talk to family members,"" said Shalala, who represents a Miami district near Homestead. ""If they were in a prison — a federal prison — they would get 300 minutes.""  Shalala is among South Florida congressional Democrats calling to close the Homestead facility and send the children elsewhere. In reporting our fact-check, we learned that Shalala understated how often children can talk to their families, though she had a point that it is far less than the phone time for federal inmates.   The Homestead temporary shelter for unaccompanied children opened in June 2016, during a migrant surge at the southern U.S. border. It was used through April 2017. Then, it reopened in 2018, and the first new wave of unaccompanied children arrived that March. It is operated by Caliburn International, a private, for-profit company and a contractor of the government. As of July 22, there were approximately 990 children at the shelter. As of mid July, the average length of stay was 36 days. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent us the written policy related to telephone time, which was written during the Obama administration in January 2015.  The policy states that children must be provided the opportunity to make a minimum of two telephone calls per week — at 10 minutes each — to family members and/or sponsors living in the United States and abroad. The children call for free. That adds up to 80 minutes of phone time per month, and not 30 as Shalala said. A spokesman for Shalala said while she misspoke on CBS, Shalala has correctly cited the call limits on the House floor in June and in a press release. Children have told immigration advocates, however, that they don’t get that much time in practice. Some said the calls are limited to between five and seven minutes. Advocates have filed a federal lawsuit against the federal government regarding conditions at Homestead. Federal prisoners, who spend years behind bars, get far more telephone time with relatives. A federal Bureau of Prisons policy states that inmates get 300 minutes per month for telephone calls, with an extra 100 minutes per month in November and December. The maximum amount of time for each phone call is 15 minutes. (The 300 minutes does not include calls to lawyers.) Unlike the calls made by children, prisoners either pay for their phone calls or make collect calls.  Christopher Zoukis, a former prison inmate who is now a consultant to attorneys and prisoners, told us for long-distance calls in the United States, that would add up to about $63 each month for prisoners.  Shalala said children at the Homestead migrant facility ""get 30 minutes over a month to talk to family members. If they were in a prison — a federal prison — they would get 300 minutes."" Shalala misspoke about the number of minutes the children get to speak. It is 10 minutes twice a week, which adds up to 80 minutes a month. The number of minutes stems from a policy written in 2015 during the Obama administration.  The other part of her claim is on point: The children receive less telephone time than federal prisoners, who get 300 minutes a month. Unlike the children, federal prisoners either pay for their calls or call collect.

No, Mexico didn't take 30% of U.S. auto business as Trump claims
","Amid on-again, off-again threats of tariffs and an ongoing border crisis, President Donald Trump has kept the pedal to the metal on one specific claim about the U.S. and Mexico. He says the U.S. has lost 30% of its automobile business to its southern neighbor. He said it on CNBC. He said it on Twitter in May and again in June. And he circled back to it during his latest visit to Wisconsin. ""Mexico, they took 30% of our automobile business, I don’t know if you know that or not,"" Trump said during a June 12, 2019 speech at Derco Aerospace where he touted the pending United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.  ""They have plants the likes of which you’ve never seen before,"" Trump said. ""They took 30% — probably more than that — of our automobile (business). I don’t blame them. I don’t blame anyone. I blame our past leaders."" Trump has pushed for a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA since taking office. The countries have now agreed to a new pact, though it faces hurdles in Congress, especially the Democratic-controlled House. But has the recent trade environment really generated the 30% automotive swing Trump claims? Trump’s reference to the 30% number was fairly vague in Wisconsin, referring only to the ""automotive business."" The White House did not response to requests to clarify the claim or provide supporting evidence. But Trump’s June 10, 2019 reference on CNBC was more specific. ""They took 30% of our automobile companies,"" Trump said on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box."" ""They moved into Mexico. All of the people got fired. They would all move back if they had to pay a 25% tax or tariff."" So we’ll start our fact check there. The Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group that gets some funding from automakers, says no manufacturers have left the U.S. for Mexico as Trump described to CNBC. ""There are no cases that I can name where an automaker closed a plant in the U.S., moved that work, opened a new plant in Mexico, and you can definitely call it a replacement,"" said Bernard Swiecki, assistant director of the center’s industry labor and economics group. Shifts in production are ""almost impossible"" to track anyhow, he said, since automakers regularly move production between plants based on available capacity. Swiecki said major automakers treat their American, Mexican and Canadian operations as one unit and ""move vehicles around that footprint at will."" For example, Ford announced it was moving production of the Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico (though that was later moved to China instead), a move blasted by Trump. But the Michigan plant wasn’t closed — it instead took on production of the new Ranger and Bronco lines. The Focus is now discontinued. ""That plant actually made out big time because it went from one mediocre product to two very successful products,"" Swiecki said. Though no U.S. automakers have outright moved an operation to Mexico, the industry clearly favors our southern neighbor when it comes to new plants. Of the 13 assembly plants announced in North America since 2009, nine went to Mexico and only four to the U.S., Swiecki said. A broader measure of auto manufacturing spending shows the U.S. holding its own, though. From 2012 through this June, automakers announced $92 billion of investments in North America, according to the Center for Automotive Research. The firm tracks announcements of new plants, expansions and infrastructure improvements (acquisitions are not included). The U.S. received 74% of those investments, Mexico 19% and Canada 7%. No such investments have been announced in Mexico since 2017. So Trump’s 30% claim falls short if we focus on the CNBC version that refers to physical movement. But is there any element of the automotive business that has seen such a shift? We compared the two countries on automotive sales, production and employment. SALES — Total sales of new passenger vehicles and light trucks totaled about 17.2 million in the U.S. in 2018, Forbes reported. The U.S. Department of Commerce says Mexico exported about 2.7 million such vehicles to the U.S., meaning Mexican production accounts for about 15% of U.S. sales. That’s up from about 12% five years ago. Our colleagues at the Associated Press leaned on the Mexican import data in a June 11, 2019, fact check that said Trump’s 30% claims on Twitter and CNBC were ""incorrect."" PRODUCTION — Mexico has roughly doubled its automotive production in recent decades, from an average of about 1 million cars per year in the early 2000s to nearly 2 million the last several years, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. Meanwhile, U.S. annual production dropped from about 5 million in the early 2000s to around 3 million the last two years. If you combine U.S. and Mexican auto production, Mexico accounted for 19% of that total in 2000 but 36% now. EMPLOYMENT — Both countries have seen major gains in the number of vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs in recent years. Since 2009, Mexico has grown from about 400,000 auto manufacturing jobs to more than 800,000, according to Mexico NOW, a business magazine. In that same span the number of automotive jobs in the U.S. grew from about 650,000 in 2009 to about 1 million this year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Much of the Mexican production is focused on parts. About 16% of parts used by automakers in U.S. assembly plants come from Mexico, Swiecki said.  Trump said Mexico ""took 30 percent of our automobile business."" Experts say there isn’t one example of an automaker closing a plant in the U.S. in order to open one in Mexico, much less enough to total 30% of anything. And Mexican-built cars still account for only 15% of sales in the U.S. It’s noteworthy that car production has decreased in the U.S. while increasing in Mexico in recent years, and that Mexico has landed the majority of the new vehicle plants built in North America in the last decade. But neither of those trends match Trump’s description in the more detailed CNBC claim, of plants being closed and workers let go in the U.S. as work moves to Mexico.

No, Ocasio-Cortez didn't call Americans garbage, as Donald Trump claims

Trump used the line at a rally in North Carolina and repeated it at a July 19 event to mark the first time a man walked on the moon. On July 23, at a Washington meeting of conservative high school students, he dropped it again. ""She called our country and our people garbage,"" Trump said July 23. White House staffers Hogan Gidley and Stephen Miller stood by the line in interviews on Fox News, as did Fox News hosts Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity.  This mangles what Ocasio-Cortez said.

She had been asked why it took a while for candidates to push for a $15 minimum wage and goals such as the Green New Deal. Ocasio-Cortez answered with a story about a conversation with a Trump voter in her district. ""I'll never forget this one older woman who came to me and said, ‘You know, I always voted Democrat because growing up my dad told me that Democrats are the people that fight for the working man.’ ""  ""And we stopped. And the working man and woman and people is the majority of this country, and so what I think we saw was both parties frankly abdicated their responsibility.  ""No one was fighting for working people who were struggling, and so, as a result, it almost created this opportunity.

So when someone's talking about our core it's like, ‘Oh, this is radical.’ ""  ""But this isn't radical. This is what we've always been.  ""It's just that now we've strayed so far away from what has really made us powerful and just and good and equitable and productive.

Do studies show middle-class families would save $3,000 a year under Medicare for All? Not really
","One of the main fears about Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All plan is that the impact of higher taxes to pay for it will swamp any savings it produces. Sanders dedicated a single speech to parry that and other criticisms of replacing private with government health insurance. ""Medicare for All will fully eliminate insurance premiums — no more premiums, no more deductibles and no more copayments,"" Sanders said at George Washington University July 17. ""Study after study has shown that as a nation we will save substantial sums of money, and the average middle-class families will save $3,000 each and every year on their health care bills."" This caught our eye, because the latest Medicare for All bill is silent about the taxes needed to pay for it. Sanders’ website offers some options, but not a specific proposal, and that’s important. If taxes replace premiums and other health expenses, a straight-forward tax plan would shine a light on who would pay how much.  The Sanders campaign pointed to two studies to back up Sanders’ point, but neither provides solid support for $3,000 in annual savings. • One study from 2016 estimated tax collections based on rates that were replaced by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  • Another study from 2018 applies only to New York state, and never considered the price tag for long-term care, a line item that costs over $26.5 billion. Medicare for All would cover long-term care. • Lastly, Sanders believes a single-payer program would save trillions of dollars in overall health care spending. Credible studies raise questions about that.  American households spend about $980 billion on health care. That includes premiums and anything they paid out of pocket to cover services, deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance. Employers pay another $700 billion. The idea behind Medicare for All is to replace all of that with taxes, with most people coming out ahead. Washington would use tax dollars to pay providers — from hospitals, to drugmakers, to dentists, to nursing homes and more. The theory is that costs would fall dramatically. The drop would come from eliminating insurance company profits, finding greater efficiencies and the government negotiating lower prices. With total healthcare spending of $3.5 trillion, a key debate is whether the single-payer approach could squeeze enough savings to keep taxes for most households lower than what they would spend today. Unlike today, Sanders provided details on how he would pay for this plan in 2016. There would be a 2.2% additional tax on income; higher taxes and a cap on tax deductions on households making over $250,000 a year; higher capital gains taxes, and more. At the time, Citizens for Tax Justice, a group that supports lower taxes on middle- and low-income families and higher taxes on the wealthy, ran an analysis. A significant factor was that since employers would no longer cover a large portion of their workers’ premiums, they would give about half of that back in the form of higher wages.  Bigger paychecks would help defray the cost of the new taxes on workers to pay for the government health plan. Citizens for Tax Justice said the middle 20% of taxpayers — people making $39,000 to $62,000 — would see their net income rise by $3,240. That estimate applies to old tax rules. Tax expert Gordon Mermin with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act changed the tax bills families face today. And the impacts could cut both ways. Some households could see their taxes go up more than before. ""The higher tax rates proposed in 2016 would raise more money now since current law rates are lower,"" Mermin said.  But revenues from the well-to-do might be less, due to the ways the 2017 tax law already limited some deductions for the wealthy. Bottom line: How people at different income levels would fare is unclear. The 2016 analysis reveals less than it once did. ""Taxes are going to vary tremendously across workers,"" said the University of Chicago’s Katherine Baicker. ""On net, some people are going to be much better off, and some people are going to be much worse off — and overall taxes will have to rise substantially.""   Staff at Citizens for Tax Justice told us they no longer do this sort of analysis and the group that took over that work hasn’t analyzed today’s Medicare for All plan. As New York weighed creating its own single-payer plan in 2018, a private foundation commissioned the policy consultants at RAND to estimate the effects. That study found that with a progressive tax plan, ""health care payments would decrease among most residents and would increase among the highest-income residents."" But that finding came with many uncertainties. In some situations, lower-income workers would see their costs go up. If a small percentage of upper-income residents found ways to avoid paying higher taxes, the burden on lower and middle-income people would go up. Total spending on health care about a decade from now could range from 15% less to 12% more. Higher costs would result in lower savings for middle-income families. Importantly, RAND analyst Christine Eibner noted that its estimates omitted long-term care. In New York, government Medicaid payments for nursing home and home care are over $26 billion. The RAND study said if it had included long term care, total health care costs would rise by at least 2%. Lastly, New York is not like every other state, and it’s not a perfect model for the rest of the country. On his website, Sanders refers to a report from University of Massachusetts researchers that found Medicare for All would reduce health care spending for middle-income families substantially — a family making $60,000/year with employer health insurance would save about $1,600. That study included several taxes, including a national sales tax (food, housing and education excluded)  and a wealth tax on assets over $1 million. That study predicted deep reductions in overall health spending, enough to ensure that the tax revenues would cover costs. But analysts at the Urban Institute and at Emory University have warned that Sanders’ past financing plans would not deliver enough money to cover the price tag. Sanders said that multiple studies show that under Medicare for All ""average middle-class families will save $3,000 every year."" The studies don’t back him up. One is based on 2016 numbers that are outdated, especially when it comes to current tax rates. Another deals only with New York state, excluded the high cost of long-term care, and offered a range of possible outcomes. A lot depends on the actual taxes to raise money, and we don’t have a specific proposal from Sanders.

At Trump rally, Bishop tells half the story of McCready and Omar
","President Donald Trump wasn’t the only one trying to score political points off Ilhan Omar during Trump’s rally in Greenville. Trump on Wednesday deepened his feud with Democratic Rep. Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman who came to the United States from Somalia as a child refugee. Trump accused her of being anti-Semitic. At one point during the rally, Trump welcomed Republican NC Sen. Dan Bishop to the stage. And Bishop, who’s running for Congress in North Carolina’s 9th district, took the opportunity to tie his opponent to Omar. Bishop said Dan McCready, his Democratic opponent, accepted a campaign donation from Omar. ""Dan McCready took money from Ilhan Omar,"" Bishop told the crowd. That’s not the whole story. DONATION RETURNED McCready received a $2,000 donation from Omar on Nov. 6. But then, earlier this year, McCready returned that donation. He tweeted about the decision on April 17. ""Some folks are asking why I directed the return of Rep. Omar’s donation. I did this weeks ago because I vigorously disagree with any anti-semitic comments. Since this time, dangerous and hateful attacks have started against her... "" McCready tweeted. ""I condemn in the strongest terms the hateful rhetoric against her, the Muslim community and people of color. Too many have been hurt by our broken politics. We must end hate speech against all people and groups."" OMAR’S COMMENTS McCready at the time didn’t specify which of Omar’s comments made him uncomfortable. But the Los Angeles Times has chronicled some of her controversial statements. Earlier this year, Omar apologized for tweeting in 2012 that ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."" In February, Omar said supporters of Israel were only motivated by money. She tweeted, ""It’s all about the Benjamins, baby!"" and later apologized. REACTION PolitiFact reached out to Bishop’s campaign and asked why Bishop didn’t mention McCready’s decision to return Omar’s donation. Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for his campaign, suggested the action doesn’t make a difference. ""Rep. Omar has a long and well-documented history of anti-Semitic remarks,"" Proud said in an email, referencing the 2012 tweet. ""So (McCready) should have never taken a cent from her in the first place."" McCready spokesman Matt Fried, contacted by PolitiFact Friday, said McCready would rather serve his community than wade into a hostile and unproductive debate. ""It’s clear politicians in Washington have lost touch with the American values that define us as patriots and when they put hate — of any kind — above love for country, we damage this nation to its core,"" Fried said in an email. ""That’s why on Wednesday Dan McCready was in Mint Hill announcing his national service plan and calling on more young Americans to serve their country, through the military like Dan did, or through civilian service like AmeriCorps."" OUR RULING Bishop said McCready ""took money from Ilhan Omar."" Omar did donate to McCready’s campaign last fall. But McCready returned the donation this spring. Bishop didn’t mention the returned money on stage, which could leave some Trump supporters believing McCready supports Omar’s controversial comments. The claim is partly accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

No, this isn’t a photo of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez crying over a parking lot
","On June 24, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez retweeted images that an El Paso photographer took of her at a Texas town on the U.S.-Mexico border last year.  ""Before @AOC hit the national stage & was just a fairly unknown House candidate frm NYC, she took time awy frm her campaign & came dwn to #Tornillo to protest the #tentcity housing migrant children,"" tweeted photographer Ivan Pierre Aguirre, who has been helping cover family separations for the Texas Tribune. ""I made these previously unpublished fotos a yr ago today. #el paso #aoc #onassignment."" Ocasio-Cortez said she would never forget that day.  ""It was the moment I saw with my own eyes that the America I love was becoming a nation that steals refugee children from their parents,& caged them,"" she said, retweeting images of her standing in front of a chain-link fence with a pained look on her face. Critics pounced, posting to social media that the congresswoman was crying over nothing more than a parking lot. Among the stories echoing that sentiment were two shared on Facebook. One was from RT, the Russian government-backed news organization, and another was from conservative news outlet PJ Media, which ran a story with this headline: ""AOC weeps over empty parking lot."" Both Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to Aguirre about the claims Ocasio-Cortez was crying over a parking lot.  Aguirre didn’t know who the then-congressional candidate was when he took the photos, he told PolitiFact. She was among others protesting outside of the tent city erected near El Paso to house undocumented immigrant children.  ""It isn’t a parking lot,"" Aguirre said. ""It’s the road leading to the camp."" In effort to corroborate that claim, we looked at photos and other coverage from that day.  Getty Images photographer Joe Raedle took a picture of the future congresswoman on July 24, 2018, noting the following in his caption of the image: ""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is embraced at the Tornillo-Guadalupe port of entry gate on June 24, 2018 in Tornillo, Texas. She is part of a group protesting the separation of children from their parents after they were caught entering the U.S. under the administration's zero tolerance policy."" Anne Flanagan, senior director and head of external communications of Getty Images, confirmed that, as the caption reads, ""Joe Raedle photographed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the port of entry gate to Tornillo-Guadalupe."" The photo is part of a collection of photos from that day that document the protest. Raedle’s cutline description of a fence near the port of entry matches what other photographers, a reporter and various images depict of the tent facility.  The Tornillo-Guadalupe  toll plaza was where protestors — including Ocasio-Cortez — entered on June 24, 2018, and then ventured on a road that curved to the left, which led to a chain fence that was near shrubs and a wall with a sign for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. One can more easily view the layout of that portion of the Tornillo site in this overhead photo from Getty that was taken three days prior to the June 24 protest: Embed from Getty Images Krantz said that Ocasio-Cortez and other protesters who stood at the fencing were gathered at the wall pictured on the right hand side of the toll plaza, where the crowd is located in the June 21 photo above. They were in the area seen in the upper right of this image, just beyond where the three dark vehicles appear to be parked. If you zoom into that June 21 Getty image, you will see the wall and what appears to be the sign for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Demonstrators weren’t allowed to pass the fence on June 24, Aguirre and Lisa Krantz, a photographer for the San Antonio Express-News, independently told PolitiFact. ""I was there, and it was not an empty parking lot,"" Krantz said. ""It was where the Tornillo camp was set up. There was a large demonstration outside that fence and that camp. The congressmen went inside for a tour."" Krantz also captured Ocasio-Cortez gripping the fence on June 24, 2018, and noted in her caption that Ocasio-Cortez ""holds on to a fence outside the tent city."" In an interview with PolitiFact, Krantz confirmed that Ocasio-Cortez was facing the facility in the photo, not a parking lot. Krantz said she, Ocasio-Cortez and others had passed through the toll plaza before arriving at the fence. Krantz also confirmed the fence in front of Ocasio-Cortez was positioned on a road that led to the facility, and that on either side of the road was a stone wall.  When looking at Aguirre’s images of Ocasio-Cortez, we see what appears to be a wall on the right side of the frame and, visible at the top of some is barbed wire. Krantz reviewed her own pictures from that day and said that the portion of the wall to the right of the frame (which peeks out from Ocasio-Cortez’ shoulder in this image) bore a sign for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  We also see that fencing, signage and wall in detail in a photo of Holocaust survivor Margaret Houffelaar, which was taken by photographer Kisha Bari for Cosmopolitan Magazine as well as in this photo from Getty. (Krantz also took a picture of Houffelaar in front of the same wall.) But was there a parking lot nearby? Krantz said she remembers a small parking lot that was near the toll plaza that wasn’t fenced in, but many people parked under the toll plaza shelter for shade or alongside the road that led to the toll plaza— which is depicted in a photo from Cosmopolitan Magazine. Daniel Borunda, a reporter for the El Paso Times who was at the rally on the same day, told PolitiFact that the tent complex was ""visible in the distance several hundred yards away"" from the fence. Our ruling A viral image of Ocasio-Cortez at a 2018 demonstration at a Texas town on the U.S.-Mexico border includes the caption, ""AOC weeps over empty parking lot."" Photographers at the scene who took photos of Ocasio-Cortez say she was not facing a parking lot. Rather she was just beyond the toll plaza for the Tornillo facility, and she standing on a road that led to the Tornillo tent complex, which was in the line of her gaze, as she stood at the fence. Pictures by other outlets also confirm the location. We rate this claim False. Clarification: Several references to the ""port of entry"" in the original version of this story have been revised to more specifically refer to the toll plaza. The changes do not affect the ruling.",/factchecks/2019/jul/22/viral-image/no-isnt-photo-aoc-crying-over-parking-lot/

Mendoza’s comparison of Indiana and Illinois gasoline taxes veers off course
","During a recent podcast interview, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza defended the doubling of the state excise tax on gasoline by arguing, in part, consumers in Indiana still pay more taxes on gas than in Illinois. Her claim came just after the Illinois tax doubled to 38 cents per gallon, part of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s $45 billion infrastructure improvement plan. The revenue generated by the tax hike is earmarked for road and bridge repairs throughout the state. After the new tax went into effect, news reports stated some residents were crossing state lines to save a few dollars by filling up their tanks in Indiana. Two weeks ago, Chicago Sun-Times podcast host Ben Joravsky asked Mendoza, a Democrat and steadfast supporter of many Pritzker initiatives, about this new phenomenon. Mendoza didn’t vote on the tax hike but voiced her support for it. ""Indiana actually has a higher gas tax than Illinois does even with the increase in taxes,"" Mendoza said in response. ""We used to only pay 19 cents a gallon for taxes here in Illinois on the gas tax, whereas Indiana has been paying 43 cents a gallon for their gas tax. So ours, even at 38 cents, is still less than what Indiana pays today."" Either driving to Indiana for gasoline is a futile and expensive endeavor, or Mendoza performed a feat of statistical gymnastics to defend a controversial tax increase she endorsed. So, we decided to check out the numbers. According to the Illinois Department of Revenue, the Illinois motor fuel tax rate is set at 38 cents per gallon from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. That rate rose from 19 cents per gallon, which had been the state excise tax on gasoline since 1990. Indiana’s excise tax on gasoline is 30 cents per gallon, after a penny increase went into effect July 1. According to Mendoza’s spokesman, Abdon Pallasch, the comptroller was given figures he had gathered from outdated articles that shared the results of a 2018 report published by the American Petroleum Institute (API), which compiled all motor fuel taxes and fees by state, rather than just the excise taxes. Based on those findings, state taxes and fees on gasoline in Indiana totaled 42.9 cents per gallon compared to 37.32 cents per gallon here in Illinois in July 2018. However, the API’s updated numbers for 2019 list the total Illinois gas taxes and fees at 54.98 cents per gallon and the Indiana total at 46.62 cents per gallon. By that measure, gasoline is clearly taxed at higher levels in Illinois. Pallasch acknowledged Mendoza’s office mistakenly used the 37.32 cents per gallon statistic for Illinois even though it represented an outdated number from last year. That led to a faulty analysis in which Mendoza compared the new Illinois excise gasoline tax to an old figure for the overall amount of taxes and fees on gasoline in Indiana. ""After the (Ben Joravsky) Show, I went back and looked at the numbers and realized that it was an inexact comparison,"" Pallasch said. ""She used an apples-to-oranges comparison."" Those overall tax and fee totals detailed by the API consist of a few different components in each state. For Indiana, the 46.62 cents per gallon charge includes the state’s excise tax on gas, a gasoline-use tax calculated monthly according to the average price of a gallon of gas (15.6 cents per gallon for July 2019), and a 1 cent per gallon oil inspection fee. In Illinois, the total number adds a state sales tax of about 15 cents per gallon and nominal fees for underground storage and environmental impacts to the new excise tax of 38 cents. What’s more, many cities and counties around Illinois also levy their own additional sales taxes on gasoline. For example, Chicago residents have to pay both the Cook County sales tax of 1.75% and the city sales tax of 1.25%, which are both on top of the state sales tax rate of 6.25%. Ultimately, state and local taxes on gasoline add up to over 60 cents per gallon in Chicago. On the other hand, according to the Indiana Department of Revenue and other state finance experts, there are no direct local taxes on gasoline anywhere in Indiana. That leaves the total taxes and fees on gas at about 46 cents per gallon throughout the state, at least several cents per gallon lower than any Illinois locality.  Illinois residents are also simply paying more for gasoline than people in Indiana. At a Mobil station in Calumet City, a gallon currently costs $3.45. Just two miles down the road in Hammond, Ind., the price of gasoline is $2.99 per gallon. Mendoza was comparing two different statistical categories. Her number for Illinois only accounted for the state excise tax on gas, while her number for Indiana included all state gas taxes and fees. ""When you use (the 43 cents per gallon) number, you’re including the state’s sales tax on gasoline, and if you want to do that for Indiana, you also have to do that for Illinois, and that bumps Illinois’ tax, when you include that part of the tax, up closer to 55 cents,"" said Richard Auxier, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center research associate. ""If you’re doing the comparison accurately, Illinois’ rate is higher.""  Mendoza said Indiana has a higher gas tax than Illinois does, even after a recent hike. By every government measure we checked, and by acknowledgement from Mendoza’s office itself, the claim is wrong. Illinois residents pay eight cents more in state excise taxes for each gallon of gasoline than residents of Indiana, according to revenue officials in both states. We rate Mendoza’s claim False.

Do State Health Plan changes deny state employees access to care?
","Hospitals have rallied against Republican State Treasurer Dale Folwell’s new health care program, saying it will hurt state employees. In a recent paid advertisement in The News & Observer, the North Carolina Healthcare Association, which lobbies for hospitals and other health-care providers, said the changes coming Jan. 1 ""will DENY North Carolina state employees, retirees, and their families of in-network access to critical healthcare services."" The program, called the Clear Pricing Project, was designed by Folwell to increase transparency and cut spending on the North Carolina State Health Plan. The deadline for health care providers to register for the program was July 1. The State Health Plan covers state employees, teachers and retirees and spends about $3.3 billion a year on its 720,000 members. Most of that money, 80%, comes from taxpayers. A third-party insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, currently administers the State Health Program by paying providers based on negotiated rates that are kept confidential. Folwell’s project would take the power to negotiate rates away from hospitals and set rates based on what Medicare pays providers, plus a 77% markup. Because of this, many hospitals have refused to sign on to the new health-care network created by the project. ""The decision to provide health care to teachers and state employees rests with hospitals and doctors… the State Health Plan is not going to pay bills when it doesn’t know what it’s paying for,"" Folwell said in a statement to The News and Observer. ""If a doctor or hospital goes out of network, it will be that medical provider’s decision not to provide care to state workers at almost twice the reimbursement rate of Medicare."" Proponents of the project say it could save state employees $57 million a year in out-of-pocket costs and premiums and the program $258 million a year in reduced fees. But opposition to the plan made news when the Greensboro News & Record reported that in an email to state leaders dated July 1, Frank Kauder, the assistant director of finance for Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, told state officials to ""burn in hell."" He even went on to attack the Republican Party, saying ""...poor people generally don’t vote for your party, so you want them to die."" Why we’re checking this We check claims that are widely shared or published; are about a topic of concern to many of our readers; can be proven or disproven through facts; and could cause people to act or vote in a certain way. This topic met all the criteria. The health care proposition is so controversial that even members of Folwell’s own party have proposed a bill in the state legislature that would delay its implementation until 2022. House Bill 184 is sponsored by Republican Reps. Josh Dobson, Julia Howard and William Brisson and Democratic Rep. Gale Adcock. It was passed in the state House, but has yet to be passed in the more conservative state Senate. The newspaper ad aims to convince people to lobby their legislators to pass the bill. What it means for hospitals Many state hospitals are not happy with the project since the fixed rates set by Folwell do not provide enough money for them to pay extra expenses, such as 24/7 emergency rooms and people who cannot afford to pay for their hospital visits. ""What you’re effectively asking hospitals to do is sign a contract with them performing the same services for the same number of people for less,"" Aaron McKethan, a professor of population health sciences at the Duke University School of Medicine and the former chief data and analytics officer for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Signing this contract could also put hospitals on a ""slippery slope,"" McKethan said. Once hospitals have compromised for one state-set rate, they fear that could give the state the power to change the rates whenever it wants. For this reason, many hospitals and doctors across the state have refused to agree to join the State Health Plan’s new network. ""The new State Health Insurance Plan will not pay what it costs to provide patients’ care,"" Doug Allred, communications manager for Cone Health, which encompasses Moses Cone Hospital, said in a statement to The News & Observer. ""Instead, beginning on Jan. 1, 2020, patients would be left with the rest of the expense, or hospitals would have to reduce or cut services that patients rely on. We don’t think that is right. Neither do most other hospitals in the state."" How would this affect state employees? If these health care providers do not sign on to the new network, they will be out-of-network providers which are not covered the same as in-network providers. Unlike in-network providers, out-of-network providers do not sign contracts with a specific insurer. In-network providers are less expensive than out-of-network providers. People who use out-of-network providers can either choose to apply for out-of-network benefits, in which their insurer assists them in paying for extra out-of-network costs, or pay for their visits directly. ""My biggest concern is the number of consumer/employees who are going to find themselves in and out of network situations with a very high cost responsibility,"" Dan Gitterman, professor of public policy at UNC-Chapel Hill, said in an email interview. McKethan said he was worried about state employees going to an institution that is in-network only to find out after the fact that the physician they saw is out-of-network, which would be an unexpected cost. However, if patients avoid out-of-network providers, they could be depriving themselves of necessary medical attention, Cynthia Charles, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Healthcare Association, said in an email interview. This could especially hurt people in rural counties who may only have a single hospital in their vicinity, McKethan said. ""It is not unreasonable to assume that those out-of-network penalties represent significant financial obligations that may force plan members to forego much needed care and effectively cut off their access to critical, affordable health services,"" Charles said. However, the State Employees Association of North Carolina supports the treasurer’s plan because of its transparency and more affordable costs. SEANC even called on the North Carolina Association of Educators to more publicly support the plan. Our ruling The health association’s claim says Folwell’s plan would ""DENY North Carolina state employees, retirees, and their families of in-network access to critical healthcare services. Because Folwell’s health-care design is unattractive to health-care providers, many doctors and hospitals have not signed on to his insurance program. Because of this, Folwell’s changes would cause some State Health Plan members to lose in-network access to providers, which would most affect people in rural areas who don’t have an in-network provider in their vicinity. However, the statement leaves out the fact that members would only lose access because providers — including members of the very interest group making the claim — will not sign on to the plan. Additionally, many State Health Plan members would actually save money in out-of-pocket costs that they pay toward their insurance. We rate this statement Half True.

Trump said when crowd chanted 'send her back' about Omar he stopped it. Video shows otherwise.
","President Donald Trump said that he stopped the ""send her back"" chants at a rally as he spoke about U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, but a video of the rally disputes his next-day version of events. During his July 17 rally in Greenville, N.C., Trump revved up his attacks on a few liberal Democratic members of Congress, including Omar, who represents Minnesota. The next day at the White House, a reporter asked Trump about the crowd’s chants. Question: ""When your supporters last night were chanting ‘send her back,’  why didn’t you stop them? Why didn’t you ask them to stop saying that?"" Trump: ""Well, No. 1, I think I did. I started speaking very quickly. It really was loud – I disagree with it by the way, but it was quite a chant. And I felt a little bit badly about it. But I will say this: I did, and I started speaking very quickly, but it started up rather fast, as you probably noticed.""  After some cross talk with the interviewer, Trump continued: ""I was not happy with it, I disagree with it, but again, I didn’t say that, they did. But I disagree."" In reviewing the video of the rally, we found no evidence that he made any effort to stop it as he said he did. Trump was silent for about 13 seconds when his supporters chanted ""send her back"" at the rally.  We used the C-SPAN video of Trump’s rally to mark the time stamps of when the ""send her back"" chants occurred. When Trump mentioned Omar’s name at about minute 31 during the rally, the crowd loudly booed. Trump then recited a string of attacks about Omar’s record of statements about terrorism, ISIS, al-Qaida and Sept. 11. These comments led to more boos from the crowd.  Then seconds before minute 36, he said, ""She looks down with contempt on the hard working Americans saying, ‘Ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country.’ "" A ""send her back"" chant can be heard amid other noises.   In this instance, Trump does start talking again quickly -- only pausing for about four seconds (although we can’t tell if he heard the ""send her back"" chant at this point). Then he continued: ""Obviously and importantly, Omar has a history of launching vicious anti-Semitic screeds."" As he completes that statement, the ""send her back"" chant starts to rev up. Starting at 36:13, Trump is silent, gripping the podium and appears to turn his head scanning the crowd in front of him, as the ""send her back"" chant loudly continues. The chant then fades out on its own, and Trump continues speaking about Omar at 36:26. He doesn’t change the subject. We count about 13 seconds while Trump is silent during the ""send her back"" chants. The Trump campaign noted that Trump didn’t himself say ""send her back"" or launch the chant. And in his media availability the next day, he stated that he was not happy with the chant and disagreed with it. After the chant, Trump continued to talk about Omar as well as three other Democrats: Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. (While Omar was a naturalized citizen, the other three were born in the U.S.) At minute 48, he described them as having only negative comments about America. ""That’s why I say, hey, if they don’t like it, let them leave, let them leave, let them leave, …"" he said. ""If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it."" The Trump campaign said that Trump is saying ""let them leave"" which isn’t the same as forcing someone to leave, or the words of the crowd’s chant ""send her back."" The campaign made a similar argument about the words of Trump’s tweets. At the White House, the reporter asking about the chanting crowd said to Trump: ""They were echoing what you said in your first tweet, that they should go back."" Trump responded: ""if you examine it, I don’t think you will find that, but I disagree with it."" The Trump campaign said Trump didn’t tweet that the congresswomen ""should go back"" — emphasis ours. In his tweets, he said if someone hates America ""you can leave"" and ""it is your choice."" When a reporter asked Trump why he didn’t tell the crowd chanting ""send her back"" to stop, he said, ""I think I did. I started speaking very quickly."" When a ""send her back"" chant was heard amid other noises, Trump did start talking quickly, though it’s hard to tell if he even heard the chant.  But then he continued his criticisms of Omar, and the ""send her back"" chant revved up in the crowd loudly, with multiple people in unison. It is at this point that Trump is silent for about 13 seconds. We see no statement or body language on his part to stop the chant. Trump gave no indication that he wanted the crowd to stop.  We rate this statement False.  ",/factchecks/2019/jul/19/donald-trump/trump-said-when-crowd-chanted-send-her-back-about-/

Trump’s Ellis Island award was not for work ‘within the black community’
","Some posts on social media are countering the accusations of racism against President Donald Trump after his tweet that a group of Democratic congresswomen should ""go back"" to the ""crime infested places from which they came."" (All four are citizens, and only one, Rep. Ilhan Omar, was born outside of the U.S. before arriving when she was 10.) One post points to Trump’s business history in New York as evidence that he looks out for minorities.  The post, in full, reads: ""There are only 3 people that won the Ellis Island Award for their work within the black community … 1. Rosa Parks 2. Muhammad Ali 3. Donald Trump … yet ‘squad’ wants you to believe he’s racist."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim gets one major thing wrong: While Donald Trump did win the award, called the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, it was not for ""work within the black community."" We reached out to the Ellis Island Honors Society, which administers the award. The society is a non-political organization promoting diversity and understanding among religious and ethnic groups, as well as the restoration and maintenance of Ellis Island. Spokesperson Otto Coca told PolitiFact that Trump was one of several people to be awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1986 – the first year it was given out (and the same year Parks and Ali were also recipients). Trump was chosen for professional contributions that benefited New York City as a developer, as well as for his German heritage. ""That post is ridiculous and an outright lie,"" Coca said.  In the first year, ""people were honored with the award for what they stood for more than what they did,"" Coca said. Parks, for example, was honored for standing up to adversity. Trump’s recognition came from ""doing well for the city of New York"" from his business. The medal has changed over the years, Coca said, and now recipients are chosen for philanthropic efforts as well as other contributions.  According to an Oct. 16, 1986, New York Times article, those named for the award were selected from more than 15,000 nominations. The winners, the article says, were a ""mixture of prominent and relatively unknown citizens,"" and were screened by the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations.

A conservative group paints Trump’s drug-pricing experiment as ‘socialist.’ Is it?
","As part of its effort to curb high prescription drug costs, the Trump administration is considering an experiment that has triggered strong opposition from Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist’s powerful conservative organization, which the president typically counts among his supporters. One of the most visible elements of the group’s battle plan is a nationwide commercial, on which it has spent almost half a million dollars, according to estimates by ad tracker iSpot.tv. It has been on the air since May.   The Americans for Tax Reform’s ad begins with President Donald Trump saying, ""America will never be a socialist country."" It then quickly pivots to take aim at the administration. ""You're right, Mr. President,"" the ad continues. ""But the Department of Health and Human Services is considering a plan to adopt socialist price controls from foreign countries.""  That led us to wonder if the organization’s take is an accurate description. The ad is referring to an initiative being considered by the administration that would be part of the president’s promise to curb high drug prices. Though not expected to launch until 2020 at the earliest, it would test-drive the effectiveness of setting price limits on what the federal government pays for prescription drugs. It would tie some payments in Medicare Part B — which covers hospital and physician-administered drugs — to prices charged in other countries, mostly in Europe. The trial would be limited to brand-name medicines that are responsible for a high percentage of Part B spending. We contacted Americans for Tax Reform to find out the basis for this claim. John Kartch, a spokesman, said, ""Price controls themselves are socialist"" and argued that they constitute a ""fundamental building block of state control of the economy."" But independent experts we spoke to said this characterization, while politically powerful, is misleading.  ""Socialism,"" as defined by Merriam-Webster, involves ""collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods."" In this case, the label doesn’t accurately reflect distinctions in how different countries handle drug pricing and neglects to consider important context about the American pharmaceutical market. HHS is still deciding which countries it might include in its ""international pricing index,"" or IPI. Under consideration are Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Some of those nations may use strategies that could be termed ""socialist."" Also on the list, though, are countries that use market-based approaches, experts said.  ""Each of these countries has a complex set of decision points, and they’re not the same,"" said Stacie Dusetzina, associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. In Germany, for instance, the first year a drug is on the market, the manufacturer can set its own price. After that, an independent board assesses the drug’s added clinical value, which is used to determine what the country’s nonprofit insurance plans – known as sickness funds – will pay. That, drug pricing experts said, is hardly ""socialism."" Even the ""price control"" phrasing is suspect, some argued. That’s because, while the IPI countries vary in strategy, many do not dictate what a pharmaceutical company charges for a drug, said Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, who studies drug pricing. Rather, she said, they are simply saying what the national insurance plan will pay. Some of the countries in question also maintain private insurance systems beyond the government plan. For instance, in Canada, people have options, depending on the province where they live, of various forms of public and private prescription drug coverage, which differ in generosity. Therefore, what the government pays for a drug doesn’t necessarily dictate arrangements negotiated between drug companies and other insurers. Plus, experts said, the advertisement’s framing ignores the role the U.S. government already plays in shaping the pharmaceutical market. Currently, Medicare Part B cannot negotiate lower prices, and it is required to cover drugs that come to market. Drug patents, meanwhile, give manufacturers monopolies over their products for a certain amount of time – and the power to charge higher prices. Together, that means the government has no bargaining power, while drugmakers can set the prices where they want. ""We really need to take a look at our own system, and it’s quite far removed from a free market,"" said Ameet Sarpatwari, an epidemiologist and lawyer at Harvard Medical School, who studies drug-pricing regulations. Some argued that incorporating the IPI into Medicare Part B payments might actually inject more, not less, competition into the current payment system. The administration has made this argument, too. For instance, when we contacted HHS for comment, a spokeswoman directed us to this speech by Secretary Alex Azar as well as this  December blog post, both of which outline how this approach would strengthen the U.S. bargaining position by setting Medicare's rates more in line with those of other nations.  Finally, there’s the issue of whether the United States would actually be ""adopting"" strategies used by other countries. Using their prices as a reference point isn’t the same thing as importing their regulatory system. The ""socialist price control"" label is one of a few commonly deployed arguments against efforts to curb drug prices – one that’s ""effective but misleading,"" Sarpatwari argued. Other claims in the advertisement – that HHS’ proposal would reduce pharmaceutical innovation and limit access to life-saving medical treatments – are also popular attack lines. There isn’t a good body of research to suggest this would happen. Sachs suggested that, if prices come down, there would likely be some impact on either drug access or innovation. Assessing the magnitude of those changes is difficult at best, though. And, she said, it would be balanced against people who are, under the changed system, newly able to afford treatment. There are other issues, experts noted. One challenge: getting accurate data about what other countries pay for drugs. Another: finding a strategy to force manufacturers to accept the lower price. But those aren’t concerns Americans for Tax Reform chose to emphasize. Given the experimental nature of what the administration is considering, they’re also issues HHS could learn from and address based on how things go, Dusetzina said. The advertisement in question claims that HHS ""is considering a plan to adopt socialist price controls from foreign countries.""  HHS is weighing a strategy that would take into account prices paid in other countries to set amounts paid by the Medicare program. But the advertisement’s language – in particular, the phrase ""adopt socialist price controls"" – is reductive, inaccurate and misleading, experts said. These strategies do not necessarily constitute ""price controls."" And while some could conceivably be viewed as ""socialist,"" it is inaccurate to suggest all of them are. Furthermore, the claim ignores important context about the American drug-pricing market. This claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts, and is in some cases actively misleading.

Gabbard hits target with claim on Trump and military deportations
","Military matters and illegal immigration. Both are hot-button issues for voters in the 2020 presidential election, though for different reasons. U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a Democratic presidential hopeful and major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, linked them when she spoke July 11, 2019 at the League of United Latin American Citizens convention in Milwaukee. LULAC is the nation’s oldest Hispanic civil rights organization. Gabbard was one of several Democratic presidential contenders who attended.  Meanwhile, President DonaldTrump visited Derco Aerospace on Milwaukee's northwest side on July 12, 2019 -- a day after Gabbard spoke to a group of veterans at a LULAC breakfast. In her speech, Gabbard said Trump ""pays a lot of lip service to our veterans, to our troops,"" but ""at the very same time he is deporting service members who have volunteered to serve this country."" Let’s take a look at whether Trump ""is deporting service members who have volunteered to serve this country."" Government Accountability Office PolitiFact Wisconsin’s attempts to reach Gabbard’s campaign and Washington, D.C., staff were unsuccessful, so let’s take a look at available data.  According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, between fiscal years 2013 and 2018, more than 44,000 noncitizens enlisted in the military.  Many of those service members are entitled to apply for American citizenship, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, people born in other countries can gain U.S. citizenship through military service.  According to the AllLaw.com website, sometimes they can do this without going through the preliminary step of getting a U.S. green card (lawful permanent resident). The exact legal requirements depend on whether the person served during peace or war time.  However, a June 2019 GAO report noted that the federal government had fallen short in efforts to guide immigrants serving in the U.S. military through the process to become naturalized citizens.  Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, can deport veterans who have not obtained citizenship and are in violation of immigration laws or who commit certain crimes.  ""ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has developed policies for handling cases of noncitizen veterans who may be subject to removal from the United States, but does not consistently adhere to those policies, and does not consistently identify and track such veterans,"" the GAO report states. A June 7, 2019 news report from NPR summarized it this way:  Hundreds of noncitizen veterans were placed in removal proceedings during the past six years despite policies to consider their service in deportation cases and to provide a pathway to citizenship for immigrants serving in the U.S. military. Of the 250 veterans facing deportation, 92 were removed from the country, according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office released Thursday. Nine of the deported veterans had service-connected disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Eighty-five percent of the deported veterans were legal permanent residents. And 26 of them tried to become citizens, according to the GAO report. Notably, the GAO report covers a period of six years, meaning the issue began before Trump took office after the 2016 election. Family members In addition to noncitizen service members facing deportation, family members of those who have served are subject to deportation.  U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., along with other Senate Democrats, wrote a letter  on July 10, 2019 demanding the Trump administration reverse course on ending the ""Parole in Place"" program, which prevents immigrants who are spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members and veterans from being deported. According to Duckworth, although the exact number is unknown, hundreds of non-citizen veterans are estimated to have been deported from the United States in recent years.  She cited a 2017 executive order from Trump expanding the grounds for deportation as a possible cause for any increase.  That executive order focused mainly on plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico and to hold back money from ""sanctuary cities."" But it included an expanded definition of who is classified as a criminal, and therefore a priority subject for deportation.   The order includes anyone who has crossed the border illegally — which is a criminal misdemeanor. Anyone who has abused any public benefits program is also considered a criminal under the expansion order. Thousands of veterans deported In February 2018, the Texas Civil Rights Project released a report, ""Land of the Free, no Home to the Brave: A report on the social, economic and moral cost of deporting veterans."" The group is an Austin-based non-profit organization that focuses on social justice issues. The report stated that ""While the U.S. government does not track veteran status of the people it deports, estimates suggest some 3,000 veterans have been deported over the years.""  Earlier, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had cited a 3,000-veteran estimate in calling for an end to the deportation of military veterans. ""We are aware of deported veterans that have served as recently as the war in Afghanistan, to veterans that served in the Iraq and Vietnam wars,"" the Hispanic caucus sent in a 2017 letter sent to Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. Indeed, according to a Jan 12, 2018 article from Stars and Stripes, the VA established a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, in 2017 ""to provide services to deported veterans, giving exams to determine whether deported veterans have injuries or illnesses connected to their military service. If they do, they could become eligible for government-paid health care and monthly paychecks from the VA.""  The clinic itself underlines the key point of Gabbard’s claim: That veterans have been deported. Our ruling Gabbard said at the same time Trump talks about supporting veterans, ""he is deporting service members who have volunteered to serve this country."" The Trump administration expanded the grounds under which people, including veterans, can be deported, which some blame for more veterans being forced to leave the country. That said, GAO documents make clear the issue existed before Trump took office -- something that wasn’t acknowledged in Gabbard’s claim. Our definition for Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2019/jul/19/tulsi-gabbard/gabbard-hits-target-claim-trump-and-military-depor/

No, Gitmo detainees not headed to ‘neighborhood near you’ as Florida congressman said
","A Florida Republican claims a measure passed in the Democrat-led House could bring Guantanamo Bay detainees to the mainland United States, but that’s a misreading of the measure, experts say. U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, of Sarasota, warned on Twitter July 12 that Democrats struck a near-decade-old ban on using money to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States. ""This means that terrorists who are currently being held at Guantanamo Bay can be transferred to a neighborhood near you,"" wrote Steube. Steube is right that the ban was removed in the House proposal. But he’s wrong to say that means the 40 detainees currently in Cuba could be coming here. Here’s why: • The House bill would only prohibit federal funds for additional detainees placed at Guantanamo Bay. Federal funding could still support the detainees already there; • The House bill calls for federal officials to submit a ""disposition plan"" to Congress about the detainees. But the disposition plan is just that, a plan. It doesn’t have to be carried out. And Guantanamo doesn’t have to be closed; • And because it matters, the White House says it will recommend that Trump veto the House bill if it were to reach his desk. The House voted 220-197 to pass the $733 billion National Defense Authorization Act for 2020.  Republicans unanimously rejected the bill — and eight Democrats joined them — for multiple reasons including the Guantanamo provision and that it has $17 billion less than the Senate version. The House bill includes language that would prohibit ""use of funds for transfer to and detention of additional individuals"" at Guantanamo Bay on or after May 2, 2018. The Senate version extends the longstanding prohibition on using funds to transfer or release Gitmo detainees to the United States. If the House bill became law as is (the veto warning means it won’t), it wouldn’t apply to detainees currently there, said Charles ""Cully"" Stimson, who coordinated the Pentagon’s detention policy during President George W. Bush’s administration. ""It doesn’t say you’ve got to get rid of the ones who are there,"" said Stimson, a legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The bill also states that the attorney general and defense secretary submit a plan to Congress about how to proceed with each individual detained at Guantanamo Bay. That doesn’t necessarily mean they would be sent to facilities in the United States. Daphne Eviatar, an expert on detention at Amnesty International, said that a requirement to write a detention plan ""doesn’t require the administration to do anything except tell Congress what the plan is.""  Steube’s spokeswoman, Rachel Harris, said Democrats blocked an effort to include a ban on using money to move detainees to the United States, which was standard language in past annual defense bills.  Without a provision banning the use of funds to transfer detainees, they can be transferred at any time, Harris said.  ""These detainees could end up in the United States at any number of facilities around the country that are located in American communities nationwide.""  Stimson disagreed. ""Just because the House fails to include that provision barring the use of funds to bring in detainees to the U.S. doesn’t automatically mean that, if it becomes law as passed, that the executive branch will make the decision to bring detainees from Gitmo to the U.S.,"" he said. ""There is a lot of green between the ball and the cup on this one."" Trump said in 2016 that ""we're going to load it up with bad dudes."" He hasn’t delivered on that goal — the population has essentially remained stagnant. But he has kept his promise to keep Guantanamo Bay open. Even if the government decided to empty Guantanamo Bay, it doesn’t mean that detainees would land at detention facilities in the United States. Detainees could be sent to their home countries, another country or the country where they were apprehended. ""I don’t see any indication that anybody in the administration in the know has made the recommendation or push to have detainees brought to the U.S.,"" Stimson said. ""To the contrary, the question has been if the administration can bring additional detainees to Gitmo including ISIS. They are not looking to unload detainees at Gitmo, they are looking to load up."" Steube said, ""Terrorists who are currently being held at Guantanamo Bay can be transferred to a neighborhood near you"" as a result of House Democrats’ actions on the National Defense Authorization Act. Democrats struck a near-decade-old ban on using money to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States. But that doesn’t mean that the existing 40 detainees will be sent to facilities in the United States. A House bill said that federal funding could not be spent on additional detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay. The House bill directs officials to write a plan about how to proceed with the detainees. But that plan doesn’t mean that detainees will be sent to the United States either.

Checking Bernie Sanders on life expectancy in Virginia, West Virginia
","During a June 12 speech at George Washington University, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders offered what he said was a stark example of income inequality and its real-world consequences. ""In 2014, for example, in McDowell County, W.Va., one of the poorest counties in the nation, life expectancy for men was 64 years. In Fairfax County, Va., a wealthy county, just 350 miles away, life expectancy was nearly 82 years, an 18-year differential. The life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years.""  Was Sanders right? We took a closer look. (Sanders’ campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) Let’s start by noting that the two counties are indeed at opposite ends of the income spectrum. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, McDowell County, in the heart of Appalachian coal country, has a median household income of $25,595, about 44 percent of the national median household income of $57,652. By contrast, Fairfax County, located in the affluent suburbs of Washington, D.C., has a median household income of $117,515, or slightly more than double the national median.  So median household income is more than four times higher in Fairfax County than it is in McDowell County. What about life expectancy? The longest-running data on life expectancy by county in the United States is compiled by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. We used the institute’s interactive database to find the most recent data for both of the counties Sanders mentioned. Here’s a summary for 2014, the most recent year available:   The data shows that life expectancy is a few years longer than Sanders said for men in McDowell County — 67 instead of 64 — which in turn makes the gap for men between the two counties 15 years, rather than the 18-year figure Sanders cited. For women, Sanders also is slightly off — there’s an 11-year gap rather than a 12-year gap. But while Sanders is a bit off on the numbers, his overall point is sound. In fact, not only can people in Fairfax County expect to live longer than those in McDowell County, but the gap between the two has been widening for nearly four decades. This chart shows life expectancy for men, women, and both in the two counties since 1980. Figures for McDowell County are shown in red, and figures for Fairfax County are shown in green. It’s easy to see the trend lines going in opposite directions.   It appears that Sanders’ comparison actually emerged more than five years ago, in a New York Times article by Annie Lowrey. She wrote: Fairfax County, Va., and McDowell County, W.Va., are separated by 350 miles, about a half-day’s drive. Traveling west from Fairfax County, the gated communities and bland architecture of military contractors give way to exurbs, then to farmland and eventually to McDowell’s coal mines and the forested slopes of the Appalachians. Perhaps the greatest distance between the two counties is this: Fairfax is a place of the haves, and McDowell of the have-nots. … One of the starkest consequences of that divide is seen in the life expectancies of the people there. Residents of Fairfax County are among the longest-lived in the country: Men have an average life expectancy of 82 years and women, 85, about the same as in Sweden. In McDowell, the averages are 64 and 73, about the same as in Iraq. Sanders said, ""In 2014 ... in McDowell County, W.Va., one of the poorest counties in the nation, life expectancy for men was 64 years. In Fairfax County, Va., a wealthy county, just 350 miles away, life expectancy was nearly 82 years, an 18 year differential. The life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years.""  A few of these numbers are slightly off, but Sanders’ overall point that there is a large gap in life expectancy between the two counties is solid.
