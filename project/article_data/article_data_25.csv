A Romney non-endorsement endorsement of sorts
","Welcome to politics, where ""is"" is only ""is"" when someone says it is. Or so it seems. Just a week ago, former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney inserted himself squarely into the current slugfest of a GOP primary via a highly publicized March 18  Facebook message, just a few days before voters in Utah, Idaho and Arizona went to the polls. Romney made no bones of the fact that he was trying to derail GOP front-runner Donald Trump. He wrote that ""Trumpism"" has been associated with ""racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence."" He ended with this: ""I will vote for Senator Cruz and I encourage others to do so as well, so that we can have an open convention and nominate a Republican,"" Romney wrote. It certainly appeared to be an endorsement in a GOP primary contest where Romney vowed he would not endorse a candidate. He had also vowed to support the party’s nominee, regardless of who that might be. But Romney aides and ""allies"" stressed in news reports that this was not an endorsement. ""Mr. Romney’s vote in Utah, where he owns a house in Holladay, is not an endorsement, his allies stressed,"" The New York Times reported. ""Rather, it is part of his effort to unite the Republican Party around an alternative to Mr. Trump’ Other news outlets reported Romney’s statement as an outright endorsement of Cruz, a ""sort of"" endorsement or something short of an endorsement.   What’s going on here? Trump certainly took it as an endorsement of Cruz. He fired back on Twitter: ""Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who ‘choked’ and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!"" Romney’s office declined to comment when PolitiFact contacted a spokeswoman. However, political scientists from across the country weighed in. Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, pointed out that Romney was campaigning for Gov. John Kasich in Ohio a few weeks before he urged Utah voters to support Cruz. ""Essentially, Romney is telling Republicans to vote for the candidate who can beat Trump in any given state, with the clear objective to deny Trump 1,237 votes on the first ballot of the GOP convention,"" Sabato said. ""That will create an open convention, and the probability is that someone other than Trump will be picked on a subsequent ballot."" Sabato said Romney is essentially endorsing ""strategic voting"" but not a specific candidate. Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, agreed. ""I'd call it a ‘non-endorsement endorsement,’ "" Swint said. ""Romney is using Cruz, who he clearly dislikes, as a vehicle to try and stop Trump. The only place that might work is Utah. Outside of that, Romney's anti-Trump actions could actually help Trump. Romney reeks of ‘the GOP establishment.’ "" Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report said Romney and his allies are ""splitting hairs."" ""If you publicly support and vote for a candidate and encourage others to do the same, the only thing left is to utter the word 'endorse,’ "" Gonzales said. ""This is a good example of why Donald Trump is leading the field because politicians and party loyalists are playing the game with an old playbook. Instead of trying to stop Trump, Romney and company are arguing with reporters over the meaning of the word ‘endorse.’ "" Political scientist Steven Smith of Washington University said the nuanced approach is complex but defendable. ""Romney is trying to say that his strategic recommendation (vote for Cruz) is not yet a sincere recommendation (endorsement) of Cruz for president,"" Smith said. ""That’s complicated but reasonable."" Our ruling Romney’s aides and allies tried to spin his Facebook post in which he blasted Trump and urged voters to support Cruz as something other than an endorsement. Technically, they have a point, according to political scientists. But the statement is also misleading. We rate it Half True. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mostly True: Bernie Sanders' claim about U.S. voter turnout one of 'lowest on earth'
","Does the United States have a lower voter turnout rate than countries from Germany to Greece, and the Netherlands to New Zealand? Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in San Diego Tuesday night that America lags far behind the world’s major countries in carrying out this civic duty. ""Today, the United States has, sadly, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth,"" Sanders claimed. Sanders makes the claim about low voter turnout at the 17:08 minute mark in the above C-SPAN.org video. Sanders added in a news conference on Wednesday that high voter turnout – particularly among younger and progressive Californians – is key to him winning the Golden State, where turnout has plummeted in recent elections. And while California’s voting struggles have been well documented, we decided to check Sanders’ claim that the country as a whole is mired in a deep turnout slump. The iconoclastic politician has captured strong support from young people during his run for president. That group has traditionally lagged behind on voter turnout. Experts say he must continue to persuade them to vote in high numbers to stand a chance of upsetting frontrunner Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Our research  As of Wednesday afternoon, the Sanders campaign had not responded to our request for sources backing up the senator’s claim. But, we found, there’s not much debate about America’s poor voting rate. Last May, the Pew Research Center ranked the United States 31st among 34 developed countries in voting turnout. The center examined votes cast as a percentage of countries’ estimated voting-age population. Looking at votes cast for president in 2012, turnout in the United States was 53.6 percent. The highest comparable rates were in Belgium (87.2 percent), Turkey (86.4 percent) and Sweden (82.6 percent). Meanwhile, Germany had a 66 percent turnout and the United Kingdom’s rate was 61 percent. Smaller players on the national stage, such as Greece, the Netherlands and New Zealand, also all outranked America by a wide margin. Of course, there’s a big caveat. Nearly 30 countries, including six in the group studied by the Pew Research Center, have compulsory voting, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Those include Belgium and Turkey, which had the highest turnout rates. Another factor at play is that many countries, like Sweden and Germany, automatically register citizens to vote. In the United States, that responsibility tends to rest with the individual. Our ruling Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has made boosting voter turnout a big part of his presidential campaign. He continued that focus in San Diego by saying the United States ""has, sadly, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth."" Research on the topic shows the United States does, indeed, rank near the bottom in turnout among developed countries. But unlike the U.S., some of those countries require their citizens to cast ballots. And others automatically register them to vote. Sanders’ statement wasn’t wrong, but it left out information that would have helped paint the full picture. We rate his claim Mostly True. In the end, we rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Did we really reduce extreme poverty by half in 30 years?
","At the dawn of the new millennium, the United Nations set a goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. With 14 years left to go, we’ve already reduced the proportion of destitute people in world by 50 percent, according to U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Gayle Smith. ""I think everyone in the room knows that this is a moment of extraordinary progress. Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half. Boys and girls are enrolling in primary school at nearly equal rates, and there are half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago,"" Smith said in a speech on Capitol Hill. We looked at the education figures in a separate fact-check, but we also wondered if extreme poverty really has been halved. According the World Bank, the reduction is actually greater than what Smith stated. The global poverty line Extreme poverty typically refers to the minimum consumption level of the world’s poorest people. The World Bank first defined this in 1990 as living on $1 a day or less, by converting the national poverty lines of a group of the poorest countries into a common currency based on their purchasing power. Since then, the World Bank has raised the bar every few years to adjust for inflation. A spokesperson for USAID referred us to a United Nations report based on the 2008 definition of $1.25 a day or less. According to the report, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from 36 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2011 — a 58 percent reduction in 21 years, more than what Smith claimed.   By the current metric of $1.90 a day, the decline is even greater. According to the World Bank, 1.9 billion people (or 37.1 percent of the global population) lived on less than $1.90 a day in 1990, compared to a projected 702 million (9.6 percent) in 2015. That’s a 74.1 percent decline in 25 years.  We should stipulate that the World Bank’s definition of extreme is by no means perfect. For 25 years, critics have pointed to methodological issues while others have questioned the very notion of a one-poverty-line-fits-all approach. Princeton University economist and Nobel laureate Angus Deaton, for example, pointed out in 2010 that the World Bank’s standard is based on the most destitute places in the world and neglects the issue of regional inequality. So the poverty count would effectively include ""all of the locally poor Indians, and none of the locally poor Americans."" In short, the global poverty line is ""an inaccurately measured and arbitrary cut off,"" said Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""I know I’d consider myself extremely poor on multiples of ($1.90 a day). And no one doubts that people on $1.91 are still really, really poor."" Nonetheless, the World Bank’s estimate still gives a good sense of just how many people live in abject poverty, Kenny added, so Smith’s claim of "" ‘halving’ is suitably cautious and about as accurate as you are going to get."" Other approaches The World Bank’s global poverty line isn’t the only measure of poverty out there. By many other definitions, the World Bank's count of the desperately poor is low-balled.  In a 2012 working paper, the World Food Programme’s Ugo Gentilini and the Institute of Development Studies’ Andy Sumner looked at national poverty lines and found that 1.5 billion people are poor, according to their own countries — more than double the number under the World Bank’s definition. The Agriculture Department's Thrifty Food Plan, the minimum cost of getting adequate nutrition in the United States, was the basis for an alternative poverty metric by economists Sanjay Reddy of the New School and Rahul ​Lahoti of the University of Göttingen. Reddy and Lahoti applied purchasing power exchange rates for the $5.04 plan and, just to be cautious, half its value. According to this analysis, the percent of people who live below the higher poverty line ($5.04) was cut by 18 percent from 1980 to 2012, and the poverty headcount at the lower line ($2.52) was reduced by 37 percent. To some, income or consumption alone isn’t enough to define poverty. The University of Oxford’s multidimensional poverty index considers a host of other indicators such as nutrition, child mortality, education, and access to electricity and water. By this definition, there are still 1.6 billion people living in poverty.  While Oxford doesn’t have long-term data, it did calculate the change in multidimensional poverty in 34 countries over various periods, spanning from two to eight years. On average, multidimensional poverty decreased 5.6 percent (albeit in much short time frames). Then there’s the idea proposed by Harvard University development economist Lant Pritchett that poverty lines shouldn’t just measure destitution, but rather set a global standard for human well-being. Pritchett suggested a high poverty line of $12.50 or even $15 a day. Under this definition, billions more would be considered poor. ""There seems to be massive global inequity built into definitions of poverty that do not allow the world’s population to even aspire to the living standards of the now rich industrial world,"" Pritchett wrote in a 2013 blogpost. ""Roughly speaking, about 1 billion people are in extreme poverty, about 1 billion are above a high threshold and 5 billion are in between. Why would we want to build a development agenda that did not measure how the standard of living of those 5 billion people is progressing?"" Our ruling Smith said, ""Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half."" By World Bank figures, Smith actually understated the reduction. We’ve cut extreme poverty by 58 percent using the 2008 definition of extreme poverty, and 74.1 percent by the 2015 definition. While we don’t quibble with Smith using that metric, our research shows that there are other ways of determining poverty, and those different ways show different declines. Moreover, defining poverty is not an exact science, experts say. Because of those caveats, we rate Smith’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B05980>],/factchecks/2016/mar/23/gayle-smith/did-we-really-reduce-extreme-poverty-half-30-years/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz wrongly says Ukraine gave up nukes due to American security guarantees
","CNN took its cue from the NCAA basketball championships to air an election special called ""The Final Five,"" or five interviews with the remaining presidential candidates. During his conversation with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, CNN host Wolf Blitzer raised the issue of NATO. Blitzer asked Cruz what he thought about Donald Trump’s demand that the European members pay more for their common defense. Blitzer mentioned Trump’s point about Ukraine, saying Germany has more of an interest there than the United States. ""Well, Donald, in all likelihood, has no awareness of this, but with regard to Ukraine, the United States has deep involvement,"" Cruz replied during the March 21, 2016, interview. ""Ukraine used to be the third-largest nuclear country on the face of the Earth. Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons because the United States of America came in and said if you hand over those nuclear weapons, we will ensure your territorial integrity from Russia. We made a commitment, and then the Obama administration has broken its word."" There are a couple of elements in Cruz’s statement. While he described the weapons as belonging to Ukraine, when the Soviet Union dissolved, the Russians still controlled them and Ukraine’s generals were unable to launch them. It would be more accurate to say that the warheads were on Ukrainian soil. The subject of this fact-check though is the claim that American promises of territorial integrity led Ukraine to hand over those nukes. Former presidential hopeful Ben Carson made the same argument in the very first Republican debate. We rated it False then, and Cruz’s claim is no different. Ukraine, nuclear weapons and the end of the Soviet Union The 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union generated enormous concern over the fate of the nuclear arsenal it had spread across three states that were newly independent -- Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- as well as in Russia itself. During the first six months of 1992, Moscow was quick to retrieve all of its tactical, or short-range, nukes. Corralling the strategic weapons, such as intercontinental missiles and bomber-based warheads, was trickier. Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed to dismantle or return what they had. But Ukraine looked at the roughly 1,900 warheads on its soil and began seeking something in exchange before it gave them up. Brian Finlay, a specialist in nonproliferation at the Stimson Center, a military-focused think tank in Washington, D.C., told us in August there was actually never any question that Ukraine would eventually relinquish those weapons. ""They had announced that they would become a non-nuclear weapon state even before their declaration of independence,"" Finlay said. ""Essentially, it was something that they traded off in order to encourage international recognition."" According to a report by Steven Pifer, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine between 1998 and 2000, Ukraine wanted Russia to promise to respect its sovereignty and its borders, a promise that has since been ignored by Russia. But just as important, Ukraine wanted money. The highly-enriched uranium in the warheads was valuable, plus Ukraine wanted somebody else to cover the costs of dismantling the silos and other infrastructure. And Ukraine knew that going non-nuclear would open the door to better ties with the West. The deal that de-nuked Ukraine It took a series of agreements to finally clear the way for Ukraine to get rid of the weapons it held. Early in 1994, the United States agreed to provide money through the Nunn-Lugar program to dismantle Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure. Russia agreed to write down the debts Ukraine owed. In December 1994, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances. Pifer described in his report how Washington wanted security assurances that avoided creating broad guarantees. ""State Department lawyers thus took careful interest in the actual language, in order to keep the commitments of a political nature,"" Pifer wrote. ""U.S. officials also continually used the term ‘assurances’ instead of ‘guarantees,’ as the latter implied a deeper, even legally-binding commitment of the kind that the United States extended to its NATO allies."" The agreement stated that ""the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and  the United States of America reaffirm their commitment"": To respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine. To refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine To seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used. Pifer writes that American diplomats went so far as to make sure that the Russians and Ukrainians understood specifically that the English meaning of ""assurance"" was not the same as a ""guarantee."" In short, the United States never promised to protect Ukraine. All it did was promise not to attack it. We reached out to the Cruz campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Cruz said that Ukraine agreed to give up the nuclear weapons on its territory because the United States promised to ""ensure its territorial integrity."" A diplomat with detailed knowledge of the American position noted that the United States went to pains to avoid making a strong guarantee to protect Ukraine’s borders. The formal memorandum of security assurances lacks a promise to ensure that Ukraine’s borders remain unchanged. The United States only promised to respect those borders itself, and to go to the United Nations should another power threaten Ukraine with a nuclear attack. Russia violated that memorandum, but that is separate from what the United States said it would do. We rate Cruz’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7FA40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/23/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-wrongly-says-ukraine-gave-nukes-due-ameri/

Gina Hinojosa, vowing reforms, says Texas has higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran
","In a campaign mailer, Gina Hinojosa of Austin brought up incarceration. ""Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran. It’s time to reverse course,"" Hinojosa said. We spotted that curious claim a few days before Hinojosa, a member of Austin’s school board, drew 57 percent of the vote to prevail in a seven-person field competing for the Democratic nomination to represent Austin's District 49 in the Texas House. She’s now almost certain to succeed longtime Rep. Elliott Naishtat after the November election; no Republican filed to run. To help Texas ""reverse course,"" as the mailer said, Hinojosa would focus on youth initiatives to keep young people out of the criminal justice system, her campaign director, Patti Everitt, told us by email. Hinojosa favors decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, supporting youth jobs programs and backing educational reforms such as universal all-day pre-kindergarten. And was Hinojosa right that Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran? U.S. incarceration numbers Asked the basis of Hinojosa’s comparison, Everitt said by email the campaign relied on a report by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that does research with the aim to ""expose the broader harm of mass criminalization,"" according to its website. The cited report, ""States of Incarceration: A Global Context,"" includes a graphic showing incarceration rates by state alongside incarceration rates of many countries. Texas is listed with the fifth-highest incarceration rate, of 1,063 per 100,000 in population. Russia has the 44th-highest rate, at 475 per 100,000; Iran is listed with the 68th-highest, at 284. Then again, many states look bad in the report. Russia is only the third foreign nation on the list, behind Cuba and Rwanda. Otherwise, the 42 places with higher incarceration rates are U.S. states or the United States as a whole, partly a result of the nation’s ""tough on crime"" policies of the 1980s and 1990s, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Louisiana is referred to as the ""the world’s prison capital,"" with the highest incarceration rate of any country or U.S. state. The Prison Policy Initiative drew the U.S. figures for correctional population counts from the 2010 U.S. Census, the group’s director, Peter Wagner, told us by phone. According to the 2010 Census, Texas’ total correctional population that year was 375,392. Of that number, 267,405 of the people counted lived in adult correctional facilities. Facilities included in that definition were federal detention centers, federal and state prisons, local jails, military disciplinary barracks and jails as well as correctional residential facilities, like halfway houses. The rest were spread among juvenile facilities, nursing facilities and an ""other"" category. Another U.S. indicator But the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, which tracks data like this, reports lower state-by-state incarceration rates. In 2014, it says, Texas imprisoned 600 people for every 100,000 residents, including minors, and 816 per every 100,000 adults. That’s because those numbers only include sentenced prisoners. They exclude prisoners who are unsentenced, prisoners serving less than one year, and local jail inmates. That limited definition, Wagner said, is why the Prison Policy Initiative turned to the 2010 Census to measure by correctional population count, getting 1,063 incarcerated per 100,000 people in Texas. Upshot: Hinojosa’s source backs her up. A Texas skeptic Yet to our inquiry, a Texas criminal justice expert expressed doubts about global comparisons. Tony Fabelo of Austin, director of research for the Justice Center at the Council of State Governments, said by phone he was skeptical of incarceration numbers from undemocratic countries. ""How do you know they’re counting in the right way? A lot of people are not counted, they just disappear, are arrested arbitrarily, never to be seen again. How do you count that?"" he said. Many politicians or advocates of changing U.S. incarceration policies cite the statement, rated True by PolitiFact Virginia in 2014, that the United States has 5 percent of the world’s population, but 25 percent of its ""known"" prisoners. The caveat of ""known"" avoids the problem Fabelo references. Fabelo suggested that making international comparisons is tricky even when comparing U.S. incarceration rates to those of other democracies. Incarceration rates are lower in the United Kingdom and France, for example, in part because those countries have lower rates of violent crime and crime involving weapons, Fabelo said. Putting incarceration rates side by side is missing part of the picture. Next, we ran the figures for Russia and Iran past experts on those countries. Russia The Prison Policy Initiative’s international incarceration rates -- 475 per 100,000 in Russia and 284 per 100,000 in Iran -- were taken from the World Prison Population List, which says it gets its numbers in almost all cases from the national prison administration of the country at hand. The list is published by the World Prison Brief, a U.K.-based arm of the International Centre for Prison Studies. Depending on the country, might that be shaky sourcing? We decided to check incarceration rates with an independent organization, turning first to Amnesty International where Europe and Central Asia press officer Clarisse Douaud suggested that for Russia numbers, we consider the Council of Europe Member States’ 2014 Penal Statistics. That report, conducted via questionnaire with the council’s 47 member states, says Russia incarcerates 467 people per 100,000 residents, which is fewer than what the initiative says. Otherwise, a web search led us to query Jonathan Weiler, an adjunct assistant professor in global studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has published research on incarceration in Russia. Weiler said by email that the initiative’s Russia rate, 475 per 100,000, looked accurate though he said it could understate realities, for instance leaving out citizens held in local police stations. In the 1990s, Weiler said, Russia had a much higher incarceration rate. He said that was before Russian President Vladimir Putin allowed a mass amnesty for lower-level offenders due to prison overcrowding. Iran To gauge the accuracy of the cited incarceration rate for Iran, we reached out to Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the nonprofit International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. By email, Ghaemi said the initiative’s declared rate of 284 people incarcerated per 100,000 residents tracked closely with his latest estimate, reached in March 2014, of 272 per 100,000. At that time, he said, Iranian officials announced the total prison population, and it was reported by Iran-based news agencies. Those numbers, Ghaemi said, can be trusted. ""The sensitive categories such as political prisoners are too few in the scheme of hundreds of thousands,"" to affect the total count, he told us. Our ruling Gina Hinojosa said: ""Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran."" Based on numbers reported by Russia and Iran, that checks out. The statement also holds up whether we use the more expansive U.S. Census measure of Texas correctional populations, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ rate based only on sentenced prisoners. Still, this assumes the figures for Iran and Russia are on the up and up and perfectly comparable to the Texas counts—and we’re not sure about that. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Group's TV ad criticizing JoAnne Kloppenburg leaves misleading impression
","Conservatives often say liberal judges are soft on crime. Such an attack is embedded in a claim made about Wisconsin Court of Appeals Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who is running against Justice Rebecca Bradley in the April 5, 2016 state Supreme Court election. The claim comes in a TV ad released March 8, 2016 by the Wisconsin Alliance for Reform, a group that surfaced in late 2015 with an ad campaign against Democrat Russ Feingold, who is trying to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson. The alliance has since been producing ads that back Bradley, who was appointed to the high court by Republican Gov. Scott Walker in October 2015. The ad begins with a reference to liberal judges and includes images on the screen of Daniel R. Fierro, a convicted sex offender, and a teen girl. ""We’ve heard it before. Liberal judges letting criminals off on technicalities. Judges like JoAnne Kloppenburg,"" the narrator says. ""This man (Fierro) had a long criminal history, including beating his wife in front of their 2-year-old daughter. Then, after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a 15-year-old child, he got 15 years. Incredibly, he appealed, saying he didn’t understand the charge. And JoAnne Kloppenburg? She agreed to give him a new hearing. Tell Judge Kloppenburg courts should protect children, not criminals."" So, did Kloppenburg agree to use a technicality to give a convicted sex offender a new hearing because ""he didn’t understand the charge""? The case As the ad indicates, Fierro pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was convicted, but then filed an appeal over his plea. The appeal was heard by Kloppenburg and the two other judges on the Madison-based appeals court panel, Paul Lundsten and Paul Higginbotham. Here is a summary of the Fierro case, based on a decision issued in March 2015 by the three judges: Fierro was charged with having sexual intercourse in June 2012 with a 15-year-old girl in Dane County. In February 2013, he pleaded guilty to felony second-degree sexual assault of a child. Two months later, Circuit Court Judge William Hanrahan sentenced Fierro to 10 years in prison and five years of extended supervision. (A note: Technically that was a 15-year sentence -- 10 years in custody, plus five years of supervision after release from prison. But the ad, by saying ""he got 15 years,"" suggests the sentence was 15 years behind bars.) Six days after sentencing, Fierro filed a motion stating he wanted to withdraw his plea, although his formal request wasn’t made until more than a year later, in May 2014. In essence, Fierro was arguing that he didn’t understand that he was pleading guilty to the crime of sexual intercourse with a minor. Hanrahan heard Fierro’s request. But, without holding an evidentiary hearing, he denied it, saying Fierro ""did fully understand the nature of the crime against him."" Fierro appealed. The appeals judges unanimously agreed Fierro should be given an evidentiary hearing in order to try to prove that he did not understand the charge he pled to. Such a hearing allows lawyers for both sides to present evidence on a factual question before the court. Here was the basis of the decision by Kloppenburg and the two other judges: At the plea hearing, Hanrahan asked Fierro if he had read over the plea documents and whether his lawyer explained the documents to him. Fierro said yes. But the documents referred to the wrong charge -- sexual contact, rather than sexual intercourse, even though intercourse was what was alleged in the criminal complaint. Hanrahan also did not himself explain the elements of the intercourse charge to Fierro. In other words, it was not clear whether Fierro understood he was pleading guilty to the crime of intercourse with a child.   The appeals judges said there were several reasons to question whether Fierro did not understand the elements of the charge of sexual intercourse. ""And, we stress that nothing in this opinion should be read as suggesting that Fierro’s asserted failure to understand should be believed or not believed,"" the opinion said. That’s the purpose of holding a hearing, the court wrote -- evidence could be presented by the prosecution and the defense as to whether Fierro understood the elements of the crime of sexual intercourse. Hanrahan ultimately held that evidentiary hearing three months later, in June 2015. He denied Fierro’s request to withdraw his guilty plea, concluding that Fierro did understand the charge he pled to, court records show. Throughout the process, Fierro’s conviction remained in place and he remained in prison. As for the idea that Fierro was given a hearing based on a technicality, it’s hard to imagine anything more fundamental in a plea bargain than the defendant understanding the charge he was pleading guilty to. A footnote: The original version of the ad carried a message on the screen saying ""conviction overturned."" That was removed after Kloppenburg’s campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter, citing the words on the screen, to television stations that were running the ad. Our rating The Wisconsin Alliance for Reform says Kloppenburg agreed to use a technicality to give a convicted sex offender a new hearing because ""he didn’t understand the charge."" Kloppenburg agreed with two other appeals court judges in ordering that the sex offender get a hearing. They did not rule, however, that the offender didn’t understand the charge he had pleaded guilty to. Rather, they ruled there should be hearing on the fundamental question of whether he did understand what he had pled to.

Donald Trump says Iran is responsible for terrorist attacks in 25 countries, five continents
","During a prepared speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, Donald Trump took a hard line on Iran. ""Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world,"" Trump said. ""During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They’ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere, very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world. And we will work to dismantle that reach."" We wondered whether Trump was correct that ""during the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents,"" so we took a closer look. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we found a source for his comment -- the Israeli government, which has taken a hard-line stance against Iran’s theocratic government. The Israeli Embassy in Washington released an infographic on March 31, 2015, titled, ""The Long Arm of Iran."" It shows a map of the world superimposed with 27 headlines detailing overseas activity by Iran or its proxy groups groups. The countries affected span the globe, from North and South America to Europe to Africa and Asia. A November 2015 tweet from the embassy featuring the infographic included the explanatory text, ""A look at Iran's global terror activity (last 4yrs): 5 continents, 25+ countries.""  In addition, during a speech to AIPAC a year earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed the audience a similar map with overlapping, though not identical, locations of alleged Iranian activity.  So how well does this evidence support Trump’s statement? Imperfectly. Where Trump has a point Trump’s most salient point is that Iran is widely agreed to have significant overseas reach. Iran remains one of just three nations that the United States has labeled as a state sponsor of terrorism. The State Department notes that Iran has supported ongoing ""terrorist-related activity"" by groups in Gaza, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. Probably the most prominent of these proxies is Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based militant group. The rise of ISIS (which is part of the Sunni branch of Islam) in Iraq and Syria has led Iran (which is part of the Shia branch) to increase its assistance to Shia militias as a counterweight to ISIS. Meanwhile, Iran is looking beyond its immediate neighborhood, according to the State Department. ""While its main effort focused on supporting goals in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, Iran and its proxies also continued subtle efforts at growing influence elsewhere including in Africa, Asia, and, to a lesser extent, Latin America,"" the State Department wrote. Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact that no one outside of Tehran really knows the scale of Iran’s foreign involvement. But he added that Trump’s subsequent statement -- that ""Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world"" -- is almost certainly correct, at least among nations. The only potential challenger for that title, he said, would be ISIS, which isn’t a state. ""The point of the Israeli infographic is that Iran is actively involved with terrorist groups with a very wide geographical range, and that it is a prolific smuggler of weapons, often in defiance of U.N. Security Council embargoes,"" Bromund said. Where Trump’s statement is misleading The problem with Trump’s statement -- that Iran ""has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries"" --  is that he conflates actual ""terror attacks"" with terrorist-related activity or, in many cases, suspicions of terrorist-related activity. Indeed, the wording of the Israeli embassy’s tweet is more restrained than Trump’s comment was. It referred to Iran’s ""global terror activity,"" not terrorist ""attacks."" Netanyahu, in his 2015 AIPAC speech, also stayed away from the word ""attacks"" when referring to the map he offered as a visual aid. ""Iran is the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in the world,"" he said. ""Look at that graph. Look at that map. And you see on the wall, it shows Iran training, arming, dispatching terrorists on five continents."" Indeed, when we looked into each of the 27 headlines on the ""Long Arm of Iran"" graphic, we found that actual attacks accounted for only a minority of the headlines. In five cases, the headlines on the infographic referred to actual attacks, some of them deadly, in which Iranian involvement was suspected. These include incidents in Bahrain, Bulgaria, India, Georgia and Thailand. Six other headlines referred to attacks that were thwarted before they could be carried out. Using an expansive definition that includes both actual attacks and thwarted attacks, less than half of the headlines on the infographic -- 11 -- support Trump’s statement. By contrast, 12 headlines refer to allegations of ties to Iran or Hezbollah in various countries, but ones well short of an actual attack, or even one thwarted at the last minute. Such headlines in this category include, ""Hezbollah tied to organized crime in Canada, says spy agency,"" ""Senegal cuts ties with Iran over weapons shipment,"" ""Gambia severs all ties with Iran after arms seizure,"" and ""British special forces seize Iranian rockets in Afghanistan."" Four other headlines address Iranian military involvement or influence in another country’s government. These and other allegations in the infographic will surely be troubling to many, but they are not the same thing as having ""perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents."" So how many have there been? Netanyahu reportedly told senior ministers that over the period of about a year between 2011 and 2012, Israel had thwarted 20 terrorist attacks overseas in such countries as Azerbaijan, Kenya, Turkey, Thailand, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Turkey. But he provided too few details for us to be able to verify them. The only hard numbers we could find for actual attacks are the ones included in the Global Terrorism Database operated by the University of Maryland. Under Hezbollah -- the operational group most frequently referenced in the headlines associated with the infographic -- we found 27 terrorist attacks since 2009. Of these, all but one occurred in the Middle East -- eight in Lebanon, seven in Bahrain, six in Israel, and five in Syria. The one attack outside the region was a bombing of an Israeli tour bus in Bulgaria. That’s a much narrower spread of attacks than what Trump suggests. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, called Trump’s math ""misleading."" ""There’s a difference between an attack and ‘activity,’ "" he said. Our ruling Trump said that ""during the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents."" He has a point that Iran is widely believed to be supporting, or trying to support, armed or terrorist groups in many countries around the world, though the exact number is not known with any specificity outside Tehran. However, that’s not the same thing as actually perpetrating terrorist attacks, as Trump indicated, even though his apparent source material only referred to activity, not attacks. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097086CC0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-iran-responsible-terrorist-attac/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says superdelegates never determined Democratic nominee
","Bernie Sanders is far behind Hillary Clinton in the delegate count toward the Democratic presidential nomination, but part of his strategy is to hold out hope that superdelegates will back him at the convention. What are superdelegates? They’re roughly 700 party officials and other high-profile Democrats who get to vote on nominees at the convention. In theory, they could swing a tight race to one candidate or another. The vast majority of superdelegates have said they will back Clinton, according to news reports. But Sanders has suggested that in states where he won by double-digit margins, superdelegates should vote according to the wishes of people in their states. That led to Fox Business News’ Maria Bartiromo asking Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her take on superdelegates. Wasserman Schultz countered that superdelegates aren’t so powerful, according to history. ""The purpose of superdelegates -- which by the way, have never been a determining factor in who our nominee is since they've been in place since 1984 -- is to make sure that party activists who want to be delegates to the convention don’t have to run against much better-known and well-established people at the district level,"" said the South Florida congresswoman. Have superdelegates not mattered since they were introduced in 1984? It’s clear that in elections after 1984 they were never needed to settle a nomination. However, they did play a role in 1984, although experts are conflicted about the extent of their power. Superdelegates started in 1984  Under the Democratic Party’s system, slightly more than 700 party officials and big shots get a vote as a superdelegate. That’s about one-third of the 2,383 delegates needed to secure the nomination, or about 15 percent of the total delegates. While pledged delegates vote for the candidate they were elected on behalf of, the superdelegates can vote for whomever they want at the convention. The superdelegate system was added in the 1980s after the Democratic party suffered huge losses with George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter’s failed re-election bid in 1980. The party wanted to come up with new ideas, with hopes of primaries resulting in candidates who were more likely to win general elections. A commission was formed and proposed a few reforms, including the superdelegates. The best example of when superdelegates played a role was the first year they started: former Vice President Walter Mondale’s nomination in 1984. (Ironically, the superdelegate system didn’t guarantee the results the party hoped for, because Mondale got crushed by Ronald Reagan in the general election.) Experts disagree how much credit superdelegates should get toward Mondale winning the nomination. Here is a quick snapshot: Entering the final handful primaries on June 5, 1984, Mondale was leading Sen. Gary Hart in the delegate count, with Jesse Jackson far behind. The battle for delegates became more dramatic that night when Hart won three primaries -- including the big prize of California in a cliffhanger. The Mondale campaign said -- and some news reports agreed -- that Mondale secured the needed 1,967 delegates that night in spite of losing California. But the Associated Press concluded he was ""barely short of the magic majority."" Mondale wanted to make it indisputable that he had enough votes -- and his campaign set a deadline of one minute before noon. So he made 50 calls in three hours to nail down an additional 40 superdelegates and declared at a press conference that he had 2,008 votes. At the convention in July, Mondale won on the first ballot. Sean Bartlett, a spokesman for the DNC, argued that Mondale won the nomination with pledged delegates, although he said that ""superdelegates came close to being decisive."" Bartlett pointed to a February 2016 article in The New Republic which stated that while superdelegates preferred Mondale, he ""ultimately won a plurality of delegates. So while superdelegates put him over the top, he was also the narrow choice of the voters."" Priscilla Southwell -- a professor at the University of Oregon who wrote an article about the 1984 Democratic nomination -- told PolitiFact Florida that she disagreed with Wasserman Schultz’s conclusion that superdelegates have never been a determining factor. ""I agree that Mondale had a plurality of pledged delegates, but he did not have enough delegates to clinch the nomination on the first round without the superdelegates. So, if the superdelegates had not been there in 1984, there would have had to be a second roll call of the states, and who knows who would emerged as the nominee?"" But Elaine C. Kamarck, who was in charge of counting delegates for Mondale, told PolitiFact Florida that Mondale could have won on pledged delegates alone. ""It wasn’t that there weren’t enough -- the California primary came up short for him, so he didn’t get the magic number. There were plenty of delegates without the superdelegates to go over the top,"" she said. ""I’d say they were very helpful in helping him get the nomination, but he would have gotten the nomination even without that burst in the end, because there were enough random uncommitted delegates that he could have done it."" (Uncommitted delegates are similar to superdelegates in that they can make up their mind at the convention. But superdelegates hold that position by virtue of their office -- for example, the president is one.) Kamarck, who worked in Bill Clinton’s White House, is a superdelegate who plans to vote for Hillary Clinton and is a lecturer at Harvard. In subsequent elections, a Democratic candidate had enough delegates early on so that the superdelegates were essentially irrelevant. In 2008, Clinton led Barack Obama in the superdelegate count in January but he overtook her by May. She suspended her campaign in June a couple months before the convention. Super delegates in 2016 So could superdelegates make a difference this year? It’s too soon to say for certain, but it appears unlikely. The blog fivethirtyeight determined in February that ""superdelegates are mathematically relevant when a candidate has 41.2 percent to 58.8 percent of elected delegates."" As of March 22, if we count pledged delegates Clinton has about 48 percent of the needed 2,383 delegates to win, while Sanders has 35 percent. Julia Azari, professor of political science at Marquette University, told NPR that superdelegates would only make a difference if it’s close. ""I think the only chance a superdelegate will make a difference is if there isn’t really an obvious preference coming out of the electorate part of the process."" Our ruling Wasserman Schultz says superdelegates ""have never been a determining factor in who our nominee is since they've been in place since 1984."" The first election where Democrats used superdelegates was in 1984, where they helped Mondale secure the nomination on the first ballot at the convention. It’s not clear that they were the ""determining"" factor. Some say Mondale would have won without them. Since that time, a Democrat has won the nomination early enough where the superdelegates haven’t mattered.

"['Nevada', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Danny Tarkanian']","
Despite new taxes, Legislature didn't forgo spending cuts
","Nevada lawmakers passed the largest tax increase in state history last summer, and its specter continues to loom over many 2016 contests. Republican state Senate majority leader and congressional candidate Michael Roberson, who played a key role in shepherding over $1 billion in new and extended taxes through the Legislature, is fending off attacks from his rivals in the 3rd Congressional District Republican primary. Some of the most pointed criticism comes from real estate owner and candidate Danny Tarkanian, who accused Roberson of failing to enact long-held conservative goals despite unprecedented Republican control of the state Legislature. Here’s what Tarkanian, son of famed UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, told Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston in February. ""You don't raise taxes until you do everything you can to cut spending, and they didn't do anything to cut spending,"" he said. ""For the first time in 89 years, the Republicans controlled the Assembly, state Senate and governor's office, they didn't do one single thing to cut spending, cut wasteful tax dollars that are being used, and instead they raised taxes."" (The comment is 18 minutes into the interview.) Tarkanian has sought to cast himself as the anti-Roberson in the primary tussle, so we thought it was worth delving into last year’s budget battles to separate truth from fiction. Reached for comment by PolitiFact, Tarkanian backtracked from his comments on Ralston and said he was making a ""general statement"" in light of the historic tax increase. He said Republicans missed an opportunity to substantially restructure spending in areas like collective bargaining and the state’s public employee retirement system (PERS). ""Because the GOP controlled both branches of the Legislature and the governor’s office for the first time in 89 years, for the first time in 89 years our state government could have made meaningful (substantive) cuts to government spending, and they should have before they raised taxes,"" he said in an email. Tarkanian’s comments do point to an interesting question -- what exactly did Nevada lawmakers do to reduce spending outside of the tax increase? There’s no easy way to compare spending cuts from one two-year budget to another. (Nevada’s part-time Legislature necessitates two-year budgets.) Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson, who chaired one of the legislative finance committees, requested that legislative staffers document spending cuts in response to questions from PolitiFact. Anderson said lawmakers cut an additional $150 million from ""ineffective programs"" in the two-year budget to free up funds for increased needs in areas like state spending for Medicaid. He said lawmakers tried to leverage most of the new spending towards K-12 education, and finessed other areas of the budget to avoid raising taxes even more. ""Had we just left everything as is, and added our education spending, we would have to raise taxes that much more to cover everything,"" Anderson said. Republican Assemblywoman Jill Dickman, a finance committee member who voted against the tax increase, recalled roughly the same amount of cuts as claimed by Anderson and said lawmakers spent a huge amount of time reviewing spending and ways to save money. ""That’s all we did, was go through the budget,"" she said Defining a ""spending cut"" can be subjective — lawmakers ""cut"" around $108 million from the governor’s recommended budget and ""cut"" from specific line items and programs, but it’s less clear if those translated into net savings. Either way, the savings make up a small percentage of the $7.3 billion two-year budget, especially including the $1.4 billion in new and extended taxes. Tarkanian said he didn’t mean to imply that no spending cuts at all were made, but instead bemoaned the wasted opportunity to create ""substantive"" changes in three areas: collective bargaining, public employee retirement benefits and prevailing wages (mandatory minimum pay for contractors on publicly-funded projects). Looking back at the legislative session, lawmakers generally backed more even-keeled legislation rather than sweeping changes favored by some Republican legislators. A wide-ranging effort dubbed ""Union Armageddon"" failed to make much headway, while a Roberson-sponsored bill changing several portions of collective bargaining law for school administrators and teachers passed with nearly unanimous support. Roberson also sponsored a widely supported bill amending the state’s public employee retirement system and helped usher through another effort lowering the prevailing wage on school construction projects (a concession from an earlier bill that eliminated it entirely). The right-leaning Nevada Policy Research Institute agreed with Tarkanian, and complained that some of Roberson’s bills only created ""cosmetic changes,"" whereas other proposed Republican legislation had the potential to severely disrupt the status quo. ""It’s easy to argue that none of these initiatives did much to pull back the wasteful spending of tax dollars, but they were certainly billed as attempts to do so,"" NPRI spokesman Michael Schaus said in an email. ""The best I can say is that there were virtually no cuts to the largest drivers of state spending."" Roberson’s campaign claims the PERS legislation, which slightly lowers benefits to new recipients and made several other changes, would save the system $1 billion every decade once fully implemented. But the vast majority of changes in the bill only apply to new employees, meaning it will take decades for any significant savings to be realized. The entitlement board testified that the legislation would have a ""positive impact on the long term financing,"" but it couldn’t predict an exact savings amount due to the long time period in which the savings would take place. The campaign also noted that Roberson and other lawmakers cut more than $500 million from the state budget in 2011 to make up for sagging state revenues after the foreclosure crisis, making it difficult to find new areas to cut in 2015. Our ruling Tarkanian says that the Republican-controlled Legislature ""didn’t do one single thing to cut spending"" in the face of historic tax increases. Taken straightforwardly, Tarkanian’s claim isn’t true — lawmakers shaved off around $150 million in spending between the last two budgets, and approved several bills designed to rein in entitlement spending over the long run. There’s a sliver of truth in Tarkanian’s follow-up, as Republican legislative leadership generally stuck with less severe changes to major state spending drivers like collective bargaining and public employee retirement than what was prefered by more conservative groups and legislators. But to say lawmakers didn’t do anything to address spending isn’t accurate. We rate his statement as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A47F680>],/factchecks/2016/mar/22/danny-tarkanian/despite-new-taxes-legislature-didnt-forgo-spending/
"['Global News Service', 'Human Rights', 'Raúl Castro']","
Are there political prisoners in Cuba?
","Cuba President Raúl Castro criticized the United States’ human rights record — and defended his own — in a joint press conference with President Barack Obama in Havana. At the first official meeting between leaders of the two countries in 50 years, Castro dinged the United States on the lack of universal access to health care, free education and equal pay before he fended off a CNN reporter’s question about political prisoners on the island. ""President Castro, my father is Cuban. He left for the United States when he was young. Do you see a new and democratic direction for your country? And why (do) you have Cuban political prisoners? And why don’t you release them?"" asked CNN’s Jim Acosta. (He then asked if Castro prefers Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.) ""Give me a list of the political prisoners and I will release them immediately,"" Castro said, according to the White House translation of his remarks. ""Just mention a list. What political prisoners? Give me a name or names. After this meeting is over, you can give me a list of political prisoners. And if we have those political prisoners, they will be released before tonight ends."" A Miami Herald translation put his response in slightly different words, though Castro’s message is not in dispute: ""Give me the list now of political prisoners to release. If there are political prisoners, they’ll be free before nightfall."" We thought we’d oblige. The task is complicated, given that human rights groups and dissidents themselves disagree on the definition of a political prisoner and just how many there are. But the notion that Cuba doesn’t have any at all — a notion that the regime has stuck by for decades — is doubtful.  A common understanding of the term is people imprisoned for exercising their beliefs peacefully. ""If you ask any autocrat in the world, they’re going to say the same thing. If you ask Maduro in Venezuela, if you ask Mugabe in Zimbabwe, Lukashenko in Belarus, Putin in Russia, they’ll all say nobody is in jail for political reasons,"" said Carlos Ponce, director of Latin America programs at the watchdog group Freedom House. Making a list, checking it thrice A few hours before Obama landed on the island on March 20, Cuban authorities arrested more than 50 Damas de Blanco (or Ladies in White) dissidents who were demanding increased human rights. This round of crackdowns was actually part of a weekly ritual — arrest, release and repeat — and part of the reason why tallying the exact number of political prisoners is so difficult. We compiled counts from several human rights and activist groups, as well as one vetted by Spanish-language network Univision. All together, the groups list 97 current political prisoners, 54 of whom appear on more than one list. On the low end, the human rights group Cuban Democratic Directorate counts 17, Univision named 19. Liudmila Cedeño, an activist with Unión Patriótica de Cuba, the country’s largest opposition group, told PolitiFact that 22 of its members are imprisoned. On the high end, the exile group Cuban American National Foundation lists 47 and the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba 51. International human rights groups have murkier tallies. Human Rights Watch pins the number at ""dozens,"" citing Cuba-based human rights groups. Amnesty International, meanwhile, recognized seven ""prisoners of conscience"" who were released in 2015, but none today. (More on this later.) Some experts contend that the lists are bogus, as some include people who would not normally be considered political prisoners. In 2010, for example, the Associated Press vetted a list of 167 political prisoners by Elizardo Sanchez, the head of the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation. About 50 people on the list ""were convicted of terrorism, hijacking or other violent crimes, and four are former military or intelligence agents convicted of espionage or revealing state secrets,"" according to the AP. Even for those who are traditionally recognized as political prisoners, Cuba rejects the term, Salim Lamrani, a Cuba expert at the University of Paris, told PolitiFact. ""Cuba’s point of view is the following: People condemned to jail sentences were not imprisoned because they expressed ideas against the authorities but because they accepted money from the U.S. government,"" he said, adding that he agrees with Castro that Cuba has no political prisoners.   Nonetheless, in 2015, Cuba released 53 people the United States named as political prisoners as part of the deal to normalize trade relations, even though the regime had denied their existence for decades, said Ponce of Freedom House. Out of the 97 people in our aggregate tally, here are examples of a few who are most in line with the traditional definition of political prisoner: • Yoelkis Rosabal Flores: A member of the Unión Patriótica de Cuba, he was arrested in May 2014 for staging a protest calling for the release of a fellow UNPACU member. Flores was charged with public disorder and sentenced to four years in jail. • Mario Ronaide Figueroa Dieguez: A member of the Unión Patriótica de Cuba, he was arrested in 2012 for staging a protest and told that he would be released if he left the union. Dieguez did but was rearrested in December 2014 (for reasons that aren’t clear) and sentenced to three years in jail. • Emilio Serrano Rodríguez: A member of the Unión Patriótica de Cuba, he was arrested in February 2015 for alleged ""illegal commercial transactions"" and currently waiting for a trial. According to the union, Rodríguez had participated in a protest. • Ricardo González Sendiña: A member of Frente de Acción Cívica Orlando Zapata Tamay and the son of Barbara Sendiña, a human rights activist with Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), Ricardo Sendiña was arrested in 2015 for an alleged crime of theft and slaughter of livestock. He was sentenced to six years. Ghosts of gulags past Gone are the days when people were explicitly jailed in Cuba for political opposition. The crackdown is manifesting in different ways on the island today. ""Nobody has a clue what is inside the jail system. It’s not clear,"" Ponce said. Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch’s Americas division, noted the regime also cracks down on opposition preemptively by ""blocking access to the websites of independent journalists, threatening and detaining people to prevent them from participating in peaceful protests and political meetings, and using an Orwellian law to imprison critics for ‘pre-criminal dangerousness.’ "" Ponce and Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, Amnesty International’s advocacy director for the Americas, emphasized that the penal code discourages political opposition indirectly by criminalizing contempt of public officials, public disorder and resistance to officials. Margerin told PolitiFact that just because Amnesty doesn’t list prisoners of conscience in Cuba currently doesn’t mean they don’t exist. The practice is rare as the burden of proof is high and often impossible to meet in a country that Amnesty hasn’t been able to access since 1990, she said. Take Amnesty’s last recognized prisoner of conscience. Danilo Maldonado, a 32-year-old graffiti artist known as ""El Sexto,"" was arrested in early 2015 after painting ""Fidel"" and ""Raul"" on two pigs. Amnesty declared him a prisoner of conscience because his court records showed that the nonviolent artists was imprisoned ""for the sole reason of his beliefs,"" said Margerin. For months, Maldonado was detained without any charges against him and released in October 2015. This practice of arbitrary arrests and temporary or short-term detention has become the new way of stifling dissent on the island. ""How can you dispute a detention if there are no charges or if the person disappeared for a short period of time?"" asked Margerin. The independent Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation reported about 8,600 politically motivated detentions in 2015 and 2,500 from the beginning of the year to March 4, 2016. Why are authorities more prone to short-term crackdowns than long-term imprisonment? For one, it’s cheaper and it’s easier, said Ponce of Freedom House. For another, more and more people are willing to demonstrate. ""Every Sunday, they take all the (Damas de Blanco) and all the other groups protesting. They arrest them and keep them for 48 hours and then release them. Then they do it again next Sunday,"" Ponce said, adding that this is the case for a lot of prominent activists like El Sexto. Activists and experts are cautiously optimistic that Obama’s visit could loosen things up, at least for a couple of days on the island. ""(Castro) would be re-enacting a ritual we’ve seen for decades when foreign leaders visit Cuba: A few jail cell doors swing open, but neither the laws nor the system changes,"" said Vivanco. ""Unless the government makes meaningful reforms, the regime can always resume jailing people for their speech and political activity once the visitor is wheels-up."" Our ruling Castro said there are no political prisoners in Cuba. Numerous activists and human rights groups beg to differ. While it is impossible to get an exact count, given the opaqueness of Cuba’s criminal justice system and the variations in definitions, there are at least a handful of political prisoners in the country. Castro is really downplaying his regime’s weekly crackdowns on demonstrators who want free expression.

"['National', 'Congress', 'Supreme Court', 'Mitch McConnell']","
Mitch McConnell exaggerates 'tradition' of not confirming election year Supreme Court nominees
","Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said his party is following a longstanding tradition by vowing not to consider any Supreme Court nominee until after a new president is inaugurated in 2017. McConnell has said he won’t even meet with federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February — let alone hold hearings or a vote on Garland. Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked McConnell if it would be hard to maintain such a rigid argument over the next several months. McConnell responded by listing prior comments from several Democratic senators. ""We're following the Biden rule,"" he said, referring to comments made by Vice President Joe Biden in 1992. ""And Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1992, in presidential election year, he said the Senate should not act on filling a Supreme Court vacancy if it had occurred that year. Harry Reid when he was back in 2005 said the president nominates, but the Senate doesn't have to vote. Chuck Schumer, who will be the next Democratic leader, said in 2007 they wouldn't confirm. The Democrats were in the majority in the Senate, they wouldn't confirm a Bush appointment to the Supreme Court if one occurred within 18 months of a presidential election. ""So, all we're doing, Chris, is following a long standing tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year."" It is more than a stretch for McConnell to say it’s a ""tradition"" for the Senate not to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year. In the past century, there have been 25 presidential elections. Just four Supreme Court seats opened up in those election years. In three of those instances, the Senate confirmed the president’s nominee, and just once — the only election-year court opening in the past 80 years — did the Senate refuse a nominee. So the scenario McConnell described has happened exactly once in the past century, in 1968, and that decision did not actually leave a vacancy on the court for any period of time. ""This is entirely a matter of circumstance,"" Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, previously told PolitiFact. It’s ""certainly not a norm or tradition by presidents refraining from nominating in a presidential election year, or by senators refusing to consider such nominations."" One-time 'tradition' In June 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren told President Lyndon Johnson he planned to retire. Johnson nominated sitting justice Abe Fortas to succeed Warren as chief. Fortas hit strong bipartisan Senate opposition and asked that his name be withdrawn for chief justice (though he stayed on the court as an associate justice). Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, as Fortas never became chief justice. While there was some opposition to the Fortas nomination based on the fact that Johnson was a lame duck, Fortas’ failed confirmation primarily resulted from ethical questions over fees he received, his prior decisions and his closeness with Johnson. In any case, the Senate’s decision not to confirm didn’t actually leave a vacant seat on the court because Warren chose to stay on the bench. Scalia’s seat, however, will remain vacant for as long as the Senate refuses to confirm a nominee. Without a ninth justice to break ties, it’s possible that many decisions will result in a 4-4 deadlock, which would mean the decisions of the lower court would stand. There are more examples in the past century of the Senate confirming Supreme Court nominees for seats that open up in election years, though it is still a rare occassion. You have to go back about 80 years, as McConnell correctly noted on Fox News Sunday. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Benjamin Cardozo. In 1916, Woodrow Wilson nominated John Clarke and Louis Brandeis, and they both made it through the Senate. McConnell’s talking point also ignores the two instances in the past century when the Senate confirmed Supreme Court nominees in election years, even though the seat opened up in the year prior. In 1988, the Senate confirmed Ronald Reagan’s nominee, Anthony Kennedy, though the seat became vacant in 1987. And in 1940, the Senate confirmed Franklin Roosevelt’s nominee, Frank Murphy, though the seat became vacant in 1939. A few 19th century presidents also nominated Supreme Court justices in election years, though not all of them were successful, according to a February 2016 article in the Cook Political Report by University of Georgia political scientist John Anthony Maltese. Maltese found that since the country’s founding, soon-to-depart presidents have made 32 Supreme Court nominations. Those nominations came within a period ranging from within 365 days of a successor’s election through the successor’s inauguration. Of those 32 nominations, the Senate confirmed 18 — hardly proving that McConnell or his Democratic opponents have reason to claim tradition. The record shows that Republicans’ inaction on Obama’s nominee is not rooted in some longstanding tradition, especially in the past century. SCOTUSblog editor Amy Howe wrote, ""The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election."" Our ruling McConnell said Senate Republicans are ""following a longstanding tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year."" McConnell’s use of the phrase ""longstanding tradition"" is misleading, as the Senate has chosen not to fill a Supreme Court seat that opens up during an election year just once in the past 100 years. The reality is that, at least in recent decades, the Senate has rarely been presented with the opportunity to consider a Supreme Court nominee in an election year. It’s so rare that there’s no fully analogous scenario to compare with the current debate over filling Scalia’s seat. McConnell’s statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978DC100>],/factchecks/2016/mar/22/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-exaggerates-tradition-not-confirmi/

Rep. Joe Pitts said 2015 saw an 80% increase in people who died as a result of terrorism
","Rep. Joseph Pitts, a Republican whose district encompasses Reading and Lancaster, used a recent Medium post to highlight the number of people killed by terrorists worldwide as he advocated for the continued usage of the U.S.’s Guantanamo Bay facility. The post, published at the end of February, opened with this statement: ""More people were killed by terrorists in 2015 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2014."" That seemed like a large increase, so we decided to check the claim. After an inquiry from PolitiFact, Pitts’ chief of staff Monica J. Volante said the statement should have read, ""More people were killed by terrorists in 2014 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2013."" So the actual statement is one year off. When the years in the statement are corrected, and based on that source, this appears to check out. The 2015 Global Terrorism Index published by the Australia-based Institute for Economics and Peace has, for the last three years, compiled information on terrorist activity dating back to 2000. It data comes from figures provided by the Global Terrorism Database hosted at the University of Maryland. The 111-page report states that 2014 was the deadliest on record worldwide, and 32,658 people died as a result of terrorism, representing an 80 percent jump from 2013 when about 18,000 people were killed. That increase is the largest yearly increase in the last 15 years, according to the report. The 2014 figure also represents a nine-fold increase compared to the number of people killed by terrorism worldwide in 2000. However, Pitts used the statement -- though the years were incorrect on first blush -- to segue into his views on keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, where about 90 terrorism suspects are held on the southern tip of Cuba. President Obama has long called for the closure of the prison and in February released a plan to transfer the remaining detainees to other facilities, including ones in the United States. Pitts’ Medium post focused largely on threats from terrorist groups Al-Qaeda and ISIS. But the Global Terrorism Index that was the basis of his initial claim reports that most deaths were by Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group based in Nigeria. In other words, those attacks have little to do with the argument Pitts builds upon: Proof that the U.S. should keep the detention center at Guantanamo Bay open. Nigeria saw the largest increase in terrorist deaths ever recorded in 2014 with 7,512 fatalities, a 300 percent increase from the year prior. Boko Haram accounted for 6,644 deaths and ISIS was responsible for 6,073. According to the Global Terrorism Index that Pitts’ office cited, much of the terrorism didn’t directly affect the United States. Of the deaths worldwide in 2014, 78 percent were concentrated in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. However, of the countries classified in the report as ""the West,"" the United States had the most deaths from terrorism in 2014, with 18 deaths and 19 attacks. Of those, all but five were committed by individuals and were, according to the report, ""largely motivated by right wing extremism or white supremacists."" Our ruling The initial claim made by Pitts says, ""More people were killed by terrorists in 2015 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2014."" While his office corrected those years to 2014 and 2013, respectively, to PolitiFact, the original Medium post was not updated as of publication time to reflect the correct years. Though the claim is accurate when the years are corrected, it leaves out context that the vast majority of the terrorism worldwide in 2014 did not directly affect the United States. Instead, it was largely concentrated in Africa and the Middle East. We rule the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097207780>],/factchecks/2016/mar/22/joe-pitts/rep-joe-pitts-said-2015-saw-80-increase-people-who/

FALSE: Donald Trump, Ted Cruz negotiating joint Republican ticket
","We spotted this headline below a post on the Dallas Morning News’ Trailblazers political news blog: ""Breaking: Cruz Negotiating With Trump for VP Spot."" Of course, that would be Texas Sen. Ted Cruz negotiating with Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump to serve as Trump’s November 2016 running mate. Huge! But wait--where’s the breathless CNN report, the insiders analysis on Fox News or even the basic newspaper scoop? We found nothing of the sort in online searches or in the Nexis news database and when we asked Cruz’s campaign about the Feb. 25, 2016, Elect Leaders post, spokesman Brian Phillips replied by email: ""Is this a serious request?"" Well, the  Cruz-negotiating-with-Trump item, also posted on ElectLeaders.com, which describes itself as keeping ""watch on our leaders and wannabe leaders,"" has a little traction. When we saw the headline March 21, 2016, the post had been shared on Facebook more than 34,000 times. Historical precedent And history shows a joint ticket could play out. In 2008, Barack Obama chose to run with a failed presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. In 1980, Ronald Reagan reached out to the defeated George H.W. Bush. Twenty years before, Democrat John F. Kennedy picked Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. So Trump-Cruz, pairing the frontrunner with the fellow running second, is possible. On the other hand, Phillips followed up with an email calling the post ""categorically false."" Anonymous sourcing For our part, we noticed a red flag in that the Elect Leaders item doesn’t quote named sources, not even a campaign spokeswoman offering a ""no comment."" Here’s what the post says: ""A high ranking Cruz campaign official has told Elect Leaders that Sen. Cruz is in negotiations with Mr. Trump to become his Vice Presidential Nominee after Rubio dropped out Tuesday."" That’s confusing timewise in that Sen. Marco Rubio dropped his presidential bid Tuesday March 15, 2016, after falling short of victory in his home state of Florida. The item goes on to say Cruz ""has been the most consistent performer in primaries behind Trump. They are seeing the writing on the wall and want to negotiate from a point of strength which will evaporate over time."" ""The official,"" again unnamed, ""stated Mr. Trump is interested in using Sen. Cruz’s ground game in the general election, likes his appeal to the conservative base and his stance on immigration. Of the other options for VP none hold as strong of an opinion on immigration outside of Gov. Jan Brewer from Arizona who is also being considered."" Brewer, by the way, is no longer governor. Finally, the post says, Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has an eye on shifting from vice president to the Supreme Court. Cruz, the item says, ""in exchange for his support is wanting to be named to the Supreme Court if an opening occurs while Mr. Trump is president. Mr. Trump does not see this as an issue and a small price to pay to bring Sen. Cruz his fundraisers, donors and staff on board,"" the post says. We tried to reach out to Elect Leaders about the post and didn’t hear back. Otherwise, we found no indication Trump-Cruz negotiations were (or are) afoot. A Trump maybe, Cruz's ‘zero interest’ In November 2015 -- eons ago in politicking time maybe especially given Trump’s references to Cruz as ""Lyin’ Ted""-- Trump told conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham that Cruz might be his choice for the No. 2 slot. To be fair, Trump declined to name a potential running mate from among his GOP opponents before noting his affection for Cruz. ""Well, I like like him,"" Trump said at the time. ""He’s backed everything I’ve said … Ted Cruz is now agreeing with me 100 percent."" But Trump also didn’t go further down the veep path, saying: ""I like to think of victory, I’ve had a lot of victories, and I like to do victories first, then start thinking about other things."" Cruz, meantime, said March 15, 2016 that he wasn’t inclined to join Trump on a single ticket, if offered the vice presidency. Conservative talk-show host Hugh Hewitt asked if Cruz ""would ever agree to serve as"" Trump’s ""vice president?"" ""I have absolutely zero interest in doing that,"" Cruz replied, going on to say he expected to overtake Trump and win the delegates needed to secure the presidential nomination. And on March 21, 2016, just before we completed this fact check, Cruz told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer: ""I have zero interest whatsoever"" in being Trump’s running mate. Blitzer had asked Cruz about the possibility by noting Trump earlier responded to Blitzer’s question about choosing Cruz as his running mate by saying: ""Crazier things happen in politics."" Our ruling On Facebook, Elect Leaders said Cruz and Trump are negotiating a Trump-Cruz Republican ticket. Anything is possible. But we don't see evidence the two camps are lately plotting a shared ticket. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Greta Thunberg did not pose with ISIS or George Soros
","On social media, some users are sharing misinformation about the 16-year-old activist who inspired the worldwide climate strike Sept. 20. One post, which was published on Facebook on Sept. 23, claims to include three photos of Greta Thunberg. It purports to show the Swedish teenager posing with an Islamic State member, philanthropist George Soros and an Antifa shirt. ""Well well well … do I need to explain anymore?"" reads text above the images, followed by the hashtags, ""#AnonsKnew #GretaThunberg #DeepStatePuppet."" A Facebook user who shared the post wrote next to the image, ""This is Typical Twisted Lies and Deceit, the Stupid Left Believes these Idiots!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And versions of it have been shared hundreds of times, so we wanted to see if the photos are real.   Based on our analysis, only one of the photos in the Facebook post is authentic — the other two are doctored or taken out of context. And the caption over the real one, which shows Thunberg wearing an antifascist shirt, isn’t accurate. The first image in the flagged post is a screenshot of another post from a Facebook user. It claims to show Thunberg posing with a bearded member of the Islamic State, the man’s arm around her shoulder as he speaks into a microphone. But the photo is not of Thunberg. A reverse image search reveals that the image is six years old and was taken from a video made during an ISIS-led Quran recitation competition in Aleppo, Syria, according to a news caption, as we noted in a previous fact check. The photo was published in a now-defunct article on an Iranian website in August 2014. And The Morocco World News reported around the same time that the girl in the video was 7 years old, tearful over mistakes she made in her recitation. While the child looks vaguely similar to Thunberg — who would have been 10 at the time — there’s no evidence that it’s her. The second image in the flagged Facebook post purports to show Thunberg posing next to Soros, a philanthropist and Democratic donor who is often the target of conservative attacks. But we found that the photo was digitally altered to make it look like Thunberg is chummy with the wealthy liberal financier. The original image actually shows Thunberg posing with former Vice President Al Gore in December. Thank you @algore for being a true pioneer. Very few people have done more. It was an honour to meet you. #climatecrisis #climatebreakdown pic.twitter.com/HzbvPcGkwu The altered version of the image appears to have been created by a French parody outlet in late August. The final photo in the suspect Facebook post shows Thunberg sitting on a couch while wearing a shirt that says ""antifascist all stars."" Text written over the image claims that the activist ""aligns herself with the Antifa terrorist organization."" Antifa is a loosely-affiliated group of left-wing activists whose mission is to counter the ideology of fascism. It has drawn criticism for its members’ willingness to use violence against far-right groups. The photo of Thunberg is real. On July 26, she tweeted that she had deleted a photo of herself wearing the shirt after learning that it could be linked to ""a violent movement."" However, in the same tweet, she said the shirt was borrowed. Yesterday I posted a photo wearing a borrowed T-shirt that says I’m against fascism. That T-shirt can apparently to some be linked to a violent movement. I don’t support any form of violence and to avoid misunderstandings I’ve deleted the post. And of course I am against fascism. We could find no evidence that Thunberg has participated in Antifa demonstrations. And being antifascist does not necessarily mean one supports the left-wing group Antifa. What’s more, the Facebook post’s claim that Antifa is a terrorist organization is dubious. The Central Intelligence Agency has not included the group on its list of such organizations, although some lawmakers have called for it to be. However, in the past, some officials in the intelligence community have called Antifa members ""domestic terrorists"" in confidential documents. A Facebook post claims to show Greta Thunberg posing with ISIS, George Soros and an Antifa shirt. The first photo was taken out of context and doesn’t show Thunberg at all. The second photo was digitally altered. The third is genuine, but Thunberg has said she borrowed the shirt at the time. Also, being antifascist is not the same as being a member of Antifa. The post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C24D880>],/factchecks/2019/sep/27/facebook-posts/greta-thunberg-did-not-pose-isis-or-george-soros/

Social media posts mislead on Democratic senators’ records
","Just before the start of the Houston presidential debate, some Facebook users spread misinformation about the legislative records of Democratic lawmakers running for president. One post claimed several of the senators running for president in 2020 had not passed any of the dozens of bills they had introduced. ""In Congress, Elizabeth Warren introduced 110 bills. 2 passed. Cory Booker introduced 120 bills. 0 passed,"" the Sept. 12 post reads. ""Kamala Harris introduced 54 bills. 0 passed. Bernie Sanders never held a job until age 53. He lived off of welfare and four different women."" The Facebook post, which was actually a screenshot of a tweet, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s a common strategy to attack politicians for their legislative records. And the post has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, so we wanted to check it out. It’s worth mentioning that it doesn’t include an assertion about Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. — the other senator vying for president. The tweet screenshotted in the Facebook post was originally published by Mark Simone a little after midnight on March 14. Simone is a conservative talk show host on WOR, a radio station based in New York City. We reached out to Simone for the sources behind his tweet, but we haven’t heard back. The post is inaccurate and paints an incomplete picture of the politicians’ effectiveness. For this fact-check, we first used the most stringent definition of the word ""passed"" — legislation that is signed by the president — to assess the validity of this post. Then we looked at how many of the senators’ bills had passed at least the Senate. We looked at each senator’s record at the time of Simone’s tweet to find out. Below are their records as of March 13, the last business day before the original post, according to GovTrack, a website that keeps tabs on congressional legislation. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. Introduced: 113 Passed Senate: 1 Signed by president: 2 Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. Introduced: 56 Passed Senate: 2 Signed by president: 0 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Introduced: 108 Passed Senate: 2 Signed by president: 0 Those numbers are close but not exactly to what Simone shared. Harris had introduced slightly more legislation than the radio host claimed in his tweet, while Booker and Warren had introduced slightly less. It’s possible that Simone used a separate source that counted each senator’s bills differently. But we don’t know for sure since he did not get back to us. However, all the senators had introduced legislation that had passed at least the Senate as of March 13. Booker even had two bills signed into law by President Barack Obama. So it’s inaccurate to say that none of them had any of their bills passed as of March 13. It’s even more inaccurate to repost that claim on Facebook six months after it was originally made. Finally, some experts doubt the premise of counting how many bills lawmakers have proposed. ""Sponsoring bills is a very limited and often questionable way of judging effectiveness,"" said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, in an email. ""Much key legislating now is done in omnibus bills, where much is done through amendments. Divided government shuts out minority lawmakers, especially now in this tribal era."" ""There are many, many other ways of being effective."" For instance, the Boston Globe reported in 2018 on a dozen or so examples Warren can point to in which she worked with Republicans to get bills to Trump’s desk.  ""She introduced legislation with GOP Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa to make hearing aids available over-the-counter, for example. She cosponsored the ‘Smart Savings Act’ with GOP Senator Rob Portman of Ohio to boost federal employees’ savings; an opioids bill with Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia; and, with John Cornyn of Texas, legislation to make it easier for veterans to obtain commercial driver’s licenses,"" the Globe wrote. Booker, meanwhile, is credited with helping pass the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that was signed into law by Trump. Booker was a co-sponsor on the legislation, which reversed harsh drug sentencing guidelines adopted in the 1980s and 1990s. Attacks on lawmakers’ legislative records are pretty common. So are falsehoods about Sanders’ life and career. Claims like those made in the Facebook post, that Sanders ""never held a job until age 53"" and that he ""lived off of welfare and four different women,"" have been circulating online since at least 2016 — the last time he ran for president. We rated a similar post False in March. In that fact-check, we noted that, after graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964, Sanders held a variety of odd jobs, including carpenter and preschool teacher. Those were likely not full time, but working part-time jobs is not the same as being unemployed. RELATED STORY: Fact-checking the Democratic presidential debate in Houston We also found no evidence to support the claim that Sanders lived off welfare, which generally consists of several government programs designed to help low-income individuals, before being elected.  A spokesperson for his campaign previously told us that the assertion was made-up. There have been media reports suggesting Sanders collected unemployment benefits in 1974, the second time he ran for U.S. Senate representing Vermont. He won only 4.1% of the vote that year, partially because he campaigned as a member of the Liberty Union Party, which advocates for democratic socialism.  Sanders also made unsuccessful bids for governor of Vermont in 1972, 1976 and 1986. He served as mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989 before joining the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991. In 2006, he was elected to the Senate. The source of the claim that Sanders lived off ""four different women"" is unclear. The senator has been married twice, but there’s no evidence to suggest they were the primary breadwinners. A Facebook post claimed, ""In Congress, Elizabeth Warren introduced 110 bills. 2 passed. Cory Booker introduced 120 bills. 0 passed. Kamala Harris introduced 54 bills. 0 passed. Bernie Sanders never held a job until age 53. He lived off of welfare and four different women."" The post attacks the legislative effectiveness of Senate Democrats. The original tweet is also inaccurate; at the time, all the senators mentioned had sponsored bills that passed the Senate. Two of Booker’s bills had even been signed by the president. As for Sanders, the post fabricates several parts of the senator’s biography. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3E8B00>],/factchecks/2019/sep/27/facebook-posts/social-media-posts-mislead-democratic-senators-rec/

Fact-checking Trump on hiring of minorities, women
","President Donald Trump during a forum with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said economic indicators painted a good picture for minority workers. Trump promoted low unemployment numbers for minorities and said that ""for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women."" Is Trump right that minorities and women for the first time account for most new hires of prime working age?  Trump’s re-election campaign told PolitiFact that Trump relied on reporting by the Washington Post. However, Trump imprecisely recounted the Post’s analysis. The Post found that for the first time, most new hires of prime working age are people of color, and that within that segment, women are predominantly driving the trend. An economist told us that the president’s statement and the wording in the Post article are significantly different. Washington Post analysis A Sept. 9 Washington Post article said that a ""surge of minority women getting jobs has helped push the U.S. workforce across a historic threshold. For the first time, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) are people of color."" The Post noted that ""minority hires overtook white hires"" in 2018 and that women were ""predominantly driving this trend.""  The newspaper said its findings were based on data the Department of Labor began collecting in the 1970s. The Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics told PolitiFact that it did not have data that identified ""new hires"" by age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, or sex. But it is theoretically possible, as the Post did, to analyze different sets of data to construct something that could be defined as a ""new hire,"" the bureau said. The Post’s analysis used detailed microdata from the Current Population Survey and other related statistics, said economists who guided the Post on how to analyze the labor market data. Specifically, the Post downloaded an extract from IPUMS (a project of the University of Minnesota) that ""allows researchers to create more detailed analysis than the number released every month in the well-known jobs report,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab who focuses on the U.S. labor market and whom the Post consulted about its data analysis. Overall, the Post found that based on data collected since the 1970s, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) were people of color, and women within that segment were pushing the trend.  That’s not the same as saying that minorities and women represent most of the new hires, as Trump said. ""The president's paraphrase of the findings is incorrect as it includes non-Hispanic white women,"" Bunker said. Ernie Tedeschi, a managing director and policy economist at Evercore ISI, also told us that the majority of prime-age job finders over the last 24 months have been people of color. Tedeschi uses the term ""job finders"" to refer to people who transition from nonemployment one month to having a job the next month. What’s influencing the trend? ""A lot of what’s going on here is population growth: prime-age America is much less white than it used to be,"" Tedeschi said. ""As a result, prime-age Americans of color, in particular women, are a growing share of the prime-age overall and nonemployed populations."" College attainment is also rising for everyone and especially for Americans of color, and that increases their chances of getting jobs, said Tedeschi, who offered the Post guidance on how to analyze the labor market data. The Post flagged additional factors driving the trend: Latino women being encouraged to work outside the home, a need for two incomes to pay the bills, and men being deported and women needing to enter the workforce to support their families. ""This trend will likely continue if the labor market remains strong,"" Bunker said. ""But an economic downturn might reverse the trend, and we might not see people of color make up most of new prime-age hires again until the labor market has strengthened for quite some time."" Our ruling Trump said, ""For the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women."" Trump’s re-election campaign said Trump’s claim is based on an analysis by the Washington Post. But Trump’s phrasing is off. The Post reported that according to data collected by the government since the 1970s, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) were minorities, and minority women were predominantly driving the trend. That isn’t the same as saying minorities and women (of all races and ethnicities) account for most of the new hires of prime working age. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Text above and below the image says: ""Keith Ellison the candidate for Minnesota attorney general and deputy chair of the democratic national committee did this to his girlfriend. But the Democrats don’t want to talk about this.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The information in the post is old. Ellison won the race for Minnesota’s attorney general in November 2018, after which he stepped down as deputy chair of the DNC.  But was the woman in the photo Ellison’s girlfriend? And is he responsible for the injuries? No, and no. The image is miscaptioned and has appeared online on various websites for several years. After running a reverse-image search we found the photo of the injured woman has been shared online since at least 2013 on Russian websites, with little description or detail. The photo started including Ellison’s name right around the time his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, accused him of abuse in 2018. In August of that year, Monahan’s son wrote a lengthy Facebook post that claimed Ellison abused his mother. Monahan confirmed her son’s account. In a statement, Ellison acknowledged the two were in a relationship that ended in 2016, but denied abusing her or that such a video existed.  It was in that context that this bruised photo of a woman began to circulate online, with people claiming it was Monahan. But Monahan herself tweeted a response saying that it was not her, and asked users not to share it ""with any connection to me or my story. Please honor this ladies wounds, pain and trauma.""

This GOP talking point that the Green New Deal will cost every household $600,000 is False
","Critics of the Green New Deal have circulated numerous false claims about the resolution — saying it would do everything from ban farting cows to eliminate air travel. Now the Republican Party of Florida is repeating a familiar talking point that the Green New Deal would create a scary pricetag. ""Democrats are proposing a radical $93 trillion Green New Deal which has been condemned by unions as a job killer and would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household,"" the Florida GOP tweeted Sept. 20. We previously fact-checked a claim that included the $93 trillion figure and rated it False. (President Donald Trump rounds up the claim to $100 trillion.) Here we will explain why the $600,000 figure is misleading, too. We found there is no government analysis of the cost of the Green New Deal per household. This is in part because the Green New Deal expresses goals; it doesn’t lay out specific policies. The $600,000 figure is based on adding up estimates in a report from a right-of-center group that cautioned it was an ""initial foray."" But the GOP talking point exaggerates and oversimplifies the analysis so much that the $600,000 figure can’t be considered accurate. The Green New Deal is a House resolution that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, introduced in February.  Resolutions are not actual, detailed legislation in themselves. In this case, the Green New Deal resolution in the House — and its companion measure that was introduced in the Senate — address broad principles to curb climate change and protect the environment. The resolutions extend into other domestic policy areas, as well, including jobs and health care.  But the proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures, and it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The House resolution was forwarded to several committees and subcommittees for further review. The Republican-led Senate, meanwhile, voted down the measure in March after it was introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and co-sponsored by many Senate Democrats running for president. The Florida GOP did not respond to our questions about the source of their evidence, but conservative news outlets have cited the $600,000 figure from a February report by the American Action Forum, a right-of-center think tank. The American Action Forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative advocacy organization. The American Action Forum acknowledged the difficulty in coming up with a number for the cost, saying that ""the breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess"" and that many of the proposed policies are redundant, ""which also complicates a precise analysis."" The report doesn’t mention the $600,000 figure or a total for the estimated per-household cost. However, it does show the estimated per-household cost for different parts of the Green New Deal, some of which were expressed in ranges. The Florida GOP’s tweet said that the Green New Deal  ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household"" -- which could suggest a massive tax increase for every family. But the American Action Forum analysis doesn’t actually say that every household will pay that cost in new taxes. And the costs identified in the analysis are spread over about a decade, from 2020 to 2029. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, told PolitiFact that he stands by the analysis. ""We never actually added it up,"" he said. ""We tried to get the order of magnitude, what are we looking at here? That was the intent of that first piece."" If we add up the high-end range in each category, that adds up to $671,010 between 2020 and 2029. If we added up the low-end range in each category, it adds up to $369,010.  To come up with estimates, the American Action Forum made a series of assumptions, such as that the Green New Deal would lead to enough high-speed rail transit available that air travel becomes unnecessary. The actual text of the resolution does not call for grounding airplanes. (A much-panned FAQ document written by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff said ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."" But a staff-written FAQ carries zero weight legislatively.) The American Action Forum analysis also factored in costs for Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. However, the text of the Senate resolution itself doesn’t include a statement on Medicare for All -- instead, it more broadly calls for ""high-quality health care."" (At least some of the resolution co-sponsors do support separate legislation Medicare for All however.) Holtz-Eakin said he had hoped more specifics would emerge from proponents allowing a more specific cost analysis, but that hasn’t happened, he said. The Florida GOP tweeted that the Green New Deal ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household."" The Green New Deal is a set of goals; it does not impose specific taxes. Instead, the $600,000 number comes from a brief that its author, the right-of-center American Action Forum, acknowledges is a preliminary and rough estimate. The analysis did not say that every household would pay an extra $600,000 in taxes. Instead, it estimated what costs might be under a range of scenarios over a period of 10 years.  It’s possible the resolution will eventually lead to legislation that can be formally analyzed for potential costs, but at this point, such costs can’t be determined. We rate this statement False.   ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C121A00>],/factchecks/2019/sep/27/republican-party-florida/gop-talking-point-green-new-deal-will-cost-every-h/

State rep exaggerates claim on Gov. Tony Evers veto of school technology program
","Partisan sniping over school spending in Wisconsin remains alive and well — even though the budget and capstone vetoes have been finalized for months. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, the former state schools superintendent, made education funding for K-12 education a centerpiece of his gubernatorial campaign and steered an extra $65 million toward schools with some of his 78 vetoes. But a recent Republican weekly radio address — aired by broadcasters around the state — leveled criticism for money Evers pulled away from one school program. State Rep. Rob Swearingen, R-Rhinelander, took aim at Evers for a veto that squelched a personal electronic computing devices program, which had funded equipment such as  Chromebooks and tablets. The program distributed $7.9 million to 353 districts in the 2018-19 school year, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. ""As of July, students in 352 districts across the state, plus three charter schools, benefitted from the program,"" Swearingen said in the Sept. 5, 2019, address. ""In vetoing this worthy program, Governor Evers took money off the table for kids across the state, saying it would be better spent in urban districts like Madison and Milwaukee."" Aside from his district count being off by one, Swearingen — representing a largely rural area — is making the case that Evers diverted money from around the state to funnel it to the state’s largest districts.  Let’s see if he’s right. As backup, Swearingen spokesman Joe Mesec pointed us to Evers’ veto message. The 65-page document included a brief description of Evers’ action on the computing device program. Here’s what Evers said: I object to providing funds to districts on a per-student basis using a membership calculation that does not match students enrolled in ninth grade. In addition, I believe that districts may choose to invest in technology through flexibility provided by the revenue limit increase and through the existing TEACH program. Further, these funds could more effectively be spent on programs that close achievement gaps. Mesec then connected that to a 2017 Wisconsin State Journal story that noted Milwaukee and Madison have the widest achievement gaps between white and black students. He also listed other stories that referenced achievement gaps being an urban issue. We’ll note that Evers’ veto lists several reasons in addition to the one Swearingen mentioned, including the way funding in this program was allocated and how other programs could address that need. And Evers’ reference was not specific to racial achievement gaps, as Swearingen assumes in connecting this claim to Milwaukee and Madison. There are several other types of achievement gaps, with some overlap between them. For example, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum released a report in March that detailed the low scores in math and reading posted in Wisconsin by English learners, students with limited English proficiency. They found the three districts with the highest percentage of English learners (more than 30% of the student body) were Arcadia, Abbotsford and Independence — all small, rural districts. And a DPI program launched in 2015-16 aims at closing the income-based achievement gap. Melissa Baldauff, an Evers spokeswoman, noted Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay are among the districts outside Milwaukee and Madison that face black-white achievement gaps. And she pointed out Evers didn’t move the money as Swearingen implied. ""Evers was saying broadly that funding to close achievement gaps is a more effective way to spend the dollars we do have,"" Baldauff said. ""He didn’t direct the money into other things."" Swearingen claimed Evers vetoed a statewide computer devices program, ""saying it would be better spent in urban districts like Madison and Milwaukee.""  The setup paints Evers as not prioritizing rural districts like those Swearingen represents. But Swearingen offered no convincing evidence to support his claim. Evers didn’t specifically shift the funds. And nothing in the veto message signals a rural-to-urban shift like the one Swearingen suggests — much less anything specific to Milwaukee and Madison. Evers offered ideological objections based on how funding was allocated and how he felt education dollars could be best spent. We rate Swearingen’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF9540>],/factchecks/2019/sep/27/rob-swearingen/state-rep-exaggerates-claim-gov-tony-evers-veto-sc/

Is unemployment for women at lowest point in almost 70 years?
","The West Virginia Republican Party recently tweeted praise for President Donald Trump’s handling of the economy, particularly as it relates to women. On Aug. 27, the state party tweeted, ""Women’s unemployment has been lower under President Trump than it’s been in nearly 70 years. #WVGOP #WomenforTrump #WV4Trump."" Women's unemployment has been lower under President Trump than it's been in nearly 70 years. #WVGOP #WomenforTrump #WV4Trump https://t.co/88rzHcS16h   Is that correct? We took a closer look. (The West Virginia Republican Party did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) According to the Federal Reserve Economic Data website, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate for women was 3.7% in July 2019, the latest data that was known at the time of the party’s tweet. In August 2019, the rate ticked down slightly, to 3.6%; the best showing came in April, with a rate of 3.4%. Here’s a chart showing the full run of data for women’s unemployment.   The data shows one period with a lower unemployment rate for women: a 12-month period in 1952 and 1953. That’s about 66 years ago, which qualifies as ""nearly 70 years"" ago. Brian Lego, an economist at West Virginia University, told PolitiFact that the Korean War in the early 1950s created some labor market distortions. Because the military draft pulled men out of the labor market, temporary jobs opened up for women. It’s important to note that presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. In fact, the unemployment rate for women has been falling since 2010, when President Barack Obama was president. The unemployment rate for women fell from 8.7% in October 2010 to 4.7% when Obama left office in January 2017 -- a decline of four percentage points, or almost half. Since Trump entered the White House, women’s unemployment has fallen by one point, or almost one-fifth. The West Virginia Republican Party said, ""Women’s unemployment has been lower under President Trump than it’s been in nearly 70 years."" The actual number is 66 years, which qualifies as ""nearly 70."" However, it’s important to note that presidents don’t deserve full credit or blame for such statistical changes on their watch.  The statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C06FE80>],/factchecks/2019/sep/26/west-virginia-republican-party/unemployment-women-lowest-point-almost-70-years/

No, Marcus Aurelius didn’t say this about opinions and facts
","On Sept. 23, an Instagram account called @jimcarreyhere posted an illustration of a man with this quote attributed to the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius: ""Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not a truth.""  We have a few opinions of our own about this one. And others had questions — this post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which also owns Instagram.)  First, there’s the Instagram account. It has 361,000 followers and the bio suggests that the account belongs to the actor Jim Carrey — it has an illustration of his face and says, ""Alrighty then.""   But the account isn’t verified with a blue checkmark, unlike the real @JimCarrey Twitter account. That account’s bio says: ""The ONLY official social media account for Actor Jim Carrey!""and has 18.5 million followers.  Second, the illustration of the man in the Instagram post doesn’t look like Marcus Aurelius. He looks like Caracalla, another Roman Emperor who was given the name Septimius Bassianus at birth and renamed Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.  But Caracalla a.k.a. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus is not the same Marcus Aurelius who wrote philosophical musings in ""Meditations"" and to whom this quote is often attributed. We didn’t find the quote searching an online version of the book and we couldn’t find a credible citation showing that Marcus Aurelius said it. Dirk Baltzly, a philosophy and gender studies professor at the University of Tasmania in Australia, told us it’s ""just vaguely possible"" that the quote in the Instagram post ""is a highly creative"" translation or paraphrase from a passage in Meditations. One edition translates the original Greek this way:  ""But among the principles readiest to thine hand, upon which thou shalt pore, let there be these two. One, that objective things do not lay hold of the soul, but stand quiescent without; while disturbances are but the outcome of that opinion which is within us. A second, that all this visible world changes in a moment, and will be no more; and continually bethink thee to the changes of how many things thou hast already been a witness. ‘The Universe—mutation: Life—opinion.’ "" But, Baltzly said, this is an old-fashioned and poor translation. Marcus Aurelius’s view wasn’t that there are no facts. Rather, he believed there are facts but that properly understood, none of the facts of the external world should disturb us.  ""What disturbs us is the (allegedly false) opinion that, for instance, death is a bad thing or that losing your money really harms you,"" Baltzly told us in an email. ""In truth, the only thing that should disturb you is the realization of your own moral feelings and — unlike all the crap in the world — that’s something you yourself can fix."" Because the universe is constantly changing and each person plays a relatively small part in the world and then dies, Baltzly said, ""everyone has a limited perspective on it."" But that doesn’t mean that people don’t know anything or that there are no objective facts and only perspectives. ""The emperor was a stoic — not a skeptic,"" Baltzly said.

Sitting up too quickly in the middle of the night won’t cause your sudden death
","If you’re prone to waking up and worrying in the middle of the night, a recent Facebook post probably didn’t help: It says you might die if you get out of bed.  ""Avoid sudden death at night,"" the Aug. 30 post begins, offering what it calls a doctor’s advice.  ""It often happens,"" the post continues. ""A person who always looks healthy has passed away at night. We often hear stories of people saying: ‘Yesterday, I was talking with him, why did he die suddenly?’ The reason is that when you get up at night to go to the toilet, it often happens quickly. We stop immediately and the brain does not have blood circulation.""  The post then says that the three and a half minutes after you wake up are important because ""by suddenly rising, the brain will be anemic and will cause heart failure for lack of blood."" Therefore, according to the post, you should stay in bed for a minute and a half when you wake up, sit in bed for another half minute, and then lower your legs and sit on the edge of the bed for another half minute.  ""After three and a half minutes, your brain will no longer be anemic and your heart will not weaken, which will reduce the risk of falling and sudden death,"" the post says, encouraging people to share this guidance with family and friends.  On Facebook, this post was shared more than 10,000 times and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We turned to Dr. Sina Gharib, an associate professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, for help parsing these online directions. He told us he knows of no evidence to corroborate the Facebook post.  ""The only caveat is that, especially in elderly (and usually in the setting of using blood pressure medication, so dehydration), sudden rise from supine to upright positions may cause a drop in blood pressure,"" he said in an email. ""Lower blood pressure to the brain can cause dizziness or even a blackout (not death)."" This is known as ""orthostatic hypotension,"" he added, and in such cases people should be careful about how they get out of bed. ""Initially sitting then rising may be important,"" he said. There’s also a condition called micturition syncope, said Dr. Hashim Hashim, a urological surgeon and professor at Bristol Urological Institute. If someone gets out of bed quickly to use the bathroom, their blood pressure could drop causing something called ""postural hypotension,"" he explained. Someone could faint due to that sudden drop in blood pressure and, ""obviously, if they faint and fall and hit their head on something hard they could sustain a head injury and die,"" he said. But he doesn’t know of a direct link between the condition and death absent a secondary injury. And, of course, deaths during the night do happen ⁠— and for many reasons, Gharib said, including due to drug overdoses. One of the most common causes is known as ""sudden cardiac death."" This is often due to an underlying coronary heart disease that may have been unrecognized, Gharib said. There’s also some evidence that untreated sleep apnea may increase the risk of sudden death, possibly as a trigger for an abnormal heart rhythm.  But that’s unrelated to anything described in this Facebook post.  We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AB9980>],/factchecks/2019/sep/26/viral-image/sitting-too-quickly-middle-night-might-make-you-di/

Donald Trump’s boasts about former Ukrainian prosecutor’s fairness ring false
","President Donald Trump in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart repeatedly suggested that an ousted Ukrainian prosecutor enjoyed a reputation for fairness when then-vice president Joe Biden in 2015 stepped in to press for the prosecutor’s removal.  A White House summary of a July 25 telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows Trump describing Ukraine’s former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin as a ""very good"" and ""very fair prosecutor."" ""A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved,"" Trump said, according to the readout, later adding, ""I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor."" A few moments later, Trump added, ""The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … ."" We decided to fact-check whether the Ukrainian prosecutor enjoyed the positive reputation Trump claimed. The notion that Shokin was widely seen as a ""very good"" and ""very fair prosecutor"" is inconsistent with our findings. Trump’s claim requires some additional context. In his phone call with Zelenksy, Trump never referred to Shokin by name. But the context of the call, including his remarks about Biden, seems to make clear that Shokin is who Trump had in mind. In fact, by the time he resigned, he was widely considered corrupt and ineffective. The White House did not respond to our request for comment and for information that would support this positive view of Shokin’s tenure. We also independently looked for affirmative reviews of Shokin’s work and weren’t able to find anything substantive or specific.  Trump and Zelensky discussed the possibility of reviving a dormant Ukrainian government investigation into a Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, served as a board member on while his father was vice president. (See our related fact-check.) Trump’s reference to the Ukrainian prosecutor being ""shut down"" is an apparent reference to Shokin’s ouster in 2016, which then-Vice President Joe Biden helped orchestrate.  Biden had assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine amid a popular revolution that in early 2014 led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired. According to Biden, it worked.  During an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, the former vice president made the following remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience: ""I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t. ... ""They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" (We’ll note that this transcript shows that Trump mischaracterized Biden’s remarks when he told Zelensky in their call that ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution"" into the company his son was involved in. Biden bragged about getting rid of an ineffective prosecutor, not stopping an investigation.) Trump’s boasts about Shokin — that he was widely seen as a ""very good"" and ""very fair prosecutor"" —  clash with the view of many Western leaders and institutions. Largely, they were united in seeking Shokin’s removal.  When Shokin was sacked on March 26, 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption. Here’s how the New York Times described it: MOSCOW — Bowing to pressure from international donors, the Ukrainian Parliament voted on Tuesday to remove a prosecutor general who had clung to power for months despite visible signs of corruption.  In fairness, the Times’ also said experts on Ukrainian politics said Shokin ""had played an important role in balancing competing political interests, helping maintain stability during a treacherous era in the divided country’s history."" But strong Western opposition to Shokin was well established prior to his ouster. For instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that ""it’s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue"" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate. Steven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. Pifer told PolitiFact that ""virtually everyone"" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine ""felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office."" This view is reflected in a Sept. 2015 speech that then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, delivered in Odessa, Ukraine (emphasis ours): ""There is one glaring problem that threatens all of the good work that regional leaders here in Odessa, in Kharkiv, in Lviv, and elsewhere are doing to improve the business climate and build a new model of government that serves the people,"" Pyatt said, later adding, ""That obstacle is the failure of the institution of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine to successfully fight internal corruption. Rather than supporting Ukraine’s reforms and working to root out corruption, corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General’s office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform.""  Anders Åslund, a resident senior fellow at Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, agreed that criticism of Shokin was widespread. ""Shokin was perceived as utterly corrupt and very close to President Poroshenko,"" Åslund said. ""His corruption was exposed by his two young and obviously honest deputies"" who were forced out. The case that attracted the most negative attention to Shokin involved the arrest of a Kyiv city prosecutor, Åslund said. During the arrest, authorities seized several million dollars worth of diamonds at the prosecutor’s home. Not only did Shokin release the prosecutor, but he also returned his diamonds. ""The steady complaint was that Shokin blocked all attempts to have the Yanukovych crooks arrested or any of the billions they had stolen recovered,"" Åslund said. ""Shokin successfully blocked any asset recovery, and he did so in a very blatant fashion."" Domestically, Shokin’s corruption was the cause célèbre of repeated street protests organized by anti-corruption activists. As news of Trump’s interaction with Zelenksy made headlines in recent weeks, Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, began to tweet images and videos of 2015 protests against Shokin.  One photograph she posted, from July 2015, showed a protest before the prosecutor general's office to demand Shokin resign ""because of his corruption, attacks on reformers and failure to investigate corruption of Yanukivych associates."" (The photograph is similar to photographs in the Associated Press database of the same event on the same date.)   This is July 24, 2015. Jointly with other NGOs we are running protest in front of prosecutors general office demanding Shokin resignation - because of his corruption, attacks on reformers and failure to investigate corruption of Yanukivych associates https://t.co/kv46MavjH3 pic.twitter.com/kr8oELbPpR When Shokin was ultimately sacked in early 2016, his reputation was in tatters, according to the Kyiv Post, Ukraine’s oldest English language newspaper. ""By the end of his term he was likely one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine,"" the Kyiv Post wrote, ""having earned a bad reputation for inaction and obstructing top cases."" Trump said ""a lot of people are talking about"" the removal of a ""very fair prosecutor"" in Ukraine.  The former Ukrainian prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, whom Trump appeared to be referencing, did not enjoy the sterling reputation Trump claimed. Far from it. Many Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin’s removal. Domestically, he was ""likely one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine"" over his reputation for corruption, the subject of popular street protests.   We rate this claim False.

There was a dog named Capitán who slept at his owner’s graveside, according to Argentinian newspaper La Voz del Interior, but it wasn’t the dog pictured. In 2012, the paper reported that in Villa Carlos Paz, a mutt called Capitán, described as having some German Shepherd in him, disappeared after his owner, Miguel Guzmán, died in March 2006. They thought the dog had died until Guzmán’s widow and son went to the cemetery about 15 blocks away and found Capitán there. The dog wouldn’t follow them and instead stayed in the cemetery, according to La Voz. The following Sunday, the dog walked home with them ""but then returned to the cemetery,"" La Voz quotes Guzmán’s widow as saying.  Capitán would sometimes visit the house but ""he returns to the cemetery,"" La Voz quotes Guzmán’s son as saying.  The newspaper reported that it confirmed the story with Héctor Baccega, the director of the Municipal Cemetery of Villa Carlos Paz. Cemetery employees saw Capitán enter the cemetery for the first time in January 2007. A video with the news story shows Capitán to be black with tan markings. ""Every day, at six in the afternoon, he goes and lies down in front of that grave,"" Baccega is quoted as saying. ""Capitán walked the cemetery with me every day. But when that time comes he goes to the bottom, where his master’s grave is."" In February 2018, more than a decade after Miguel Guzmán’s death, Capitán also died, according to La Paz. He had lived in the cemetery among other stray dogs but he spent nights at his master’s grave, the paper says. In August, Carlos Paz debuted a monument to the dog in the cemetery.  We don’t know the origins of the image featured in the Facebook post, but it’s appeared on websites like Reddit, where it was shared in 2017 under the title: ""Must have been a good human. Dogs are something else."" After it was posted on imgur.com a few days later, one user commented:  ""FYI, this is from a Facebook post that clarified the dog moved from spot to spot, not keeping any specific headstone company."" This Facebook post appears to blend fact with fiction. A dog named Capitán — Spanish for captain — reportedly slept by his deceased owner’s grave every night. But he was a black German Shepherd mix — not at all similar to the yellow lab depicted in the photo — and he apparently spent most of his time at the cemetery, not, not arriving at its cemetery gates every night. And this all happened in Argentina, not the United States. So while the U.S. Marine Corps motto of Semper Fi, or ""always faithful,"" might apply, the American flag emoji does not. We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A58C40>],/factchecks/2019/sep/26/viral-image/dog-named-capitan-known-sleeping-his-owners-grave-/

No evidence Saddam Hussein said this about American politics
","Facebook users are sharing a supposed quote of Saddam Hussein — and warning that Democrats are using his advice as political strategy.  ""We cannot defeat America by the sword. America must be defeated within their politics,"" reads the statement attributed to the deceased Iraqi dictator. The Feb. 14 Facebook post  goes on to say that Hussein ""was telling the truth and this is exactly what the Democrats are doing by seating one Muslim at a time."" It’s been shared more than 93,000 times and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Searching for the quote online we found 10 results, but they were from meme websites like me.me or awwmemes.com,  In 2006, Hussein testified in his defense against charges of crimes against humanity, and he called on Iraqis to join together to defeat the U.S.-led occupation in Iraq, according to C-SPAN. But in reviewing that testimony, we didn’t read anything like the quote that appears on Facebook.  Searching for the quote in the news archive Nexis we found no results. Nor did we find it searching Google Books, or reviewing online versions of ""Saddam’s War of Words"" and ""The Saddam Tapes,"" which contains annotated transcripts of audio recordings of meetings between Hussein and his allies.  We reached out to the author of ""The Saddam Tapes"" and others who have studied Iraq and Hussein, but they were all unfamiliar with the quote.  Kevin Woods, the book’s author, said ""the idea behind the quote is implicit in many of the discussions between Saddam and Tariq Aziz,"" Hussein’s top aide, but that the quote wasn’t something he recognized.  Samuel Helfont, assistant professor of strategy and policy, U.S. Naval War College, told us in an email that ""it sounds like something he would say, and that was certainly his strategy in the 1990s/early 2000s.""  Amatzia Baram, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Haifa in Israel, said the only case where he sees Hussein implying an idea like the statement in the Facebook post stems from his 1990 meeting with April Glaspie, then the U.S. ambassador to Iraq. It was a week before Hussein invaded Kuwait, Baram said, and he told Glaspie that since the Vietnam War, the United States can’t afford casualties but Hussein can. (""Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000 dead in one battle,"" he told Glaspie, according to Newsweek.) ""The connotation was that American war policies can be influenced through casualties,"" Baram said.  If evidence emerges that Hussein made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post, we’ll reconsider our ruling.

No, police aren’t warning shoppers to use wipes on carts over fentanyl overdose risk
","A viral Facebook post claims police are warning shoppers to use wipes on shopping carts to prevent overdosing on fentanyl residue:  ""You know when you go to Wal-Mart and the grocery store and they have the wipes to clean your cart handle? How many of you don’t use them? Well, I do and I always thought of the germs only. Was told that the police also suggests (sic) you do it because of all the problems with drugs, if someone has Fentanyl still on their hands and they touch that cart they transfer it to the cart, then you get it on you, one drop can cause death. Scary but worth taking the time to clean the handle. All you have to do is rub your nose or touch your child’s mouth. Copy and post. I did! This is a scary truth."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim is inaccurate. First, police are not warning about shopping cart handles as a means of fentanyl overdose. And second, a close look into the medical research shows that overdose through skin contact is highly unlikely. The idea that a small amount of fentanyl residue can cause an overdose by skin contact alone took off following a May 2017 incident in which an Ohio police officer said he came into contact with the residue while searching a car and later began to overdose after he brushed some off his shirt. Reports at the time said it took multiple doses of Narcan, an emergency ""opioid antagonist"" used to counter the effects of overdose, to revive him. Warnings about the dangers of the drug residue went viral by November 2017 after someone posted a variation of this notice on the Facebook page of the Leachville Police Department in Arkansas. The department deleted the post shortly after and, according to contemporaneous reports, posted an update apologizing for the misinformation:  ""The post about the fentanyl was sent (to) me from another officer at another department. I simply shared it. I'm (sic) should have checked into it further before I posted it. Sorry for the confusion."" First, there are different forms of fentanyl. One can be legally prescribed as a skin patch that regulates the release of the drug through the skin. But, in this case, the viral post is referring to the powder form of street fentanyl, which can be 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and can cause death in small doses.   There is no question that there is a legitimate risk of fentanyl overdose when it is ingested or injected intravenously, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and such overdoses are on the rise. But while skin contact can be an exposure route, experts from the CDC say it isn’t likely to lead to an overdose unless there is a large amount of highly concentrated powder: ""Responders are most likely to encounter illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogues in powder, tablet, and liquid form. Potential exposure routes of greatest concern include inhalation, mucous membrane contact, ingestion, and percutaneous exposure (e.g., needlestick). Any of these exposure routes can potentially result in a variety of symptoms that can include the rapid onset of life-threatening respiratory depression. Skin contact is also a potential exposure route, but is not likely to lead to overdose unless large volumes of highly concentrated powder are encountered over an extended period of time. Brief skin contact with fentanyl or its analogues is not expected to lead to toxic effects if any visible contamination is promptly removed."" When it comes to whether an overdose is possible after someone touches the residue to their ""nose or mouth"" as the post warns, PolitiFact reached out to the American Chemical Society, a nonprofit organization that supports scientific inquiry in the field of chemistry. ""Yes, small amounts of fentanyl can be picked up from surfaces and absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes (e.g. nasal passages),"" Richard Sachleben, a retired chemist, wrote in an email. ""However, it would take a pretty substantial level of surface contamination for a person to receive a fatal dose of fentanyl this way. The human lethal dose is not well established, but probably on the order of milligrams for adults, and lower for children and infants. To get a milligram dose of fentanyl from a shopping cart, for instance, would probably require tens to hundreds of milligrams to be present on the surface, which is pretty unlikely."" Medical experts who looked into the May 2017 account of the Ohio police officer who was treated following his exposure to fentanyl took issue with the notion that it was the casual physical contact that caused his reaction. They said that while it was possible the officer accidentally ingested the powder, overdosing by only touching a small amount was implausible.  Jeremy Samuel Faust, an emergency physician at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, wrote a piece in Slate questioning the incident: ""Neither fentanyl nor even its uber-potent cousin carfentanil (two of the most powerful opioids known to humanity) can cause clinically significant effects, let alone near-death experiences, from mere skin exposure … Each of the medical and toxicology professionals I asked agreed that it’s implausible that one could overdose from brushing powder off a shirt."" Faust also cites Ed Boyer in the article, a medical toxicologist, who said that fentanyl applied dry to the skin ""will not be absorbed.""  Around the same time, the American College of Medical Toxicology issued a new position statement on fentanyl, saying that ""incidental dermal absorption is unlikely to cause opioid toxicity."" A viral Facebook post says police are warning shoppers to use wipes to clean their cart handles to mitigate the risk of overdosing on fentanyl residue. The risk of overdosing from fentanyl residue via the skin is unlikely, medical experts say. As well, the rumor went viral after being mistakenly shared by a police department, which has since apologized and deleted the post.  This claim is not accurate.

Donald Trump's flawed stat on threats to religious freedom
","In his United Nations General Assembly speech, President Donald Trump focused on trade, Iran and North Korea. But he also touched on protecting gay rights, gun ownership and freedom of religion. Trump put forth the United States as a pillar of religious toleration, speaking of the ""ironclad American commitment"" to protecting religious freedom. ""Hard to believe, but 80% of the world’s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed,"" Trump said Sept 24. ""We want and support religious liberty for all."" There’s some substance to Trump’s statistic, but it relies on the broadest definition of threats to religion. How broad? Well, in the underlying analysis, the United States itself was included as having having high rankings for one type of intolerance and ended in the same category as places such as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Let’s unpack the number. The 80% figure shows up in a summary by the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation, an organization that promotes interfaith understanding and aims to show business leaders that ""religious freedom is good for business."" The group looked at countries with high levels of governmental restrictions or social hostility rooted in religion and added up their populations. The country list came from the Pew Research Center, a reliable source of data. ""Pew Research Center data show that the number of people living in countries with high religious restrictions and hostilities has reached nearly six billion people, or 78.5% of the world's total population in 2017,"" the group’s president wrote in a presentation. The math is correct, and supports Trump’s claim. But a closer look at the Pew study shows why a dose of caution applies. The Pew Research Center’s most recent survey of religious restrictions looked at two types of problems: government actions, and actions by individuals or groups, which it called social hostility. Jeremy Barker with the Religious Freedom Institute, a group that advocates for religious liberty, told us that when interpreting the findings, ""additional nuance is required."" ""While the total population of these countries is 6.3 billion, the restrictions may not evenly affect these people,"" Barker said. Especially in the area of social hostility, all it takes is a handful of bad actors to put a country on a list of nations with relatively poor rankings. In the government category, the report found that out of 198 countries, 52 had high or very high levels of governmental restrictions on religion. In the very worst cases, government agents had arrested or detained people for reasons of their faith. The top offenders were China, Iran, Malaysia and Syria, and countries such as Russia and Indonesia ranked in the top 10.  The Pew analysis had separate rankings for social hostility. Those included such acts as harassing women for the clothes they wear, religious violence by organized groups, and hate crimes by individuals. These can take place beyond the best efforts of governments to stop them. It ranked 56 countries as showing high or very high social hostilities. India was at the very top, followed by Syria, Iraq and Egypt. With rising tensions in Europe tied to refugees, Denmark, Germany and Italy also appeared there.  But so did the United States. It received higher rankings due to incidents such as the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., where marchers chanted ""Jews will not replace us,"" and a fatal stabbing in Portland, Ore., when a man shouted anti-Muslim remarks to two women, one of whom was wearing a hijab. While Trump exhorted other nations to match the commitment of the United States, his statistic included the United States and other nations with a tradition for protecting religious rights. Combining the lists of governmental restrictions and social hostility, the report found that 83 individual nations ranked high in at least one or the other. Their combined population is close to 6 billion, of which the U.S. population is a part. That is the source of the 80% figure Trump cited. Shaun Casey, director of the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University, said the 80% figure distorts the Pew report. ""The president is looking for a riveting number that says religious intolerance is on fire,"" Casey said. ""And you look at the data and it’s not true."" Barker warned that a few countries have an outsized impact. ""Because a few large countries are included in this — India, China, Indonesia, etc. — the population share is very high compared to the raw number of countries."" Anna Schiller, a Pew spokeswoman, said the center includes many variables but doesn’t rank them by severity or importance. ""We leave it up to our readers to form their own opinion based on the analysis we provide,"" Schiller said. Trump said that 80% of the world’s people live in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or completely outlawed. Ultimately, that is based on an independent group’s list of countries with what it deems high or very high levels of governmental or social intolerance of certain religions. But the underlying data sweeps up many laws and actions, some much more repressive than others. The United States shows up on one list, as do several other Western democracies. There is no simple way to capture the experience of religious minorities. The 80% figure is dramatic, but the experts we reached agreed that it exaggerates the impact of government-sanctioned and societal religious intolerance on most people living in those countries. We rate this Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CCFA00>],/factchecks/2019/sep/25/donald-trump/donald-trumps-flawed-stat-threats-religious-freedo/

Is California really ‘winning’ in court against the Trump administration?
","Democratic-controlled California has been labeled the ""State of Resistance,"" in large part for challenging the Trump administration in federal court on issues ranging from the environment to immigration to the U.S. census.  As of late September, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra had filed or joined 60 lawsuits against the Trump administration. His office has also filed friend of the court briefs in several additional cases against the administration.  But is California really ""winning"" in court as Becerra and Gov. Gavin Newsom have confidently claimed?  ""We are winning. The vast majority of the lawsuits have been adjudicated in favor of California,"" Newsom said at a news conference on Sept. 16 at the state Capitol.  Becerra has been equally self-assured:  ""Every time we go to court, for the most part, we win,"" Becerra claimed at a late August news conference where he announced one of California’s 14 lawsuits on immigration since the president took office. That suit seeks to block to block Trump administration rules that could indefinitely detain migrant children and their families.  ""If I were a baseball player, my batting average would be the envy of the MLB,"" he quipped in a Mercury-News article in May. ""We’re proving that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States."" We set out to fact check Becerra’s claim: ""Every time we go to court, for the most part, we win.""  Our research CalMatters, a nonprofit news organization, along with a Marquette University political science professor have separately tracked California’s lawsuits against the Trump administration. Records from both generally support Becerra’s claim that the state is winning in court, at least for the cases that have received rulings so far, though they also show the majority of lawsuits are still pending a final decision.  The CalMatters database of 60 lawsuits showed the state had won 16 completed cases and lost two, while 38 are pending and another four were on hold, as of late September.  California has scored some clear victories. In July, it prevailed in its effort to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the move and Trump abandoned his plan. The state also won a case against the administration’s attempt in 2017 to cut off certain federal funds for ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions. A district court ruled the move was unconstitutional. California again sued the administration last year after it withheld money for similar reasons. The state was also victorious in several cases where it sued to ensure federal energy and environmental regulations were implemented.  In February, the state was dealt one of its few defeats following its lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from waiving environmental laws to speed up border wall construction of in California. A federal district judge and later an appeals panel ruled in favor of Trump. The state also lost a case it joined opposing Trump’s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. The first version of the ban was struck down by a lower court, while a second partially went into effect but then expired. The Supreme Court upheld a third version in June 2018.  Earlier in Becerra’s August news conference, the AG offered a more nuanced and complete version of his statement about California winning in court.  ""Unfortunately, close to 60 times now this administration has taken actions which would harm the people of the state of California. And in most of the cases that we’ve filed, we have been victorious so far in the rulings that we’ve secured,"" Becerra told reporters. A spokesperson for Becerra provided a list of the state’s cases against the Trump administration, along with information about the status of each, though not an explicit win/loss breakdown.  ""Some have concluded, but many are ongoing,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email. ‘California has had great success in court’ Paul Nolette, the Marquette political science professor, is tracking all multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration. His database includes the majority of cases filed by California against the administration, though not the 13 solo cases the state has filed against it. As of mid-September, Nolette said California had been successful on nearly 90 percent of the multi-state lawsuits that had received at least an initial judgment, though he cautioned that a majority of the cases are still awaiting a final ruling.  ""California has had great success in court against the Trump administration, looking at both those completed cases as well as looking at those other cases that are still working their way up through the system,"" Nolette said.  Here’s how the state has fared, based on Nolette’s data:      • It is involved in 53 multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration      • Of those, 21 cases have been completed while 32 are pending a final ruling      • Of the 21 completed cases, it has won 16 and lost three. Two were voluntarily dismissed Nolette said California’s record in the pending, multi-state cases is also good.  ""In cases where there’s been some sort of court judgment or ruling, California is 10 and 0. And some of those cases may still be on appeal. So, they could still lose,"" he said. ""But, I think if you combine both of those together (the pending and completed cases), that’s a lot of wins: Really 26 clear wins in these cases, against only three losses."" California’s solo cases Like the multi-state cases, California has had some early success in cases it has brought independently against the Trump administration.  The attorney general’s office described 13 of its 60 lawsuits against the Trump administration as ""California-only suits."" Among those cited by the AG’s office, the state has two clear victories and one loss, according to a review by PolitiFact California.  Nine of the cases are still pending, while one seeking conflict of interest documents from former EPA Director Scott Pruit was settled with the EPA producing the documents when Pruitt resigned last year without admitting guilt.  UC Davis Law School Dean Kevin Johnson agreed California has a successful record in court so far. ""I think generally it’s a fair statement,"" he said of claims California is ‘winning.’ ""It’s not as easy as saying whether a team won a football game, though. Some of these cases are far from completion. For example, in the cases challenging the president’s executive order on punishing and defunding sanctuary jurisdictions, the case isn’t over."" The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Our ruling  California Attorney General Xavier Becerra claimed at an August news conference, ""Every time we go to court,"" against the Trump administration, ""for the most part, we win.""  A Marquette political science professor and CalMatters, a nonprofit news organization, are separately tracking California’s lawsuits. Their records each show the state has won the vast majority of cases that have received at least an initial or completed ruling.  But that doesn’t mean California has won ""every time we go to court,"" as Becerra put it, even acknowledging his qualifier ""for the most part."" Most cases are still working their way through the courts and have yet to receive final judgments, some of which could go against California. That important caveat is not reflected in Becerra’s claim.   Becerra does, however, offer a more complete statement earlier in the press conference, saying ""in most of the cases that we’ve filed, we have been victorious so far in the rulings that we’ve secured.""  Given this context and California’s early success in court, Becerra’s claim is generally accurate.  We rate his claim Mostly True.  MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
