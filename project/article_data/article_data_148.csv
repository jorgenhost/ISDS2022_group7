Ahead of 2018 election, Gov. Scott Walker attacked for spending more on corrections than colleges
","The dais was crowded at a candidates’ forum attended by 12 of the Wisconsin Democrats who are running for governor in 2018. One of them joked that ""there's actually another blank name tag up here, so if anybody else wants to get in the race ..."" But much of the event, in Eau Claire on Dec. 11, 2017, was serious, of course. Candidate Kelda Helen Roys used part of her time to attack Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is running for a third term. Roys, a former state Assembly member from Madison, accused Walker of putting prisons ahead of the University of Wisconsin System, saying: I think in 2011, it was Walker’s first budget, and we had the dubious distinction of spending -- for the first time in our state’s history -- more on our prison system that we did on the entire UW System. It’s a claim likely to be repeated during the campaign, so let’s check it out. Journal Sentinel report Walker was elected in 2010; his first state budget was for 2011-’13. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in 2012, that two-year budget allotted, for the first time, more money for prisons and correctional facilities -- that is, for the Department of Corrections -- than for the UW System. The tallies, after a $250 million cut to the UW System: $2.25 billion: Corrections $2.1 billion: UW System The operations of the Department of Corrections include running 36 adult prisons and correctional facilities, supervising adult offenders who are probation or parole, and managing the state’s two juvenile correctional facilities and community services for juvenile offenders. The UW System has 13 four-year campuses, including the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison, 13 two-year campuses (known as the UW Colleges) and a statewide extension with offices in each county. The Journal Sentinel’s report, which reviewed more than 20 years of Wisconsin state budgets, pointed out that the eclipse in funding between the two agencies was the culmination of years of policy changes made under both Republican and Democratic governors prior to Walker. Also, nationwide, public universities were seeing cuts while prison spending, sparked by sentencing changes put in motion in the 1980s, was going up. So, the change did occur on Walker’s watch, though it was the culmination of a shift over a period of years. More numbers For a little more context, we reviewed all four of the state budgets that have been adopted under Walker and the four adopted previously, all of which were under Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat. The figures are from the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (We’ve indicated in bold whether the UW System or Corrections got more in each budget.) State budget UW System Corrections 2003-’05 $1.91 billion $1.7 billion 2005-’07 $1.93 billion $1.8 billion 2007-’09 $2.24 billion $2.17 billion 2009-’11 $2.27 billion $2.25 billion 2011-’13 (First Walker budget) $2.1 billion $2.25 billion 2013-’15 $2.25 billion $2.32 billion 2015-’17 $2.08 billion $2.35 billion* 2017-’19 $2.14 billion $2.43 billion* The figures show that in the four budgets before Walker, the gap in funding between the UW System and Corrections got smaller in each biennium; and since Walker, Corrections has gotten more money than the UW System. To be clear, those figures are for state tax dollars only. Corrections is essentially funded entirely with state tax dollars; in contrast, the UW System gets total funding of about $12 billion per year, much of it from federal grants and tuition payments. One thing that has squeezed the UW System is that, although the increases in its state funding slowed under Doyle, tuition was increased. In contrast, state funding for the UW System has remained roughly the same under Walker, but he has frozen tuition. A spokesman in the governor’s office didn’t dispute Roys’ claim directly, but said that under Walker the state is now spending more state tax dollars on higher education overall -- including the UW System, the technical college system and other funds -- than it did in 2011.  Our rating Roys said that in 2011 under Walker, Wisconsin for the first time spent ""more on our prison system than we did"" on the University of Wisconsin System. She’s correct. That occurred with Walker’s first state budget, for 2011-’13, when he directed more state taxpayer dollars to the Department of Corrections than the UW System. But the eclipse was years in the making before Walker took office, and it’s worth noting that the UW System, with tuition and federal grants, has a much larger total budget than Corrections. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. Editor's note: We revised this item on Jan. 12, 2018 to indicate that the governor's office did respond to our request for information. The response had been inadvertently overlooked when this fact check was first posted.",[<zip object at 0x000002809670D300>],/factchecks/2018/jan/12/kelda-helen-roys/ahead-2018-election-gov-scott-walker-attacked-spen/

Donald Trump’s ‘fake news awards’ could land White House staff in hot water
","On the campaign trail, Donald Trump honed his craft of slamming media organizations that covered him critically, a practice he’s carried over to the White House. His efforts will culminate soon in the so-called ""fake news awards,"" an idea Trump first floated last November on Twitter. ""We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!"" he tweeted Nov. 27, 2017.  We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY! Trump’s idea got poor reviews from government watchdogs, who warned White House staff that the event would breach federal ethics rules designed to keep government honest and impartial. ""WARNING to White House staff: the president may be exempt from the rules at 5 CFR § 2635.701 et seq. on misuse of position BUT YOU ARE NOT. If you help @potus with the below, you risk violating §§ 702, 704 & 705 forbidding use of gov time & $$$ to harm some media & aid others,"" Norm Eisen, President Barack Obama's former ethics czar, tweeted on Jan. 7.  WARNING to White House staff: the president may be exempt from the rules at 5 CFR § 2635.701 et seq. on misuse of position BUT YOU ARE NOT. If you help @potus with the below, you risk violating §§ 702, 704 & 705 forbidding use of gov time & $$$ to harm some media & aid others. https://t.co/gHxzJcCEAW Experts who practiced government ethics at the highest levels told us the fake news awards could land White House staffers in hot water, for violating government rules and encroaching on the First Amendment. Eisen, now chair of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, referred to a set of federal regulations that lay out the ethical conduct of executive branch employees. (As Eisen noted, Trump, as president, is exempt.) These rules are overseen by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, or OGE, an executive branch agency whose 4,500 ethics officials serve as watchdogs over the executive branch to prevent (or resolve) conflicts of interest, with the aim of safeguarding governmental integrity. Eisen specifically pointed to a section of the rules that deal with executive branch employees misusing their government jobs. The section states that an executive branch employee ""shall not use his public office for the endorsement of any product or enterprise."" Because of that rule, the ethics office also has long considered it improper for an executive branch employee to condemn a company, said Walter Shaub, who led the OGE until his resignation in July 2017. ""You can't use your government position to endorse a company, and you can't trash a company to the advantage of a different company,"" said Shaub, who is now the senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center. It's unclear if Trump’s event is being held by the White House or the Trump/Pence campaign, and neither organization replied to our questions. (Eisen's tweet — and this analysis — deals with official government events. A separate set of laws, including the Hatch Act, would apply if White House staffers participated in a campaign event, sources said.) Absolutely, according to Shaub, who retweeted Eisen’s warning to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ""Hey @PressSec & @RajShah45, Norm is right. If you or ANY WH staffers work on this or post it on the WH website, it will be a violation of the Standards of Conduct. Beware of laws on using federal appropriations too, if there are any visuals, certificates, handouts, or trophies,"" Shaub tweeted Jan. 7.  Hey @PressSec & @RajShah45, Norm is right. If you or ANY WH staffers work on this or post it on the WH website, it will be a violation of the Standards of Conduct. Beware of laws on using federal appropriations too, if there are any visuals, certificates, handouts, or trophies. https://t.co/3tlyrkNc9H Shaub told PolitiFact that a staffers' participation in an official Trump administration event designed to publicly humiliate certain media outlets would clearly constitute a misuse of their government position. ""It’s not even a close call,"" he said. ""Sending out tweets talking about how great Fox News is, which is a business, and now he’s going to give awards trashing CNN and others, which are businesses, is preferential treatment."" Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said that while some ethics rules can be ambiguous, a Trump staffer's participation would be out of bounds. ""The endorsement of some news outlets and the condemnation of others crosses the line under the OGE regulations,"" he said. ""It’s hard to show where that line precisely is, but what I can tell you is it has been crossed in this instance."" Absent some kind of serious government study showing systemic failures by certain media organizations, there’s no compelling government interest that justifies the staging of fake news awards, he said. Painter said Trump’s tweets, as well as other administration actions affecting the media industry, raise First Amendment concerns. This makes it more likely an ethics official would find a staffer broke the rules by participating in Trump's fake news awards, he said. During his time in office, scores of Trump’s tweets have followed a familiar pattern: praise for Fox News and scorn for its competitors. On Twitter, Trump mentioned Fox News, its programs or its hosts in more than 70 tweets that describe the right-wing media outlet in positive, if not glowing, terms. Trump uses Twitter to promote Fox News reporting, highlight favorable coverage of him and his administration and lavish praise on the network while condemning their competitors. ""The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!"" Trump tweeted Feb. 15, 2017.  The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great! Over the same period, Trump has mentioned Fox News' rivals more than 50 times. Aside from two tweets promoting his own interview on ABC News, these tweets have ranged from negative to scathing. ""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"" Trump tweeted Feb. 17, 2017. In addition to Trump's tweets, Painter said there’s other evidence the administration has used its power to play favorites in the media industry, raising First Amendment concerns that bolster the case that the fake news awards are out of bounds. He pointed to the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Time Warner, which has raised questions about whether this was done as retribution against CNN; Trump’s threat against NBC's license over reporting he disputed; and Trump’s repeated — and false — attacks on Amazon and its chairman Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post. Painter also noted Trump congratulated Rupert Murdoch, who co-chairs 21st Century Fox, over a deal to sell significant Fox assets to Disney, after Trump reportedly sought reassurance that Fox News wouldn’t change hands. ""There's some concrete evidence that they're playing favorites with the media organizations in official action, and penalizing those who do not give them the news coverage they like,"" Painter said. ""Couple that with the president's tweets, including several that suggest he wishes he were in a country without the First Amendment, and this is viewed as a part of a pattern of conduct."" Both Painter and Shaub noted the ethics rules also require loyalty to the rule of law and the constitution. ""In effect the president is trying to establish official news media, establish that Fox is good and CNN is bad,"" Painter said. ""That does loop back into what's a reasonable application of the OGE rule if what you're doing is treading really close to a First Amendment problem."" Eisen and Painter are chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued Trump for violating a constitutional bar on presidents and federal officials accepting gifts and payments from foreign governments. Eisen said the White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate in Donald Trump’s ""fake news awards."" Two experts, who practiced government ethics at the highest levels, said participation by White House staffers would violate federal ethics rules. Trump, for the record, is exempt. They added that the president and his administration’s pattern of playing favorites among media outlets raises First Amendment issues that would subject this event to heightened scrutiny by ethics officials. We rate this statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809731C980>],/factchecks/2018/jan/11/norm-eisen/donald-trumps-fake-news-awards-could-land-white-ho/
"['Redistricting', 'North Carolina', 'Robin Hayes']","
NC GOP: a gerrymander is 'a strange looking monster drawing'
","A panel of judges on Tuesday struck down North Carolina’s election districts for U.S. Congress, and the state’s Republican leaders aren’t happy. The panel was unanimous in ruling that North Carolina lawmakers under Republican leadership violated the U.S. Constitution’s equal-protection clause when they drew maps explicitly to favor their party. It was the first time federal judges have struck down congressional districts as partisan gerrymanders. North Carolina has been at the center of election map battles since 2011, when some sued the state for what they called unfair congressional and legislative maps. The decision drew swift rebukes from Republican lawmakers and organizational leaders. Some said they’ll appeal and some questioned a judge’s impartiality. Robin Hayes, chairman of the N.C. GOP, issued a statement suggesting that the judges’ understanding of gerrymandering is warped. Hayes focused on geographic shapes, noting that the ill-fated maps kept 87 of North Carolina's 100 counties whole and divided only 12 precincts. ""A ‘gerrymander’ is by definition and common understanding, a strange looking ‘monster’ drawing. This map is clearly not that,"" Hayes said in a Jan. 10 statement. ""Judge Wynn is not being a judge, he is acting as a pundit by trying to impose his liberal beliefs instead of making a judicial ruling."" The origin of the term The term ""gerrymandering"" comes from the 1800s, when a critic of newly-drawn election maps compared one of the districts to a salamander. And Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the N.C. GOP, referenced the term’s origins when he emailed PolitiFact to explain Hayes’ claim. ""It is important to note that this definition accompanied an ‘eye’ test,"" Woodhouse said. ""In other words the meaning of the word came WITH a illustration that showed a bizarre looking districts, something many people would object to just based on how they look."" Hayes and Woodhouse share the view of state Senate leader Phil Berger, who falsely claimed last year that North Carolina has the ""strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the country."" Berger’s argument, like the N.C. GOP’s, was based on the idea that compact districts that keep counties intact are therefore fair. While initial claims of gerrymandering focused on district shapes, and experts say district shapes can be an indicator of gerrymandering, they aren’t the lone test of whether something is gerrymandered. ""The history of using gerrymandering to partisan advantage goes all the way back to the original use of the term for tilting state senate districts in Massachusetts,"" said Moon Duchin, associate professor of mathematics and Senior Fellow at Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. ""These days, with incredibly rich data available to the line-drawers, very skewed districts no longer have to look like exotic reptiles with fangs and claws,"" Duchin said in an email. ""The current map in North Carolina is a great example – it is an extreme outlier, more favorable to Republicans than 99.5% of maps produced by a neutral process."" Types of gerrymandering There are three main types of gerrymandering, as explained by Vox: There’s partisan gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts to favor one party. (On Tuesday, judges ruled that North Carolina’s congressional maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders meant to favor Republicans.) There’s racial gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts that dilute the influence of a particular race or community. There’s even bipartisan gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts that protect incumbents in both parties. ""The North Carolina court adopted the same definition of partisan gerrymandering as the Supreme Court: a district plan that aims to benefit a particular party and in fact does so severely, durably, and unjustifiably,"" said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor from the University of Chicago.   ""That North Carolina's districts are not as ugly as in previous years is neither here nor there. You can obviously have nicer-looking districts that still intentionally and dramatically favor one side over the other,"" Stephanopoulos said. Check out this explanation by the Washington Post, which includes a helpful graphic, for a visual representation of Stephanopoulos’ argument. Stephanopoulos and Eric McGhee, a public policy fellow at University of California-Berkeley, created a new measure known as the ""efficiency gap"" -- the difference between the two parties' wasted votes, divided by the total votes cast -- which is a focal point in the partisan gerrymandering case from Wisconsin that was argued at the U.S. Supreme Court in October. (Wasted votes are when voters are shifted into districts where their votes won’t matter, either because their party’s candidate can’t win or is already sure to win.) McGhee said the courts haven’t cemented district shapes as a requirement of gerrymandering. ""I’m not a lawyer, so I can’t give a legal opinion,"" McGhee said in an email. ""But the question of whether a gerrymander requires funny-shaped (""non-compact"") districts is not a matter of settled law or definition."" He said defenders of the Wisconsin assembly and NC congressional maps have argued that non-compactness is required. ""But the lower courts have not been sympathetic so far. [It] remains to be seen what SCOTUS will say,"" McGhee said, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court. Duchin noted that there are three high-profile cases where courts plan to explore methods for measuring partisan gerrymandering. ""None of them emphasizes district shapes,"" he said. As for the shapes of NC’s congressional districts and whether they resemble monsters, some Washington Post reporters say they see not only ghastly images – but also at least one squirrel, dog and Sherlock Holmes, among other things. NC GOP says their districts can't be gerrymanders because gerrymanders are ""strange looking monster drawings"" and ""this map is not that."" NC-2 literally looks like a monster eating Raleigh. https://t.co/VGmppXW7NI pic.twitter.com/1TMcspA6s9 Our ruling Hayes said a gerrymander is ""by definition and common understanding, a strange looking ‘monster’ drawing,"" insinuating that North Carolina’s Republican-drawn maps can’t be gerrymanders if the districts have smooth edges and look nice. While he’s right that weird shapes can be indicators of gerrymanders, shapes are not the lone determining factor. And there’s more than just one definition of gerrymandering. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3D38C0>],/factchecks/2018/jan/10/robin-hayes/nc-gop-gerrymander-strange-looking-monster-drawing/

Gov. Rick Scott's Full Flop on oil drilling
","Gov. Rick Scott met with a member of President Donald Trump’s administration and struck a deal to remove Florida from a list of states proposed for more offshore oil drilling. ""As a result of our interest in making sure that there's no drilling here, Florida will be taken off the table,"" Scott said Jan. 9th, after meeting with U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in Tallahassee. Zinke highlighted Scott’s role in the deal. ""Florida is obviously unique,"" Zinke said. ""For Floridians, we are not drilling off the coast of Florida, and clearly the governor has expressed that it's important."" Scott’s statement led to claims that Scott had flip-flopped on offshore oil drilling. We decided to measure whether Scott had shifted his position on our Flip-O-Meter. Scott’s announcement came as the term-limited Republican governor is poised to potentially run against Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, an opponent of an expansion of drilling. Scott’s spokespersons argued that Scott made no flip. ""Since 2010, Governor Scott has consistently said that we must ensure that Florida’s beaches are protected and has made it clear that protecting the environment is his top priority,"" Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said. We found that Scott clearly campaigned in 2010 on expanding oil drilling. Today, he opposes an expansion. PolitiFact Florida has tracked Scott’s stance on oil drilling since his first campaign in 2010. On his campaign website then, Scott called for more drilling offshore but said that the state’s beaches must be protected. ""As we explore the expansion of domestic drilling in the U.S. we must ensure that we have sound policies in place that ensure the companies drilling are doing so in an environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards. ... Rick supports expansion of nuclear power, use of alternative fuels and off-shore drilling."" A Scott campaign spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida in May 2010 that his campaign had initially posted his position before the Deepwater Horizon explosion in April and later updated it to add the phrase about the environment and safety standards. During that summer, Scott reiterated his call for safe offshore drilling when meeting with Panhandle fishermen. Scott said drilling wouldn’t happen in the ""foreseeable future. ...We are not going to drill now. ...It's not safe. It doesn't make any sense."" Scott never took significant steps toward his promise to explore expansion of drilling in a safe, environmentally sound way. We rated his promise broken in 2013. In April 2017, Trump signed an executive order that aimed to expand offshore drilling. Scott was initially mum. Days later, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times that he hadn’t seen the proposal and declined to comment. The state Department of Environmental Protection sent an Aug. 17 letter to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management raising concerns about the effects of oil and gas activities on the environment, but did not expressly oppose the drilling proposal. On Jan. 4, Zinke announced a proposal to open up more coastal areas in Florida, California and the Atlantic to drilling. Scott expressed his voice quickly on Twitter Jan. 4, saying that he opposed drilling: ""Based on media reports, it is likely that the Department of the Interior will consider Florida as a potential state for offshore oil drilling – which is something I oppose in Florida. I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration. My top priority is to ensure that Florida's natural resources are protected, which is why I proposed $1.7 billion for the environment in this year's budget.""  Governor Scott’s Statement on Trump Administration’s Plan on Offshore Oil Drilling: pic.twitter.com/iQqNU9afsQ Over the next few days, Scott had multiple meetings with Trump administration officials. On Jan. 9, when asked what caused the Trump administration to change its position on Florida drilling, Zinke said, ""The governor."" Scott praised the Trump administration for removing Florida from consideration. Oil and gas exploration doesn’t seem to be entirely off the table, though. Zinke said seismic testing still would be allowed, but no new drilling. Susan Glickman, Florida Director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said the only reason to allow seismic testing is to find places to drill. During his first campaign for governor in 2010, Scott called for drilling offshore. After the Deepwater Horizon explosion, he added language to his campaign website to state that he wanted drilling done in an ""environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards."" During his first term, Scott took no meaningful steps to expand drilling. But when Trump’s administration proposed an expansion of offshore drilling Jan. 4, Scott said he opposed the idea and sought a meeting with Zinke. That rejection sounds different from his stance when he first ran for governor in 2010 and he was open to drilling. We give Scott a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C2BB40>],/factchecks/2018/jan/10/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-full-flop-oil-drilling/

Beto O'Rourke flip-flops on requiring young to perform public service
","We galloped to fact-check a claim that the Democratic congressman seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Ted Cruz wants every young American to work a year for the government. But while we were looking into that, the candidate, Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, said that he’d made a mistake in describing the envisioned service as ""mandatory."" O’Rourke’s declaration led us to shift from solely verifying what he’d originally advocated to rolling out the PolitiFact Texas Flip-O-Meter, which gauges shifts in position. Candidate extols mandatory service O’Rourke, who’s been making web-casted campaign stops around Texas, piped up in favor of a national service mandate while speaking in Corsicana Jan. 4, 2018. As noted in a Jan. 5, 2018, KSAT-TV news story, O’Rourke specified there that he hopes to introduce legislation this year requiring all young Americans to spend at least a year ""in service to this country."" Some context: His campaign’s Facebook Live post of O’Rourke’s remarks shows that O’Rourke edged toward airing his interest in mandatory national service after an audience member asked: ""How do we meet the challenge of the increasing wealth gap?"" O’Rourke responded, in part, by mentioning his concerns about Republican-passed federal tax changes. He also talked up improved access to higher education before turning to requiring national service, saying: ""One last idea on this--and I’m trying to find a Republican colleague--and I may have one, and I hope to announce it soon--who will help me to introduce this into the Congress this year. ""And that is a national service bill that will require every young person, no matter how wealthy or how poor, to spend at least a year of their lives in service to this country, in a military unit, in a conservation corps unit, in a medical unit, in a teaching unit, in some way that they’re going to help to make this country better and stronger and have to sacrifice together and leave that with a shared understanding of who we are as a people--and no kid is going to be rich enough to buy their way out of it and no kid (interrupted by applause)."" Co-sponsorship of a measure O’Rourke had already embraced the idea of expanding national service. A web search led us to learn that in June 2017, O’Rourke was among more than 150 House co-sponsors of the America’s Call To Improve Opportunities Now for National Service Act filed by Rep. John B. Larson, D-Conn. That legislation doesn’t require any Americans to perform government service. Still, Owen Dodd in Larson’s office emailed us a summary stating the proposal would result in at least a million government-linked ""service opportunities"" and reward ""young people who serve two full terms of service"" with four years of their home state’s average in-state tuition. The resulting program, the summary says, would ""help the nation address priorities in education, infrastructure, healthcare, disaster relief and poverty."" Another mention of mandating service We spotted one other recent instance of O’Rourke speculating about mandatory service. In September 2017, he said in an interview with The Daily Texan, the student newspaper at the University of Texas, that improved college affordability could lead young Texans to return to their home communities after college. O’Rourke then said that compulsory national service might be appropriate: ""Maybe a next step is a national service program, which gives everyone the opportunity, or maybe compels young people to spend a year or two improving their communities. And in exchange for that, there is the ability again to pursue higher education, or training, or an apprenticeship or certification. And again, it doesn’t have to be a traditional four-year college, and it doesn’t have to be for the 18-year-old. It could be for that 52-year-old who was just laid off from that peanut-packing plant in Plainview, Texas, who needs a little bit of help getting that next job. And if she needs help getting that online course, certification, the credentials that she needs, she is going to be able to do that. I think all of that should be part of the conversation in college affordability or higher education affordability."" Reversal: ‘I made a mistake’ In Corsicana, then, O’Rourke revealed his plans to offer a mandatory national service measure. But a few days later, O’Rourke said that he’d gone too far in saying that national service should be ""mandatory."" ""That is a word that has concerned a lot of you,"" O’Rourke said about three minutes into his Jan. 8, 2018 remarks livestreamed on Facebook. ""And I’ve got to tell you, you’re right. ""I think I got way out in front of this without having the necessary conversation,"" O’Rourke said, ""without listening to enough of you about if you were serving as a teacher, if you were serving in the VA, if you were clearing trails in a conservation corps, if you were serving in the military, if you were doing some kind of service that helps to make your country stronger, your community better -- that, that allows us all to have some sense of shared purpose and sacrifice in this country. ""You know,"" O’Rourke went on, ""talking about this being a requirement for everybody, that’s a few steps beyond the conversation that we’ve had already. So I want to tell you that I’ve heard you and that I’m listening to you--and I think I made a mistake without having listened to enough people and really had the conversation we need to have about what this would look like, getting so far out ahead on an issue."" After watching the video, we inquired into O’Rourke’s up-to-date position on national service. An O’Rourke campaign spokesman, Chris Evans, replied by email: ""He does not plan on introducing a bill to require mandatory national service. Texans made their voices heard and he is listening to them."" Our ruling In January 2018, O’Rourke said he soon planned to file a proposal mandating at least a year of national service for all young Americans. A few days later, O’Rourke called his pitch for that mandate a mistake and, we confirmed, dropped plans to file a measure requiring national service. We rate this shift a FULL FLOP.

Julián Castro says nearly all DACA recipients employed, in school or serving in military
","Calling out Republicans, Julián Castro of Texas said research shows that nearly every young immigrant at risk of losing federal protection from deportation is employed, in school or serving in the military. According to an October 2017 web post, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary was generally urging the Republican-led Congress to change federal law by offering a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children or those who overstayed their visas. The post on the conservative blog PJ Media says that in a conference call organized by an advocacy group, Castro specified that a ""recent analysis"" showed that 91 percent of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, sometimes called ""Dreamers,"" are employed, in school or serving in the military. Critics, conversely, sometimes characterize the program as an illegal amnesty that harms the working class. Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and 2020 Democratic presidential prospect, directed his call for DACA action at U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-San Antonio, as well as John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate majority whip, who, Castro said, ""should make sure Congress passes a DREAM Act soon."" Castro, who joined the faculty of the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in 2017, was otherwise quoted in the post criticizing President Donald Trump for declaring the month before that his administration would discontinue DACA, which President Barack Obama launched through a 2012 memo, unless Congress authorized a program by changing federal laws. In a September 2017 tweet, Trump said both that Congress should ""legalize DACA"" and that in the event of inaction, he’d ""revisit this issue."" Castro cites online survey results So, was Castro right about DACA recipients nearly all being in school, employed or in the military? Castro, asked the basis of his claim, told Josh Baugh of the San Antonio Express-News by text that he drew his data points from an August 2017 web post by the left-leaning Center for American Progress about a national DACA survey. That survey, we found, asked if DACA recipients had jobs or were in school. It didn’t ask if respondents were in the military. The center’s post summarizing the results said Tom Wong, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, led the August 2017 survey of 3,063 DACA recipients. All told, the post says, the survey reached DACA recipients in 46 states including Texas, where 17 percent of respondents said they were living, according to the center’s separate post of the survey’s 22 questions and tallied results. Let’s check on whether the results back up Castro’s claim before turning to the survey methodology and other efforts to gauge how DACA recipients spend their lives. Survey results Asked if they were ""currently employed,"" 91.4 percent answered affirmatively, according to the results, with 55.9 percent of those respondents saying they hadn’t been employed ""before DACA."" Another question asked if the respondent was currently in school; 44.9 percent responded affirmatively with 55 percent saying not, according to the results. Wong told us by email that an additional sort of the ""in school"" and ""currently employed"" responses showed 97 percent of all respondents reporting being employed or enrolled in school — with 71.5 percent of those saying that they were in school reportedly pursuing a bachelor’s degree or higher. Methodology The center said in its post that the results drew on the largest sampling of DACA recipients to date. Some perspective: the 3,000-plus respondents would have amounted to about 4/10ths of 1 percent of some 690,000 active DACA recipients reported at about that time by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wong conducted the survey in collaboration with the center and advocacy groups United We Dream and the National Immigration Law Center. At the survey’s release, that teaming drew criticism on the right-leaning Breitbart blog, where writer Neil Munro underscored an acknowledgment in the survey’s methodology section that ""it is not possible to construct a valid margin of error"" for the results because ""there is no phone book of undocumented immigrants."" Munro counted this as an admission that the data was unreliable. In the same vein, we wondered how Wong’s team confirmed that respondents were signed up for DACA; best we could tell, beneficiaries are not revealed by the government. By phone, Wong reaffirmed the methodology described in the center’s post about the survey including that the partnering entities recruited the recipients surveyed online. Specifically, Wong said, the partners sent a web link to the survey to individuals on their respective email lists, also employing Facebook ads to ensure that self-identified DACA recipients from all over the country could participate. Recognizing that non-DACA recipients could potentially click through the survey, the researchers reported taking steps to eliminate bias and other factors that might skew the results. In the write-up posted by the center, Wong and his co-authors said that to prevent people from submitting multiple responses, they used a survey platform that prevented an IP address from submitting multiple responses. Wong said he used another tactic to stop people from gaming the study: Near the beginning of the survey, each respondent was asked to say at which age she or he came to the U.S. Close to the end, the survey requested the year the respondent came to the U.S. If the age provided toward the survey’s start matched the year offered later, the results stayed in. If off by more than a year, Wong said, he threw out the response. In the end, he said, the responses of 3,063 people were tallied--with approximately 6,000 respondents’ surveys getting set aside for one reason or another. We asked Wong to provide more detail perhaps enabling us to confirm the percentages in the results. Wong told us by email that he hadn’t talked to the study’s outreach partners ""about what data can and can’t be released."" Wong also said he plans to write a book analyzing the first four years of his survey results, at which point the data he analyzes for the book will be made publicly available. ""I know talk isn’t worth much, but I analyzed all of the data myself and stand by the results,"" Wong wrote. Solid research, expert says We separately asked Ernesto Castañeda, an American University expert on migration research, if he considers the Wong-led results to be valid. Castañeda’s answer: Yes. Wong and his colleagues ""carried out a valid study on a hard-to-reach population,"" Castañeda said by email. ""With more than three thousand respondents, this is an exceptionally large sample size."" Castañeda further said that researchers cannot always calculate margins of error for ""unknown populations"" like homeless and undocumented people, adding that the authors ""took a number of steps to avoid duplicates or dubious data."" Castañeda told us too that the study’s results appeared to be consistent with ethnographic research on DACA recipients and survey and interview research through 2016 by Roberto Gonzales, a Harvard University expert on immigration and social inequality, suggesting that DACA recipients made gains after getting that designation. Wong and Gonzales each found DACA beneficiaries finding educational and career opportunities that had been closed to them before they entered the program. According to Gonzales’ study, posted by the center in June 2017, ""DACA beneficiaries told the authors that they were able to match their education and training with work that was meaningful to them—‘an occupation that they could be proud of and that did not carry the stigma of ‘immigrant work.’ "" Wong told us a result from his 2017 study stood out to him: 54.2 percent of respondents reported getting a job ""that better fits my education and training."" In the Breitbart post critical of Wong’s work, Munro wrote that the study was ""based on a skewed sample of relatively successful DACA illegals who were identified by advocacy groups."" To Munro’s point, 35.5 percent of respondents 25 and older reported having bachelor’s degrees or higher. Seemingly in contrast, Munro noted, an August 2017 Migration Policy Institute study found only 5 percent of the ""immediately eligible DACA population"" holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. The institute, a think tank that says it believes in the benefits of well-managed immigration, reached its ""5 percent"" figure by drawing on responses to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey. Wong, asked about the possibly too-high education levels suggested by his results, pointed out that the 35.5 percent of survey-indicated DACA recipients with bachelor’s degrees came out only slightly greater than what’s lately shown for naturalized American citizens. According to bureau data from 2016, 35.2 percent of naturalized citizens — those who obtained citizenship after being born as non-citizens — reported having a bachelor’s, graduate or professional degree. DACA recipients’ high education levels make sense, Wong said, because the program requires applicants to be currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a General Education Development (GED) certificate, or be an honorably discharged Coast Guard or military veteran. ""We’re actually requiring them to be more educated than the general population,"" Wong said, adding: ""Now that the DACA population is getting older, we’re talking about a pretty sizable number of college-educated individuals who are just beginning to hit their strides in their careers."" Castañeda suggested by email that Wong’s survey provided more meaningful results than the MPI study, which was concerned with many more residents including individuals unlikely to seek DACA status. Castañeda wrote: ""DACA recipients are by definition positively self-selected since they have to apply to the program, deal with the complex application process and requirements, and pay application fees."" Another view We also asked Jessica Vaughan of the conservative-leaning Center for Immigration Studies to evaluate the survey cited by Castro. By phone, Vaughan told us that she would not be surprised that DACA recipients participate in the labor force at high rates because for many, employment was likely ""a motivating factor to apply for DACA."" Vaughan speculated, though, that the survey overstated the employment and education rates of DACA recipients simply by being administered online and, she suggested, drawing from people with regular online access as well as individuals with the ""time and inclination to fill out such a survey."" It’s reasonable, she said, to suppose that the same people would be more likely employed and well-educated. Our ruling Castro said a ""recent analysis"" showed that 91 percent of DACA recipients are employed, in school or serving in the military. Some 97 percent of respondents to an August 2017 online survey reported being employed or in school. However, the researchers asked no questions about military service.

Does the newly signed Republican tax reform law mean $1,000 or more per year for Americans?
","Are we already just weeks away from getting savings from the new Republican tax law? And will those savings total $1,000 or more per year? That’s the claim Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany made Dec. 27, 2017, five days after the tax overhaul was signed into law by President Donald Trump. McEnany, who was a pro-Trump pundit on CNN during the 2016 presidential election, said it this way on Jerry Bader’s conservative talk show on Green Bay radio: It's exciting to think that come February (2018), Americans will see their paychecks grow at the tune of saving $1,000 or more a year. Is she right? McEnany’s evidence When we asked McEnany for information to support her statement, she told us she was referring to the middle class. But there was no mention of the middle class in her interview up to the point when she made her claim. So, her claim is broad, referring simply to ""Americans."" McEnany also said her statement was based largely on a PolitiFact National article that identified winners and losers in the tax bill. And she cited a list of 40 companies that say they have given their employees bonuses as a result of the tax law. Sometimes lost in the reporting on the overhaul is that the overwhelming majority of Americans will see tax cuts, starting in 2018 and continuing for at least several years. But, as we’ll see, many Americans -- roughly 40 percent of households -- won’t see cuts as high as $1,000 per year at all. ‘Come February’ We’ll start with McEnany’s reference to February 2018. Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us that because of the law, some Americans likely would see somewhat larger paychecks as soon as February 2018, as employers withhold less money from employee paychecks. That will depend on how quickly the Internal Revenue Service develops new withholding tables and then how quickly employers are able to implement them. Now to the larger part of McEnany’s claim -- paychecks, or at least the take-home portion of paychecks, growing by $1,000 per year. ‘$1,000 per year’ The PolitiFact National article, relying on data from the Tax Policy Center, said the vast majority (about 80 percent) of taxpayers will see tax cuts in 2018. But for Americans on the lower end of the income spectrum -- roughly 40 percent of households -- the average cut will amount to $480 or less. Meanwhile, the richer 60 percent of households will get cuts ranging from $1,090 to $285,490 (for the richest 0.1 percent). Mazur told us those scenarios would remain the same, more or less, through 2025. After that, many of the individual tax cuts go away under the new law -- unless they would be extended by a future Congress. At that point, Mazur said, most taxpayers will be worse off under the new law than if the law it replaced would have remained in place. In fact, by 2027, fewer than one-third of taxpayers in the bottom 80 percent of the income spectrum would see a tax cut. (Experts from the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, the libertarian Cato Institute and the conservative Manhattan Institute also referred us to the Tax Policy Center projections for checking McEnany’s claim.) As for whether more companies will -- as a result of the tax law -- give their employees raises or bonuses -- is, of course, unknown.  Our rating McEnany said: ""Come February (2018), Americans will see their paychecks grow at the tune of saving $1,000 or more a year."" It’s expected that some Americans, though it’s impossible to know how many, will start seeing larger take-home pay from their paychecks in February 2018 as less money is withheld for taxes as a result of the law. Meanwhile, it’s expected that about 60 percent of households will see tax cuts of at least $1,000 per year from 2018 through 2025. But those would largely go away after 2025, when various individual tax cuts in the law expire. As for whether Americans in large numbers will get raises or bonuses -- because of the tax law -- that remains to be seen. McEnany’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BD1100>],/factchecks/2018/jan/10/kayleigh-mcenany/does-newly-signed-republican-tax-reform-law-mean-1/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Did Obama say he didn't have the right to issue DACA?
","President Donald Trump sat with congressional leaders for an open conversation about cutting a deal on the fate of about 700,000 undocumented young immigrants whose parents brought them to America as small children. Trump said last September that an Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) would end this March unless Congress acted. ""President Obama, when he signed the executive order, actually said he doesn't have the right to do this,"" Trump said Jan. 9, 2018. ""You have to go through Congress. Whether he does or whether he doesn't, let’s assume he doesn’t. He said it."" We looked at Obama’s Rose Garden speech announcing the new policy that allowed those who qualified to register and apply for two-year deferrals. Obama didn’t say that he lacked the right to act. In contrast, he emphasized his authority to set priorities until Congress approved the DREAM Act, a measure that would formalize the legal status of this group of immigrants. ""In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we’ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places,"" Obama said June 15, 2012. ""This is not a path to citizenship.  It's not a permanent fix.  This is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people."" Obama did urge Congress to act, saying, ""There is still time for Congress to pass the DREAM Act this year, because these kids deserve to plan their lives in more than two-year increments."" It has been a theme among Republicans and conservatives that before he penned DACA, Obama had said that he was bound by law to pursue deportations. The Speaker of the House John Boehner posted a list of 22 times when Obama said ""he couldn’t ignore or create his own immigration law."" Indeed, Obama did tell a Univision audience Oct. 25, 2010, that ""I'm president, I'm not king."" But he continued on to say, ""If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people who are really causing problems as opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves."" In March 2011, he again told Univision, ""there are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president."" And then he said, ""That does not mean, though, that we can't make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity."" In the fall of 2011, he said, ""I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true."" Then he added, ""What we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources, and say we’re not going to go chasing after this young man or anybody else who’s been acting responsibly and would otherwise qualify for legal status if the DREAM Act passed."" Whether Obama’s action was legal or not, he consistently left open the option to focus enforcement on more dangerous illegal immigrants. Where he was particularly vague, however, was on the scope of his flexibility and the tools at his disposal. DACA took a major step by creating a formal process for applicants, but he justified it as an extension of the concept of selective enforcement. In announcing DACA, Obama emphasized that it was a temporary policy. He did not issue an executive order. Rather, the policy was released by the Department of Homeland Security. Later in his presidency, Obama expanded the approach of deferred action to families, and for various reasons, that was blocked by the courts. There is no question that his interpretation of his authority grew over time. Trump said that when Obama signed the executive order on DACA, he acknowledged that he didn’t have the right to do it. The smaller errors in that statement are that Obama didn’t sign an executive order, and that when he announced the new policy, he didn’t say that he lacked the authority. The bigger issue is that in 2010 and 2011, Obama reserved the right to enforce immigration laws selectively. His emphasis was on deporting criminals who were undocumented, rather than undocumented students or workers who presented no threat to public safety. To be sure, Obama drove home the point many times that his hands were tied and that he had to follow the law. His words about his legal flexibility were vague and gave no hint about the DACA program, an approach that took the idea of selective enforcement to a new level.

No, Californians do not overwhelmingly oppose sanctuary policies
","Are nearly three quarters of Californians strongly opposed to so-called sanctuary state policies? That’s what GOP Assemblyman and candidate for governor Travis Allen claimed in a Jan. 2, 2018 interview on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight. ""Seventy four percent of Californians are absolutely against sanctuary state"" policies.  Allen made a similar claim in a Washington Examiner op-ed in October 2017, calling the state’s opposition to sanctuary policies ""overwhelming."" The Orange County lawmaker has vowed to defund sanctuary cities if elected governor. Background on sactuary state California became a sanctuary state in October 2017 when Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law that limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal authorities on immigration holds. The topic is controversial in California and nationally. President Trump has threatened to cut off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. And earlier this month, Trump’s acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Thomas Homan, threatened to jail elected officials in sanctuary cities. ""This isn’t the America I grew up in,"" Homan said in a separate Fox News interview, also on Jan. 2, 2018. ""We got to take these sanctuary cities on. We got to take them to court. And we got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes."" Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, a strong supporter of sanctuary policies, was defiant in response, telling the Sacramento Bee: ""They certainly know where to find me."" There’s no doubt some Californians oppose sanctuary policies. But we wanted to know whether 74 percent are ""absolutely against"" them as Allen claimed. We set out on a fact check. Our research Several polls have asked Californians about sanctuary policies in recent years. The four most recent we found all contradict Allen’s claim: • A November 2017 USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times survey found 53 percent favored and 29 percent opposed California’s sanctuary state legislation. Only 18 percent strongly opposed it, nowhere near the 74 percent Allen asserted. The survey asked ""Do you favor or oppose the new law that says California law enforcement personnel will not hand over immigrants in the country illegally to U.S. immigration agents, unless the person has committed a serious crime?"" • A March 2017 UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found conflicting results depending on the question asked. It showed 56 percent supported and 44 percent opposed ""local communities declaring themselves sanctuary cities and instructing local police and government employees not to automatically turn immigrants over to federal immigration officers when they are found to be in the country illegally."" When asked about the topic in a slightly different way, 53 percent opposed and 47 percent supported allowing cities and counties the right to ignore requests from federal authorities to detain illegal immigrants who have been arrested and are about to be released. • A May 2017 Public Policy Institute of California poll asked more specifically about California’s sanctuary state legislation. It found 48 percent of adults were in favor and 42 percent were opposed. • A January 2017 Public Policy Institute of California survey showed 58 percent of likely voters ""favor California’s state and local governments making their own policies and taking actions—separate from the federal government— to protect the rights of undocumented immigrants living in the state."" Only 39 percent opposed. Outdated survey Allen’s campaign responded to our request for evidence after publication. See our update at the end of this fact-check for its full response.  The lawmaker relied on a separate UC Berkeley IGS survey from September 2015. Results from that older survey do match up with the 74 percent figure Allen stated. It found 74 percent opposed the idea of local authorities ignoring a federal request to hold a detained person in the country illegally. The IGS survey asked essentially that same question in its March 2017 poll and found only a slight majority, 53 percent, opposed that idea. Jack Citrin, who led the IGS survey in 2015, explained the shift in Californians’ opinions to the New York Times this way, ""Partisanship was much less a factor"" in 2015, he said. ""But now I would say in California, whenever you ask pretty much any political question that may have some connection to Trump, you get a huge, huge partisan divide."" Recent polls show a majority of Californians disapprove of Trump and disagree with his policies, with the results falling along partisan lines. Mark DiCamillo, the current director of the IGS survey, said opinions on sanctuary policies, meanwhile, ""vary according to how you frame the issue."" Californians strongly favor cities having the ability to declare themselves sanctuaries and the option to not automatically turn over immigrants to federal authorities. But, as DiCamillo added, ""just ignoring a federal request is not as popular, it’s very divisive."" ""There are nuances to the issue, in my opinion, that affect public opinion and how it’s gauged,"" he said. Our ruling  Republican Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed ""74 percent of Californians are absolutely against sanctuary state"" policies. Allen appears to have based his numbers on a September 2015 survey. But much has changed since then: Donald Trump was elected president and recent polls show Californians’ opinions have evolved. Most importantly, we found four recent polls that contradict Allen’s statement. They show Californians generally favor cities having the ability to declare themselves sanctuaries. Two specifically found greater support than opposition for California’s sanctuary state law. We rate Allen’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: A spokeswoman for Allen’s campaign responded to our request for evidence after we published our fact check. She confirmed in an email that Allen was referring to the September 2015 IGS survey. The spokeswoman described that poll as""the most accurate and appropriate to use"" regarding California’s sanctuary state legislation.  She claimed the March 2017 IGS poll ""was biased"" and ""adds politics and inaccurate descriptions of sanctuary policies into the poll."" Her statement did not address the other recent surveys that show a majority, or near-majority, of Californians support sanctuary policies.

Did Democrats vote to deport Dreamers?
","A progressive advocacy group claims Democratic lawmakers have voted to deport so-called ""Dreamers,"" young immigrants in the country illegally. ""Democrats who just voted to deport Dreamers. Share to shame Democrats who are enabling Trump’s racism,"" said an image tweeted Dec. 21 by Credo Mobile, listing the names of 14 Democratic representatives, 17 Democratic senators and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine. Remember these names. Shame. #DreamActNow #DeportationCaucus @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer pic.twitter.com/za5l2v1jFQ The accusation is jarring after years of congressional Democrats pushing for legislation granting certain immigrants a chance to stay in the United States legally and have a pathway to U.S. citizenship. Contrary to their rhetoric, did dozens actually vote to kick them out of the country? Credo’s tweet came after members of the U.S. House and Senate, including Democrats, voted to continue funding the government short-term, until Jan. 19. The final bill that President Donald Trump signed into public law contained no reference to deportations or Dreamers. But immigrant advocates had urged Democrats to vote against the spending bills if they did not include a legislative solution for Dreamers who are at risk of deportation. Credo’s rationale is voting for a bill that doesn’t benefit Dreamers amounts to voting to deport them. That’s a mischaracterization of the actual content of the bill. The Trump administration in September rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program created during the Obama administration to prevent the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally who came to the United States as children. This group is often referred to as Dreamers. The government has granted DACA to about 800,000 people, and around 690,000 are currently protected. Despite rescinding DACA, Trump’s administration allowed DACA beneficiaries with permits expiring by March 5, 2018, (about 154,000 people) to apply for renewal in the fall. The vast majority of the 154,000 recipients were granted renewals or have an application pending, but about 21,000 don’t have a renewal pending, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Immigrants who chose not to submit renewal applications may be at risk of deportation based on that decision. (DHS acting spokesman Tyler Q. Houlton tweeted that not all DACA recipients choose to renew, so it does not necessarily mean that immigration officials denied the requests.) DACA recipients with permits expiring after March 5 are set to lose their deportation relief if Congress does not pass a bill to help them out. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., as well as other Democratic senators seeking re-election in 2018, support Dreamers but were not ready to shut down the government in December over the issue. ""I will exercise every bit of leverage I can for the Dream Act, but if there is a vote that would lead to a shutdown, that’s where I draw the line,"" Kaine told the Washington Post. On Dec. 21, lawmakers in the House and Senate approved short-term spending bills in order to prevent a government shutdown. The bill Trump signed into law did not have any provisions related to Dreamers, either to protect or deport them. Since Democrats didn’t force passage of the Dream Act, a bill to benefit Dreamers, some immigrants protected by DACA will be subject to deportation, Credo campaign manager Nicole Regalado told PolitiFact. ""We believe it is more than reasonable to assert that any Democrat who voted for December’s CR without any protections for DACA recipients voted to help Trump deport immigrant young people whose DACA status will expire in the coming weeks,"" Regalado said. However, it’s uncertain that lawmakers could have passed the Dream Act. Trump has said he expects ""massive border security"" in exchange for a solution for Dreamers, and Democrats have voiced strong opposition to his border wall, among other measures. The Trump administration has emphasized that any immigrant in the country illegally is subject to deportation, though Kirstjen Nielsen, in November during her Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Homeland Security, said DACA recipients whose protection expired would not be an enforcement priority. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the conversation would continue ""because it is an emergency."" ""They kicked the can for the omnibus into January. It’s this year, extended, that’s what it is. It’s the process,"" Pelosi told reporters, The Hill reported. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., a prominent immigrant advocate, tweeted that Democrats would continue fighting for Dreamers in 2018. His tweet came after confronting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ahead of the vote, according to the Washington Post. ""This fight continues in January & I think Dems are on same page now. Good of the country must outweigh any political calculations, therefore we'll be moving forward on #DreamAct under leadership of @RepLujanGrisham @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer & allies in House & Senate,"" Gutierrez tweeted Dec. 21. Credo tweeted that Democratic lawmakers who voted in favor of short-term spending bills in December ""just voted to deport Dreamers."" Lawmakers voted to continue funding the government until Jan. 19, but there was no language in the legislation to deport Dreamers. Credo contends that voting for a bill that does not include protection for Dreamers is essentially a vote to deport them. That’s an interpretation of the vote, but not an accurate representation of the content of the bill that was voted on.

Hollywood celebs didn't announce strike if Donald Trump won't resign
","Fake news reports said without evidence that celebrities threatened to go on strike unless President Donald Trump quit. ""Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign,"" said a Dec. 30 headline on Nourtey.com, a fake news website that attacks Democrats. The story suggested Rosie O’Donnell was among the celebrities threatening to go on strike. Facebook users flagged the Nourtey.com post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This story mimics earlier reports that have circulated for at least a year. Shortly before Trump’s inauguration, a similar story surfaced on therightists.com that said celebrities were calling for a strike within the movie industry in hopes that it would urge Trump to resign. Snopes found that the rumor stemmed from an ad in the New York Times by the group Refuse Fascism. The group, which included O’Donnell, called for millions to hold a protest to ""create a political crisis that prevents the Trump/Pence fascist regime from consolidating its hold on the governance of society."" Thousands of people, including musicians, actors, professors and authors, signed the petition as of Jan. 6, 2017. The celebrities were not calling for a strike barring Trump’s resignation. O'Donnell told NBC Late Night host Seth Meyers in November 2017 that she has been in a ""severe depression"" since Trump won the presidency and that she spends ""90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards"" Trump. The pair have bad blood going back to O’Donnell’s time on ABC’s The View, when she criticized Trump on multiple personal and professional fronts after his decision not to fire a Miss USA accused of drug use and other wrongdoing. We messaged O’Donnell on Facebook to ask if she had threatened to strike and received an automated message: ""Please use my memes and articles as a resource to fight against Trump. I read all of my messages. #LoveTrumpsHate #ResistTrump Please don't leave hateful comments or memes on my page. Stay Rosie.""

No proof that Queen Elizabeth removed Obamas from Prince Harry's wedding guest list
","The guest list for Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle has been the subject of fake news accounts — including one that Queen Elizabeth delivered a ""well-deserved and humiliating beatdown"" to Michelle Obama by striking her from the guest list. ""Queen Elizabeth removes Obamas from royal wedding guest list,"" said a Dec. 10 headline on America Today. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story is similar to an earlier article by Just News USA. We found only speculative news reports about whether the Obamas would be invited and no official reports about the guest list. We found no credible news articles which stated that the Queen struck the Obamas from the list. The fake story said that when Michelle Obama heard that Harry was marrying a black woman (Markle is biracial) she tried to ""sneak a spot on the guest list."" ""Barack, who had been practically stalking Prince Harry on Twitter in recent weeks, made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which served the purpose of letting the Royals know that he and Michelle were angling for an invitation to the wedding of the year,"" the story said. Ever since the couple announced their engagement in November, there have been multiple speculative news reports about who will and won’t be invited to the wedding. Some news reports based on unnamed sources said that the couple want the Obamas at their May 19 wedding. While the royal family has been friendly with the Obamas, we found no official reports. The royal family has put out two press releases regarding the engagement in November, and neither mention an invite list. On Dec. 27, while guest-editing a BBC morning radio program, Harry joked that the guest list was still a ways off. ""I don't know about that -- we haven't even put the invite or the guest list together yet. Who knows if (Obama's) going to be invited or not,"" Harry said. ""I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise."" News reports have speculated about whether Trump will be invited to the royal wedding although there is precedent for sitting U.S. presidents to not attend.   While those reports are speculative, Markle was critical of Trump before her engagement. In May 2016 while on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, Markle said Trump was ""divisive"" and ""misogynistic."" A headline said that ""Queen Elizabeth removes Obamas from royal wedding guest list."" We found no credible reports that the Queen took this action -- just speculation about whether the Obamas will be invited.

Is Donald Trump right that the Dow Jones just had its fastest-ever 1,000-point jump?
","In the wake of the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching the 25,000-point landmark, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to tout a new record.

Rick Perry says Aggies were kept out of governor's office until he made it in 2000
","
It’s well known that Gov. Rick Perry, just sworn in to a fresh four-year term, is a graduate of Texas A&M University, where he was a student yell leader. Not so well known: the claim Perry put forth in his inaugural address Tuesday on the south side of the Texas Capitol: ""For 154 years, they kept an Aggie out of the Governor’s Office."" 
We don’t read Perry’s remark as a claim that Aggies never even entered a governor’s office -- say, to visit. Still, we were hooked: Is Perry truly the first Aggie governor of Texas since statehood in 1845? 
News reports from the start of his first term say so. 
A Dec. 21, 2000, news article in the Austin American-Statesman said that after Gov. George W. Bush resigned that morning, then-Lt. Gov. Perry would be sworn in as his successor that afternoon. The story refers to Perry as ""the first Texas A&M graduate to get the job."" 
Likewise, a May 4, 2001 Associated Press dispatch on Perry’s first gubernatorial visit to A&M’s College Station campus opens: ""Aggie Rick Perry, the first Texas A&M graduate to be Texas governor..."" 
The AP story said other Aggies had run for governor, including 1990 Republican nominee Clayton Williams, but ""no Aggies have been elected."" Perry, a West Texan who graduated in 1972 with a degree in animal science, is quoted saying: ""Had it not been for my opportunity to get an education at Texas A&M,"" becoming governor ""wouldn't have been possible."" 
We checked the news reports by consulting an online database of gubernatorial biographies kept by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. 
According to Perry’s biography, he is ""the first Texas A&M graduate to occupy the Texas Governor’s Mansion."" 
Two previous guvs established A&M ties after serving in the state’s top elected office. Richard Hubbard, governor from 1876-1879, attended Mercer University in Georgia and then Harvard University, but later joined A&M’s board of directors, which later became the board of regents. And in 1891, Lawrence Sullivan Ross followed up two terms as governor by stepping ""immediately into the presidency of the seriously troubled Agricultural Mechanical College of Texas,"" which later was renamed Texas A&M University. 
Six governors have attended the University of Texas, most recently Dolph Briscoe, who graduated from from UT in 1942 before serving as governor from 1973-1979. Other governors were connected to UT in some other fashion, like Ann Richards, who graduated from Baylor University before earning her teaching certificate at UT in Austin.

North Kingstown wind turbine critics say spinning blades pose risk of seizures
","
To some, spinning wind turbines are a majestic source of pollution-free energy. But when they're proposed for residential areas, opponents often portray them as a menace to healthy, safety, aesthetics and property values.

The rhetoric can get pretty extreme.

When one was proposed in Barrington in 2008, opponents claimed that unnamed ""independent medical experts"" had found that turbines can cause everything from headaches to heart problems, and that sunlight flashing through the blades can produce a stroboscopic effect that may lead to nausea, dizziness, disorientation and seizures.

So when a massive 427-foot turbine was proposed for Stamp Farm on Route 2 in North Kingstown, it wasn't surprising that the opposition would echo those claims. One opponent was state Rep. Laurence Ehrhardt of North Kingstown. He co-authored an opinion column published in The Providence Journal with former North Kingstown Town Council President Edward Cooney.

For one of their bullet points, they played the epilepsy card: ""The health risk of 'flicker' impact created by shadows of blades of turbines poses real and significant health risks, particularly seizures.""

We've seen reports in the medical literature documenting that seizures can be caused by everything from Pokemon cartoons and ""Super Mario Brothers"" to the voice of former Entertainment Tonight host Mary Hart, but we've never seen any real evidence that wind turbines can trigger seizures. So we decided to investigate.

We contacted Ehrhardt and Cooney to ask for their source for the statement.

Ehrhardt said Cooney was responsible for that part of the commentary. Cooney sent us links to various articles available on anti-turbine websites.

None of them offered any documented case histories of people having seizures because of wind turbines. Instead, they say the turbines ""may"" cause seizures and they raise other issues with similarly tenuous evidence.

For example, North Kingstown opponents sent us to the website WindVigilance.com asserting that ""the health impact of visual burdens cannot be underestimated."" 
But the WindVigilance.com page, drafted by turbine opponents, doesn't say turbines pose a ""real"" seizure risk, as Ehrhardt and Cooney said. Instead, it says that flicker just ""has the potential to induce photosensitive epilepsy seizures, however the risk is low with large modern models and if proper planning is adhered to.""

Similarly, opponents sent us copies of a research report that looked at flicker and epilepsy, but the report only examined the conditions that might  cause a seizure.

Cooney referred us to ""a well-known study by Dr. Nina Pierpont, which addresses 'wind turbine syndrome' and the health risks associated with such.""

Pierpont's ""study"" is actually a book in which she reports on people who claim to have suffered all kinds of ills from living next to turbines, from blurred vision to rapid heart rate and panic attacks. But, according to her online resume, she has never published a study on any human health topic in any respected medical or scientific journal. One of her stated goals was to prove that the physical symptoms of the residents were real, not psychosomatic, a bias that most researchers try to avoid. 
In one of his emails, Cooney referred us to a 2007 report on wind turbines written by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. It reported that ""Thus far, there has been relatively little dispassionate analysis of the human impacts of wind-energy projects. Much that has been written has been from the vantage points of either proponents or opponents.""

That report, written by a panel of experts, concluded that shadow flicker ""can be a nuisance to people living near a wind-energy project"" but the frequency of the flickering ""is harmless to humans.""

In his e-mail, Cooney quotes the ""harmless to humans"" paragraph, which directly contradicts his claim. When asked about the contradiction, he responded: ""I stand by my statement.""

Another piece of evidence supplied by Cooney was a portion of a report called ""Planning for Renewable Energy. The section on flicker and epilepsy says only 0.5 percent of the population is epileptic, only about 5 percent of those are sensitive to flickering light, and less than 5 percent of those would be sensitive to the type of flicker produced by turbine blades. That's less than 1 in 80,000 people.

We contacted two epilepsy experts who said the concern was ridiculous because it was so unlikely.

David Mandelbaum, a neurologist and pediatrician at Brown University's Alpert Medical School, said even if an epileptic is sensitive to light, the flicker has to be at just the right frequency, and that frequency can vary widely from person to person.

Dr. Gregory Kent Bergey, director of the epilepsy center at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, said in an email: ""The fact is, the great majority of people with seizures [probably greater than 95 percent] do not have this photosensitivity."" Some patients may experience a brief spasm if they see the sun coming through the trees, ""but these seizures are usually readily controlled by medication. I do not tell these patients not to drive in the forest!""

He said ""the risk from sun coming through a wind turbine would be very small -- the person would first have to be looking at the sun, not just at a turbine, and most of us know not to look at the sun directly. . . . We cannot use this as a reason not to erect wind turbine farms."" 
Mandelbaum said he has never seen any reliable documentation that turbines can cause seizures, or any other health problems. ""They're using the epileptic community. It's clever and it's nonsense, and I find it personally offensive,"" he said.

Finally, we called a place where, if wind turbines did cause health problems, doctors would probably know about it.

Cogdell Memorial Hospital is near what is reputed to be the world's largest wind farm, located in Roscoe, Texas. The farm has 627 turbines spread out over 100,000 acres and 4 counties. Several are located along Route 84, where motorists would be exposed to flicker.

Said spokeswoman Belinda Kerr: ""We have not seen or treated any illnesses or injuries related to these wind farms.""

In the end, there may be valid arguments to make both for and against wind turbines in residential neighborhoods. But the seizure risk that Ehrhardt and Cooney cite is not one of them.

The ""real and significant"" health risks that they say turbine flicker poses are undocumented. If they exist, they are probably not very significant. To say that seizures are the best example is ridiculous.

We wish there were a more environmentally-friendly solution, but the Truth-O-Meter calls for some carbon-based combustion. Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028097715980>],/factchecks/2011/jan/19/laurence-ehrhardt/north-kingstown-wind-turbine-critics-say-spinning-/

Newsmax courts readers with statistic about federal waste in airline tickets
","
Newsmax, a conservative newsmagazine and website, recently sent an e-mail pitch to potential subscribers that spotlighted a few examples of supposedly wasteful federal spending. We saw it when one of our readers passed it along.

""Dear Newsmax Reader"" the e-mail read. ""The average American works three months a year, WITHOUT PAY, for the federal government. If you are in a higher tax bracket, you could be spending up to half your life working for Uncle Sam. And how is your money being spent?"" 
The example that most piqued our interest was this one: ""The refusal of many federal employees to fly coach costs taxpayers $146 million annually.""

We decided to check to see if the claim was correct.

An Internet search first directed us to a column by Brian Riedl, a fiscal policy specialist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The column was posted on the website of the Orange County Register on Nov. 25, 2009. Further research revealed that the data came from a September 2007 study by the Government Accountability Office, the non-partisan investigative arm of Congress.

The GAO concluded that at least $146 million was spent on ""improper first- and business-class travel government-wide"" between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006. It arrived at this number by obtaining billing information from government travel charge-card databases operated by Bank of America, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and U.S. Bank. The audit focused on executive branch agencies and wholly owned government corporations and excluded travel by the judicial and legislative branches. 
The rules defining justified premium air travel are complicated, but generally speaking, agencies can provide business class travel in circumstances such as when an individual has a physical disability that is certified by a medical professional or when a flight is to or from a destination outside the continental United States, exceeds 14 hours and is taken without a rest stop en route or at destination.

GAO researchers selected what they described as a statistically valid sample of 96 premium-class flight purchases with a price tag of $391,000. These purchases received close scrutiny.

""For each sample transaction, we requested that the entities provide the travel authorization, travel voucher, travel itinerary, and other related supporting documentations demonstrating justification for premium travel arrangements,"" the report said. ""Based on the information provided, we assessed whether premium class travel was properly authorized and whether the premium class travel was justified in accordance with (federal) or other applicable travel regulations. If, after repeated requests, the entities did not provide us with the supporting documentation, we concluded that the premium class travel was improper.""

All told, about two-thirds of the trips were either ""not properly authorized, not properly justified, or both,"" the GAO found. This percentage was then projected onto the universe of federal premium travel billings, which was $230 million over the time period studied. Adjusting slightly downward as a hedge against statistical error, GAO concluded that $146 million of the $230 million spent on premium flights was unjustified.

The GAO noted that the differences between first class, business class and coach tickets can be wide. Citing data from the General Services Administration, a federal agency, the GAO noted that government fare for business-class travel ""is typically more than 5 times the price of coach class travel for comparable routes, with some tickets costing more than 10 times as much. First-class travel can be even more costly. For example, we found that a round-trip first-class ticket from Washington, D.C., to London cost over $12,000 compared to a business class ticket that would have cost about $6,000, or a coach class ticket that would have cost less than $800.""

If you trust GAO's sampling and overall methodology -- and we have no reason to doubt it -- then Newsmax's presentation of the data seems pretty accurate. We only had two quibbles:

• The GAO's methodology doesn't delve into the question of the employee's motives when seeking a premium-class flight, so we think '""refusal"" is too strong a word for Newsmax to use when describring how the federal employees reacted to the idea of flying coach.

• GAO noted that the $230 million spent on premium-class flights accounted for less than 1 percent of the cost of all federal government flights during the period. So the overcharges themselves amounted to less than 1 percent of the total spent on federal airline travel.

When we asked Riedl about this, he said that ""the point is that taxpayers paid for $146 million in largely unnecessary spending. Whether that accounts for 1 percent, 10 percent, or 50 percent of the total federal travel budget is irrelevant to that point.""

We do think that knowing the full context might give readers a different impression, and we believe the word ""refusal"" oversteps. But in general, the $146 million number was determined by what appears to be a credible methodology, and by a group -- the GAO -- without a partisan axe to grind. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097704600>],/factchecks/2011/jan/18/newsmax/newsmax-courts-readers-statistic-about-federal-was/
"['Small Business', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says his tax cut plan will benefit 98 percent of small businesses in the state, freeing them to create jobs
","
When newly elected Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, offered up a tax cut plan for small business, it was reasonable to expect the GOP-led Legislature to approve it with few changes.

Turns out there are many practical obstacles to turning a campaign tax promise into reality.

Republican lawmakers are considering significant changes to Walker’s proposal, with a key meeting set for Jan. 20, 2011.

Some background: In the 2010 election, Walker promised a 1 percentage point income tax-rate cut for businesses with 50 employees or fewer.

After he took office Jan. 3, 2011, he changed and trimmed the plan substantially, proposing a credit targeting businesses with less than $500,000 in gross receipts. Even that scaled-back idea carried an $80 million price tag over two years.

In touting the change, here is what Walker said in a Jan. 5 news release:

""This legislation will provide tax relief to thousands of business owners, freeing them to expand and create jobs,"" Walker’s office said. ""98 percent of all small businesses will be eligible for tax relief under the Governor’s proposal.""

That’s a broad statement.

Does virtually every small business in the state stand to benefit from tax relief? And is it enough to spur job growth, as Walker claims?

To back the claim, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie provided us state tax-filing data showing that 98 percent of all Wisconsin businesses are under the $500,000 in gross receipts -- and therefore eligible to apply.

That number is not in dispute, but let’s drill down.

The information provided by Walker showed that in slightly more than half of tax returns, the businesses reported minimal gross sales -- somewhere between $1 and $10,000.

For that group, there would be negligible tax savings -- based on Walker’s data, it would average just over $1. That’s barely enough for a candy bar, much less a salary for a new employee.

Beyond that, there are two problems with the data provided.

First, it calculated the tax credit based on an earlier, more generous version of Walker’s current proposal. And second, it doesn’t account for businesses that don’t make a profit.

We couldn’t obtain similar data on Walker’s current proposal, but the state Department of Revenue provided another way to look at the expected size and reach of the 15 percent tax credit he proposed.

The department gave us a chart that projects the average tax credit for personal income tax filers who reported some portion of their income from business. (Most small business owners use the personal-income tax system to report their business income.) The data showed the largest group, with nearly 40 percent of those filers, was under $50,000 in income.

The average credit for that group: $37.

That’s at the low end.

The average credit tops out at $3,205 for a small group of high earners. They make up about 1 percent of those expected to qualify for the credit.

The overall average for all the 252,000 filers who could qualify for the credit -- $145. More than two-thirds would get less than $100 on average.

From both sets of statistics, it’s apparent that -- for the majority of those eligible -- the tax credit is enough to stock up on a limited supply of paper clips and printer paper, but not nearly enough to create a job.

Right off the bat that takes some wind out of Walker’s claim that the credit would quickly spur needed job creation.

The problems don’t stop there.

Businesses that don’t turn a profit in 2011 would not get a credit -- unless they make money in a future year and take it then. Walker’s plan -- set up as an offsetting credit -- kicks in when taxes are owed. It was not set up as a refundable credit; that could have allowed businesses to get it regardless of whether they made a profit.

So some percentage of small businesses may be eligible based on gross receipts but won’t qualify for a credit next year because they made no profit and therefore have no state tax liability.

How many is that?

State officials couldn’t say exactly.

But the number is apparently substantial. Walker’s information listed 335,000 business tax returns that would meet his gross-receipts test, but revenue officials said a much smaller number -- 245,000 filers -- likely would qualify to get the tax credit. They attributed some of the difference to filers who didn’t profit enough to owe taxes.

So the no-profit issue means those businesses won’t be getting a credit any time soon.

Finally, in some cases the tax credit would go to self-employed business people who have no employees. Some critics question how job creation would result from giving them a small credit.

Bill Smith, head of the state’s leading small-business membership group, likes Walker’s plan -- but not because it would propel hiring by those who get the credit.

""I’m not suggesting you’re going to have all this wonderful job creation out there,"" said Smith, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business.

Smith said the public should view the tax credits as a kind of indirect economic stimulus, because that $37 credit or $100 credit (or whatever amount it is) will be spent at restaurants or hardware stores or at other Main Street businesses, helping those operations during tough times.

Smith also said Walker’s tax plan, along with other measures like lawsuit limits, would boost the spirits of business owners who are pessimistic right now.

Walker’s original small-business tax cut -- the one targeted at 50-employee firms or smaller -- would have included firms with $2 million or more in gross sales, Smith said. So it would have reached a much larger group than his current plan.

Another small-business group leader, with the Independent Business Association of Wisconsin, said it’s possible that as few as 20 percent of the group’s members would fit under the $500,000 sales threshold.

Bart Adams, an accountant and IBA board member, said the group is not taking a position on Walker’s proposal.

Let’s return to the bottom line:

Walker said 98 percent of small businesses ""will be eligible"" for job-creating tax relief under his emergency plan to jump-start the lagging Wisconsin economy. There are that many businesses under the $500,000 threshold -- but that’s just the beginning of the story.

They may all be eligible to apply, but many won’t qualify for a tax credit of any significant size. And the number gets substantially reduced because unprofitable businesses won’t see a credit until they turn around. Even business advocates don’t contend it would help recipients create jobs, as Walker claims.

We rate Walker’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968BF380>],/factchecks/2011/jan/18/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-tax-cut-plan-w/
"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Phil Gingrey']","
Marietta Republican says a single immigrant can lead to more than 270 others
","
U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey wants Georgians to know that even a trickle of immigration can lead to a deluge.

The Marietta Republican explained just how bad he thinks it can get during a state legislative committee meeting on immigration. Speaking via a video conference transmission from Washington on Dec. 16, he put blame on the shoulders of national immigration policy.

""And so now, under the policy, our immigration policy, literally one person with a green card can bring in, in the extreme ... 279 people.""

That sounds like a lot. Is this true?

Immigration became a central issue during the election season when now-Gov. Nathan Deal and his Democratic foe, former Gov. Roy Barnes, both called for an Arizona-style immigration law. That state's decision to take a more active role enforcing federal laws prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to file suit against it.

We called Gingrey's office for evidence. A staffer referred us to NumbersUSA, a nonprofit group that advocates for lower immigration levels.

Roy Beck, the group's executive director, said he did not know of any cases where this happened, but he stressed it's possible through ""chain migration."" That's when immigrants take advantage of U.S. rules that allow them to bring their relatives here.

Foreigners who obtain green cards can apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to bring their spouses and unmarried children. If they become citizens and are over age 21, they can also apply to bring in their married children, parents and siblings.

We checked NumbersUSA's math.

The group used immigration rules and fertility rates for less-developed countries to determine that 273 relatives of a legal immigrant can follow him during the next 15 years. (Gingrey said 279, but we won't count this slight difference against him.)

Since Gingrey said such immigration was possible ""in the extreme,"" we accepted the group's assumptions such as that in recent years, families in the less-developed world have, on average, three children, and that all of an immigrant's eligible family members would leave for the U.S. and become citizens as soon as they could legally do so.

We also assumed there were absolutely no visa processing waits and that immigration backlogs do not exist.

We found NumbersUSA's estimate was not based on ""literally one person with a green card"" entering the country, as Gingrey said. Their estimate assumes that the first immigrant comes here as a worker with his spouse and three children. This roughly doubles its estimate.

We also found that immigration researchers generally agree that in the real world, such large-scale immigration is at least extremely unlikely if not impossible.

Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, is critical of chain migration, but she noted that administrative wait times and quotas can make such large-scale migration difficult. She had not heard of a case where this has happened. 

Karen Woodrow-Lafield, who studies immigration as a professor at the Maryland Population Research Center at the University of Maryland, noted those same problems. She said such numbers are ""not possible under the current immigration system"" because of visa application backlogs.

Atlanta's USCIS field office now takes four or five months to process immigration documents. In California, the processing time for U.S. citizens to bring in siblings is more than four years.

Crystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, a national association of attorneys and law professors who practice and teach immigration law, said her group also determined that NumbersUSA's figures are not possible. Her group supports the U.S. Justice Department's suit against Arizona.

""If people could bring in those numbers, they would have,"" Williams said. ""But they didn't.""

U.S. law sets yearly quotas on legal permanent residents and caps the percentage of potential immigrants from a particular country to 7 percent.

This means waits that can last for decades. For instance, Filipino siblings of U.S. residents who applied for visas before Jan. 1, 1988, are only just beginning to be interviewed for entry, according to the U.S. State Department. For countries without backlogs, the date is Jan. 1, 2002. 

In reality, chain-migration numbers are much lower, experts who study the subject told us.  Over a span of 20 years, immigrants who came in on employment visas in 1971 brought in an average of one resident.

More recently, one researcher found that on average, one foreign citizen brings in 2.1 others under family reunification rules. And another study shows only some 10 percent of immigrants who got their green cards in 2003 petitioned to bring a relative to the U.S.

So what does this mean?

Gingrey said that ""literally one person with a green card"" could bring in more than 270 others ""in the extreme."" But we found his figure was not based on one person. It's based on a family of five.

We found this scenario is likely impossible under quotas established under current immigration policy. Quotas mean it can take years -- even decades. Merely processing immigration documents can take months, if not years.

Given that recent data show that the average immigrant brings in 2.1 others in his lifetime, Gingrey could easily have remained within the bounds of accuracy by describing an ""extreme"" scenario as one where two or three dozen others followed the first immigrant within 15 years. 

Instead, he said ""279"" -- hundreds more than ""extreme."" We therefore rule Gingrey's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A405040>],/factchecks/2011/jan/18/phil-gingrey/marietta-republican-says-single-immigrant-can-lead/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Dennis Kucinich']","
Rep. Dennis Kucinich claims a chunk of health care dollars don't go toward care
","
Republicans took control of the House of Representatives this month with the announced intention of dismantling the new health care law.

They started by approving rules that would permit the legislation's repeal without any requirement to make up resulting losses in revenue. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Health Care Law Act would reduce federal budget deficits by $145 billion over 10 years. Repealing the legislation (which Republicans formally labeled ""the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act"") would increase federal deficits $230 billion over the next decade.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich is among defenders of the health care law. One of its benefits ""is to make sure that more of the health care premium dollar goes for, in fact, health care,"" the Cleveland Democrat said in an interview on CNN.

""You have to keep in mind,"" he said, ""that prior to the passage of the health care reform bill, one out of $3, of every health care dollar spent, went for corporate profits, stock options, executive salaries, advertising and marketing, the cost of paperwork -- that was over $800 billion a year -- didn't go for health care.""

That's a lot of expenses. PolitiFact Ohio thought it would check Kucinich’s statement.

The congressman's staff said his primary source for the breakdown was a much-cited study by Drs. Steffie Woolhandler and David Himmelstein of Harvard Medical School. Published in 2003 in the New England Journal of Medicine, the peer-reviewed study analyzed administrative costs of the U.S. health system, and found that they consume 31 percent of health spending.

Kucinich's estimate of the total tab comes from the the official estimate of total health care spending in the United States, the National Health Expenditure Accounts issued by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Their latest report, issued this month, said that health expenditures in 2009 reached $2.5 trillion. (The figure represented the slowest rate of increase in 50 years, which was attributed to people losing jobs and health insurance and deferring medical care.)

We did the math. Thirty-one percent of that comes to $775 billion -- close to $800 billion, but not ""over"" it.

But the 31 percent figure might be too low, and a higher percentage could push costs past $800 billion.

Kucinich’s staff noted that the study by Woolhandler and Himmelstein looked at administrative costs for the year 1999. Costs since then, they said, reflect ""immense growth in (health coverage) plans more complicated to administer."" Going back to 1970, the number of physicians has increased by less than 200 percent while the number of administrators has increased by 3,000 percent, according to the federal government and an analysis by Himmelstein and Woolhandler.

Woolhandler was lead researcher for the 2003 study of administrative costs. Since then, she told us,  ""I think it is likely costs have gone up just a little bit as a share"" of total expenditures. ""The reason they haven't gone up hugely as a share is that they were so high to begin with.""

So does that mean the annual cost could top $800 billion? Woolhandler told us she thinks Kucinich’s numbers are correct. But she, too, is offering an educated opinion, rather than a statement rooted in new numbers and up-to-date data.

So where does that leave him on the Truth-O-Meter?

"['Afghanistan', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
An Aghan solider's first car is an HMMWV, Marco Rubio says
","
Florida's U.S. senator, Marco Rubio, joined other senators on a secret visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan over the Martin Luther King Day weekend, where Rubio saw first-hand America's efforts to hand over security and governmental operations to the Afghan people.

Rubio and the six other Republican senators did not announce their trip until a conference call with reporters on the morning of Jan. 17, 2011, as the group was preparing to leave. Rubio said that in Pakistan, he met parliament members and U.S. embassy officials. In Afghanistan, Rubio observed Afghan military exercises and met with Gen. David Petraeus and Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

Speaking from Kabul, Rubio said 2011 would be a ""critical"" year for Afghan military forces to ""step up,"" but dismissed plans for the U.S. to begin withdrawing troops this summer.

""I think we are on the timeline this year to have some real good news and make some significant progress, but I think if you attach a date to it, that you talk about openly in the press especially, you are really creating a difficult situation,"" Rubio said. ""The bad guys, the Taliban and even al-Qaida, must know all they have to do is wait.""

Rubio also addressed the challenges in training the Afghan National Army to take over as the primary security force for the country. Currently, there are about 132,000 international troops in Afghanistan, including 90,000 Americans.

""Some of the men serving in the (Afghan) armed forces have never driven a vehicle before,"" he said. ""The first time they've ever driven a car or any kind of vehicle is a HMMWV mine-cleaning vehicle.""

Rubio's statement was meant to broadly illustrate the difficulties in training Afghan men to join a 21st century military force. But we were curious, if on the specifics of the driving claim, Rubio was correct.

As part of their mission, American troops are teaching the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police weapons and combat training, crisis management and all the other skills modern-day Army and police personnel need.

That includes driving the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWVs) and other military vehicles.

We found several accounts of the driver training courses, which last several weeks. Each story helps confirm Rubio's claim. Many Afghani men joining the Army haven't driven before.

Here's an excerpt from a story written for the website of the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan: ""For many of the students, it's the first time they've sat behind the wheel of a vehicle, let alone behind that of an up-armored military vehicle. They don't know the driving basics -- braking, seat belt, mirror use or signals -– or the more complicated concepts of manual transmission and engine maintenance.""

New Afghan drivers have difficulty adjusting to using a rear-view mirror, said Army Sgt. Ernest Richardson, U.S. Army driver course team leader. They also have problems with turn signals. (In Afghanistan, many people use a blinker to indicate it's safe for someone else to pass, rather than an indication of changing lanes or turning.)

An Army account of its 60-day course says trainees are taught on three vehicles: a Ford Ranger pick-up truck, an armored HMMWV, and a seven-ton flat-bed truck.

""A lot of the students who come to the course have never driven before,"" said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Darwynn Palmer. ""So teaching them to drive is like teaching a teenager in the U.S. to drive. It's a challenge, but they eventually pick it up.""

The Army story quoted Mohammed Aghai, an Afghan National Army solider, who was learning to drive for the first time. ""I'm here to learn how to be a good driver and so far, I've learned a lot from both the U.S. and the Afghan instructors,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to completing this class because it will help me, my unit and the ANA.""

An ABC News story also dealt with the difficulties in something as simple as teaching Afghan soldiers to drive.

""About 95 to 98 percent have never driven,"" U.S. Army Capt. Jon Doiron said. ""We are looking at about 90 to 95 percent that are also illiterate in the training as well, so we are having to teach them how to read the different gauges -- everything on the vehicle, as well as any sort of safety warning or anything like that.""

To confirm the news reports, we reached out to Nazif Shahrani, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at Indiana University and an expert on Afghanistan.

He said many people in Afghanistan are unlikely to have driven because the country has been consumed by war for much of the last 30 years.

""The statement you have quoted from Marco Rubio seems plausible because a great majority of Afghans of military age have grown up during the devastating war years of the last three decades plus, and are unlikely to have driven any vehicles,"" Shahrani said. Shahrani said the inability to drive would be particularly common in the remote Afghan countryside.

Experts and news accounts agree with Rubio. One of the problems facing American soldiers training the new Afghan army is that many members of the new Afghan force don't know how to drive or have never driven.

"['Georgia', 'Weather', 'John Eaves']","
Was snowstorm that rare?
","
Now that metro Atlantans have freed themselves from the unyielding grip of ice and snow that descended upon the region last week, we thought it was time for some perspective about the magnitude of this mess.

The miserable road conditions put several elected officials on the defensive. Fulton County Commission Chairman John Eaves explained why he felt it wouldn’t make sense to invest in snowplows or more spreader trucks.

""You’ve got to weigh the cost versus the need,"" he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""The reality is, this kind of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years.""

Is Eaves correct? Was this a ""perfect storm"" that comes along only every decade or so?

Didn’t we just have a ""white Christmas"" that shut down schools and caused the airlines to cancel hundreds of flights at the airport?  

PolitiFact Georgia contacted the National Weather Service’s local offices, headquartered in Peachtree City. Meteorologist Matt Sena noted that 3.7 inches of snow fell at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Jan. 9. By contrast, there were 4.2 inches of snow recorded at the airport on March 1, 2009.

There! These types of snowstorms are more frequent than once a decade.

But it’s not that simple, Sena told us. What made the last week’s storm different  -- very different -- is the dangerous combination of snow, followed by sleet and freezing rain, followed by Arctic temperatures that turned much of metro Atlanta into a skating rink for much of the week, he said.

So have there been similar combinations of subfreezing temperatures and precipitation that have lasted for days? If so, how often do they occur?

Over the past 80 years, there have been 11 snowstorms of 4 inches or more in the city of Atlanta. The highest total was on Jan. 23, 1940, when 8.3 inches of the white stuff fell on Atlanta.

The March 2009 snowfall was the most recent case for more than 4 inches. It closed some school districts for a day, about 12,000 metro Atlanta residents lost power and Delta canceled about 300 round-trip flights. Two days later, most of the roads had dried off, and flights were back on schedule.

Channel 2 Action News meteorologist David Chandley noted the March 2009 snowstorm and some others didn’t have the lingering impact because they didn’t have the Arctic air blast afterward that turned the snow into ice.

Many say the last comparable weather event to the past week took place when Atlanta was expecting lots of company: in January 2000, the week before it hosted the Super Bowl. An ice storm left more than 300,000 homes and businesses without power for days. More than a quarter-inch-thick ice hung from every surface. On the weekend of the big game, a second wave of ice tackled the region. There was a 47-vehicle crash on I-20, west of the city. The St. Louis Rams won the game in a thrilling finish, but many visitors remember the weekend for the wicked weather. Atlanta hasn’t hosted a Super Bowl since.

A snowstorm in March 1960 blanketed Atlanta and much of North Georgia with as much as 10 inches.

A little more than a decade later, in January 1973, a cold rain turned into an icy nightmare. The ice froze power lines, causing many of them to crash, creating a light show that could compete with the Independence Day fireworks display at Lenox Square. For three days, more than 200,000 people were without power.

Nearly ten years later, on Jan. 12, 1982, there was ""Snowjam."" Seven inches of snow fell across Atlanta over three days. All of the city’s 1,425 miles of surface streets and 200 miles of interstate highways were immobilized. The snowstorm scared Atlantans so much that the AJC reported many fled the city before an anticipated snowfall in 1983 ""like extras in a disaster movie.""

In March 1993, metro Atlanta was pounded by a blizzard that exceeded predictions. Winds reached 50 mph, as much as 1 foot of snow reportedly fell and the temperature plummeted into the teens. Some call it the ""Super Storm of 1993.""

Sena contends snowstorms like this in 1993 and the most recent storm are rare.

""Temperatures were cool beforehand … and we stayed below freezing days afterward,"" he said.

Indeed, the thermometer rarely poked above the freezing point most of the week, causing ice to coat roads throughout the region.

Chandley, who has been at Channel 2 Action News since November 1988 and lived in the area before that, said the worst storm he has seen was Snowjam because it took the region by surprise. This month’s storm is unusual, he said, because of the low temperatures that froze the snow for several days afterward.

Because of the cold air that followed this storm, Chandley called it a ""once-in-a-generation type of thing.""

Eaves seems to have a point about the frequency of this type of weather. We occasionally get snow and we occasionally get ice. But we rarely get the snow-ice-Arctic-conditions metro Atlanta lived through last week.

We may not like how state and local officials responded to the snow and ice, but history shows this perfect storm of winter weather is rare. Eaves’ estimate of this type of thing occurring only every 10 to 15 years might actually be a bit conservative.

We rate his statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096ECA1C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/17/john-eaves/was-snowstorm-rare/

Attack on DeWine's health reform position tests the definition of voluntary
","
Wasting no time, new Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine made good on his campaign pledge to challenge the 2010 federal health care law as unconstitutional. DeWine, a Republican, notified Florida Attorney General Pamela Jo Bondi on Jan. 10 that he would join 20 other states that have already signed on to try to invalidate the Affordable Care Act in U.S. District Court in Florida.

The gist of the lawsuit, as DeWine explained in a news release: ""The federal government simply does not have the right to force someone to buy a product -- be it health insurance or any other type of goods or services that an individual may or may not want -- or face a penalty."" Under the Affordable Care Act, that requirement to buy health insurance would begin in 2014.

Critics pounced, their reactions as predictable as DeWine’s. But one group in particular, the labor union-affiliated Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans, drew our attention when it said in a news release that DeWine’s first act as state attorney general was ""at odds"" with his actions as a U.S. senator. When we called to learn more about this claim, Norman Wernet, field organizer for the group, told us that DeWine was being ""not only a little illogical but also hypocritical.""

That’s because as a senator, DeWine in 2003 supported a bill that added prescription drug coverage to Medicare, the federal government’s health program for seniors. Seniors would have to buy this coverage to participate, starting in 2006, and the law had a penalty for not buying drug coverage when eligible, said the alliance. It was a ""mandate"" no different from the new one requiring all Americans to get health insurance or face a fine, according to the alliance’s news release and our interview with Wernet.

""It appears that what was constitutional to Senator DeWine in 2003 is no longer so,"" said the news release, going on to criticize the Medicare prescription drug law for additional reasons only tangentially related to the claim of constitutional hypocrisy.  ""This pang of conscience seems to us to be more political theatrics than sound use of Ohio’s time and money.""

We are not going to debate whether either of these laws is good or bad or whom they benefit. And far be it from us to argue the hotly debated question of whether the mandate to buy health care insurance or face penalties flies in the face of the Constitution. Federal courts will settle that.

Instead, we have a more basic question to settle, because the alliance’s claim was news to us. We did not know that the 2003 Medicare prescription drug law had a mandate: Buy drug coverage (it is known as Medicare Part D) or else be penalized.

As it turns out, neither did the groups with whom we checked. It needs to be noted that these sources, including the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health policy, do not wish to engage in political debate. They have no beef with DeWine or the Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans.

But they referred us to their analyses, and to fact sheets from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, that described the Medicare prescription drug coverage as voluntary. That word -- voluntary -- shows up repeatedly. We read the 2003 bill itself, too, which could not say it more clearly, because the section establishing the drug program has this title: ‘‘PART D—VOLUNTARY PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT PROGRAM.""

We read the description of the program published by the pharmacy school of the University of California at San Francisco, which said: ""It is voluntary.""

Finally, we asked CMS directly: Is enrollment mandatory or voluntary? CMS spokesman Tony Salters said, ""Voluntary is correct.""

With so many people and publications saying the program is voluntary, how then, could the Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans see it so differently?

As Wernet explains his group’s take, everyone who is 65 or over and retired must either get into a Medicare Part D plan or have similar drug coverage, such as from the Department of Veterans Affairs or through a retiree health plan. Otherwise, they must pay a penalty when joining later. That penalty amounts to 1 percent of the cost of a drug policy for each month the enrollee has delayed since he or she was eligible, and it is added to the monthly premium the senior will pay.

Yes, we asked, but can’t a retiree delay enrolling indefinitely and therefore never face a fine?

What about wealthy seniors who don’t care about reducing their prescription costs (seniors with low incomes may qualify for subsidies to pay for Part D coverage), or healthy seniors who don’t have high drug costs or need a prescription policies? What about independent-minded people who just don’t want any part of this government-created health care system?

Here is where the interpretations of ""voluntary"" diverge.

Wernet said that eventually, the need for prescriptions and the financial pinch of paying for them catches up with people. So in reality, just about everyone winds up with some kind of coverage. Yet those who don’t sign up quickly, perhaps trying to ""game"" the system by waiting (and saving on premiums), get hit with the penalty.

It is the same principle as in the new health care law, he said: You can try to avoid getting health care coverage until you get sick and decide you need it, but you’re going to pay a penalty. One penalty -- written in the 2010 health insurance law -- will kick in quickly once that provision takes effect, while other -- from the 2003 Medicare prescription law -- kicks in when seniors finally decide to enroll. The timing is different but the principle, he said, is the same.

""To us, it seems to be a distinction without a difference,"" Wernet said. ""What Congress said in 2003 is no different than what Congress said in 2010: You can’t game the system.""

We see a significant difference, however.

The 2003 law that DeWine backed did not have a mandate. If you want to roll the dice when you retire, Congress said you certainly may. You’ll pay a penalty for delaying if you change your mind, but you are free not to change your mind. You have that choice -- and about 4.7 million people, or 10 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, have made that choice, according to CMS figures cited by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Not a one of them is paying a fine.

In other words, DeWine is not being hypocritical in challenging the 2010 health insurance mandate, because when he voted in 2003 for the prescription insurance program, he was not supporting a mandate.

That’s why we rate the Alliance for Retired Americans’ claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BDC080>],/factchecks/2011/jan/17/ohio-alliance-retired-americans/attack-dewines-health-reform-position-voluntarily-/
"['Oregon', 'Public Service', 'Greg Walden']","
Rep. Greg Walden says nearly half the incoming Republicans are newcomers to politics
","
Members of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as the chamber’s groupies love telling anyone who’ll listen how it is the ""people’s house,"" a sometimes raucous and befuddling chamber of 435 members whose backgrounds and ideologies are a cross-section of the entire nation.

This year especially, the preferred message is that your representative is probably like you -- hard working, honest, genuine, young and old, educated and not. He or she, the thinking goes, has come to Washington on a noble journey, the furthest thing from the most hated label of all - career politician.

Republican Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon seemed to suggest all of that and more when he made this point while delivering the Republican weekly radio response on Nov. 13: ""The incoming Republican freshman class – well, it’s no ordinary group: nearly half of its roughly 80 members have never served in elective office before.""

This theme has even more power this year in the wake of the Tea Party movement’s success and its assertion that Washington is the problem; that it’s populated by free-spending, self-serving career politicians. And as Congress gets ready for serious work it’s the fuel for Republican energy in the House.

So let’s take a look at the numbers to see if the impression Walden paints holds up.

When the House convened Jan. 5, 85 newly elected Republicans were sworn into office. (The total is different from Walden’s because some races were undecided when he spoke. Back then, not all Republicans had been declared winners. Also, Republicans claim 87 new members were sworn in. But two arrived at the tail-end of the previous Congress)

Of the 85, 32 Republican freshmen never held a publicly elected office before, according to the National Republican Campaign Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the House. (Not every one of those 32, however, is a complete novice. At least three worked previously as congressional aides or at the White House, one is on the Republican National Committee’s executive committee and at least two raced unsuccessfully for other public offices in the past.)

In real terms, that means 38 percent of the newest Republicans in the House never held elective office before. If you base the calculation on information known at the time Walden spoke, it’s still about 36 percent. Either way it’s a bit of a reach from ""nearly a half,’’ as Walden suggests. By comparison, only one of the nine Democrats newly elected to the House could claim to be a political neophyte.

Walden’s staff says he used two sources for his claim. A column in the website PoliticsDaily that flatly said - without offering any support or attribution - that 35 new Republicans came from non-political backgrounds. The second source was the National Republican Congressional Committee, which according to Walden’s office, said 32 had never held elective office before.

The final number is 32.

Does this really matter? Not really. As they say for the stock market, past performance doesn’t predict future actions. The same is true in Congress, where members often find themselves taking positions and votes that they did not envision while running for office.

And that does nothing to diminish the truly diverse background of the incoming class of the 112th Congress. The new Republicans include Tim Griffin of Arkansas, a former assistant U.S. attorney; Robert Dold of Illinois owns a pest control business, was a White House aide and once managed an Internet data storage concern.

There are farmers and surgeons and airline pilots. There is Michael Grimm of New York, who owns a health food store and was an FBI agent and Jon Runyan who, before arriving in Washington, was an All-Pro offensive tackle in the NFL. There’s alsoJames Lankford of Oklahoma, who worked as a religious youth camp director before winning election to the House.

All of this is interesting and supports Walden’s claim that the new GOP class in the House brings considerable non-political experience. But the gap between 38 percent and Walden’s suggestion of ""nearly half"" is simply too wide. For this reason, we rate his claim Barely True.

Houston group says Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican
","Raging Elephants, a Houston-based group involved in unsuccessful efforts to stop GOP state Rep. Joe Straus from winning another turn as Texas House speaker, says on its website that it's dedicated to bringing more ""Americans of color"" to the ranks of conservative voters. Posted on the site is a video of a speech by the group's leader, Apostle Claver Kamau-Imani, titled ""Apostle Claver tells the world how the real party of racism is the Democrats."" Also on the site, the group claims: ""Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican!"" We weren't aware that the late civil rights leader ever expressed a partisan affiliation. Yet, we discovered, Republican groups have previously declared King one of their own. In 2006, the Sarasota, Fla.-based National Black Republican Association ran radio ads in Washington, D.C.; Georgia; Maryland; Ohio; and Pennsylvania including the statement that King was a Republican, according to an Oct. 19, 2006, Washington Post news story. And in 2008, according to news reports, the same group — whose website says it ""is dedicated to promoting the traditional values of the black community, which are in concert with the core Republican Party philosophy of strong families, personal responsibility, quality education and equal opportunities for all"" — paid for eight billboards bearing that message in Florida and South Carolina, as well as 50 billboards in Denver during the Democratic National Convention, where Barack Obama became the party's presidential nominee. In July 2009, Raging Elephants made the same claim on a Houston billboard, according to a July 14, 2009, news article on the Fox News Channel's website and a July 9, 2009, column in the Houston Chronicle. Kamau-Imani told FoxNews.com that the purpose of the billboard was to get blacks to rethink their political affiliation; African Americans typically vote for Democrats. ""We think it's imperative that (the GOP) try and attract more people from the communities of color to vote their values — to vote conservative,"" Kamau-Imani told FoxNews.com. The King message has drawn objections. In Houston, the Fox News story says, local activist Quanell X held a news conference to speak out against the sign. Earlier, an Associated Press news article about the billboards posted in Florida reported that the chairman of the Florida Legislative Black Caucus, Democratic state Rep. Joe Gibbons, called the statement ridiculous. ""To make a claim without presenting proof is bogus,"" he is quoted as saying in the July 4, 2008, story. Frances Rice, chairwoman of the National Black Republican Association, was quoted by the Post in 2006 as saying that the backlash from the radio ads was so great that she stopped answering telephone calls. But she stood by the claim that King was a Republican. ""We were all Republicans in those days,"" she told the Post. ""The Democrats were training fire hoses on us, siccing dogs on us."" The Post story says it's correct that Southern Democrats ""blocked the social and political progress of black Southerners for decades."" When we asked Raging Elephants for information to support its claim that King himself was a Republican, Kamau-Imani pointed us to a video made by the National Black Republican Association featuring one of King's nieces, Alveda King, founder of the faith-based group King for America. In the Sept. 14, 2008, video, she says: ""I just want to share with you a little bit about my family and my history. My uncle Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during his lifetime was a Republican, as was my father, his brother, Rev. A. D. King, and my grandfather, Dr. Martin Luther King Sr."" She adds: ""The Republican Party historically has supported the rights of the oppressed. During the times of slavery, many of the abolitionists were Republicans."" Our attempts to contact Alveda King were unsuccessful. Next, we sought historical expertise, including by asking Thomas Jackson, a history professor at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro and author of From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Struggle for Economic Justice, for his take on the video. He told us that Alveda King's description of the Republican Party's history was on the mark. ""The Party of (Abraham) Lincoln defended black rights most vocally in the 1860s and 1870s, then abandoned the cause when the Democrats and the (Ku Klux) Klan defeated Republican state governments in the South. Blacks started their historic switch to the Democrats during the New Deal,"" which were economic programs implemented in the 1930s under President Franklin Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. But Jackson said that he would not consider King a Republican, calling him instead a "" 'tax and spend' democratic socialist."" ""He wanted the nation to spend billions of dollars directly to employ the unemployed when the private sector failed, and a vigorous mixture of affirmative action and anti-poverty programs championed by the liberal-left, and targeted federal spending in impoverished areas, especially the nation's slums,"" Jackson said. David Garrow — author of Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for biography — advised against assigning King to either party. ""It's simply incorrect to call Dr. King a Republican,"" Garrow told us. However, he said he wouldn't call King a Democrat, either, because he had ""very positive feelings"" about Republican Richard Nixon in the late 1950s and ""extremely positive feelings"" about Republican Nelson Rockefeller, the New York governor who later served as vice president. Also, Garrow said, King became ""a very harsh critic"" of Democratic President Lyndon Johnson over his escalation of the Vietnam War and ""wouldn't necessarily have backed (Democratic presidential nominee) Hubert Humphrey in '68 had he (King) lived."" We asked Garrow about the 2006 Post article's statements that King had voted for Democratic presidential candidates John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Lyndon Johnson in 1964. He said there is little doubt that King did so. But that doesn't mean King made public his political preferences. In his book, Garrow writes that during the 1960 race between Kennedy and Republican Richard Nixon, King declined to endorse either nominee — even after Kennedy associates interceded with officials in Georgia to help secure King's release from jail on a probation violation. The closest King came to that was a few days before the election when he released a statement that said: ""I want to make it palpably clear that I am deeply grateful to Senator Kennedy for the genuine concern he expressed. ... (He) exhibited moral courage of a high order."" King's father, however, was so grateful to Kennedy that he announced he was shifting his traditionally Republican presidential preference to vote for Kennedy, according to Garrow's book. King was more vocal about the candidates in the 1964 presidential election, when Johnson faced GOP nominee Barry Goldwater, who as an Arizona senator had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Garrow told us that King ""certainly did all but explicitly endorse LBJ in '64 and strongly criticize the Goldwater candidacy."" Garrow writes in Bearing the Cross that King urged his supporters to vote against Goldwater and all GOP candidates who did not disassociate from him. According to the King Online Encyclopedia, from Stanford University's Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, King campaigned for Johnson and welcomed his win. Next, we wondered what the King Center in Atlanta, founded by King's wife, the late Coretta Scott King, had to say about his partisanship. In 2008, Steve Klein, the center's communications director, told the National Journal that ""there is absolutely no confirmation that (King) was a Republican. ... He was never a member of any political party — and never formally endorsed any candidates."" Klein noted Coretta Scott King's recall of a 1960 phone call from Kennedy when her husband was in jail. In her book, My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr., she wrote that she took the call but was later unsure what to say about it. ""My husband had a policy of not endorsing presidential candidates,"" her book says. ""And at this point, I did not want to get him or myself identified with either party."" The 2008 AP story about the Florida and South Carolina billboards included a statement from King's son, Martin Luther King III: ""It is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest that he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states."" Friends and associates of Martin Luther King Jr. also objected. The AP article says that the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, ""said there is no reason why anyone would think King was a Republican."" Lowery told the AP that King almost certainly voted for Kennedy and that the only time he openly talked about politics was when he criticized Goldwater in 1964. The story quotes Lowery as saying: ""That was not the Martin I know, and I don't think they can substantiate that by any shape, form or fashion. It's purely propaganda and poppycock. ... Even if he was, he would have nothing to do with what the Republican Party stands for today."" Finally, we checked with political experts in the states where King spent most of his adulthood. Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said King ""didn't die a Republican."" But Bullock speculated that King could have been Republican in his youth when Southern Democrats were intensely segregationist. William Stewart, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, said that if King was a Republican, he kept it a secret. King focused on civil rights, Stewart said, and ""partisan politics wasn't relevant."" Upshot: Raging Elephants points to a King family member whose declaration lends support for its claim that King was a Republican: his niece Alveda. We didn't divine how she reached that conclusion. Another King relative, his son, disagrees, as do respected academic experts and former King associates and friends. The record shows that as a civil rights leader, King avoided partisan identification. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970012C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/17/raging-elephants/houston-group-says-martin-luther-king-jr-was-repub/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Glenn Grothman']","
Wisconsin state Sen. Glenn Grothman says recent research shows that the benefits of 4-year-old kindergarten don’t last
","
On Dec. 21, 2010, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction issued a news release celebrating the expansion of 4-year-old kindergarten.

The programs are now part of 85 percent of the state’s school districts. In all, 41,176 state children are enrolled in 4-K programs offered by 350 school districts and 84 private schools through the parental choice program.

State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers attributed the growth to the fact ""school districts know the value of early education for young children.""

On Dec. 29, 2010, state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, issued his own take.

He believes school districts use 4-K  to pad their budgets with additional state aid and that the programs are a pet project of the teachers’ unions. He urged Republican Gov. Scott Walker to ""immediately announce he will not provide any more money for four-year-old kindergarten.""

Grothman said it was critical that Walker act soon because the Madison school district is adding 4-K in 2011, a move he says will cost $10 million a year in state aid.

In the release, Grothman said there was a ""lack of any credible evidence that 4-K programs are beneficial to young children.""  He added: ""Recent studies have confirmed that any academic benefits of government funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade.""

Welcome to the latest installment of the kindergarten wars, where students, parents, academics, policy groups and politicians of all stripes mix it up like, well, kids in one of those play areas filled with plastic balls.

We asked Grothman to back up his statement, which presents the value of 4-year-old kindergarten as a settled issue, one ""confirmed"" by the studies.

He pointed us to a 2006 report by the ""free-market"" Pacific Research Institute, a 2006 report by the libertarian Reason Foundation, and a Dec. 20, 2010, e-mail from Reason Foundation staffer Lisa Snell that summarized programs around the country and included a transcript from an Oklahoma City television news report.

The studies are from 2006, which is not all that recent. And both are from groups that come at issues from a particular point of view, not independent academic researchers.

Let’s take a look. 

Now a broader view.

The 4-K programs in question have been around for decades. A rudimentary review shows they have been studied at length. We found a huge body of research -- including entire academic institutes and researchers at politically oriented think tanks -- devoted to the subject.

We are not trying to settle the question of whether the programs are good or bad for performance of young students. We are looking at Grothman’s claim that the recent studies effectively close the debate on the question.

We turned to several national experts, including Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research, based at Rutgers University.

According to that group’s website, Barnett: ""reviewed 22 long-term studies of the effects of preschool in a 1993 article entitled Does Head Start Fade Out? Each study followed children from preschool until at least 3rd grade. Results from these studies show that initial gains in children's IQ scores tended to disappear over time. However, gains in graduation rates, as well as declines in special education placements and grade retention, were maintained.""

Barnett added: ""There is considerable evidence that preschool programs of many types -- including Head Start -- have persistent effects on academic ability and success. There is no convincing evidence that these effects decline over time.""

A summary of recent research on 4-K programs by the institute cites 20 academic reports and studies. It makes no mention of work conducted by the Reason Foundation or the Pacific Research Institute.

Another study, which looked at 123 comparative studies of early childhood interventions, concluded: ""significant effects were found in this study for children who attend a preschool program prior to entering kindergarten. Although the largest effect sizes were observed for cognitive outcomes, a preschool education was also found to impact children’s social skills and school progress.""
                  
Finally, an Education Week commentary by Nobel Prize winning University of Chicago economist James Heckman, who was part of a pre-kindergarten study, concluded: ""I now believe that early interventions with children are not so productive if they are not followed up with ongoing investments in children during their elementary and secondary school years. Instead, we need to invest early in children — and not stop. And by ‘invest’ I do not simply mean that government should be pumping money into new social programs for disadvantaged youths.""

OK, time for recess.

The debate over 4-K is about more than whether kids benefit in their later schooling. It’s about money, politics, social agendas and more. For support of his position, Grothman said recent reports ""confirm"" that academic benefits are soon lost. Some studies reached that conclusion. But Grothman is citing one small portion of a much broader debate and declaring the whole matter settled when there is considerable evidence on the other side.

We rate Grothman’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097017640>],/factchecks/2011/jan/16/glenn-grothman/wisconsin-state-sen-glenn-grothman-says-recent-res/

Education chairman says each high school dropout costs Rhode Island $72,000 over a lifetime
","
With Rhode Island facing a budget crisis, officials are desperate to find ways to generate more revenue or save money.

During a Dec. 17, 2010, budget summit, Robert G. Flanders Jr., chairman of the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education, said bringing down the state's high school dropout rate could be the key because a well-educated work force would attract new business.

In addition, he said, there could be a direct monetary benefit to government as well.

""The biggest thing I think we can do at the state level to promote savings is to do a better job of keeping kids in school and not having them turn out to be dropouts because the dropout problem -- it's not unique to Rhode Island of course -- but every dropout costs us $72,000 for the life of that person, whereas any person who has a college degree is generating hundreds of thousands of dollars for the state,"" he said. ""The most expensive tuition we pay is the tuition to send kids to the training school or the ACI [Adult Correction Institutions], and those are disproportionately populated with people who have no education or who have dropped out and have no skills to get jobs.""

Does each dropout really cost the state $72,000 over a lifetime?

We're always curious where the numbers like these come from, so we decided to go to the source.

Flanders' office directed us to an April 2009 report from Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies prepared for the Board of Governors for Higher Education, The Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Rhode Island.

To find out how much high school dropouts cost the state, the authors used data gathered for the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to make several estimates. One was their average earnings from age 18 to 64 in 2007 dollars. That number turns out to be $827,438.

Then they estimated how much a typical dropout pays during that period in federal, state and local taxes, including property and sales taxes.

Finally, they subtracted how much the typical dropout is expected to receive in unemployment compensation, disability, food stamps, Medicaid, workers' compensation and other social welfare programs, or how much would be spent to keep them in prison, using national incarceration statistics.

It turns out that, by their reckoning, an average high school dropout costs society $440,214 from age 18 to 64. That's offset by the $367,867 he or she pays in taxes.

Thus, a dropout's lifetime cost is $72,347, which is where Flanders' $72,000 number comes from.

Looked at another way, the money you save by converting one dropout to one high school graduate is even higher. According to the methods used in the study, graduates have a lifetime income of $1,206,250, pay $532,922 in taxes, and consume $216,217 in services.

Instead of being a $72,347 drain to the government, they add $316,705 to state, local, city and town coffers.

So the average net benefit to the tax rolls of preventing one dropout is $389,052 over a lifetime.

In theory.

One problem with Flanders' comment is that he was talking about the impact of dropouts on the state, while the study looked at all taxes -- state, federal and local. State taxes make up about one quarter of a person's tax burden, according to estimates from The Tax Foundation, a respected business-backed tax policy group.

Suddenly the $389,052 in tax benefit accrued by preventing one dropout and helping them graduate drops to about $100,000 over a lifetime. That's $2,100 per year.

Meanwhile, we found other sources of information that made us wonder about the estimates.

If you do the math, you discover that, according to the study, dropouts and high school graduates pay 44 percent of their lifetime earnings in taxes.

But The Tax Foundation, which gives an annual estimate of how much Americans pay in taxes, reports that state, federal and local taxes amount to 27 percent of income, a much smaller ratio.

Also, in 2005, Cecilia Rouse, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, made her own estimate of the lifetime difference in income between dropouts and high school graduates. She pegged it at $260,000, much smaller than estimate of $378,812 found in the study cited by Flanders.

In her study, Rouse noted that the dollar amount varies significantly depending on how the economy behaves. The lifetime estimate could be as low as $121,000 or as high as $294,000.

Rouse, who now works at the White House as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, said such estimates include all sorts of assumptions that can quickly turn out to be outdated.

""There's a lot of variation in this,"" she said. ""These numbers are, at best, illustrative and are meant to make a point, and I don't encourage anybody to . . . say, 'That's the number.'""

Christy Huebner Caridi, director of the Marist College Bureau of Economic Research in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., expressed concern that the Harrington study ""didn't pick up indirect costs such as the need for increased police and private security because there's an increased criminal element"" with more dropouts.

""There are many factors they couldn't take into consideration in a study like this,"" she said.

We asked Paul Harrington, the chief author of the study cited by Flanders, who is now at Drexel University in Philadelphia, about some of the discrepancies. He said one reason for the variation is that other reports exclude people who have no earnings; even though they have no income, they do end up paying some types of taxes such as sales tax.

""Because there are many more zero earners among dropouts, this will bring down their average per capita lifetime earnings estimates proportionately more than it will lower their average lifetime tax burden, given that they do pay some taxes,"" he warned. ""Our findings are consistent with other reports once we exclude zero earners from the analysis.""

He also noted, correctly, that the Rouse study looked at employee payroll taxes, state income and federal income taxes, not sales and other types of taxes. So that's another reason why the analysis would come up with different numbers.

""I think we're using some of the best data out there for research purposes,"" he said. ""I think these are probably pretty solid numbers.""

There's no disagreement that dropping out of high school is harmful, both for the individual and society. Dropouts tend to make less money, get in trouble with the law more often, require more social services and end up with more health problems.

But the $72,000 figure strikes us as another example of experts making assumptions and doing calculations that produce numbers that sound precise, yet may only be rough approximations of the truth.

In the end, while experts may calculate the cost of dropouts in different ways, they all agree that turning would-be dropouts into high school graduates is beneficial to the economy.

But Flanders cited the $72,000 figure with a degree of certainty that is undeserved. And he did not make it clear that the figure includes lost tax revenue to the federal government, not just the state.

As a result, the Truth-O-Meter grades his assertion as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097689C80>],/factchecks/2011/jan/16/robert-flanders/education-chairman-says-each-high-school-dropout-c/
"['Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Cantor says health care reform collects 10 years of taxes for six years of benefits
","
Newly elected House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and his colleagues are wasting no time following through on promises to attempt a repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care reform bill.

A challenge for House Republicans has been finding a way around their own new rules, which require that nearly all proposed legislation is paid for. So the GOP exempted the repeal -- which is estimated by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office to increase the deficit by $230 billion over 10 years -- from the requirement.

Cantor issued a statement last week reinforcing what he sees as the need for the repeal.

""Despite claims that this trillion dollar bill would reduce deficits and save taxpayer dollars, the new law is riddled with budget gimmicks that double count savings, offset 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases, and rely on cuts to Medicare and tax increases to fund a new entitlement,"" Cantor said.

We wondered about the oft-repeated assertion that the law would offset six years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases.

Asked for a source, Cantor’s deputy press secretary Megan Whittemore replied:

""By law, ObamaCare implements new taxes and fees to ‘pay for’ new subsides aka benefits.  With regard to the question about offsetting six years of benefits with ten years of tax increases, the law raises taxes and fees immediately upon enactment – as we have already seen – while not paying out for the cost of benefits contained within the law until 2014. Thus, the 10-year period scored by the CBO only accounts for the cost of 6 years of benefits actually going out the door, compared to 10 years of taxes and fees coming in.""

Looking at the big picture, that’s not entirely true.

As PolitiFact has previously reported, two of the highest-profile and most significant elements of the bill start in 2014, roughly four years after the law took effect last year. The virtual marketplaces known as the health care exchanges would start that year, enabling those who are uninsured or who do not have access to coverage through a large employer to buy affordable plans. Also starting that year would be subsidies to help people buy coverage on the exchange.

In addition, that's the year for a major expansion in eligibility for Medicaid. And a 10-year phase out of the ""doughnut hole"" -- the gap in Medicare drug coverage -- began last year.

So, Cantor’s argument that the ""benefits"" don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at the biggest provisions of the law. But many other, smaller provisions to boost coverage have already taken effect. As PolitiFact has previously reported, there are plenty of examples:

• Small business tax credits. From 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost.

• Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Soon after enactment, people with pre-existing conditions who haven't had coverage for at least six months could obtain coverage through a ""high-risk pool"" with subsidized premiums. This would be a temporary solution until the exchanges begin in 2014.

• Assistance for early retirees. Starting last year, a temporary reinsurance program will help cut the cost of health coverage for retirees not old enough to be eligible for Medicare.

• Dependent coverage to age 26. Shortly after enactment, all insurers were forced to accept dependent coverage for children up to age 26.

• No more recisions. Existing plans can no longer terminate beneficiaries when they get sick.

• Enhanced preventive care. Soon after enactment, qualified health plans were forced to provide certain preventive services without cost-sharing. Starting this year, patient cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid are eliminated.

The other half of Cantor’s claim is that the taxes kicked in immediately.

Some of the tax provisions that help pay for the plan are already in effect. A 10 percent levy on indoor tanning began last year, and an escalating annual fee on drug makers begins this year. Individuals with flexible spending plans and health savings accounts -- tax-advantaged accounts linked to health care expenses -- have already been hit with certain exclusions and limits.

But many of the major tax changes will be delayed by a few years.

• Medical device taxes. A new levy on medical device makers worth about $20 billion over 10 years kicks in 2013.

• Taxes to benefit Medicare Part A. The bill's hike of payroll taxes for individuals earning $200,000 or couples earning $250,000 and a new tax on unearned income for higher earners will start in 2013.

 • Insurance sector fees. Fees on health insurers totaling $67 billion over 10 years become effective in 2014.

 • Mandated coverage. Two of the bill's provisions most controversial to Republicans -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance and that employers of a certain size offer affordable health insurance, under penalty of a fine -- would not begin until 2014. The individual mandate would start low that year and then phase in through 2016.

 • ""Cadillac tax."" The most recent version of the bill pushes back the tax on higher-cost health plans until 2018.

Now, let’s look at numbers to get a sense of proportion.

According to the Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress' bipartisan judge of revenue impacts from proposed laws -- the tax provisions collect minimal revenue for 2010, $2.9 billion for 2011 and $5.5 billion for 2012. They only start getting big in 2013, when revenues increase to $31.9 billion, eventually peaking at $86.9 billion in 2019.

Indeed, of the total $409.2 billion in increased taxes over the 10-year window, only 10 percent of that amount is raised in the first four years -- the period when, according to Republicans, the government is collecting taxes without providing care.

Meanwhile, on the coverage side, it's true that the cost increases significantly four years after enactment. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's Office of the Actuary, the first four years account for about 1 percent of the 10-year cost of increased coverage.

The ""statement that you have 10 years of taxes and six years of benefits is obviously an oversimplification,"" said Paul N. Van de Water, Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""But overall, it is generally true that more taxes kick in a little bit earlier than the benefits do.""

Van de Water said the larger question is whether this is a gimmick and a long-term problem. The answer to that, he said, is no.

""Despite the fact that it’s true that some of the taxes kick in on average a bit earlier, by the end of the 10-year period the health reform bill still produces a modest reduction of the deficit, according to the CBO estimate,"" he said, ""and in the subsequent 10-year period the reduction of the deficit gets even larger.""  

Republican leadership has waved off the CBO estimate, saying that it’s misleading. 
So let’s review.

Cantor says the health care reform law ""offset[s] 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases.""

Cantor is correct that the bill's biggest expansions in coverage do not happen until 2014, including the exchanges, the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. He's also right that some taxation begins well before that. But several of the bill’s  most popular provisions -- including no cancelation of health insurance for pre-exisitng conditions and guaranteed coverage of dependents to age 26 -- have taken effect and other components will be implemented before 2014. And only 10 percent taxes that come with health care reform will be levied in the first four years.

So we find his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2F3500>],/factchecks/2011/jan/15/eric-cantor/cantor-says-health-care-reform-collects-1o-years-t/
"['Oregon', 'Stimulus', 'Transportation', 'Lars Larson']","
Larson accuses TriMet of investing too much with the prospective returns being too little
","Federal cash giveaways always get close attention from pundits and politicians -- and PolitiFact Oregon. More often than not, the funds that go toward research in the form of scientific and technological grants (and particularly odd-sounding grants) usually get labeled as wasteful spending. (Does anybody remember the great ant debate?)

Well, we’re on the case of another wasteful-spending accusation; this time radio personality Lars Larson is accusing TriMet of a particularly poor investment choice.

On Dec. 21, 2010, he sent out a mighty tweet proclaiming: ""(T)he brain trust at Tri Met just announced they are spending 4.2 million in fed funds to save $168K per year.""

To add a little insult to injury he also asked a question: ""(C)an anyone down there do math?""

By our calculation, anyway, an investment of $4.2 million being paid back at $168,000 a year wouldn’t be cleared for some 25 years. That’s a ways off, to be sure, so we figured it was worth looking into whether TriMet was investing wisely ""in these hard economic times.""

First off, we needed a little context. What, exactly was this $4.2 million going to fund? We gave TriMet a call and Bekki Witt, the agency’s spokeswoman, e-mailed us a release.

Here’s how it starts out and where Larson gets his $4.2 million figure: ""TriMet has received a $4.2 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to expand the use of regenerative braking on MAX trains. The grant will allow TriMet to install 20 energy storage units on light rail vehicles, capturing much of the energy generated by the trains’ braking systems and storing that energy for immediate and future use.""

Sounds good. Now how about that $168,000 annual savings? Just read a little further: ""The new units will release the stored energy to help power those trains as well as other trains on the system. The storage units, or energy capacitors, will capture and use nearly 100 percent of the power generated by braking trains, saving $168,000 a year in energy costs.""

Based on those two paragraphs, it seems Larson is on to something. TriMet is spending more than $4 million to upgrade its regenerative braking systems so that they can store the saved energy. That energy adds up to a savings of about $168,000 annually.

But, as with most research, sometimes dollars are just the beginning when it comes to the returns. So, we gave Witt a call and asked her what she thought about Larson’s comments. The figures sound, right, we said. What gives?

First, she said, it’s important to understand the scope of the grant program from which TriMet received the funds. According to the FTA website, the program was created when ""The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus) provided $100 million to be distributed as discretionary grants to public transit agencies for capital investments that will assist in reducing the energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions of public transportation systems.""

Witt elaborated: ""TriMet is the first in the country to try this technology out. … We're kind of part of that research and development aspect of it.""

As it stands now, TriMet does recoup some of the energy the trains create while braking, but that energy must be used almost immediately, either by the train itself or by a nearby train (the rescued energy can be transferred short distances). With this new technology, that saved energy can be stored and used for broader purposes, she said.

""It gives us that flexibility that we don't have right now,"" Witt said. ""This is something we see as a valuable project that will pay off in the long term. it's kind of a pilot, if you will, to see how it might work for us and for other transit programs throughout the country.""

When we contacted the Federal Transit Administration, the director and an engineer there echoed Witt’s remarks. ""In time, we’re confident this regenerative braking will reduce transportation costs significantly around the country — while also reducing our dependence on oil,""  wrote administrator Peter Rogoff in an e-mail comment.

We wondered if any of this might convince Larson that the trade-off was not as stark as he initially believed. No, he said, it didn’t. TriMet’s press release was clear, $4.2 million to save $168,000 a year. ""You don’t know what the value of research will be,"" Larson said.

It’s clear then, that there are two competing views here. Larson is looking at this grant in the Portland vacuum. TriMet and the Federal Transit Administration are looking at it in a broader, national context: TriMet is spending $4.2 million to refine technology that might, eventually, offer a significant return.

So what about the ruling? Well, it would be premature to offer up a figure for the return on research, just as Larson argued. That said, he certainly simplified the grant and the expenditure. To say it’s a simply case of spending ‘x’ to save ‘y’ seems somewhat disingenuous. As with most political statements, this one needs some context. We rate this claim Mostly True.

"['Agriculture', 'China', 'Economy', 'Texas', 'Todd Staples']","
Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples says that Americans spend less of their disposable income on food than individuals in Mexico, China and Russia
","
Noting that Americans are ""blessed with bargains at the grocery store,"" state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples writes that ""right now, on average, Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food.""

""Compare that to folks in Mexico, who spend 22 percent, China, 28 percent, and Russia, 37 percent,"" he says in an op-ed column posted on the San Antonio Express-News website Dec. 29.

Bryan Black, a Texas Department of Agriculture spokesman, initially pointed us to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website to buttress Staples' claim.

A table created by the USDA's Economic Research Service outlines the proportion of an individual's disposable personal income spent on food from 1929 through 2009, when individual adults and families reportedly spent 9.5 percent of their total disposable personal income on food — 5.5 percent eating in and 3.9 percent eating out.

According to the table, the percentage of disposable income spent by Americans on food has dropped over the decades. In 1929, it was 23.4 percent. Since 2000, the share of such income spent on food has run between 9.4 and 9.9 percent.

Every year, the Economic Research Service uses data primarily from the the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Census, which collects data from all retailers that sell food, to measure total food expenditures in the United States and estimates how much food is eaten at and away from home. (Go here for more details about the USDA's food-expenditure number-crunching.)

Ephraim Leibtag, a USDA senior economist, told us the percentage of income individuals in the U.S. spend on food has dropped because ""as income and wealth rises in a given country, less of that income needs to be spent on food in percentage terms.""

Black also pointed us to a July 2006 article on Salem-News.com, a website that describes itself as the ""most unique and interesting news group in the nation"" and ""the first exclusively Web news organization in the world."" The article lists ""the percentage of disposable income spent on food at home"" in various countries, statistics the article attributes to the USDA. According to the article, consumers in Mexico spent 21.7 percent of their disposable income on food at home, in Russia, 36.7 percent and in China, 28.3 percent.

But we noticed that these statistics for foreign countries, which aren't dated in the article, focus only on money spent on food prepared at home, whereas the USDA data also accounts for money spent eating out. The statistics on the Salem-News website are also at least three years older than the USDA's most recent measure of how much disposable income Americans spend on food.

We followed up with the Texas Agriculture Department about these distinctions. Black said in an e-mail: ""USDA's ERS numbers are constantly changing, so there are many different sets of statistics floating around.""

He also sent USDA data comparing U.S. food costs to those of other countries. In 2005, according to the ERS table cited by Black, food accounted for 7 percent of total household expenditures for goods and services, incurred by U.S. households. For households in Mexico, food expenses were 24 percent, Russia, 33 percent and China, 36 percent.

Separately, USDA economist Annette Clauson noted more recent data comparing the same food costs. In 2009, U.S. households spent 6.9 percent. In Mexico, households spent 24 percent; Russia, 28 percent and China, 32.9 percent.

Those figures look similar to the ones cited by Staples when he compared how much of their disposable income American households spend on food versus how much households in other countries spend. But it appears that the USDA only looks at total household expenditures — not disposable income — when comparing relative food costs in foreign countries. That's not an apples-to-apples comparison.

Still, available indicators support the thrust of Staples's statement, which is that Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food, and the other three countries spend two and three times as much.

We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971C2740>],/factchecks/2011/jan/15/todd-staples/agriculture-commissioner-todd-staples-says-america/
"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
Gov. Bob McDonnell says his job creation record tops former Gov. Tim Kaine's
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell has made job creation a priority--and key talking point--since he took office a year ago.

In his inaugural address he said ""the creation of new job opportunities for all our citizens is the obligation of our time.""  

McDonnell returned to that theme Jan. 12 in his annual State of the Commonwealth speech.

""Since February 2010, Virginia has added 67,900 net new jobs, the third-highest number in the nation. We ranked 35th in this same category in 2009.""

We sensed some unspoken political score settling within the statement. After all, Democrat Tim Kaine was governor in 2009. And McDonnell, a Republican, was governor for all but the first two weeks of 2010.

We wondered about two things: Are those rankings correct, and do they provide an accurate picture of Virginia’s job growth compared to the rest of the nation?

Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, told us the figures were taken from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which gathers the nation’s job and unemployment information. According BLS, Virginia lost 94,600 jobs during 2009, the 35th best performance of any state.

But how relevant are net job figures, when each state has a different population? Should we be using a percentage-based figure instead, to account for the different populations in the various states? After all, as Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron told us, ""1,000 jobs in Idaho are much more important than 1,000 jobs in New York.""

Virginia is a relatively large state, ranking 12th in population. During 2009 the largest job losses occurred in the largest states, with California leading the way.

If we examine the figures on a percentage basis, the state’s performance suddenly looks better. Those 94,600 jobs represented 2.56 percent of the state’s employed population. That 2.56 percent drop in jobs places Virginia’s performance 14th best nationally.

The state added 67,900 net new jobs between February 2010 and November 2010, the last month for which data are available. That matches the governor’s claim, and McDonnell is right that Virginia’s job creation trailed only the 196,400 jobs new jobs in Texas and the 70,000 jobs added in Pennsylvania during the period.

When looking at the 2010 figures on a percentage basis, Virginia’s statewide employment rolls grew 1.90 percent between February and November. That’s good for fifth in the nation, trailing only Washington D.C., Maryland, North Dakota and Texas.

John Knapp, a senior economist at  the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at The University of Virginia, explained why the percentage figures are a more accurate reflection of performance.

""For comparisons among the states we use percentages because of the tremendous difference in size,"" he said. ""The total number is relevant  if you are doing a comparison inside the state.""

Let’s look at two examples. Nevada lost 76,800 jobs during 2009, meaning by McDonnell’s math it performed better--and should rank higher--than Virginia. But because Nevada has far fewer people than the Commonwealth, those lost jobs represented 6.40 percent of the Silver State’s work force. So didn’t Virginia easily out out perform Nevada?

Or consider New York’s 2009 performance. The state lost 208,700 jobs, 2.41 percent of the total. Despite having a far greater net job loss, New York’s performance was actually a bit better than Virginia’s when we account for population differences.

Randy Marcus, chief of staff for Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, compiles the employment figures used by McDonnell administration.  He said raw and percentage figures provide equally accurate views of the job picture. Marcus said the figure used by McDonnell was one of many statistics available to show Virginia’s performance and also argued that to people looking for work,,total job creation numbers are far more important than percentage figures or state-to-state comparisons.  

Knapp has previously told ushe thinks governors get undue kudos for good job numbers and undue scorn when jobs leave a state. Miron has similar views.

""I, like most economists, feel consistently that politicians get too much blame and too much credit,"" he said. ""They are not irrelevant, but in a state economy the national economy obviously matters.""

Miron did say governors and state legislatures sometimes have a short-term impact, citing the recent move by politicians in Illinois to raise personal and business income tax rates.

Let’s review.

McDonnell has used raw numbers to draw the starkest contrast with Kaine. Under that set of numbers, which measure total jobs gained or lost each year, the governor accurately said Virginia ranked 35th under Kaine and third under the McDonnell administration.

But percentages tell a more complete story. Based on percentage of the work force, Virginia's job creation went from being 14th under Kaine to fifth under McDonnell, which is not nearly as dramatic.

McDonnell has used a selective set of data to imply Virginia went from being a ""D"" student under Kaine to an ""A"" student under the new administration. But that fails to provide the necessary context provided by percentages. In reality Virginia went from a ""B+"" performance under Kaine to an ""A"" performance under McDonnell.

Therefore, we find McDonnell’s claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C30EFC0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/15/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-his-job-creation-record-top/
