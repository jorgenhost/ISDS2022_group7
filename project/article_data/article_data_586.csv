Ad says JoAnne Kloppenburg jailed an 80-year-old farmer for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm
","
Critics of JoAnne Kloppenburg, the challenger to Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser in the April 5, 2011 election, portray her as a rigid ""government lawyer"" bent on enforcing regulations no matter the consequences.

Among them is a group called Citizens for a Strong America, which claims in a TV ad:

""Kloppenburg is so extreme, she even put an 80-year-old farmer in jail for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm.""

Among its other charges, the ad points out that Kloppenburg has never been a judge. Of course, only a judge -- not an assistant attorney general such as  Kloppenburg -- can put people in jail.

But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

Let’s till some ground and see how much truth grows out of this claim.

The farmer referenced in the ad is Wayne Hensler, who was involved in an 11-year water pollution dispute with Jefferson County, as well as the state, over farmland he owned adjacent to Marsh Lake.

We wanted to ask Citizens for a Strong America-- one of five conservative groups that reportedly have spent $2 million in TV advertising against Kloppenburg -- for evidence to back its claim. That proved to be difficult.

According to its website, the group is based in Beaver Dam, Wis., and ""promotes public policies that reduce tax burdens on families, increase public safety and protect the rights of parents to make decisions about their children’s medical, psychological and educational well-being.""

No names, phone numbers or e-mail addresses were provided on the website. And there are no Beaver Dam phone numbers listed for Citizens for a Strong America or for Veronica Johnson, a person identified as having placed the TV ad.

We did find a statement that the group filed with TV stations as support for its anti-Kloppenburg ad. The statement cites online court records to back up the claim that Kloppenburg put Hensler in jail.

But that’s not what the records show.

What they show is that now-retired Jefferson County Circuit Judge John Ullsvik ordered Hensler to serve five days in jail after finding him in contempt of court -- for a third time -- in connection with his land dispute.

The records show that Kloppenburg prepared an order so the court could seize $5,000 from Hensler’s bank account to cover a court-ordered forfeiture that Hensler had repeatedly refused to pay.

But that involved getting the court-ordered payment, not the jailing. And the judge instructed Kloppenburg to do this. It is common in legal matters for attorneys to draft documents, such as proposed findings, that are ultimately issued by the court.

In any case, that’s not the same as Kloppenburg putting Hensler in jail for not planting native vegetation -- a claim that is all the more ridiculous when you consider what happened over the course of Hensler’s 11-year dispute with the government.

Here are some of the highlights, based on online Jefferson County Circuit Court records, as well as a civil complaint and the jailing order that were filed in the case:

April 1999: County officials meet with Hensler about the ""severe erosion problem"" on his farmland, which slopes down toward a culvert that discharges into Marsh Lake. So it doesn’t start out as a ""native vegetation"" issue at all.

October 1999: In its third meeting with Hensler, the county suggests remedies, including seeding the area with winter wheat or rye, and offers to pay 70 percent of the cost. He rejects all the options. Later, the state agriculture department gets involved, ordering Hensler to solve the erosion problem within three years.

August 2003: With the three-year deadline having passed, the state Department of Natural Resources gives Hensler a new one-year deadline, ordering him to plant vegetative cover to stop the erosion.  

December 2004: After the one-year deadline and an extension pass, a county official checks to see if Hensler has done the seeding. Hensler says: ""Hell no, I ain’t doing nothing. You have to prove I am running all that (expletive) dirt into the lake.""

April 2005: Kloppenburg, representing the state, files a civil complaint against Hensler in Jefferson County Circuit Court. The complaint says Hensler’s land is a significant source of pollution in the Rock Lake watershed and it cites state law that requires corrective action to protect water quality.

November 2005: After another deadline passes, Judge Randy Koschnick, who initially handled the case, finds Hensler in contempt of court and gives him another deadline to plant the native vegetation.

May 2007: Hensler admits that he ripped up seeding that had been done by the DNR with permission of the court. He is found in contempt of court again.

July 2008: Ullsvik, who took over the case from Koschnick, finds Hensler in contempt of court a third time and orders a five-day jail term. Hensler does not go to jail because he has heart surgery.

February 2009: Ullsvik orders Hensler, then 80, sent immediately to jail for the contempt and for not paying a court-ordered $5,000 forfeiture to cover the DNR’s cost to re-seed the land.

The Jefferson County Jail confirmed that Hensler spent five days in jail.

We tried to call Hensler, but his number has been disconnected. Court records indicate he turned the land in dispute over to family members.

We did reach Ullsvik and asked whether Kloppenburg had asked him to put Hensler in jail.

The retired judge said he asked Kloppenburg at one hearing ""somewhat sarcastically"" if she wanted Hensler jailed, and that Kloppenburg said no, she only wanted Hensler to comply with the orders.

So it was a judge’s decision -- based on Hensler’s contempt of court, not based merely on his refusal to plant grass -- to put Hensler in jail.

OK, we’ve turned over enough soil; let’s see what our work has yielded.

Citizens for a Strong America claimed in a TV ad that Kloppenburg ""put an 80-year-old farmer in jail for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm."" Wayne Hensler did refuse to plant native vegetation and he was 80 when he went to jail. But it is impossible for Kloppenburg -- or any attorney -- to put someone in jail.

What’s more, the ad leaves out 11 years’ worth of context. Hensler repeatedly ignored orders from county and state officials -- and then from a court -- to remedy an erosion problem. He was found in contempt of court three times by two different judges. And when Hensler was finally put behind bars, it was on the order of a judge for contempt of court, not merely refusing to plant native vegetation. Kloppenburg didn’t even request the jail time.

The claim against Kloppenburg is ridiculously false.

A gloomy claim: Tallahassee is the ninth-rainiest city in America
","
At the end of a gloomy week in Tallahassee (weather-wise), we offer this depressing weather update.

The state's capital city, it turns out, is one of the rainiest places in the country.

So says John Buss, the water resources manager for the city of Tallahassee, who made the claim while testifying against HB 457 -- a bill that would prohibit local governments from regulating the use of fertilizers and leave that power with the state. Buss was trying to make the point that different communities have different issues when it comes to regulating fertilizer use, and that a one-size-fits-all approach won't work.

""Tallahassee is the second-rainiest city in Florida and the ninth-rainiest in the nation,"" he told members of the House Community & Military Affairs subcommittee on March 23, 2011. ""When you get our seven-inch rainfalls in six hours ... you wash the fertilizers into the waterways.""

Forget about the fertilizer bill for a moment, we wanted to check his stats on rain in Tallahassee.

Believe it or not, he's not that far off.

Weatherbill, a company that provides weather insurance for the agricultural industry, analyzed 30 years' worth of U.S. rainfall data collected from 200 National Weather Service stations in 195 cities across the 48 continental states to identify the average rainfall per city in inches, among other things.

The result?

Tallahassee collects the ninth-most rain among U.S. cities, averaging 60.5 inches of rain per year, the analysis found.

It was one of several Florida cities to make the Top 10 list (something Buss got wrong in his comments to House members). Pensacola ranked second among U.S. cities with 64.6 inches of rain on average per year; West Palm Beach ranked fourth with 62.5 inches, and Miami ranked seventh with 61.5 inches of rain per year.

The No. 1 rainiest city? No, not Portland (42nd) or Seattle (41st).

It is Mobile, Ala., Weatherbill concluded, with 66.9 inches of rain each year.

Buss said Tallahassee is the second-rainiest city in Florida -- Weatherbill says it's fourth -- and he forgot to mention that the rainfall averages exclude Hawaii and Alaska. But this is still dreary news. Tallahassee is the ninth-rainiest city in the Lower 48.

Eric Cantor says discretionary spending up 20 percent in 2 years, 80 percent with stimulus
","
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor rarely passes an opportunity to brand President Barack Obama as a reckless spender.

During a March 17 interview on Fox News, the Virginia Republican said Obama ""missed the opportunity"" to cut spending in the 2012 federal budget he sent to Congress this winter.

Cantor complained Obama’s proposal would merely freeze discretionary spending. ""That’s after it’s increased by over 20-some percent over the last two years if you don’t include the stimulus,"" he told host Greta Van Susteren. ""If you put the stimulus in, it’s over 80 percent.""

We checked his numbers.

First, an explanation: Discretionary spending is the money Congress controls through annual appropriations. It goes for services such as defense, education, health and housing. In contrast, mandatory spending is used for entitlement programs with required levels of funding -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

Ray Allen, a political adviser to Cantor, said the congressman was referring to non-defense discretionary spending. He also said Cantor, in discussing spending ""over the last two years"" is referring to a period that begins with Obama’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009.

PolitiFact is no stranger to the set of numbers Cantor used. They also have been cited by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., chairman of the House Budget Committee. The figures, culled from the Congressional Budget Office, can be traced to a Ryan news release last June.

Although several budget experts we spoke to quibbled about the exact figures Cantor used, the raw numbers are not really in dispute. His computations of those numbers, however, have problems.

The numbers show non-defense discretionary spending rose from $434 billion in fiscal 2008 to $537 billion in fiscal 2010. That’s a 23.7 percent jump -- consistent with the ""20-some percent"" increase Cantor claimed.

Cantor does not provide an historical perspective to those numbers, so we will. In the eight federal budgets approved during Republican George W. Bush’s administration -- non-defense discretionary spending increased by an average 9.6 percent each year. During the first two years of the Obama administration, it has grown by an annual average of 11.9 percent.

Non-defense discretionary spending adds up to about one-sixth of expenditures in the federal budget. Even if it was completely eliminated, the nation would still run an estimated $820 billion deficit this fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Now, let’s move to the $787 billion stimulus package, approved by the Democratic-controlled Congress in 2009 with hopes that a federal injection of money would jolt the economy out of recession.  A third of the money -- $259 billion -- was appropriated for discretionary uses.

Cantor adds all of the $259 billion to the $537 billion in discretionary spending for 2010.

That gives him a total of $796 billion in discretionary spending for fiscal 2010. And if you compare it to the $434 billion in 2008, it’s an 83.4 percent increase -- consistent with the ""over 80 percent"" he claimed.

But there are a few catches.

First, not everyone agrees it’s appropriate to include stimulus money in the calculation since it could be considered one-time emergency spending -- not part of the budget base. Cantor seemed to acknowledge that point by saying, ""If you put the stimulus in, it’s over 80 percent.""

We also wondered why Cantor counted the $257 billion in 2010. After all, the stimulus was approved in 2009.

Allen said Cantor lumped the stimulus money into fiscal 2010 because that’s the year most of it was spent. ""When something passed is irrelevant,"" Allen said. ""What matters is when it’s spent.""

Several budget experts said Allen’s point is valid. So we went back to the spread sheets and encountered a problem: We found no one, including Cantor, who could produce data showing the exact yearly expenditures of non-discretionary stimulus funds.

But we did find two tables that suggest Cantor’s contention that all of the money was spent in 2010 is faulty. A 2009 analysis of the stimulus bill by the Congressional Budget Office said the discretionary money would be doled out over a number of years, with 36 percent being spent in 2010.

The CBO published an updated estimate of stimulus spending in January. It indicates that about 34 percent of the ""budgetary effects"" of the discretionary portion came in 2010. To assume that obligated money has been spent is incorrect.

So let’s suppose 35 percent is the actual figure. That would mean Cantor, under his formula, should have applied only $90 billion of stimulus to last year’s discretionary spending total -- not the full $257 billion.

It would mean discretionary spending, if you include the stimulus, increased 44 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration -- far shy of the ""over 80 percent"" Cantor claimed.

Allen disputed our calculus, saying only a tiny portion remained unspent at the end of 2010. He referred to CBO documents from earlier this year saying all but about $5 billion in discretionary stimulus money has been ""obligated.""

The CBO defines obligations as ""a legally binding commitment by the federal government that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future.""

Contrary to the claim of Cantor’s camp, the CBO documents do not prove most of the money was spent in 2010. One of the reports, in fact, says ""most of the discretionary funding provided by ARRA (the stimulus) has been obligated, although outlays may occur in 2011 and later years.""

Let’s review:

Cantor said discretionary spending has ""increased over 20-some percent in two years if you don’t include the stimulus. If you put in the stimulus, it’s over 80 percent.""

Without the stimulus, discretionary spending increased 23.7 percent. So is Cantor right on that part.

But the majority leader runs into trouble when he starts counting discretionary stimulus funds. 
Cantor generates his high percentage by lumping in all of the $257 million approved for discretionary stimulus use into 2010 spending. CBO reports indicate that only slightly more than a third of the discretionary stimulus was spent last year.  

That suggests that when you add in the stimulus, discretionary spending increased 44 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration -- not ""over 80 percent"" as Cantor says.

Cantor’s statement is half right and half wrong. We’ll split the difference and rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/01/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-discretionary-spending-20-percent/
"['National', 'State Budget', 'Tim Pawlenty']","
Tim Pawlenty said he brought Minnesota state spending growth down ""to about 1.7 percent per year.""
","
In his book Courage to Stand: An American Story, Tim Pawlenty describes himself as a fiscal conservative with a record of reining in government spending.

The evidence: Reduced state spending growth during the eight years he was governor of Minnesota, he said.

""From 1960, the year I was born, until the time I became Governor in 2003, the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent,"" Pawlenty writes. ""We brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year.""

It’s a statistic that he repeats several times in his book, so we decided to check it out.

Pawlenty was elected governor in 2002, taking office in January 2003. In Minnesota, the budgets follow fiscal years that begin in July. So the first budget Pawlenty could have put his stamp on was the 2004 budget that went into effect on July 1, 2003.

We found spending numbers dating back to 1960, and averaged the two-year increases for the general fund between 1965 and 2003. We arrived at  21.09 percent, so that’s in line with what Pawlenty said.

We then turned to the second part of Pawlenty’s statement, that ""we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year."" First, note that he’s comparing two-year increments with one-year increments, which would make the difference seem more dramatic.

Still, we examined year-over-year change from 2004 to 2011. (Again, Pawlenty left office on Jan. 3, 2011, but the fiscal year started six months before that.)

We averaged the year-to-year changes in the budget for those years and arrived at an average increase of 1.64 percent, very close to what Pawlenty said. If you took the two-year average, it would be a bit higher, at 3.53 percent.

Yet those numbers don’t tell the whole story.

As Pawlenty was leaving office, state budget agency released forecasts showing spending increasing 27 percent over the next two years -- before the incoming governor, Democrat Mark Dayton, made any changes to the budget at all.

The budget analysts said the state had used several mechanisms to reduce state spending. That included using $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus and two separate delays shifts in spending on K-12 education that totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion.

The budget numbers led DFLers -- that’s members of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, equivalent to Democrats in other states -- to blame Pawlenty for using one-time fixes and ignoring structural imbalances.

Pawlenty supporters acknowledged the anticipated spending increase but blamed it on DFLers for refusing to embrace Pawlenty’s ideas for long-term solutions.

Pawlenty’s statement was that from 1960 to 2003, ""the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent. … we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year."" The numbers are accurate, though Pawlenty is comparing two-year increases to one-year increases. More significantly, spending forecasts increased dramatically as Pawlenty was leaving office, when short-term budget fixes like the federal stimulus and spending delays for K-12 education expired. Given that increase, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/01/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-said-he-brought-minnesota-state-spend/

Americans United for Change says Eric Cantor wants to abolish Social Security and Medicare
","
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor set off a feeding frenzy on the left when he made a statement at the Hoover Institution on March 21, 2011, that seemed to suggest he wants to abolish entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

The statement in question came during a discussion of the need to reform entitlement programs. Said Cantor: ""We're going to have to come to grips with the fact that these programs cannot exist if we want America to be what we want America to be.""

The quote shot around the liberal blogosphere and was circulated in a statement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats, with dire warnings about Republicans finally revealing their true intentions for Social Security and Medicare.

On March 31, 2011, the liberal groups Americans United for Change and the group Strengthen Social Security put out a press release titled, ""U.S. Rep. Schakowsky, Leading Seniors Advocates: Will Republicans in Congress Condemn House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s Outrageous Calls for Abolishing Social Security and Medicare?""

The release calls on Republicans in Congress to ""denounce the radical, out-of-touch statements made by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., who said Social Security and Medicare 'cannot exist' for future generations.""

Later that morning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., and the two groups held a teleconference with the media in which Schakowsky blasted Cantor's statement as ""stunning"" and ""completely out of touch with where the American people are right now."" Without Social Security, she said, 14 million seniors would fall into poverty.

Abolishing Social Security and Medicare are pretty radical political ideas, but is that actually Cantor's position?

One need only listen to Cantor's statements immediately before and after the quote seized on by Democrats to see that's not the case.

Here's a fuller transcript of Cantor's statement at Hoover:

""Our (entitlement) reforms are centered on the fact that you've got to protect today's seniors.

""I mean, just from the very notion that it said that 50 percent of beneficiaries under the Social Security program use those monies as their sole source of income. So we've got to protect today's seniors. But for the rest of us? For -- you know, listen, we're going to have to come to grips with the fact that these programs cannot exist if we want America to be what we want America to be.

""So, we're going to have to accept some changes as far as the rest of us. And what we're saying is for those 55 and older who do not have to worry about changes in benefits, but for the rest of us, we will. We will have to do that.""

So for starters, Cantor is saying that he does not intend to mess with the Social Security benefits for current retirees, or those nearing retirement.

But what about those under 55? Cantor and other Republican leaders have been short on details. In his speech at Hoover, Cantor said that within three weeks, Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan will be unveiling a budget for the coming fiscal year that will include specifics on how the Republicans want to reform entitlement programs. In the past, Rep. Ryan has called for a plan that would allow workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. 
As for Medicare, Ryan's plan again called for leaving Medicare benefits as they are for people over 55. But for those younger than 55, his proposal ""creates a standard Medicare payment to be used for the purchase of private health coverage."" Ryan's plan included a number of other Medicare changes as well. But Republican leaders never signed off on the Ryan plan, and it's unclear what the upcoming Republican budget plan will include. And while Cantor has has provided general support for Ryan's plan, he has not been clear about where he personally stands on the plan's specific proposals for Social Security and Medicare.

But while Cantor isn't tipping his hand with many specifics, in recent public statements Cantor has talked about changing, but not abolishing entirely, the programs for those under 55.

In an op-ed for Politico on Feb. 19, 2011, for example, Cantor wrote about the need to ""rein in"" entitlements. In an interview on CNBC on March 16, 2011, Cantor said the Republican plan will ""protect today's seniors and those nearing retirement. But for those of us 54 and under, we're going to insist to go and deal with the fact that if these programs are going to be around, they're going to have to look a lot different. That's the plain and simple fact of it.""

""Looking a lot different"" isn't the same as abolishing.

Cantor spokeswoman Laena Fallon told PolitiFact via e-mail that the statements from Schakowsky and other Democrats and liberal groups are a deliberate distortion of his position.

""People are entitled to their own opinions, but not to their own facts,"" Fallon said. ""With all due respect, what the congresswoman is saying is simply untrue – Eric has made clear for months that he is committed to ensuring the long-term viability of these programs by addressing their solvency issues now. What's indisputable is that doing nothing – which seems to be the position of the president, his party's leaders, and Congresswoman Schakowsky – will ensure these programs remain on a path to bankruptcy, resulting in a debt-fueled economic crisis. We should be able to debate different solutions for preserving Social Security and Medicare for future generations based on intellectual honesty, not demagoguery and fear campaigns.""

Asked about Cantor's position on Medicare, Fallon said that Cantor ""has been pretty clear that entitlement programs won't change for those 55 and above, but we must work to strengthen these programs so that they're around for future generations for those folks 54 and below.""

In a story about the Democratic furor over Cantor's statement, Brian Beutler of the liberal site Talking Points Memo wrote that there is ""plenty of fodder for criticism"" of Cantor's statement.

""But it's pretty far-fetched to say Cantor proposed eliminating Social Security outright for people under age 55,"" Beutler wrote.

A Cantor spokesman told TPM that Cantor simply misspoke in the Hoover address. And Fallon told us that, ""Leader Cantor does not want to abolish Social Security and Medicare.""

But when asked in her teleconference about the possibility Cantor misspoke, Schakowsky wasn't buying it.

""It might be some sort of Freudian slip where Eric Cantor showed everyone what he really thinks,"" Schakowsky said. ""...I think the slip was that he said it out loud.""

In a press release, Tom McMahon, executive director, Americans United for Change, said, ""This was no slip of the tongue. We’ve long since suspected Eric Cantor’s true intentions of going down a path towards abolishing Social Security and Medicare as we know them -- intentions that he may now regret saying out loud in public.""

In the release and the telephone news conference, Schkowsky and Americans United failed to provide any solid evidence that Cantor wants to abolish the programs. They have cherry-picked a portion of his comments to the Hoover Institution that his office says does not reflect his true position.

Cantor has repeatedly said that entitlement program reform needs to be part of the national discussion -- a controversial enough idea on its own -- but his lack of detail about how that ought to happen leaves him open to speculative attacks. The fuller context of Cantor's statement at Hoover, together with statements he has made about Social Security and Medicare in other recent interviews, however, give no indication that he would like to abolish them. That fuller context suggests Cantor probably meant to say that Social Security and Medicare cannot exist as they are now. That's different. It was a linguistic misstep on a highly volatile issue, but the Democrats' reaction was a clear overreach.

Senate budget chief criticizes water management district for sitting on taxpayer cash
","
Here's a new one: The Senate budget committee chairman says the water management district that includes the Tampa Bay area is so overflowing with money that it could run for two years without collecting a dollar more in taxes.

Sen. J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, is making the claim as part of his proposal to fold the Southwest Florida Water Management District budget -- along with the budgets of the four other water management districts -- into the general state budget.

""When I see $850 million, half of which is not reserved for anything, and we've essentially allowed them to collect taxes on people when they really didn't need the money, I don't understand that,"" Alexander told reporters on March 29, 2011.

On March 31, Alexander made a similar claim, telling members of the Senate budget committee that the Southwest Florida Water Management District has $850 million in ""reserves.""

The talk about the water management district stuck out to several people, who asked us if it could be true. Specifically we wanted to know: Does the Southwest Florida Water Management District, or Swiftmud, have enough money to operate for more than two years without levying taxes?

The state's five water management districts generally operate independently, but their governing boards are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, and the governor must approve water management district budgets each year. Alexander wants more control over district budgets to potentially lower the property taxes they collect, and to provide additional oversight of the taxing entities.

Alexander's office began requesting detailed financial information from Swiftmud a few weeks ago, said David Rathke, the district's legislative affairs director.

The water management district covers 16 counties surrounding the Tampa Bay area and operates with a budget of about $280 million. Of that, about $160 million comes from property taxes, and about $76 million was carried over from previous years' budgets. The rest of the budget, around $44 million, is comprised of local, state and federal funds.

On top of that, the water management district has separate pots of money for different types of projects and for future planning, said Rathke, Swiftmud spokeswoman Robyn Felix and finance director Daryl Pokrana.

• $298 million set aside to fulfill outstanding contracts.

• $78 million allocated for specific projects where contracts have not yet been finalized.

• $182 million reserved for future projects that have neither been identified nor approved.

Adding in the yearly $280 million budget brings the total to $838 million, or approximately the $850 million Alexander is talking about.

The problem with Alexander's claim is that most of the money is obligated to ongoing projects or part of the district's yearly budget. Or it will soon become obligated as part of contracts for projects. They're not reserves in the way most people would think about it. ""A lot of these projects are multiyear projects,"" Pokrana said. The water management district may look like it has a lot of money, he said, in part because it has no debt and does not issue bonds to finance projects.

Some of the money set aside is funding a pipeline project that would transfer reclaimed water from the city of Lakeland to the Tampa Electric Company so it could be used for the electric company's operations instead of drinking water, Felix said. Other funds are being allocated for a restoration project in Sawgrass Lake in Pinellas County and to create a wetland treatment system on Lake Hancock in Polk County.

Alexander said Swiftmud could forgo property tax collections for more than two years -- which would mean giving up at least $320 million in tax revenues (the annual amount the district collects multiplied by two). But the math doesn't add up.

The district could bottom out $182 million in long-term planning and project funding. And it could postpone or cancel anticipated contracts for projects, freeing up an additional $78 million.

But that adds up to only $260 million.

The rest of the money is either part of Swiftmud's annual budget or being used to fund current, ongoing contracts.

Alexander was trying to make the point that Swiftmud's bank account needs pruning. The district does have $182 million stored away to be used for future projects. But Alexander has overstated the issue by saying the Southwest Florida Water Management District has enough money in savings to run without levying taxes for more than two years.

Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg says PolitiFact Wisconsin “concluded that the charge that Justice Prosser prejudges matters that come before the court is True""
","
At a candidate forum a week before the April 5, 2011, Wisconsin Supreme Court election, Justice David Prosser cited an article that PolitiFact Wisconsin did about a claim made by his opponent, assistant state attorney general JoAnne Kloppenburg.

Kloppenburg had claimed that Prosser prejudged matters likely to come before the court.

That’s a serious accusation, given that the Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judicial candidates from making statements that commit them regarding ""cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court.""

Prosser correctly stated at the March 29, 2011, forum, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Milwaukee, that Kloppenburg’s campaign provided to us no examples of prejudging to back her claim.

A few minutes later, Kloppenburg responded:

""Well, I’d like to note first that the PolitiFact concluded that the charge that Justice Prosser prejudges matters that come before the court is true.""

Really?

Sometimes our memories fail us here. But we remember our article about Kloppenburg’s prejudging claim. It was published just two days before the forum was held.

This was our conclusion:

""The statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to (Gov. Scott Walker) and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a ‘complement’ to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases.
     
""But Kloppenburg didn’t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had ‘prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court.’ Yet she could provide no examples.
   
""We rate Kloppenburg’s claim Barely True.""

We asked Kloppenburg’s campaign spokeswoman, Melissa Mulliken, why Kloppenburg said we rated her claim True.

""There’s True and there’s False,"" Mulliken said. ""You rated it True.""

Actually, there aren’t two, but rather six possible ratings on the Truth-O-Meter.

Barely True, which is what we concluded about Kloppenburg’s prejudging claim, is a statement that ""contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""

That’s a long way from True, which means a statement ""is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.""

At the opposite end of the meter from True is Pants on Fire, for a statement that is ridiculously false.

And Pants on Fire is what Kloppenburg gets for her claim about our earlier ruling.",/factchecks/2011/apr/01/joanne-kloppenburg/supreme-court-candidate-joanne-kloppenburg-says-po/

Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser says challenger JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record consists only of prosecuting cases regarding regulation of docks
","
The candidates in the acrimonious race for Wisconsin Supreme Court have spent a considerable amount of time focusing on their experience and qualifications for the job.

Justice David Prosser’s experience is pretty simple to understand. He has served a dozen years on the court and was Outagamie County district attorney for a couple of years. A Republican, Prosser also served 16 years in the state Assembly, and was speaker.

The JoAnne Kloppenburg file is more difficult to evaluate: 21 years as an attorney in the state Department of Justice.

That leaves plenty of room for interpretation -- by the candidate and her opponent. That’s what happened in a March 21, 2011, debate at the Marquette University Law School.

Prosser told the audience that Kloppenburg ""is incredibly envious"" of his record as a district attorney, and his time as a lawmaker and justice. He said he had prosecuted cases that involved violent crime.

""I’ve had victims of crime cry on my shoulder,"" Prosser said.

He continued with this observation about Kloppenburg’s experience: ""She has a very different record as a prosecutor. It’s all the prosecution of DNR regulations of docks … the length of docks. The width of docks. Whether people can have docks. That’s a complete different kind of prosecution that I am familiar with or have been writing cases about as well for 12 and a half years.""

That stopped us and undoubtedly many in the audience.

More than two decades on cases hassling dock owners? Sounds like a lot of legal grunt work.

It’s a claim that Prosser has made repeatedly on the campaign trail, and a theme that’s been picked up in ads from outside groups attacking Kloppenburg.

We asked for backup.

Prosser’s campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said in an email that state court records and other research tools showed 46 cases that involved Kloppenburg, 76 percent of which ""were for the DNR.""  

""Of the 46, five were directly identifiable with piers,"" he said.

Fair enough. For a decade, Kloppenburg led the Department of Justice’s environmental litigation team. Docks would be in her wheelhouse.

Kloppenburg opponents have seized on her record as a environmental lawyer, painting her as an extremist. On March 29, talk show host Charlie Sykes said: ""If you are an environmental zealot, I do understand that JoAnne Kloppenburg is probably your candidate.""

Sykes added: ""If you have a pier that’s a few feet too close … JoAnne Kloppenburg is your worst enemy.""

But let’s circle back to the support Prosser’s campaign provided. Of the 46 cases cited, only five dealt with docks. What about the rest?  

The Kloppenburg campaign gave us a list of 17 published decisions of cases that she argued before the state Appeals Court. The cases involved water and air pollution permits, a landfill dispute and the state’s authority over navigable waterways. Two involved the civil rights of state prison inmates, one involved the treatment of a prisoner. No dock cases were included.

The campaign noted that over the years, Kloppenburg has argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts around the state, and numerous cases before the state Supreme Court -- including one in which a decision was handed down March 23,  two days after the debate at Marquette.

In that case, Kloppenburg represented the state in a lawsuit involving a dispute over a hearing for a water discharge permit for a paper mill in Green Bay. Environmentalists wanted a public hearing about the permit; the DNR did not. Kloppenburg represented the DNR and won the case -- with Prosser voting with the majority. While environmentalists were unhappy with the decision, business groups -- some of which are paying for ads attacking Kloppenburg’s legal credentials -- were pleased.

She said her campaign was able to identify citations of 206 court cases dating back to 1989, and said few, if any, involved docks or piers.

Other cases she’s handled in her career included those involving complaints from prisoners, the state’s part of lawsuits against big tobacco companies, Indian treaty rights and gaming compacts, and medical malpractice caps. She has had numerous cases involving well-known state and local companies, including Patrick Cudahy, Enbridge, Georgia Pacific, and a sunken barge in the Menomonee River.

Kloppenburg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board that her job was to enforce the state’s environmental laws.

When we asked Prosser directly to explain his comment, he said he was well aware Kloppenburg handled a much broader variety of cases for the Justice Department than docks. Indeed, a number of them were argued before him on the Supreme Court.

""I’m certainly aware of the breadth of those cases,"" Prosser said, adding that his comments about docks were ""a little rhetorical flourish.""

Prosser recalled a case about a July 2006 decision about a Green Lake subdivision that let homeowners have a fractional interest so they could have a boat slip on a nearby dock. The court ruled in favor of the DNR and forced the association to reduce the number of boat slips. Prosser also mentioned another case that was relayed to him in a private letter from a circuit court judge in northern Wisconsin.

""Those are the two I was most familiar with,"" Prosser said.

He added this about his dock comment: ""I was really trying to inject a little bit of levity into this. I think the rhetorical flourish is easily justified in terms of these two cases.""

But that flies in the face of the reality of the campaign. As we noted, the dock cases have emerged as a line of attack against Kloppenburg from several fronts. What’s more, those in the audience didn’t offer a lot of chuckles during that portion of the debate.

Former Journal Sentinel reporter Alan Borsuk, who now works for the Marquette Law School, blogged this about the event: ""I’ve been at some testy and tense debates and joint appearances by candidates in various races, but this one was way up the list, if it wasn’t the champion on my personal list.""

Borsuk noted the exchange about experience and said Prosser touted his record ""while slighting her record in environmental work with the attorney general’s office as involving ‘the length of (boat) docks.’""

Let’s bring this ship to shore.

Justice Prosser told a debate audience that his opponent’s work as a prosecutor was very limited and said she only handled cases involving the size and length of docks. But the record shows a much broader range of cases handled by Kloppenburg in her time at the Department of Justice. Indeed, Prosser later said he was well aware of the ""breadth"" of those cases.

What’s more, Prosser brushed the claim off as a ""rhetorical flourish"" and an attempt at ""levity."" That would be more believable if people treated it that way at the time and if it didn’t match up with one of the major lines of attack from Kloppenburg critics in the campaign.

At PolitiFact, a statement is False if it is not accurate. It’s not accurate to say that Kloppenburg’s has only handled dock cases. That’s a ridiculous claim -- from a justice who has heard her argue a variety of cases before him on the state’s high court.

False plus ridiculous equals Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/apr/01/david-prosser/wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-david-prosser-says/

Sen. John Cornyn says U.S. arrested people from nations designated as terrorism sponsors on border with Mexico in first 19 months of Obama administration
","
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, came to a committee hearing on homeland security armed with statistics about the nation’s southwestern border. 
Confronting Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on March 9, Cornyn cited information that he said was from the Border Patrol about people from countries other than Mexico who have been detained near the southwestern border for illegally entering the United States. Cornyn said there were about 45,000 arrests of people from 140 different countries, excluding Mexico, in the 19 months between the start of the 2009 fiscal year — Oct. 1, 2008 — and April 30, 2010. 
At least four of those nations ""have been designated by the U.S. Department of State as state sponsors of terrorism,"" Cornyn said. ""How can you possibly claim that the approach of the administration is working when it comes to border security, in light of these statistics?"" 
He made a similar point the next day while questioning National Intelligence Director James Clapper at another hearing. ""Would you agree with me, Director Clapper, that an individual with enough money and enough determination can penetrate our southwestern border and make their way into the United States … and that that does represent a potential terrorist threat to the United States?"" Cornyn asked. 
Clapper’s response: ""Yes, sir. I don't — I don't pretend, nor would, I don't think, Secretary Napolitano pretend that, you know, we've got an iron-clad perfect system."" 
We wondered whether Cornyn was right. Did the U.S. Border Patrol arrest people on the Mexico border who were from nations that the U.S. labels state sponsors of terrorism? 
On the State Department’s website, we found that the only nations currently designated as state sponsors of terrorism are Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. ""State sponsors of terrorism provide critical support to many non-state terrorist groups,"" says a 2009 department report on terrorism. ""Without state sponsors, these groups would have greater difficulty obtaining the funds, weapons, materials, and secure areas they require to plan and conduct operations."" 
Next, we looked into Border Patrol apprehensions near the southwestern border. We found that nearly all are of Mexican nationals, according to information the agency publishes on its website. In fiscal 2009, their 495,582 arrests accounted for 92 percent of the total. 
The rest of the apprehensions on the Mexican border are of people from countries other than Mexico. The Border Patrol, which is part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection division of the Homeland Security Department, publishes data on how many of those occur — but not by individual country. According to that information, there were 45,283 arrests of individuals from nations other than Mexico in fiscal 2009 and 50,912 in fiscal 2010. (It appears that Cornyn quoted only the fiscal 2009 number during the hearing.) 
In Homeland Security lingo, an ""apprehension"" is an arrest for being in the United States illegally. However, the number of people actually detained is smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once, according to a June 2009 fact sheet published by the department’s Office of Immigration Statistics. 
As support for the senator’s statement during the March 9 hearing, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie sent us a chart that he said his office had received from Customs and Border Protection. Unlike the Border Patrol’s published data, this chart lists a country-by-country breakdown of arrests ""by citizenship"" for illegal entry on the southwestern border during fiscal 2009 and the first seven months of fiscal 2010. That’s the same time period that Cornyn noted at the March 9 hearing. 
The southwestern border data from Cornyn’s chart show that there were 105 apprehensions of Cubans, 10 of Iranians, six of Sudanese and none of Syrians in fiscal 2009. In the first seven months of 2010, there were 48 apprehensions of Cubans, seven of Iranians, one of Sudanese and two of Syrians. 
All together, the apprehensions from those four countries represent 0.25 percent of the total arrests of non-Mexicans on the southwestern border over the 19-month period, according to Cornyn’s chart. (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras alone accounted for 84 percent.) 
Add Mexican nationals to the equation, and the percentage shrinks more: According to the numbers in Cornyn’s chart, apprehensions of people from the ""state sponsor of terrorism"" nations amounted to 0.02 percent of the 540,865 total arrests on the southwestern border in fiscal 2009. 
What about the other U.S. border areas? The Border Patrol also apprehends people for illegal entry at the northern border with Canada and in the coastal areas of Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana and other Gulf states. According to 2009 nationwide statistics that we received from the Border Patrol, there were 935 arrests of people from the four ""terrorism"" nations: 910 of Cubans, 15 of Iranians, six of Sudanese and four of Syrians. Subtract the 121 apprehensions that took place on the southwestern border that year, according to Cornyn’s chart, and that leaves 814 arrests, mostly of Cubans. 
So, 87 percent of the apprehensions of citizens from terrorism-sponsoring countries occurred away from the southwestern border. 
We asked the Border Patrol to confirm the information in Cornyn’s chart, but the agency declined. ""For operational integrity and intelligence-based targeting, the Border Patrol does not specifically list country of birth to the location of apprehension,"" Border Patrol spokesman Mark Qualia said. 
To try to verify that the data were authentic, we asked Cornyn’s office to show us the accompanying e-mail from the agency; Brandewie declined. 
For a fact-checking outfit, that’s an impasse. 
However, Border Patrol statistics that the agency either publishes online or confirmed for us lend statistical support to Cornyn’s claim. 
For instance: The vast majority of apprehensions of people from countries other than Mexico occur on the southwestern border, 86 percent in fiscal 2009. So it’s statistically likely that some of the apprehensions of people from countries that sponsor terrorism take place there, too. 
And while total nationwide Border Patrol apprehensions have dropped 72 percent over the past decade, arrests of people from nations other than Mexico increased 49 percent. Have arrests of people from the ""state sponsor of terrorism"" nations also gone up? 
Not as far as we can tell. We asked the Border Patrol for a country-by-country breakdown for fiscal 2005, midway through the Bush administration and one of the peak years for total apprehensions in the past decade, as well as other years. All we received was the data for 2005, when six nations had the ""terrorism"" label: Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Nationwide in 2005, there were 3,309 apprehensions of people from terrorism-sponsoring countries out of a total of 1,189,000. That compares to the 935 apprehensions in 2009 out of a total of 556,041. 
In fiscal 2010, the nationwide apprehensions of people from the four terrorism-sponsoring countries dropped again, to 736. 
What of Cornyn’s larger argument: that the arrests of people from Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria show that the federal government’s approach to security on the southwestern border is not working and that the border is vulnerable to penetration by terrorists crossing illegally? 
We’re not going to tackle the first point, which is a political bone of contention. We’re also mindful of the logic that any arrests are evidence that border security efforts are working. But we wanted to find out whether there is evidence of would-be terrorists entering the U.S. illegally through Mexico. 
Matthew Chandler, press secretary for the Homeland Security Department, told us that ""at this time, DHS does not have any credible information on terrorist groups operating along the southwest border."" 
Eric Olson, a senior associate at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, echoed that thought in a March 17 Texas Tribune news article, saying that the State Department’s most recent report on terrorism gave no indication that Mexico has become a launch pad for terrorists crossing the border illegally. 
""I suppose anyone that hates the U.S. would find a way to get in,"" he told the Tribune. ""But so far, most of the cases (of those visitors who have sought to harm the U.S.) have been overstayed visas. They come in through the front door, not the back door."" 
David Shirk, director of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute, which studies border-related topics such as the cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico on security initiatives, told us that although the U.S. has been arresting people at the border from countries associated with terrorism, that doesn’t necessarily indicate that those individuals were would-be terrorists. 
But Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company, told us that Cornyn’s comments are ""spot-on"" and that there is reason to be concerned about potential terrorists coming across the southwestern border. As an example, he pointed to a June 3 Stratfor assessment noting that in late May, the Homeland Security Department ""issued a lookout to authorities in Texas, warning that … (a) Somali purportedly linked to al Shabaab was believed to be in Mexico and was allegedly planning to attempt to cross the border into the United States."" 
Al Shabaab, an Islamist militant group based in Somalia that has fought the nation’s transitional government for years, has been on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations since early 2008. 
Where does that leave us? 
Cornyn’s claim — that people from countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism have been arrested on the Mexican border for illegally entering the U.S. — relies on Border Patrol statistics that the agency won’t confirm or deny. However, they appear to be consistent with broader data the agency has made public. And we have no reason to question the authenticity of the information we received from Cornyn’s office. 
But in the larger context of Cornyn’s concerns about security on the Mexican border, his own numbers show that 87 percent of the apprehensions of people from ""terrorism"" countries took place elsewhere. And our spot-check found that the Border Patrol made three times as many of those arrests in 2005, during the Bush administration, than in 2009. 
Because Cornyn's statement leaves out key details, we rate it Half True. 
UPDATE, 1:00 p.m., April 11: On Friday, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed March 25, we received information from Customs and Border Protection confirming Cornyn's data on the number of apprehensions of Cubans, Iranians, Sudanese and Syrians that took place on the southwestern border between Oct. 1, 2008, and April 30, 2010.",/factchecks/2011/apr/01/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-us-arrested-people-nations-de/
"['Georgia', 'Nuclear', 'Johnny Isakson']","
Isakson claims no deaths in U.S. from nuke plant operations
","
(Editor’s Note: Sen. Isakson’s statement was made in the context of a discussion about two commercial nuclear power plants -- Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi and the Votgle facility, a plant near Augusta that’s slated for expansion. Isakson was specifically addressing safety issues at commercial nuclear power generators.) 
The fallout from Japan’s nuclear disaster has arrived in Georgia as a small cloud of worry.  

The construction of the nation’s first new nuclear reactors in decades is slated for just south of Augusta at the Vogtle power plant. When a deadly earthquake and tsunami triggered what is likely a partial meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a few residents near the Georgia site began to ask questions.

U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson was quick to offer reassurances that Vogtle would be safe.

""There has never been a death caused by a reactor in the United States, even when Three Mile Island failed in the 1970s,"" Isakson said in a YouTube.com video posted by his office.  

Three Mile Island? That 1979 nuclear accident sank the U.S. into a three-decade freeze on the building of nuclear power plants. No one died?

Nuclear power companies have a lot at stake at Vogtle. They hope its new reactors will herald an industry renaissance.

Now that Fukushima Daiichi is in crisis, the future for nuclear power is uncertain. Members of Congress, such as independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, have urged regulators to be cautious as they proceed with the construction of more nuclear plants in the U.S.

We called up Isakson’s office and asked for more evidence. A spokeswoman pointed us to 2010 testimony by Greg Jaczko, the chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at a Senate committee hearing.

When a senator asked Jaczko whether a fatality had ever occurred ""as a result of an accident at a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States,"" Jaczko replied with this:

""There has not as a result of plant operation, not at a commercial power plant. There have been other nuclear facilities where there have been fatalities, but not in a nuclear power plant.""

We interviewed experts on Three Mile Island, epidemiology and the history of nuclear power. They agreed that no one died during the immediate crisis surrounding the Three Mile Island accident or in other commercial U.S. plants as a result of plant operation.

In addition, they agreed that the scientific consensus is that in the decades following Three Mile Island, no deaths have been tied to illnesses resulting from radiation exposure.

""The statement of the politician [Isakson] is correct -- as far as we know,"" said Sam Walker, who retired last year as historian for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is the author of a book on Three Mile Island.

The prevailing view is that despite early, anecdotal reports of deaths and disease, Three Mile Island’s impact on overall cancer deaths is minimal. Worker radiation exposure was higher than normal but not extreme, and experts think people living near the plant were exposed to low doses.

This does not mean, however, that the disaster has not caused deaths or won’t in the future. It can take more than a decade for radiation exposure to manifest itself as cancer, and it’s difficult to pinpoint whether radiation exposure, a smoking habit or other factors caused a particular person’s illness.     

The latest research suggests Three Mile Island may have some deadly long-term effects.  University of Pittsburgh professor Evelyn Talbott has been leading a major, decades-long effort to track the effects of Three Mile Island radiation in more than 32,000 people who lived in the area surrounding the plant.  

Talbott’s team noted no increase in overall cancer deaths 20 years afterward, but research they recently submitted for publication shows that adult men who they think received the highest doses of radiation from the accident are at greater risk for leukemia than others who were exposed, the scientist said.  

Women with similar amounts of radiation exposure showed a higher risk of breast cancer.

""So presumably there may have been excess deaths. We just don't know who specifically, as the cases were within a group of people exposed to more radiation but also had other factors which may have predisposed them,"" Talbott told PolitiFact Georgia.

Members of an impassioned minority think the impact may have been more severe. A study by scientists at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, found a link between Three Mile Island and increased incidents of cancer overall.

Critics think there are too few peer-reviewed studies published in medical journals on the disaster’s health effects. Joseph Mangano, the head of the Radiation and Public Health Project, thinks the dangers of radiation exposure in general are underplayed. He noted that only a handful of studies have been published on patterns of several types of cancer.
 
""I think the health research field has completely dropped the ball,"" Mangano told PolitiFact Georgia.

In conclusion:

Isakson’s statement that ""there has never been a death caused by a reactor in the United States, even when Three Mile Island failed in the 1970s,"" reflects a prevailing view.

According to the latest research, that does not mean there has never been a death because of Three Mile Island’s long-term effects. It’s also worth noting that some scientists back a minority view that the accident increased overall cancer deaths.   

That said, Isakson specified in his claim that there has never been a death ""caused by a reactor"" in the U.S. This language is not clear, but it does indicate his claim is limited to plant operations, not the long-term aftermath of a nuclear accident. His backup information suggests this as well.

We rate Isakson’s statement True. ",/factchecks/2011/apr/01/johnny-isakson/isakson-claims-no-deaths-us-nuke-plant-operations/
"['Health Care', 'Virginia', 'Morgan Griffith']","
Morgan Griffith says you need a waiver to keep your health care plan
","
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith is on the long list of Republicans who observed the first anniversary of the health-care reform law by firing out a scathing statement.

Griffith, who represents the 9th Congressional District in Southwest Virginia, said in a March 25  newsletter that Americans were misled about the bill.

""Originally, Democrats promised that if you liked your health-care plan, you could keep it,"" Griffith wrote. ""One year later we know that you need a waiver to keep your plan.""

We gave his statement a checkup.

Roughly 160 million Americans get health insurance through employee benefits, and millions more buy it on the private market, according to Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University and a consumer advocate for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

Our research turned up no evidence of blanket waivers being required by the government. But experts did tell us Uncle Sam was issuing some waivers for limited-benefit plans and coverages that were not meeting a new requirement to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health benefits rather than administrative or other costs.

Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, confirmed that Griffith’s comments refer primarily to the limited-benefit, or ""mini-med"" plans popular at huge employers with lots of part-time or low-wage workers. Two of the largest users are Wal-Mart and McDonalds.

These policies often have annual limits on on total payouts. Jost said the caps can be as low $2,000. The new law bars annual benefit limits, starting in 2014. The ban will be phased in over the next three years, allowing benefit caps of $750,000 in 2011, $1.25 million in 2012 and $2 million in 2013.

But the health-care reform law provides an out for plans that can’t meet these new limits without jacking up premiums. If an insurer can convince regulators that the new caps would cause premiums on a plan to soar, regulators can issue a waiver.

During the first two months of this year, 1,040 waivers were issued for limited-benefit plans covering 2.6 million workers, according to the the Department of Health and Human Services. That’s roughly 1.6 percent of the employees with health care coverage. Jost believes virtually every mini-med plan in America has sought a waiver.

""These waivers include some pretty good plans with $250,000 or $500,000 annual limits that just can’t quite get to the threshold,"" Jost said. ""Some offer pretty decent coverage, and some offer virtually nothing.""

Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said mini-med plans are expected to all but vanish by 2014. He said the government predicts many businesses will bring their plans into compliance with new standards, even though it will likely force businesses to spend more.

But Tanner stressed that most companies and their employees will not go through a waiver process.

""That’s just not the case now,"" Tanner said.

During the health care debate, President Barack Obama promised Americans would be able to keep their plans, if they like them. PolitiFact rated that statement Half True, because while many elements of the health care system will not change, private companies retain the right to switch and tweak their health care plans. Many do so now, and they will continue to do so after 2014.

When Obama later said nothing in the law will force most employers to change plans, the statement was rated True. While employers retain the right to change plans, they are not, in most cases, required to do.

So here’s our final diagnosis.

Griffith wrote in a column excoriating insurance provisions in the health care reform law that ""you need a waiver to keep your plan."" His press secretary told us  the congressman was only talking about limited-benefit plans, although Griffith made no such distinction in his writing.

About 2.6 million Americans are covered by limited-benefit plans. That’s a tiny percentage of the 160 million people who have employer-sponsored health coverage, and millions more who have other forms of coverage.

Contrary to what Griffith said, very few Americans will need a waiver to keep their health-care plan. We rate his statement Barely True. ",/factchecks/2011/mar/31/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-you-need-waiver-keep-your-hea/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Social Security', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum says one of every three pregnancies ends in an abortion
","
In a March 29, 2011, interview with WEZS Radio in Laconia, N.H., former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. -- a possible 2012 presidential candidate -- discussed a possible link between the financial predicament of Social Security and abortion.

Santorum, a strong opponent of abortion during his time in the Senate, argued that abortion has so depleted the ranks of younger Americans that the costs of Social Security benefits are having to be shouldered by fewer working-age Americans.

""The Social Security system in my opinion is a flawed design, period,"" Santorum said in response to a question from a caller. ""But having said that, the design would work a lot better if we had stable demographic trends. The reason Social Security is in big trouble is we don’t have enough workers to support the retirees. Well, a third of all the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion, because one in three pregnancies end in abortion.""

Several readers asked us to check Santorum's claim about the number of abortions.

To do this, we delved into statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We chose 2003 as our representative year, since it was the most recent year for which we were able to obtain all of the relevant data.

We set out to determine the number of known pregnancies in 2003. We say ""known"" because some pregnancies end due to natural causes at a very early stage, often before the woman even realizes she is pregnant. CDC only offers statistics for fetal deaths beginning at a fetal age of 20 weeks, so that’s the parameter we’ll use in our calculations.

To calculate the number of known pregnancies, we added together three figures: the number of live births, the number of fetal deaths (these include natural miscarriages and stillbirths), and the number of abortions. Here’s the data for 2003:

Live births: 4,090,007
Fetal deaths: 25,653
Abortions: 1,250,000

Total known pregnancies: 5,365,660

So abortions account for 23.2 percent of all known pregnancies. That’s less than a quarter of all pregnancies, rather than the one-third Santorum said.

The Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health, has come up with a number very close to what PolitiFact found, spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said. The institute found that 22.4 percent of pregnancies resulted in an abortion in 2008. (The institute did not factor fetal deaths into its calculation.)

But Santorum isn’t just off-base about the number of abortions. He also makes a flawed assumption about the impact of abortions on U.S. population trends, Wind said.

""It is simply wrong"" to assume that every abortion reduces the U.S. population by one person, she said, since many women obtain abortions to postpone childbearing -- not to prevent it altogether.

A 2005 Guttmacher study of more than 1,200 women who had undergone an abortion found that a little under half cited the desire not to have additional children as a reason for having their abortion. This means that a substantial minority -- and possibly as many as 53 percent -- expected to have children after the abortion. This pattern was particularly strong among younger women in the study (less than a quarter of those 19 or younger said they were done with childbearing) and among those who had no children at the time of the abortion (only 3 percent said they were done with childbearing).

We provided Santorum's office with our calculations and asked for a response. A spokeswoman did not counter our findings, but offered a brief statement that said ""the prolife community has been astounded at the increasing percentages in the pregnancies that result in abortion."" The statement also made additional claims about abortion rates among certain demographic groups, but they did not address the wording that Santorum had used in the radio interview. 
So we find Santorum is significantly overstating the frequency of abortions when he claims that ""one in three pregnancies end in abortion"" -- it’s actually in the 22 percent to 23 percent range.  That's less than one in four. And the effect on population would be even lower if women who had abortions had children later in life. We can't know exactly how that would affect the numbers, but it would send the estimate even lower. We rate Santorum's statement False. 
UPDATE, April 1, 2011: After we published this item, a reader pointed out that the statement we quoted from Santorum’s office was incorrect. While a spokeswoman had told us that ""the prolife community has been astounded at the increasing percentages in the pregnancies that result in abortion,"" the reader pointed us to statistics from the Guttmacher Institute that show the rate of abortions declining over time. From a 1981 peak of 29.3 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44, the rate has fallen, gradually but steadily, to 19.6 in 2008 -- a decline of about one-third. According to Census Bureau data, the raw number of abortions has also fallen consistently, from a peak of 1,609,000 in 1990 to 1,242,000 in 2006.",/factchecks/2011/mar/31/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-one-every-three-pregnancies-end/

Scott says new federal health care act eliminated inexpensive child-only insurance policies
","
To mark the one-year anniversary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010, Republican leaders have been rallying their voices and calling for a repeal of the health care measure.

From television advertisements like this one featuring Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee to newspaper opinion pieces, Republicans continue to drum their talking points against the health care overhaul. Likewise, Democrats have also been using the anniversary to grow support for the measure by hosting events like community picnics and forums.

Gov. Rick Scott was among those adding to the Republican chorus of dissent against the law. On March 23, 2011, he penned an opinion piece for the Tampa Tribune decrying ""ObamaCare.""

""As important as health insurance is, most people need a job more than they need health insurance,"" Scott wrote.

Scott, a former hospital chain CEO, ran on a platform opposing health care reform, and has supported the Florida-led lawsuit against the law. Before becoming a candidate, Scott founded Conservatives for Patients' Rights, a group dedicated to opposing federal health care reform.

""Before this law was enacted, Florida parents who were laid off or who couldn't get dependent coverage at work were able to purchase inexpensive 'child-only' coverage for their children,"" Scott wrote. ""The law's 'consumer protections' have now eliminated that choice in Florida and 17 other states.""

We wondered about Scott's claim. Did the federal health care law really eliminate all inexpensive child-only insurance options in Florida?

We turned to Scott's press office to request materials that would support the governor's claim but never received a response. Our research, however, found that child-only insurance programs do still exist, and the state runs one of them.

The health care law 
Let's start with the law and its consumer protection provisions. The law was signed by Obama on March 23, 2010, and is aimed at ensuring that all Americans have access to health insurance by barring health insurance providers from refusing coverage for folks with pre-existing conditions.

The entire law is set to go into effect by 2014; however, there are elements of the law, namely those geared toward children, that were launched in 2010. For example, children can now remain under their parents' insurance until age 26, when previously most had to be off the plan by age 19 or when they stopped being enrolled full-time in college.

Another measure set into motion in 2010, the one referenced by Scott, bans insurance providers from refusing to insure a child based on pre-existing conditions. The child-only provision was set to demonstrate on a smaller scale what the law aimed to do when it is fully launched in 2014 -- ensuring coverage for everyone, healthy or sick, who applied for health insurance.

Except, unlike the ""health care for all"" provisions set for 2014, the child-only provisions did not include language requiring insurers to write insurance policies for children. In other words, they couldn't deny a child coverage based on a pre-condition -- but the law doesn't require them to sell a child-specific policy in the first place.

""Nothing in the Affordable Care Act, or any other existing federal law, allows us to require insurance companies to offer a particular type of policy at this time,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius acknowledged in an Oct. 13, 2010, letter to Jane L. Cline, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

Leading up to the Sept. 23, 2010, start date of the child-protection provisions, some of the nation's leading providers -- including WellPoint, UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, Cigna and Humana -- stopped selling the child-only policies. Several cited concerns that the law did not provide guarantees that parents wouldn't wait until a child was gravely ill before purchasing a plan.

""The regulations provide a very powerful incentive for parents to wait until their children are sick to buy coverage, which drives up costs for everyone else,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a leading lobbyist group for insurers.

Doug Lynch, vice president of actuary for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, likened the measure to letting a person purchase homeowners insurance once their house is on fire.

""As an example, on the way to the hospital, a parent could call from the ambulance to get coverage,"" Lynch said in a March 28, 2011, telephone interview. ""There was no waiting period … this type of system lends itself to abuse. If you do cover that case, then you would need to charge everyone for that abuse.""

Sebelius offered some suggestions so that private insurers would continue to sell the child-only plans -- imposing a surcharge if a parent dropped their child's coverage and subsequently reapplied for it, and adjusting rates based on health status as permitted by state law (though by 2014, they will no longer be allowed to charge rates based on health status). She also noted in her letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that insurance companies could set enrollment periods, so that parents could not just sign up at any time, so long as the periods they set are consistent with state laws governing enrollment periods.

Some providers say that they may be willing to return to selling child-only policies in Florida if the kinks of the law's language are ironed out before 2014.

""For us, it's a market issue,"" Gwyn Dilday, spokeswoman for Cigna, said. ""If the market dynamics change in Florida, it's something that we would consider.""

Dilday said Cigna did not stop selling child-only policies solely because of the health care law, but also because the child-only policies accounted for a tiny portion of their overall business.

""There were a lot of factors in our decision,"" Dilday said. ""We’re such a small player in this line of business. It's a very, very small amount of policies, less than 1 percent of the 100,000 policies we have nationally. We had to take that into consideration.""

Other options

While private providers have stopped selling the child-specific policies in Florida, there are still two other government-funded options available to parents -- KidCare and the newly formed Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP)

Established by the state Legislature in 1998, KidCare, a program run under the Florida Department of Health, provides health insurance not only for low-income children, but for parents of all income levels. Parents pay a monthly premium based on their income, so they can pay anywhere from $15 a month per child to $159.

""We did realize when they started leaving, that we were probably it,"" said Jennifer Lloyd, chief external affairs officer for KidCare, referring to the private providers no longer selling child-only policies.

As of January 2011, there are 1.7 million children enrolled in KidCare, the bulk of those insured through Medicaid. Those not covered by Medicaid amount to 281,000 children as of March 2011, according to Lloyd. Lloyd said the program is open for enrollment throughout the year, but it must cap enrollment once the program reaches its annual funding limit. For the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the program received $510 million in state and federal matching funds.  Still, Lloyd noted that the last time the program had to close enrollment because of financial limitations was in 2002-2003.

Despite private providers no longer selling child-specific policies in the state, Lloyd said enrollment in KidCare has ""remained steady.""

""I cannot say that we've seen a spike in enrollment,"" Lloyd said. ""We saw a spike in applications in January, a little spike, but we think with all the chatter surrounding the health care act, it just got people thinking about health insurance more.""

Lloyd said that while the program does outreach at schools to inform parents, it isn't as widely advertised as plans from private insurers who may have more advertising money at their disposal.

""People might forget that we’re an option,"" Lloyd said.

Another option for parents of children with pre-existing conditions is enrollment in the federally funded Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). The plan was created by the health care law, which allotted $5 billion to help fund high-risk insurance pools run by the states or the Department of Health and Human Services until 2014.

In Florida, the plan is administered directly by the Department of Health and Human Services, with plans for those under the age of 18 ranging from $196 to $263 a month. (For a full breakdown of how each state administers the PCIP program, check out this HHS website.)

""The PCIP program is available for eligible children with pre-existing conditions who have been uninsured for at least six months,"" Sebelius wrote in her letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

Our ruling

So back to Scott's claim: Did the federal health care law eliminate an inexpensive insurance option for children in Florida?

While elements of the law that took effect in 2010 have prompted private insurers to stop selling child-only policies, the state continues to offer a viable option for parents in the form of KidCare. For parents who are laid off or low-income, the KidCare rates are inexpensive. And children with pre-existing conditions can also seek enrollment in the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) created by the federal law -- though the rates are higher. Without private insurers participating, the choices for parents have certainly been reduced. But eliminated, as Scott said? No.

"['County Government', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Wisconsin', 'Ismael Ozanne']","
Attorney general candidate says he's running large district attorney's office with 1985 staffing
","In the run-up to the Aug. 12, 2014 primary election for state attorney general, Democrat Ismael Ozanne has stressed his experience as the Dane County district attorney and as a former deputy secretary of the state Department of Corrections. On June 7, 2014, near the end of a speech he gave at the state Democratic Party convention, Ozanne said: ""And I’m running the second-largest county district attorney’s office. And I’ve talked to you about some of the innovations that we’re doing, some of the things that we’re doing to be proactive. But I’m doing that at 1985 staffing levels. So, you think about that. That’s leadership. That’s experience. I’m doing more with less in a county that’s grown 46 percent, where law enforcement’s grown 103 percent. We are moving forward."" It’s no surprise that the population of Dane County, home to Madison, has been growing and that court caseloads would be higher, as well. So, is the DA’s office there still operating with the same number of staff it did nearly three decades ago? Prosecutor funding In Wisconsin, the elected district attorneys and the prosecutors they hire primarily prosecute felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well juvenile cases, in circuit court. They were county employees until 1990, after a change in state law made them state employees. The change was made largely as a means of providing local property tax relief and reducing turnover in prosecutor positions, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. As a result, the vast majority of prosecutor positions in the district attorney offices is determined through the state budget process. Some county district attorney offices also get prosecutors via state- or federally funded grants, which come and go. Concerns have been raised for years about the number of prosecutors. A state Legislative Audit Bureau analysis done in 2007 noted that the state employed 425 district attorney prosecutors but -- based on the number and types of cases prosecuted as analyzed by the State Prosecutors Office -- should employ 542. That gap has grown, according to a more recent analysis. The State Prosecutors Office says there were still 425 district attorney prosecutors as of April 2014, but there should be 555. Ozanne's numbers As for Ozanne’s claim, he said he was referring to the prosecutor positions in his office. To back the claim, his campaign initially cited a chart on the website of the Dane County district attorney's office, which lists the number of prosecutors annually back from 1985 through 2011. Separately, we obtained a 1985 budget document from the county’s budget office. Both indicate the Dane County DA’s office had 26 prosecutors in 1985. The number remained in the high 20s to low 30s well into the 1990s before peaking at 34 in both 1999 and 2003, according to the chart. The low was 25 prosecutors in 2010. The current number, however, is slightly higher than the 26 that there were in 1985. The full-time-equivalent number of prosecutor positions for 2014 is 27.85, according to the State Prosecutors Office. That is nearly two positions, or about 7 percent, more than Dane County’s 1985 total. By comparison, Milwaukee County had 86 prosecutors in 1990 (the oldest complete data available) compared to 119.5 in 2014, according to the State Prosecutors Office. But two other important factors bear on Ozanne’s claim. 1. The Dane County DA's office has used more state-paid special prosecutors than any other county in each year since 2012 (Ozanne became DA in August 2010), according to the State Prosecutors Office. So far in 2014, it has used six special prosecutors, including two who are covering extended leaves; that would technically bump its total to 29.85 prosecutors for 2014, as indicated on information Ozanne’s campaign provided. The state incurs an additional cost to pay the special prosecutors, even though they are not a net addition to the prosecutorial staff. 2. Ozanne’s claim was general -- the level of staffing in his office, rather than specifically the number of prosecutors. We found there are currently 58 non-prosecutors in the DA’s office -- paralegals, investigators, secretaries and others -- which is 41 percent more than the 41 support staff in 1985. Our rating  Ozanne said: ""I’m running the second-largest county district attorney’s office … at 1985 staffing levels."" The Dane County district attorney’s office has a full-time-equivalent of 27.85 prosecutors, just slightly more than the 26 in 1985, but it also regularly utilizes special prosecutors to fill temporary vacancies. And the office has 41 percent more support staff than it did in 1985. We rate Ozanne’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/23/ismael-ozanne/attorney-general-candidate-says-hes-running-distri/

Democratic group says Pennsylvania is 49th in job creation under Gov. Tom Corbett
","Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, remains one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors running this year. Elected to his first term in 2010, Corbett now trails Democratic challenger Tom Wolf by more than 20 points in most recent polls. Despite Wolf’s lead, pro-Democratic groups are leaving nothing to chance. One of these is Fresh Start PA, a political action committee running parallel to the state Democratic Party. It’s headed by Katie McGinty, one of the Democratic primary challengers Wolf defeated, and its senior strategist is veteran Pennsylvania Democratic consultant Mike Mikus. Here’s the text of the ad released on July 15: ""It's a shame what Tom Corbett has done to Pennsylvania: huge deficits, while he's given tax breaks to big corporations. He's let oil and gas companies off the hook. Under Corbett, we're the only state in the country who doesn't charge an extraction tax. Corbett's cut a billion dollars from our schools, forcing communities to raise property taxes. And Pennsylvania ranks 49th in job creation. Tom Corbett: why would we give him four more years?"" There are a lot of claims here, but the one we’re going to check is that under Corbett, ""Pennsylvania ranks 49th in job creation."" The source of the statistic isn’t cited within the ad, but when we asked Mikus, he said it came from data compiled by the Keystone Research Center, a think tank whose board includes many labor-union officials and is often described as liberal-leaning. Because the data from the group’s report comes from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, we were able to recalculate it ourselves. We looked at the change in total, seasonally adjusted, non-farm employment in the 50 states between January 2011, when Corbett took office, and June 2014, the most recent month for which data is available. We found that Pennsylvania gained a net 124,800 jobs during that period -- an increase of 2.2 percent. Measuring by percentage increase, that ranked Pennsylvania 47th in the nation. The only states with a smaller increase were New Mexico (1 percent), Alaska (1.58 percent) and Arkansas (1.91 percent). The reason for the discrepancy between 49th (as the ad said) and 47th (what we found) is that the Keystone Research Center report used data only through April 2014, while we used it through June 2014. We can see why Fresh Start PA cited a pre-existing report for their data, but we figured it was better to use the most current data available during the ad’s run. Billy Pitman, a spokesman for the Corbett campaign, said the ad’s statistic is ""misleading,"" noting that the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent in January 2011, when he took office, to 5.6 percent now. But Mikus counters that Corbett was the one who said that making Pennsylvania No. 1 in job creation was one of his goals, on at least two occasions (video here and here). One piece of context worth noting is that states that suffered relatively modest job losses during the downturn would be expected to experience a less robust recovery, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. During the recession and immediate post-recession years of 2008 to 2010, Pennsylvania lost less ground in employment than most states. Finally economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a limited impact on a state's economy. States are tied to larger economic forces, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. Corbett's most direct impact on jobs would presumably have come in government employment. Since he took office, state and local government employment fell by 55,000, or 7 percent of the government work force. In fact, if government employment had remained stable over that period, total nonfarm employment would have been 44 percent higher than it turned out to be. Either way, the ad offered a specific statistic, and it’s pretty close. Whether the state ranks 49th or 47th in the nation, the ad raises a fair point that job growth in Pennsylvania has lagged that of most other states since January 2011. Another sign of the weak employment picture: The number of payroll jobs in the state isn’t even back to where it was at the start of the recession. Our ruling Fresh Start PA said that under Corbett, ""Pennsylvania ranks 49th in job creation."" We looked at the most current numbers and found the state is now 47th rather than 49th -- but even at 47th, Pennsylvania is clearly among the weakest states in job creation since the start of 2011. It’s important to note that Corbett, like all governors, has a limited influence on the economic performance of his state.

Nan Rich says Florida has 3rd most-regressive tax structure
","When it comes to taxes, Democratic candidate for governor Nan Rich wants to make things more fair for the little guy in Florida. Rich, a former state senator from Weston, faced a question about whether Florida’s tax system should be changed during a Florida Press Association event July 11 at the swanky Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. ""I think it's a regressive tax base, and when you look at some of the studies saying it’s the third most-regressive tax base -- I don't want you to quote me on that because PolitiFact may get me, I'm not sure if it’s (No.) three -- but I think there are things we need to do to make a more equitable and fair tax structure."" At PolitiFact Florida, our ears perk up when we hear rankings that put Florida near the top or bottom. As for her request for us not to PolitiFact her, well, we couldn’t help but take that as a friendly challenge. Studies about regressive taxes Rich told PolitiFact Florida in an interview, ""don’t hold me to ‘third regressive.’ .... I did not say ‘third’ definitively. ... We are one of the most regressive."" Rich cited a 2013 report by The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, a group that advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families. The report concluded that all states have regressive tax systems. It means that state taxes come more from the poor and middle class than from the rich. ""Virtually every state’s tax system is fundamentally unfair, taking a much greater share of income from middle- and low-income families than from wealthy families,"" the report says. ""The absence of a graduated personal income tax and the over reliance on consumption taxes exacerbate this problem in many states."" The report measures property, sales and excise taxes on gasoline and cigarettes paid by different income groups in each state in 2013 and concludes Florida is ""No. 2 of the terrible 10"" -- the second most-regressive tax system in the country. (No. 1 was Washington state.) ""The No. 1 and No. 2 predictor of a very unfair tax system is not having a personal income tax of any kind and an above-average sales tax, and Florida has both of those things,"" said Matt Gardner, the institute’s executive director. The report found that for non-elderly taxpayers, the bottom 20 percent pay 13.2 percent of their income toward state and local taxes. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent of earners only pay about 2.3 percent of their income toward state and local taxes. The report gives a nod to one progressive feature of Florida’s taxes: We don’t have sales taxes on groceries. We were unable to find any other entity that included Florida in a state-by-state comparison of regressivity and taxes. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that analyzes tax policy, wrote a report criticizing the institute’s study, but their points were not specifically about the states’ rankings. Instead, they criticized the report for promoting income taxes. The foundation does its own ranking of states in terms of business climate -- Florida placed fifth. We interviewed a few experts on taxes, and they were not surprised by Florida’s ranking when it comes to regressive taxes. ""Not that many states don’t have an income tax, so that puts us in a small group that looks more regressive,"" said University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith. However, he said, "" ‘regressive’ and ‘burdensome’ are separate issues. The tax burden in Florida is still very low, despite being regressive."" Aaron Twait, research director at the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, said there are only two taxes that are progressive: the income tax and the estate tax. ""States that don’t have the income tax -- they just don’t have that lever to pull,"" he said. ""Sales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes run from moderately regressive to really regressive."" Our ruling Rich said that there is evidence that Florida has ""the third most-regressive tax base,"" though she acknowledged when she spoke she wasn’t certain if she had the number right. She was close: A study placed Florida No. 2 in terms of its regressive tax base. Florida has a regressive tax base because we lack a state income tax. Though the Tax Foundation criticized the report, it didn’t dispute the states’ rankings, and other experts we interviewed also had no qualms about Florida’s placement. Rich’s number of third place was just a smidgen low, so we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/22/nan-rich/nan-rich-says-florida-has-third-most-regressive-ta/

Do 76 percent of doctors support the use of medical marijuana?
","An initiative proposing to legalize recreational marijuana in Oregon is headed for the November ballot. Signature verification by the Oregon Secretary of State’s office wrapped up Tuesday, with enough valid names turned in on petitions passed by New Approach Oregon to send the proposal to voters. The claim: The pro-pot group, on its Facebook page, recently posted a statistic indicating that physicians back the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. ""Did you know...76 percent of doctors support the use of medical marijuana,"" reads the claim. PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: New Approach Oregon’s claim that more than three out of four doctors ""support"" medicinal use of marijuana was attributed to a May 2013 survey published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The poll was conducted online. Unlike scientifically designed surveys, those who responded were not chosen at random but rather volunteered to participate. We checked the survey, which asked doctors, hypothetically, whether they would prescribe marijuana to help alleviate the suffering of a 68-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer. The study’s authors, both physicians, wrote they were surprised by the outcome -- 76 percent said yes. Although participation in the survey was global, 1,063 of the 1,446 votes came from the U.S., Canada and Mexico. ""Analysis of voting across all regions of North America showed that 76 percent of voters supported medicinal marijuana,"" the study’s authors wrote. The low end of support came from Utah, where only 1 vote in 76 supported medical pot. Pennsylvania represented the other extreme, with 102 of 107 votes in support. The study’s authors took a fairly specific situation -- the plight of a suffering 68-year-old -- and extrapolated the votes to indicate that 76 percent of physicians generally support medicinal marijuana. That’s a bit of a broad brush. However, the authors, Drs. Jonathan N. Adler and James A. Colbert, also noted that many votes came with explanations that went beyond that one hypothetical. ""Many pointed out the known dangers of prescription narcotics, supported patient choice, or described personal experience with patients who benefited from the use of marijuana,"" they wrote. Those who opposed medical marijuana, by contrast, ""targeted the lack of evidence, the lack of provenance, inconsistency of dosage, and concern about side effects, including psychosis."" Invited by the authors to write a rebuttal, Drs. Robert L. DuPont and Gary M. Reisfield noted that marijuana can cause lung damage, further harming anyone who already has breathing problems. We checked for additional national surveys assessing physicians’ views toward medical marijuana. The most prominent effort was published April 2, 2014, on WebMD’s website. Of 1,544 doctors surveyed, 69 percent said marijuana can help with certain treatments and conditions; 67 percent said it should be a medical option for patients; and 56 percent supported making it legal nationwide. The survey, drawn from doctors representing more than 12 specialty areas, reported a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent. However, as with the New England Journal of Medicine survey, this effort was voluntary, self-selected and unscientific. The survey and poll come as 23 states, including Oregon, and the District of Columbia have now legalized medical marijuana, with eight of those states signing on in just the past three years. We contacted the Oregon Medical Association to see where Beaver State physicians stand on the issue. ""We don’t recommend participation in medical marijuana,"" Gwen Dayton, the organization’s general counsel and vice president for health policy, wrote in an email. ""If a physician wants to, fine, but if they ask us whether they should or not, we don’t recommend it."" Asked about the national survey, Dayton said, ""They are an esteemed publication. I’d never say anything they print is nonsense."" The American Medical Association takes much the same view. While the association is calling for more research into marijuana’s effectiveness as a medical option, it has no language that would give doctors a green light to prescribe it, Kelly Jakubek, the AMA’s public information officer, wrote in an email. We called Liz Kaufman, New Approach Oregon’s campaign director. She said the journal of medicine’s article was posted on New Approach’s Facebook page not because the statistic is viewed as a scientific finding, but because it brings attention to the issue. ""This was a study published in the journal, not conducted by it,"" Kaufman said. ""Nor was it a telephone survey. It came from a self-selected set of doctors who gave opinions as individuals. We weren’t making a statement about the New England Journal of Medicine. This is just an article we’re bringing attention to."" New Approach Oregon’s stated reason on Facebook was to highlight that its measure wouldn’t change anything regarding medical marijuana. ""Our campaign knows that doctors know what’s right for their patients,"" the post reads. ""That’s why the New Approach initiative makes no changes to Oregon’s medical marijuana program."" The ruling: New Approach Oregon, a group backing an initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the state, claimed on its Facebook page that ""76 percent of doctors approve of medical marijuana use."" The figure comes from an unscientific survey published in one of the country’s most reputable health publications. Participants chose to take part and were not drawn from a random sample. New Approach Oregon offered no nuance with its posting, including the fact that the study was not scientific, nor that it was based on a single hypothetical example. The associations representing most physicians in both Oregon and the U.S. are making no such call, at least for now, that marijuana should be a treatment option for doctors. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False. Thoughts on our ruling?

Did Reagan really rush back to DC after Korean plane shoot down in '83?
","For Fox News, the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine evoked memories of another disaster, the shooting down of Korean Air Flight 007 by the Soviet air force in 1983. The commercial flight with 269 people aboard had strayed into Soviet airspace on its way to Seoul. After tracking the plane for several hours, a Soviet SU-15 Interceptor opened fire, crippling the plane and sending it into the sea. About 60 Americans were on board, including a member of Congress. Several pundits on Fox News used the 1983 crash to illustrate how unfavorably President Barack Obama compares to President Ronald Reagan. They criticized Obama for attending a fundraiser and sticking with his regular schedule on the day the Malaysian plane went down. They said it was completely different with Reagan. Chris Stirewalt, the Fox News Online editor, described how Reagan and his Secretary of State George Shultz ""immediately went on the offensive"" to ""show resolve in the face of aggression."" Conservative commentator Kate Obenshain echoed the speed of Reagan’s response. ""President Reagan rushed home from Santa Barbara vacation, from the Reagan ranch when the Korean jetliner was shot out of the air by the Russians,"" Obenshain said July 17 on The O’Reilly Factor. We looked at the sequence of events in late August and the first few days of September 1983. What we found is that it fails to line up as neatly as Obenshain said. An abbreviated timeline Korean Air 007 left Anchorage, Alaska, on Aug. 31, 1983. We now know that an incorrect setting in its autopilot system sent it slightly off course, enough to put it into Soviet airspace. At about 2:30 p.m. the plane vanished from radar screens. There was significant uncertainty as to what had happened. It took until the middle of the night Thursday Sept. 1 before U.S. officials knew that the plane had been shot down with no survivors. Secretary of State George Shultz spoke to the press that morning. At that time, he had not spoken to Reagan, although others had briefed the president. Up to this point, Reagan was on vacation at his Santa Barbara, Calif., ranch. The day that Shultz held his news briefing, White House spokesman Larry Speakes gave a statement to reporters in California. ""The president is very concerned and deeply disturbed about the loss of life aboard the Korean Air Lines flight overnight,"" Speakes said. ""There are no circumstances that can justify the unprecedented attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft. The Soviet Union owes an explanation to the world about how and why this tragedy has occurred."" When asked if Reagan would be returning to Washington, Speakes said he would not. ""There are no plans for the president to return to Washington earlier than anticipated,"" he said. The president ""has every facility, every capacity, every capability to do, perform any function that he could perform in Washington."" About eight hours later, Speakes called the reporters together again and announced that Reagan would return to Washington, D.C., the next day, Friday. As Reagan was leaving California, he read a brief statement. ''I speak for all Americans and for the people everywhere who cherish civilized values in protesting the Soviet attack on an unarmed civilian passenger plane,'' Reagan said. ''Words can scarcely express our revulsion at this horrifying act of violence."" Reagan wrote this in his diary that evening: ""We were due to return to Wash. on Labor Day but realized we couldn’t wait so we left on Fri. It was heartbreaking. I had really looked forward to those last three days. When we got in Fri, I went directly to a NSC (National Security Council) meeting re the Soviet affair."" On Sept. 5, 1983, four days after the jet was shot down, Reagan spoke to the nation for about 18 minutes in a televised address. A Fox News host corrects his colleagues Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, tried to correct the record on Fox. During an interview on the network’s morning show Fox and Friends, Wallace explained his experiences covering Reagan in 1983.   ""He was in Santa Barbara at his ranch when this happened, and quite frankly he didn't want to leave,"" Wallace said. ""And his advisers realized how terrible this looked, and eventually persuaded him he had to fly back to Washington and had to make this speech to the nation."" Reagan biographer Paul Kengor described the president’s reaction in his book The Crusader. Kengor quotes Reagan telling his National Security Advisor William Clark ""to be careful not to overreact to this."" According to press reports at the time, Reagan wanted arms control talks with the Soviets to continue and resisted putting economic sanctions on Russia. As for Obama, news of the Malaysia plane crash started appearing around 11:30 a.m. Washington time. By 12:05 p.m., White House reporters said Obama had been briefed on the crash. By shortly after 1 p.m., Obama and Russian Vladimir Putin discussed the crash and shortly after 2 p.m., Obama made a few brief remarks at a previously scheduled event in Delaware. ""Obviously the world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the Russia-Ukraine border. And it looks like it may be a terrible tragedy,"" Obama said. ""Right now, we’re working to determine whether there were American citizens onboard.  That is our first priority."" The president attended two fundraising events in New York City the night of the crash and returned to the capital that evening. He held a news conference at the White House the next morning. He called the deaths ""an outrage of unspeakable proportions,"" and said that ""Russia, these separatists, and Ukraine all have the capacity to put an end to the fighting."" Our ruling Obenshain said that when the Russians shot down a Korean passenger plane in 1983, Reagan rushed home from his Santa Barbara vacation. The actual timeline shows that even after the White House concluded that the Soviets were responsible, administration officials decided that the president would remain in California. It took about half a day for them to change their minds. Aside from a brief statement, it took Reagan several days before addressing the issue with the American public. In a practical sense, the delay was not long but there was more deliberation than Obenshain’s words would suggest.

CNN legal analyst: By 18, kids have killed over 100,000 people in video games
","The death of a Google executive at the hands of an escort he met online have pundits wondering: Is the digital age one of sex, lies and dark fantasies? To see the moral rupture created by technology, look no further than the reckless slaughtering on video games, said CNN legal analyst Mark O’Mara. O'Mara represented George Zimmerman, the Orlando-area man who shot and killed Trayvon Martin. ""The perceived anonymity of digital existence makes it much easier to sort of distance yourself for your own morality,"" said O’Mara on July 16, 2014 on CNN Tonight. ""It’s just what happens because it’s so much easier to be somebody you want to be but know you shouldn't be when you’re online. Literally, by the time a child is 18 years of age, they‘ve killed over 100,000 people in video games and other online things."" Whether video games lead to real-life violence has been a debate for decades. As for the virtual violence, we were struck by O’Mara’s claim that an 18-year-old has killed over 100,000 people in video games. We wanted to check it out. Shots in the dark While O’Mara’s delivery suggests we’d find our answer in some sort of academic journal, his spokesman told us the statistic was ""napkin calculation."" More realistically, it sounds like a guess. ""(He) may have underestimated that significantly, it could be less than 5 percent of what the real number may be,"" O’Mara spokesman Shawn Vincent said. ""The point is that young people are simulating murders, and witnessing thousands of them on TV."" We were unable to find any study or research that approximates the number of video kills of an 18-year-old, and experts in the field said no such research exists. The problems include the types of games children play, how often they play them, how they play them. Plus, while the vast majority of children play video games, not all do. ""There's absolutely no way to determine this -- it's too vague,"" said Entertainment Software Association spokesperson Dan Hewitt. ""It's all how a game is played. For example. Grand Theft Auto can be played from beginning to end without harming or ‘killing’ anyone. Same is true with many games. It's all in how an individual plays it and there's no way to even make an estimate."" From the gamer’s perspective So while it’s dangerous to make a broad generalization the way O’Mara did, we can get a sense of what’s happening among gamers who play shooting-style games. The take-away: Their virtual personas do a lot of killing. One of the best-selling gaming franchises, Halo, estimates that the first three games amassed 136 billion player-versus-player kills. We reached out to several players either through Facebook groups or through colleagues to hear about their personal stories. Pete Cruz, 22, has a total kill count of player-versus-player 52,459 on one Halo 3 game. He estimates that this is a pretty average or slightly above average count. Cruz has been playing the Halo games since 2004 and says his total kill count was ""easily 100,000"" when he was 18. ""More like 150,000 if not more,"" he said. ""That number can easily be reached during your teenage years or from 10 to 19 (years old)."" Jay Manning, 21, estimated he probably reached 100,000 kills in his first six months of playing. Reaching that count by the you’re 18, he agreed, is ""easy."" Govinda Sessa, 18, has a total kill count of 73,316 over 30 game days in Halo 4. Ben Stuart, 23, put these numbers in context: He averages about 10 to 15 kills per game and has played about 5 or 6 games daily since he was 10 years old. That adds up. Call of Duty, another popular shooting franchise, hasn’t released recent data since its newest game debuted, said spokesperson Kyle Walker. But from the start of the franchise in 2003 to its second newest game, players have ""respawned"" (come back to life after a player-inflicted death) 1.9 quadrillion times. That’s 15 zeroes. Marty Maldonado, 21, began playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 when he was 16. He estimates spending two or three hours daily on the game in high school, and says he probably reached 100,000 kills by the time he was 18. But Maldonado is wary of saying these kills were of people. ""You don't really see them as people, mainly because you're playing a game and you think of the avatar as an extension of the other person's ability,"" he said. ""The only time I would say I felt like I killed someone were emotional games that had good character development like the BioShock series or (the) nuke scene in Call of Duty 4."" Different keystrokes Halo and Call of Duty are both first-person shooting games, a category of video games that make up about a fifth of the market, according to a Entertainment Software Association report. All the gamers and experts we talked to point out that it’s hard to compare total kills. ""What’d you even consider a kill? Mario stomping? Call of Duty shooting?"" said PC Magazine writer David Murphy. In some categories -- action and sports game, for example, which take up about 22 percent and 15 percent of the market respectively -- killing is not even the point. The No. 2 best selling video game of 2012 was Madden NFL 13, a football game in which players aim for touchdowns not deaths. In Assassin’s Creed, a popular action-adventure franchise, the main gameplay involves storylines and missions. Though you do kill in the game, you don't really count the number in an open world game, said player Rahul Prakash. Even in shooting games, total kill counts don’t account for the many variables in video games and differences in players. Time spent on games, time frame per game, game goals, player age, player level, online or offline, single player versus multiplayer -- these factors all matter and are rarely accounted for, said Cruz. ""Depending on how that number is constructed, it can definitely lead to misinformation and misconstrue facts about video games,"" he said. The ruling O’Mara said, ""Literally, by the time a child is 18 years of age, they‘ve killed over 100,000 people in video games and other online things."" Literally, the stat is a ""napkin calculation."" Research doesn’t exist on the point and there are too many variables to affect how many people someone might have killed in video game. That said, a range of gamers told us that if you play shooting-style games in your teen years, you’re quite likely to kill 100,000 people or more. While that gives O’Mara’s statement some truth, the lack of definitive information makes this claim somewhat dodgy.

Hillary Clinton says economic stats were 100 times better under Bill Clinton than Ronald Reagan
","With the nation mired in a long, slow recovery from the Great Recession, the past tends to have a rosy glow. Republicans like to tout the halcyon days of President Ronald Reagan, while Democrats fondly remember the era of President Bill Clinton. During a recent interview on the Charlie Rose show on PBS, Hillary Clinton -- who had a front-row seat for the Bill Clinton era as first lady -- made clear her economic role model as she continues to weigh a 2016 presidential run. ""If I just were to compare Reagan’s eight years with Bill’s eight years, it’s like night and day in terms of the effects,"" Clinton said during the July 17, 2014, interview. ""The number of jobs that were created, the number of people lifted out of poverty, a hundred times more when Bill was president. And did policies have something to do with that? I would argue that they did."" Really? Were the Clinton years, statistically, 100 times better than the Reagan years? A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. The comparison is actually pretty fair. Both presidents entered office during a weak economic time and exited before the economy went into a downturn. We’ll analyze employment first, and then poverty. We looked at two different date ranges, each of which could plausibly be defined as the duration of their presidency. One was 1980 through 1988 for Reagan and 1992 to 2000 for Clinton. The other was 1981 through 1989 for Reagan and 1993 through 2001 for Clinton. For simplicity, we’ll only write below about one option -- the latter one. The patterns are broadly similar regardless of what range of years you use. Job creation For job creation, we looked at the two most common yardsticks for employment tracked by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics -- total nonfarm employment, and the unemployment rate. For consistency, we used January’s monthly figures for each year. During the eight years under Reagan, the number of employed people went up by 16.1 million, or an increase of 18 percent over the eight-year period. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of employed people went up by 22.9 million, or an increase of 21 percent over the eight-year period. So while both presidents did well, the number of employed people rose faster under Clinton, both in raw numbers and by percentage. What about the unemployment rate? Under Reagan, it fell from 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent -- a drop of 2.1 percentage points. Under Clinton, it fell from 7.3 percent to 4.2 percent -- a drop of 3.1 percentage points. So here, too, both presidents chalked up good marks over eight years, but Clinton’s record on job creation over Reagan was modestly superior. Poverty For poverty, we looked at figures from the U.S. Census Bureau, which has tracked poverty figures for decades. We looked at both raw numbers of people in poverty and the poverty rate. During the eight years under Reagan, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 294,000, or a drop in raw numbers of about 1 percent. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 6.5 million, or a drop in raw numbers of about 17 percent. So both presidents oversaw a decline in the raw numbers of people in poverty, but the decline was bigger under Clinton. Next, we looked at the poverty rate -- the percent of all Americans who are impoverished. During the eight years under Reagan, the poverty rate fell from 14 percent to 12.8 percent, or a decline of 1.2 percentage points. During the eight years under Clinton, the poverty rate fell from 15.1 percent to 11.7 percent, or a decline of 3.4 percentage points. So, once again, the poverty rate declined under both presidents, but the decline was bigger under Clinton. Was the improvement ‘a hundred times’ better under Clinton? Put it all together and it’s a vast exaggeration to say Clinton’s record is 100 times better than Reagan’s. Even allowing for some over-enthusiasm on Clinton’s part, the differences are fairly modest. The biggest gap comes from the percentage decrease in impoverished Americans. The decline in raw numbers under Clinton was 17 times greater than under Reagan. But the other metrics are closer. The poverty rate fell close to three times faster under Clinton; the unemployment rate fell 50 percent faster under Clinton; and the number of employed Americans rose 17 percent faster under Clinton. We did not hear back from Clinton’s camp. However, we would be skeptical of the argument that her claim was simply a harmless exaggeration for rhetorical effect. She posits a massive difference in economic improvement under Clinton as opposed to Reagan. In reality, both saw notable improvements, even though Clinton’s were stronger across the board. We also reviewed the video of the interview and didn’t detect any obvious sign that Clinton said it facetiously. Our ruling Clinton said the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton’s presidency was ""a hundred times"" what it was under President Ronald Reagan. Clinton’s record does outpace Reagan’s on the four statistical measures we looked at. But the differences are not like night and day, as her phrasing claims. Both presidents saw improvements, with Clinton’s being incrementally better -- not 100 times better. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jul/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-economic-stats-were-100-times/

Fewer wars, fewer people dying in wars now than in quite some time, Glenn Beck writer claims
","Armed conflict has been in the news this year: Syria, Iraq, Ukraine-Russia, and now Israel-Palestine. But on July 15’s Glenn Beck Program, head writer Stu Burguiere suggested that on the whole, the modern world is particularly peaceful. A caller got Beck gushing on the United States’ decision to bomb Nagasaki and Hiroshima to bring about the end of World War II and the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence. ""I love that it’s probably stopped a war between the United States and Russia,"" Beck said. ""We had a cold war instead of a hot war because we both knew, oh, if you push that button I’ll push that button."" Beck put the number of lives saved by the nuclear bomb at potentially ""hundreds of millions."" Burguiere chimed in, acknowledging that nuclear weapons are still plenty dangerous. Even so, he continued, ""so far, I don’t think you can look at it as anything other than a positive."" ""Violence around the world is dropping. There are less wars, there are less people dying in wars than there have been in quite some time. It’s odd to think about, but it’s true."" With violence making newspapers’ front page almost every day, we were surprised enough to check: Are the number of wars and the number of deaths from wars on the downswing? The big picture Burguiere was a little vague with his time frame, so we’re going to start broad and zoom in. Compared to prehistoric, pre-state, and even Medieval man, Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker argues, the world has become incredibly peaceful. ""Violence has been in decline for thousands of years,"" Pinker said in the Wall Street Journal, ""and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in the existence of our species."" ""The rate of documented direct deaths from political violence (war, terrorism, genocide and militias) in the past decade is an unprecedented few hundredths of a percentage point."" In his book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, Pinker attributes our species’ decline in violence to the creation of states, trade interests, the Enlightenment and the dearth of major interstate war since World War II. It’s worth noting that even though rates of violence are down, the exponential increase in population means that the absolute number of violent crimes and deaths every year is nowhere near an all-time low. ""Think about the vast loss of life in World War II,"" said Robert Epstein, professor of psychology at the University of the South Pacific. Epstein compared violent deaths to AIDS insofar as both were causes of death that were strictly behavioral. ""If we use the same logic with, let’s say malaria or polio or any other cause of death, that relatively speaking we’re doing better, I don’t think a lot of people would accept that. They’d want to know, is it possible to eradicate that."" Battle deaths After World War II -- and after the nuclear bombings Beck and Burguiere were discussing -- both the absolute number of direct deaths from war and the per capita rate of direct deaths dropped. Battle deaths are difficult to pin down precisely, but the Uppsala Conflict Data Program puts the number of battle deaths in 2013 at about 30,000.    According to the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which produced the graph above, there were between 557,000 and 851,000 battle deaths in 1950, the highest since the end of World War II. Despite some peaks and troughs, there have been fewer battle deaths over the last decade than any other 10-year average since World War II. ""The number of people killed in wars is close to its lowest point since 1946,"" Pinker said. ""There was a slight uptick in 2012, and I expect it will continue to rise a bit in 2013 and 2014 because of Syria and Iraq, but not nearly enough to bring us to the levels seen during the Chinese Civil War, Korea, Vietnam, India/Pakistan/Bangladesh, Iran-Iraq, USSR-Afghanistan, and the many now-quiescent regions of Africa."" The experts we spoke to generally understood deaths due to war to mean direct battle deaths, as applying a consistent standard to war deaths outside of battle is difficult. ""Direct deaths are the only ones that can be counted with confidence,"" wrote Pinker in Better Angels. By most measures, war deaths are lower now than they’ve been for most of the post-World War II period, even as burgeoning conflicts in the Middle East have driven the number of battle deaths up in 2012 and 2013. Defining war Burguiere said fewer people today are dying in wars, but what constitutes a war is somewhat up for debate. The definition of war that most political scientists use is a conflict with at least 1,000 battle casualties in a year, according to Joshua Goldstein, author of Winning the War on War. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program -- which Goldstein called ""the expert on battle deaths"" -- refer to conflicts that kill 25-999 people as ""armed conflicts,"" not wars. ""Interstate wars, between regular armies, have dropped to zero currently and have become much less frequent and also shorter over recent decades,"" Goldstein said. He acknowledged, though, that ""the world has slipped backward a bit in the last 5 years, mostly because of the war in Syria."" Armed conflicts have also seen a slight dip in recent years, although they’ve generally risen in frequency since World War II, even as they’ve become less fatal. There are other ways, though, to define war. Mark Harrison, in his paper ""Frequency of Wars,"" took an inclusive definition of war that includes even displays of force between countries. Based on this definition, as the number of countries has increased from less than 50 in 1870 to more than 180 today, the number of wars has also steadily increased. ""One way to think about this could be the difference between fire and friction,"" Harrison said. ""Burguiere says there are fewer fires and fire deaths, and this is true. Our work shows that there is increasing friction."" Pinker, Goldstein and Harrison all attributed the decrease in major armed conflict to factors other than nuclear deterrence, although they acknowledged it’s an open debate. In Winning the War on War, Goldstein attributes the decline to the United Nation’s international peacekeeping and the fall of Communism, and in Better Angels, Pinker points out that Democratic countries have never fought in a war against each other. Neither, too, have capitalist countries. Commerce is ""a game in which everybody can win,"" Pinker said. ""Though the relationship today between America and China is far from warm, we are unlikely to declare war on them or visa versa. Morality aside, they make too much of our stuff, and we owe them too much money."" Our ruling In the course of praising nuclear deterrence, Burguiere said, ""there are less wars, there are less people dying in wars than there have been in quite some time."" According to the most common definition of war -- an armed conflict with more than 1,000 battle deaths annually -- Burguiere is right, although other definitions exist. Battle deaths are also down since World War II. However, they have begun creeping up in the last couple of years, mostly because of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The record when it comes to ""people dying in wars"" generally is less clear, as is the role of nuclear deterrence. Those caveats -- that ""war"" and ""people dying in wars"" are fraught terms, and that recent Middle Eastern conflicts are increasing the number of battle deaths -- don’t detract much from the overall point that violence is down. We rate Burguiere’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/21/stu-burguiere/fewer-wars-fewer-people-dying-wars-now-quite-some/

Social media meme says Alan Greenspan said insecure workers 'serve the masters gladly'
","Amid a stubbornly slow economic recovery, a reader recently forwarded us a social media post taking aim at former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for using callous language about worker insecurity. The post features images of Greenspan and says: I am Alan And, I used to run the Federal Reserve. And, I actually said this: If the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society, because if workers are insecure they won't ask for wages, they won't go on strike, they won't call for benefits; they'll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that's optimal for corporations. The reader wondered if the five-time chairman of the United States’ central bank actually said something so dismissive about America’s economically left-behind. So did we. As it turns out, Greenspan didn’t say it. Instead, it's academic Noam Chomsky's take on something Greenspan said. And Greenspan and Chomsky couldn’t be more different ideologically. As a young man, Greenspan was a member of the inner circle of Ayn Rand, the libertarian thinker and novelist. (Rand would eventually stand with Greenspan when he was sworn in as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1974.) Greenspan was nominated for the Fed chairmanship by three Republican presidents (Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) as well as by Democrat Bill Clinton. Meanwhile, Chomsky is an influential academic linguist who’s at least as well known for his political views. They veer sharply left and are sometimes referred to as ""anarcho-syndicalist,"" a philosophy he’s described as promoting ""a very organized society, but organized from below by direct participation at every level, with as little control and domination as is feasible, maybe none."" So how did this misattribution happen? It emerged from remarks Chomsky made to the Adjunct Faculty Association of the United Steelworkers on Feb. 4, 2014, reprinted in transcript form in the February-March issue of CounterPunch. Here are excerpts from a section of the transcript where Chomsky discusses the issue of universities hiring non-tenure-track faculty: ""That’s part of the business model. It’s the same as hiring temps in industry or what they call ‘associates’ at Walmart -- employees that aren’t owed benefits. It’s a part of a corporate business model designed to reduce labor costs and to increase labor servility. When universities become corporatized ... they want to keep costs down and make sure that labor is docile and obedient. The way to do that is, essentially, temps. … ""This idea is sometimes made quite overt. So when Alan Greenspan was testifying before Congress in 1997 on the marvels of the economy he was running, he said straight out that one of the bases for its economic success was imposing what he called ‘greater worker insecurity.’ If workers are more insecure, that’s very ‘healthy’ for the society, because if workers are insecure they won’t ask for wages, they won’t go on strike, they won’t call for benefits; they’ll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that’s optimal for corporations’ economic health. At the time, everyone regarded Greenspan’s comment as very reasonable, judging by the lack of reaction and the great acclaim he enjoyed."" We looked at Greenspan’s Feb. 26, 1997, testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Here’s a portion: ""The performance of the U.S. economy over the past year has been quite favorable. … Continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. … Atypical restraint on compensation increases has been evident for a few years now, and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater worker insecurity. The willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well documented. The unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted even as the labor market, by all objective measures, tightened considerably."" Greenspan, in his testimony, then suggests technological change and international competition as possible reasons for worker insecurity, before noting that ""suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end. In other words, the relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because there is a limit to the value of additional job security people are willing to acquire in exchange for lesser increases in living standards."" Chomsky’s take on the substance of what Greenspan said seems reasonably on target. However, Greenspan’s tone is far different than Chomsky’s. Greenspan’s words are explanatory and analytical, displaying none of the sarcasm that Chomsky, or the creator of the Facebook post, ascribes to them -- especially the part about workers serving their masters ""gladly and passively."" Reached by email, Chomsky confirmed that he and other economists have periodically pointed to Greenspan’s 1997 testimony, including a reference in his book, Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy. Chomsky added, ""Don’t know anything about Facebook. I don’t use it."" Our ruling The meme says Greenspan said that ""if the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society"" because ""they'll serve the masters gladly and passively."" Those words actually come from a sarcastic critique of Greenspan’s words by Noam Chomsky, not from Greenspan himself.

Ed Gillespie's immigration reform position remains steady
","Republican Ed Gillespie was gung-ho about comprehensive immigration reform in June 2013 -- just days before the U.S. Senate passed the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" bill that would bolster border security and provide a pathway to citizenship for 12 million people who entered the country illegally. ""I don’t think that the Gang of Eight bill is a perfect bill, no one does,"" Gillespie said during an interview with Larry Kudlow on CNBC. ""But it is the right approach, and it can be perfected. This amendment on the border surge will help to do that. But at the end of the day, it’s good policy and it is good politics."" Now, let’s fast-forward to this year as Gillespie revs up his campaign to unseat Democrat Mark Warner in the U.S. Senate. The Republican-led House has refused to take up the immigration bill and Gillespie says that’s fine with him. ""It’s unlikely that it’s going to occur during an election year and, frankly, I don’t think it should at this point,"" he said in April. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, went a step further in a June 13 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. He said Gillespie opposes the bill and opposes citizenship for illegal immigrants. Warner’s campaign sent us the statements with a suggestion that his opponent’s position on comprehensive immigration reform has changed. That thought has been echoed by Bloomberg.com, which has written that Gillespie is taking ""a different stand"" on immigration this year. Logan says Gillespie’s stance has remained constant. So we decided to roll out the Flip-O-Meter and take a look. Gillespie in 2006 Immigration reform has long been impeded by a central debate: Many conservatives say the U.S. should focus on border control and enforcement of deportation laws; many liberals say policies should include a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who otherwise have exemplary records obeying U.S. laws. Gillespie for years has endorsed a compromise. Records shown that since at least 2006, he’s called for strong border control combined with a path toward legal U.S. residency -- not citizenship -- for immigrants who have obeyed laws since entering the country and are self-sufficient. Gillespie, in a 2006 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, wrote that those who came to the U.S. illegally ""should not be rewarded with citizenship,"" but added that ""a rational immigration policy that allows workers to enter and exit this country for temporary employment will make us more secure."" He wrote that an expanded visa program would ease the workload of law enforcement officials, expand tax rolls and provide needed workers in agriculture and technology. Gillespie, who had recently stepped down as chairman of the Republican National Committee, said a GOP compromise on immigration would be politically wise. ""The Republican Party cannot become an anti-immigration party,"" he wrote. ""Our majority rests too heavily on white voters, given that current demographic voting percentages will not allow us to hold our majority in the future."" Gillespie in 2013 Now, let’s analyze what Gillespie told CNBC’s Kudlow in 2013 about the Gang of Eight bill, which Warner supported. The legislation  -- sponsored by four Democratic and four Republican senators -- would give $3 billion to the Department of Homeland Security to improve border protection through drones, more fencing and additional customs agents. DHS would be required to achieve complete surveillance of the southwest border with Mexico and apprehend 90 percent of the people trying to cross illegally through major entry areas. Once those goals and a few others were met, most illegal immigrants would be eligible to start a 13-year path to citizenship. They could immediately seek ""Registered Provisional Immigrant Status"" that would allow them to legally stay in the country. After 10 years, they could seek a Green Card and, three years later, be eligible to apply for citizenship. The path would be shorter for people brought here illegally as children, known as ""Dreamers."" Gillespie was complimentary of an amendment in the bill that prioritized border control. He spoke again of the need for comprehensive immigration reform on policy and on political grounds. But Gillespie never endorsed the citizenship provisions in the bill. Kudlow did not bring up the subject, and Gillespie did not offer an opinion about it. While Gillespie said the bill was ""the right approach,"" he also offered hope ""it can be perfected"" without specifying how. So Gillespie did not contradict the position he laid out in greater detail years earlier. Gillespie 2014 Finally, let’s consider what Gillespie is saying this year. ""I do not support amnesty, and oppose granting citizenship to them, which would be unfair to those who have come here legally and played by the rules,"" he wrote on his website. ""And I don’t believe we should give one of the greatest privileges in the world—American citizenship—to those who are here by virtue of having broken our laws. ""At the same time, I do not believe that our nation will implement the mass deportation of 10-12 million people, so we need to come to terms with those who are here illegally now. It would be in the interest of both American citizens and those here illegally to be able to come forward and, after a series of processes (i.e., criminal background checks, payment of back taxes, assimilation, demonstration of self sufficiency), be issued new visas to be here legally."" Although Gillespie’s position remains steady, his enthusiasm for passing the Gang of Eight bill appears to have diminished. Last year, he said the legislation was ""good policy"" that should be ""perfected"" and approved. This year, Gillespie says though a spokesman that he would not have voted for the bill and thinks Congress should delay consideration of immigration reform until after the mid-term elections. Our ruling  Gillespie has remained steady in his longtime principles for immigration reform. They’re stated on his campaign website: increased border security and a creation of a system that would allow most illegal immigrants to obtain legal residency -- but not citizenship. There’s been a shift in Gillespie’s rhetoric on the sweeping Gang of Eight bill that’s become the lightning rod for immigration debate. Last year, he described the bill as ""good policy"" that should be amended and passed. This year, he says he would have voted against the legislation and that consideration of comprehensive reform should be delayed until after the elections. But the changed language doesn’t equate to a changed position. It’s not surprising that Gillespie says he would have voted against the Gang of Eight bill. The legislation, when it came up for vote on the Senate floor, hadn’t been amended. It contained a pathway to citizenship that Gillespie has consistently opposed.

Kerry: Ukrainian separatist 'bragged' on social media about shooting down Malaysia Flight 17
","John Kerry made a strong case Sunday tying Ukrainian separatists to the missile that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Kerry spoke on all the major networks about what he knows so far about MH 17, the Boeing 777 carrying nearly 300 people that was shot down over eastern Ukraine July 17. The evidence clearly points to Ukraine’s Russian separatists, who have already shot down 12 Ukrainian military planes, he said. Kerry’s cache of evidence included a flow of major weapons (including tanks and rocket launchers) from Russia to the rebels over the past month. And he says the Russians trained the rebels to use an SA-11 missile launcher like the one used to shoot down MH 17. Additionally, an SA-11 passed through the area where the launch originated in the past couple of days, but it did not belong to Ukraine. To top it off, the separatists have implicated themselves, Kerry claimed. Intelligence intercepted conversations among separatists talking about knocking down a plane. And one separatist leader allegedly bragged on social media about shooting down a plane. ""We know that very shortly (after the crash), separatists were bragging in the social media about having shot down a transport plane,"" Kerry said on Fox News Sunday. ""We know that the so-called defense minister of the People's Republic of Donetsk, Mr. Igor Strelkov, actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media."" While much of Kerry’s evidence relies on intelligence that the public can’t access, we can fact-check his claim that a rebel leader posted on social media about shooting down a plane. We quickly found this screenshot of a post from Strelkov’s social media profile -- allegedly the smoking gun -- that has made its way around the Internet since Thursday:  The post has since been deleted. But the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine -- which periodically saves versions of websites -- shows the post did appear on Strelkov’s page at one point, so we know it was it was a real post. But does it indicate that the rebels are behind the attack like Kerry said. First, some background. Who is Igor Strelkov? Igor Strelkov is the rebel commander of Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin forces and an alleged former Russian intelligence agent. His real name is Igor Girkin (Strelkov is Russian for ""gunman""), and he’s also called ""Igor the Terrible."" Strelkov is a shadowy figure. He is a veteran of the Russian military, having fought in post-Soviet conflicts in Transnistria, Serbia and Chechnya, according to the New York Times. Kiev leadership believes Strelkov currently works for Russian military intelligence -- taken by some as proof of Russia’s assistance in the separatist uprising, according to BBC reports. Strelkov last legally crossed into Ukraine from Russia on Feb. 26 of this year. In an interview with the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, he admitted to participating in the conflicts in Crimea in the spring and in Slovyansk in April. There, he was named the commander of the rebel forces of the Donetsk People's Republic -- the separatists’ self-proclaimed state in eastern Ukraine. The New York Times describes him as an ""iron-fisted"" solo operator, who has openly criticized the Kremlin for not providing aid to the rebels. Strelkov wrote for the right-wing Russian nationalist newspaper Zavtra in the 1990s, and he is a war re-enactment enthusiast. Bloggers have discovered photos of him dressed in period military costumes. What do we know about his post? The U.S. State Department confirmed that the post pictured above is the one Kerry was referring to in his statement on Fox. The post comes from Strelkov’s profile on VKontakte (VK), Russia’s version of Facebook. This is a translation of the post, according to the Ukraine Crisis Media Center: 17.07.2014 17:50 (Moscow time) In the region of Torez AN-26 plane has been shot, it is somewhere near the ‘Progress’ mine. We have warned them – not to fly ‘in our sky.’ Here is video-proof of yet another ‘bird fall.’ The bird has fallen behind the (waste heap), it missed the residential quarters. Peaceful citizens were not hurt.  The post also included two videos showing some sort of explosion from a distance that are similar to other videos of the MH 17 aftermath. One of the videos is still on YouTube. Supporting the idea that the post was referring to MH 17, it went up at 5:50 p.m. local time, which was about a half hour after MH 17 went down. It says the plane went down in Torez, which is just a few miles south of the MH 17 crash site. The post says, though, that the rebels shot down an AN-26, which is a military transport plane about one-third the length of a Boeing 777. (People in the alleged leaked audio of intercepted conversations also mention confusion over whether the downed plane was a civilian or AN-26.) Separatists had recently shot down at least two transport planes. And the post is no longer on VK -- leading Kerry and others to the conclusion that it was deleted after Strelkov realized that it was a civilian plane, not a transport. But Strelkov denies involvement in the post. In a later VK post, translated for Forbes, Strelkov said the announcement about the transport plane going down was not an official one: ""ATTENTION. This announcement declared that the news of the downing of the AN-26 was not official but came from residents and militia members on the scene. The only official announcements are published under the banner: Strelkov INFORMS. In other words, Strelkov asks his readers to forget the earlier announcement of the successful downing of a fascist Ukrainian plane."" Later, he posted that Donetsk supports an objective investigation but denies involvement in the missile launch and instead blames the Ukrainian military. Additionally, some separatists in Donetsk told Max Seddon, a BuzzFeed reporter, that Streklov’s VK page is a fake made by fans. But of course, the separatists have an incentive to distance themselves from any evidence tying them to an action that killed 300 civilians. Our ruling Kerry said, ""(Strelkov) posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media."" We know that a post appeared on Strelkov’s social media profile bragging about shooting down a transport plane close to the MH 17 crash site. In a subsequent post, Strelkov said the information passed along came not from him directly, but from militia members on the scene. He said the information was unofficial and incorrect. It’s impossible to know with certainty Strelkov's role in the post, or when the post was pulled, but we do know that the posts come from within the separatist movement -- as Strelkov himself said. The evidence is largely on Kerry's side, though there are some points that are unclear.

"['Labor', 'Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Bloggers']","
Bloggers claim the feds sued a company for requiring workers to speak English
","In the fall of 2012, Wisconsin Plastics, Inc., a Green Bay-area manufacturer, fired 22 people, most of them Hmong or Hispanic workers. The action led to a lawsuit against the company by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which argues the workers’ civil rights were violated. The agency sued June 9, 2014 after its mediation efforts failed. The lawsuit alleges that the workers were fired based on 10-minute observations that marked them down for their English skills, even though those skills were not needed to perform their jobs. Several weeks after the suit was filed, the case caught fire. Fox News did a piece on it, criticizing the government’s case. And a series of conservative blogs slammed the agency’s actions,  including FreePatriot.org. A PolitiFact Wisconsin reader came across that post and asked us to examine it. The posting carried this headline: ""Obama administration suing Wisconsin company for forcing employees to speaking English."" Yes, it said ""speaking English."" But we’re not here to check typos. In any case, the claim is a good one for a fact check: Is the Obama Administration suing a Wisconsin company ""for forcing employees to speak English."" We started with the author of the FreePatroit item, Tim Walker, who blogs from the Philippines. In an email, he said the sole source for his item was RightWingNews.com which had posted an item with this headline: ""Feds suing county in Wisconsin for requiring workers to speak English."" (That headline is actually incorrect, because a business is being sued, not a county.) The Rightwingnews.com item linked to an item from a site called Weasel Zippers, which had reposted an item from Judicial Watch that carried this headline: ""U.S. sues American co. for requiring workers to speak English.""  In each case, the bloggers claim the EEOC lawsuit is about workers forced to speak English -- what the agency terms an ""English only"" case. These cases revolve around situations where workers are required to speak English at work or when interacting with customers. But the EEOC says the bloggers got it wrong. So does the company. What the agency says When we contacted the EEOC, agency attorney Cesar del Peral said the case is about the rights of the employees being violated because they had been subjected to ""a sham performance improvement plan"" that pointed out a lack of language skills. The complaint says that the firings violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects employees from discrimination based on national origin, which includes the linguistic characteristics of a national origin group. ""The company based its decisions on English language fluency,"" said del Peral, who noted that some of the dismissed employees had been with the company for seven to 10 years and had previously received satisfactory performance evaluations. Del Peral said the case was different from other actions that the agency has taken against companies who have ""English only"" rules. He noted the suit doesn’t allege that ""anyone was forced to speak English or that anyone refused."" The company’s side After the blog postings started to appear, the company issued a July 2, 2014 news release that criticized the posts and said language was not a factor in the firings. ""The recent story regarding the EEOC lawsuit filed against Wisconsin Plastics, Inc. is sensationalizing a lawsuit that has no merit,"" said Bruce Wendt, vice president of operations, in the statement. ""WPI is proud to have a diversified workforce and have interpreters on staff to accommodate the language needs of our workforce."" The statement also said: ""The reality is the decision to lay off employees in the fall of 2012 was made based on the employees’ overall comparative skills, behaviors and job performance over time."" So, where did the English-only idea picked up by the bloggers come from? Once we plowed through numerous web sites to the source, we discovered a sloppy EEOC news release. The agency’s June 9, 2014 release included this statement: ""Our experience at the EEOC has been that so-called 'English only' rules and requirements of English fluency are often employed to make what is really discrimination appear acceptable,"" said John C. Hendrickson, EEOC Chicago regional attorney. ""But superficial appearances are not fooling anyone,"" he said. ""When speaking English fluently is not, in fact, required for the safe and effective performance of a job, nor the successful operation of the employer's business, requiring employees to be fluent in English usually constitutes discrimination on the basis of national origin -- and thus violates federal law."" When asked about the news release, Hendrickson backed away from the statement about English Only rules in the case. The ""EEOC does not contend that Wisconsin Plastics either has an ‘English Only Rule’ or that the charging parties were terminated because of the failure or refusal to obey an such rule. Perhaps my reference to English Only Rules was therefore not helpful,"" he wrote in an email. The statement continued: ""Our contention is that they were terminated on account of their national origin and that termination followed some sort of test of their fluency in English -- notwithstanding the fact that fluency in English was not required for the performance of their jobs (as evidenced by their prior successful performance of those jobs)."" Our rating Various blogs said that the EEOC sued Wisconsin Plastics because the company ""forced employees to speak English."" That’s not what the lawsuit says. The complaint says the company violated workers’ civil rights by subjecting them to a sham performance exam that focused on English language skills. Even the company says the bloggers, while trying to sympathize with it, took matters too far and sensationalized the lawsuit.

Barbara Comstock said millions of Virginians lost insurance because of Obamacare
","Republican Barbara Comstock is offering herself as antidote to Obamacare in her campaign for the 10th District congressional seat in Northern Virginia. Comstock says Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, should be repealed. On her website, she claimed that the law ""already has caused millions of hardworking Virginians to lose their health insurance and have their well-being and financial health threatened."" We hadn’t heard that statistic before and wondered if it could be correct that -- in a state with about 8 million people -- ""millions"" had already lost their insurance because of the law. We asked Comstock’s campaign for proof and were told it made an error. ""Our website said ‘Virginians’ when it should have read ‘Americans’,"" Johanna Persing, the communications director for Comstock’s campaign, emailed. Comstock changed the wording on her site. There’s no doubt that millions of Americans in the individual market -- those who purchase health insurance themselves or are covered by small employers -- were notified last fall that their policies were being discontinued because they don’t fulfill minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare. No one could say exactly how many policies were cancelled, but media reports estimated the number was at least 4 million. The embarrassed White House offered a fix that allowed many of the disqualified plans to exist for another year. Some people were moved to a different plan by their insurance companies or got coverage on state exchanges created by the health care law. But Comstock’s original claim raises an interesting question: How many Virginians received notices last year that their policies were ending? Virginia doesn’t keep those figures, said Ken Schrad, a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission. Doug Gray, the executive director with the Virginia Association of Health Plans, estimates 850,000 Virginians who bought their plans individually or got coverage through a small employer were notified their plans were discontinued. Gray stressed, however, that those people were given a choice to switch to a new plan or to renew their original policy for another year. A majority of them chose to keep their original policy through this year, he said. Our ruling Comstock’s website said that millions of Virginians lost their health insurance because of Obamacare. Her campaign acknowledged it erred and, after our inquiry, changed its site to say millions of ""Americans"" lost their health insurance. While we applaud the campaign’s admission of a mistake, that does not unplug the Truth-O-Meter. There’s no exact count on how many Virginians were notified last year that their plans would be ended because of Obamacare. A state health insurance lobbyist estimates the number at 850,000. But these people still had options; they or their employer could renew their old plans for another year or switch to new coverage. So Comstock’s claim about millions of Virginians losing coverage was unfounded and we rate it False.",/factchecks/2014/jul/20/barbara-comstock/barbara-comstock-said-millions-virginians-lost-ins/
"['Rhode Island', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Brett Smiley']","
Providence mayoral candidate Brett Smiley says there are roughly 20,000 guns sold yearly in R.I.
","As the gun debate continues to roil the nation and Rhode Island, Providence mayoral candidate Brett Smiley wants to take guns out of the hands of criminals. But how? Smiley, one of five Democrats vying for the seat, proposes  a supplemental 10-percent statewide sales tax ""on the approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island and on ammunition purchases."" That in turn, would produce revenue to support community anti-violence efforts and other initiatives to part criminals from their guns. Smiley unveiled his ""Safest City Plan"" at a December press conference.  A seven-page campaign brochure he mailed to voters in the last week of June includes a version of that plan that reiterates his gun tax proposal. [A bill sponsored on Smiley’s behalf to impose the 10-percent statewide surplus gun tax failed to make it out of committee in the last General Assembly session]. So are there 20,000 guns sold a year in Rhode Island? First, let’s look at the laws for buying a gun in the state: Statutes 11-47-35 and 11-47-35.2. Anyone wanting to do so must first fill out a state purchase application form with a Federal Firearms Licensee - i.e., a licensed gun shop. The application is run through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data base. The licensed firearms dealer sends a copy of the application to local or state police, and the attorney general’s department. They must later destroy the copies if no disqualifying information is found. If approved, you must wait seven days before you buy your firearm - or firearms (more than one gun can be purchased per application.) Smiley bases his claim on NICS Firearm Background Checks data.     Here are the NICS statistics from 2010-2014: 2010: 14,835 2011: 17,271 2012: 24,050 2013: 26,666 2014: 10,140 as of June 30 ""Looking just at the data for NICS Firearm Background Checks, you see that the Rhode Island figure has been steadily increasing in recent years, with 24,050 in 2012 and 26,666 in 2013,"" campaign manager Josh Block wrote in an email. ""It's also worth noting that these figures are for the number of people receiving background checks, and multiple guns purchased at the same time would still yield only one background check. Given these figures, it's clear that saying ""approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island"" is an accurate, and frankly even a relatively conservative, estimate,"" Block wrote. He said that number refers specifically to the number of guns sold. Federal law prohibits the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from creating a federal registry of gun transactions. The FBI must destroy all approved gun purchase records within 24 hours.   ""ATF does not gather or collect information pertaining to the number of guns sold,"" says Debora A. Seifert, public information officer for the ATF Boston field division. The FBI notes that the NICS Firearm Background Checks ""do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale."" OK. But do those NICS statistics represent an approximate measure, as Smiley claims? Short of tallying every licensed firearms dealer’s register in the state, no one can say precisely how many guns are sold every year in Rhode Island. We turned to the Rhode Island State Police and attorney general’s office for some answers. We also called more than half a dozen local gun shop owners. In different ways, they suggested that, if anything Smiley’s estimated number is on the low side. Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Peter F. Kilmartin, gave us a breakdown for the years 2010 through 2013, of the number of applications approved and denied. The data reflect a consistent ratio between approvals and denials: on average, fewer than 1 percent are denied. State police Major James M. Manni interprets the NICS data the same way as Smiley. ""Based on the number of NICS checks done - that’s factual that there are approximately 20,000 firearms sold in Rhode Island or even more"" every year, said Manni, state police commander of inspectional services. Take the 2013 figure of 26,666 firearms background checks for example, Manni says. ""Does that mean there were 26,000 guns sold? There could be more. You can buy multiple firearms"" on one application, however he notes that ""the vast majority are single sales."" Manni also noted that the numbers of applicants who are either denied a purchase -- or who ultimately decide not to buy a firearm -- are very small. He said that In 2014, ""in a six-month period, there were 10,140 NICS firearms background checks. So 2014 is on track for about 20,000"" of those checks.   Gun shop owners we spoke with also confirmed that very few applicants change their minds about buying a gun during the 7-day waiting period. And they confirmed that it’s impossible to determine precisely how many guns are purchased in the state each year. John Francis, owner of Competition Shooting Supplies, in Pawtucket, said  "" Unless you went to each dealer, and had each dealer count through our records … there’s no way to know."" Our ruling Brett Smiley says there are ""approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island.""   There is no official registry of yearly gun sales in Rhode Island; state law prohibits it. But state and federal law enforcement officials cite the same statistics that Smiley does to back up his claim. Gun shop owners, and state police tell us that the majority of applications represent single sales. Because Smiley was careful to approximate the number, we rate his claim as True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/20/brett-smiley/providence-mayoral-candidate-brett-smiley-says-the/
"['Georgia', 'Ethics', 'Vernon Jones']","
Ethics complaint doesn't equal wrongdoing
","DeKalb County has more than its share of alleged misdeeds by elected officials. Ethics complaints are pending against all six sitting DeKalb County commissioners and interim CEO Lee May. Suspended CEO Burrell Ellis is slated to go on trial in September to face felony charges he shook down county vendors for campaign contributions. Amid that backdrop, Vernon Jones, the former county CEO, is complaining that interim Sheriff Jeff Mann faces his own integrity problems. The pair traded several such attacks at a recent Atlanta Press Club debate, which airs at 10:30 a.m. Sunday on Georgia Public Broadcasting. One volley from Jones drew a direct line between ongoing conduct questions and Mann: ""His senior executives, and he himself, have ethics complaints against them (that) they are using county employees to campaign during county time. That’s an indictable offense."" Given the winner of the runoff race Tuesday will serve out former Sheriff Tom Brown’s term through 2016, the AJC Truth-O-Meter jumped quickly. First, know that Mann protested in the debate that he knew of no pending ethics complaints against him. He also denied any wrongdoing. So has Jones, after a special grand jury last year recommended that he be investigated on allegations of bid rigging during his eight years as CEO. The question of an ethics complaint, though, is easy to answer because DeKalb has a Board of Ethics. State law grants the board the power to examine complaints that elected officials or county workers have violated the code of ethics – and remove them from office or fire them if allegations are deemed flagrant enough. DeKalb reinvigorated the board last year, amid the ongoing scandals, but the body has yet to take such drastic action on any of 18 pending complaints. County records show two of those complaints relate to Mann. On June 25, the clerk to the County Commission forwarded both complaints from Rhonda Taylor, a former Sheriff’s Department employee, to the ethics board’s attorney. Taylor complains that Mann forced her to work on his campaign and that the department’s human resources director, Xernia Fortson, abused her during that work. Similar allegations surfaced last month, but no ethics complaints were filed in that case. At the time, Mann released an email he sent in March to the department. It reads in part that working on campaigns at work is prohibited. The ethics board attorney, and the board itself, have yet to review Taylor’s complaints, Chairman John Ernst said. That’s because the board last met June 24, the day before her complaints were filed. Procedure calls for the board attorney to review complaints for presentation to the board during meetings, to decide whether the body has jurisdiction to investigate and act. In the sheriff’s case, that jurisdiction is in doubt. The board is given authority over elected commissioners, the CEO and workers, as well as appointed county board members. But it is specifically excluded from oversight over the district attorney, solicitor and most court officials, such as judges and clerks from State and Superior Court. The question is whether the sheriff – like the DA and judges, an elected office enshrined in the state Constitution – falls in the first or second category. ""The (board) attorney is expected to tell us at our meeting if we have jurisdiction,"" Ernst said. Only if the board has and accepts jurisdiction at that session, scheduled for Aug. 14, would the board send Mann and Fortson notice that it plans to investigate. The question of an indictment is a criminal matter that would fall to the DA’s office, not the ethics board, to pursue. District Attorney Robert James would not comment on whether his office is looking into Taylor’s allegations. It’s worth noting that James persuaded a grand jury to indict Ellis last year on similar charges, of having county employees do campaign work on taxpayer time. Far more clear is the fact that at least one ethics complaint has been lodged against Mann, as Jones claims. Anyone can file a complaint against most elected officials and county workers in DeKalb, though. There is real uncertainty about whether the county’s Board of Ethics has jurisdiction over the constitutionally elected sheriff. So while the statement contains a lot of literal truth, it lacks a good deal of context to fully understand how ethics complaints work.

"['Georgia', 'Jeff Mann']","
DeKalb one of the nation's best sheriff's offices?
","The DeKalb County battle to replace Sheriff Tom Brown is a rare local political fight this year. And it cries out for fact checks. Brown stepped down in March to focus on his unsuccessful race to unseat U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson. Former DeKalb County CEO Vernon Jones and Jeff Mann, Brown’s former chief deputy who became interim sheriff last spring, beat back six other candidates in May’s nonpartisan special election. Whoever wins Tuesday will fill out Brown’s unexpired term. Jones and Mann have appeared together recently only once, in a debate taped to air at 10:30 a.m. Sunday on Georgia Public Broadcasting. Each candidate made claims about the other at the session. But Mann focused more on his tenure with Brown and their work to professionalize the department. At the GPB debate, Mann implied that DeKalb has been recognized in recent years for having one of the best sheriff’s departments in the nation. ""We have received the National Sheriff’s Association Triple Crown distinction,"" Mann said. ""We are in the top 1 percent of sheriff’s offices in this nation."" Those are bold claims anywhere. But they especially set the AJC Truth-O-Meter in action given corruption investigations, indictments and convictions that ended the careers of three DeKalb sheriffs between 1972 and 2000. All that happened before Sidney Dorsey, the defeated incumbent sheriff, ordered the assassination of winning candidate Derwin Brown just days before he was to take office in 2000. The department has had no major scandals in recent years. Some observers of DeKalb’s history find that fact remarkable in itself.   The National Sheriffs’ Association confirms that DeKalb did receive its Triple Crown honor in 2008 under Brown. The award recognizes those departments that have earned simultaneous accreditation from three agencies: The Commission on the Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies, which sets standards on the law enforcement function of the department whose main roles are to protect the courthouse and run the jail. The American Correctional Association's Commission on Accreditation for Corrections, which lays out policies and rules governing hiring practices and staffing in the department. The National Commission on Correctional Healthcare, which focuses on the health care aspect of running the jail. Each agency has its own standards and requires a sheriff’s office to submit files and submit to site visits to confirm compliance. Meeting the standards generally requires thousands of dollars and a significant time investment. The ACA accreditation, for instance, takes at least 18 months to complete. ""To get all three is a significant accomplishment,"" said Fred Wilson, the NSA’s director of operations. ""It shows a commitment to and an intent to achieve high standards."" The NSA counts about 39,000 sheriff’s offices nationwide and lists 51 agencies that have achieved the Triple Crown. That would make DeKalb among the 1 percent to earn that honor. Wilson said DeKalb and other award winners would benefit from lower insurance costs connected to the distinction. So a focus on professionalization can minimize liability for taxpayers. But does it mean those sheriff’s offices are the best? Consider that also on the Triple Crown list is the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office, which earned the achievement in 2003 under then-Sheriff Jacqueline Barrett. But faulty jail locks, understaffing and other problems have prolonged a nearly decade-old lawsuit over jail conditions in Fulton. The litigation has cost taxpayers more than $200 million, including bills for renovations and outsourcing inmates. Being plagued with those kinds of problems can sometimes be a function of size, said Frank V. Rotondo, the executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, which does not handle sheriffs’ standards. But for any department, earning accreditation is not a silver bullet, he added. ""It certainly doesn’t mean you’ll never have problems,"" Rotondo said. ""It really says you’ve established you will meet a very high set of standards, to try to preclude problems."" That means the distinction works both ways. So Mann was accurate to claim DeKalb had achieved a rare accomplishment. That honor can have financial benefits for taxpayers but not protect them entirely from big expenses associated with improving operations. Mann’s statement certainly contains an element of truth but overstates the significance of the award. We rate Mann’s claim as Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/19/jeff-mann/dekalb-one-nations-best-sheriffs-offices/

Were 12,808 people in Oregon arrested for marijuana-related crimes in 2012?

The analysis:
 
As part of its campaign to persuade Oregonians to support legal recreational marijuana, New Approach Oregon has set out to highlight the cost of policing existing marijuana laws.
 
The group claims that in 2012, the latest statistics available, 12,808 people were arrested in Oregon for marijuana crimes. Here's one of the examples, from a ""Myth vs. Fact"" section on the group's website:
 
""Myth:  Most of the statistics of marijuana 'arrests and citations' are simple citations. They are like speeding or not signaling the right way. They take very little resources.
 
""Reality: More than half of the drug-related arrests made in Oregon are for marijuana. (Source: Oregon State Police, page 4-10). In 2012, the most recent year for which data is available, 21,856 people were arrested for drug crimes, and 12,808 of them were for marijuana.""
 
We emailed Lt. Gregg Hastings, the Oregon State Police spokesman, to ask for a breakdown of numbers on marijuana offenses in 2012.
 
He responded with statistics and a link to the 2012 Oregon Annual Uniform Crime Report, which has comprehensive crime numbers. A table with the heading ""Statewide Drug Law Arrests by Type of Drug and Activity - 2012"" shows, for marijuana, the number New Approach Oregon cited: 12,808.
 
But Hastings noted in his email that 10,054 of those people were cited for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana -- ""a violation (but) not a criminal offense.""
 
""It is important to note,"" he continued, ""that enforcement action in the case of a 'violation' is handled by the issuance of a citation, similar to a traffic citation for speeding or not wearing a safety belt. Someone cannot be taken into custody and lodged in jail for a violation offense.""
 
In other words, Hastings said, those 10,054 were cited, not arrested. That leaves 2,754 people arrested for marijuana crimes in 2012, not 12,808.
 
The 10,054 figure is also in the state report, in a row listing those found with less than an ounce of marijuana.
 
So why is the figure for violations listed under an ""arrests"" heading? Hastings, after consulting with a state police researcher, said Oregon's report is part of the FBI's national Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which includes information from more than 18,000 agencies nationwide.
 
Each state must use the FBI's reporting requirements, which have only one field for ""arrested, cited, referred, or summoned."" Oregon separately tracks whether marijuana offenses involved more or less than an ounce, and includes that in another place in the report.
 
On July 14, 2014, we called Peter Zuckerman, spokesman for New Approach Oregon and a former news reporter who worked at The Oregonian from 2007 to  2009. He pointed to the Oregon Uniform Crime Report and the ""arrests"" wording. Told about Hasting's comments, he said he would look into the numbers.
 
In an email later that day, he stood by the 12,808 figure, saying it was the most accurate available. He said violations can technically be ""noncustodial arrests,"" a term police sometimes use to describe when someone is stopped but not detained.
 
By then, Hastings had explained to Zuckerman why the 12,808 figure was incorrect. In emails shared by Zuckerman, Hastings wrote on July 7, 2014: ""I want to make sure it is clear to you that Possession of less than an Ounce of Marijuana is a violation in Oregon, not a crime. A violation is only handled by issuance of citation (similar to a traffic citation) and someone cannot be taken into custody for a violation. Even though it is listed as an 'arrest' in this report, it is not a 'custodial arrest.'""
 
On July 8, Hastings sent Zuckerman the legal definition of an arrest in Oregon: ""to place a person under actual or constructive restraint or to take a person into custody for the purpose of charging that person with an offense.""
 
Over multiple emails and phone calls to PolitiFact Oregon from July 14-17, 2014, Zuckerman continued to quibble over the definition of ""arrest."" He sometimes acknowledged that the 12,808 figure is incorrect but other times said ""if"" it's wrong, it's the fault of Oregon State Police.
 
He noted that people can be arrested for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana if they're near a school or on parole but did not provide statistics to show what effect, if any, that would have on the 12,808 figure. Hastings said parole violations would be counted elsewhere and that possessing less than an ounce of pot near a school would not necessarily result in an arrest. He also said he doesn't hear of such arrests often.
 
Ultimately, Zuckerman said New Approach Oregon should not be held responsible for promoting the number because it relied on a credible source - the state police - and followed up when the number seemed inflated.
 
""If it turns out the state police issued a misleading crime statistics report because of a communications problem they have with the FBI, and then gave me bad information about custodial vs. noncustodial arrest, that's not our fault,"" Zuckerman wrote. ""It's unreasonable to think we would or could have known that.""
 
The claim remained on the organization's website as of Friday afternoon.
 
The ruling: New Approach Oregon claims 12,808 people were arrested in 2012 for marijuana-related offenses, citing a ""Drug Law Arrests"" listing in Oregon's Annual Uniform Crime Report. State police spokesman Lt. Gregg Hastings told PolitiFact Oregon and New Approach spokesman Peter Zuckerman that the number includes 10,054 people who were cited - but not arrested -- for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana, leaving the actual number of arrests in 2012 at 2,754. While the way the number is listed in the state report is confusing, officials have clarified the record. Citing it any other way earns it a rating of False. Thoughts? Questions?
