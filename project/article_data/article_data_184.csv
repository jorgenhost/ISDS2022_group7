Senate candidate Mark Kirk says rival gave mobsters bank loans
","In a mud-slinging fest in the race for President Barack Obama's old Illinois U.S. Senate seat, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, the Republican candidate, has hammered Democratic opponent Alexi Giannoulias for his tenure working as a senior loan officer for his family's Broadway Bank.

In a Kirk campaign TV ad called ""Risky,"" the announcer says, ""At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed.""

We decided to weigh in because this has been the most frequent attack on Giannoulias. And because we like the nicknames.

Let's start with Michael ""Jaws"" Giorango. He was convicted in 1991 of federal bookmaking charges in Chicago. His business with Broadway Bank began long before Giannoulias joined the bank as vice president and a senior loan officer, a job he held from 2002 to 2006.

But according to a March 2, 2010, story in the Chicago Tribune -- which has done much of the investigative heavy-lifting here -- Giorango and his new partner, Demitri Stavropoulos, came to the bank in mid 2004, and during a 14-month period when Giannoulias was a senior loan officer, secured about $20 million in new loans. As Broadway was financing land deals in Chicago, Florida, California and South Carolina, Stavropoulos in 2005 began a two-year sentence on a felony conviction for running a multi-state bookmaking ring, while Giorango served time for promoting a nationwide prostitution scheme, the Chicago Tribune found.

In July 2009, Broadway Bank filed foreclosure lawsuits seeking to recoup $12.9 million in defaulted loans made to the pair. So there's no question that these were ""risky"" loans, as the ad put it.

But what was Giannoulias' role in these loans? He was a senior loan officer at the bank at the time, but there's no evidence he approved them.

In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Giannoulias' older brother, Demetris Giannoulias, the bank's president and CEO, said he established Broadway's relationship with Giorango in the mid 1990s. And Alexi Giannoulias maintains that throughout his association with the bank, the client relationship with Giorango was managed by Alexi’s father and brother.

""In a case like this, where Alexi had no role in managing the client relationship, his responsibilities were more administrative, like getting appraisals ordered and loan documents prepared, coordinating with attorneys, and preparing commitment letters,"" said Matt McGrath, a spokesman for the Giannoulias campaign.

Initially, Giannoulias downplayed his relationship with Giorango as someone he had met at the bank a few times. But in April, Giannoulias said he traveled to Miami to inspect property the bank had financed for Giorango and met with him there, the Tribune reported.

In addition to Giorango, the other two ne'er-do-wells pictured in the Kirk ad are former state Sen. John D'Arco and Boris Stratievsky.

D'Arco -- convicted of federal corruption charges -- came into play because his name appeared in legal documents in connection with a Giorango company that purchased the Lorraine Hotel in Miami Beach. According to a 2006 story in Crain's Chicago Business, however, Broadway Bank released a statement saying that D’Arco's name does not appear on mortgage papers, ""has never been a loan applicant, recipient, co-signer, guarantor or customer"" of Broadway, and does not hold an ownership share in the hotel deal.

According to Giannoulias' spokesman McGrath, ""the Giorango loans included money that went to the purchase of the Lorraine Hotel in Miami in 2001, a land deal which state Sen. John D'Arco was involved in with Giorango."" Giannoulias, however, ""joined the bank in 2002 after graduating from law school, so this transaction predated his time there.""

Which brings us to reputed Russian mobsters Lev and Boris Stratievsky. According to a March 13, 2010, story in the Chicago Sun-Times, Giannoulias signed off on $20 million in loans to the father and son. According to McGrath, Giannoulias was not on the loan committee that approved the loans and he did not manage the bank's relationship with them. More importantly, McGrath correctly noted, Lev and Boris ""Half Dollar"" Stratievsky had no criminal background at the time of the loans. Boris Stratievsky pleaded guilty in May 2008 to federal money-laundering charges, and Lev has since died. ""Even a criminal background check wouldn't have turned anything up,"" McGrath said. So it would be incorrect to say, as the ad did, that Stratievsky was a ""convicted mobster"" when Broadway Bank made him a loan. One last point. The ad says ""At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed."" The bank did collapse. On April 23, 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that Broadway Bank was closed by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. According to a press release, ""the FDIC and MB Financial Bank, National Association entered into a loss-share transaction on $878.4 million of Broadway Bank's assets."" And the FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be $394.3 million. The ad, however, suggests that risky loans to mobsters caused the bank collapse, and that's a big stretch. More accurately, the bank invested heavily in construction and development and could not weather the collapse of the real estate market. The losses sustained in loans made to Giorango while Giannoulias was a senior loan officer, while substantial, were a relative drop in the bucket in the overall scheme of the bank's woes. In summary, D'Arco's involvement involved a loan that predated Giannoulias' time at Broadway Bank. Stratievsky had not been charged with anything when Broadway made loans to him. As for Giorango, his relationship with Broadway Bank began long before Giannoulias came on board. But as the Chicago Tribune detailed, the bank made Giorango an additional $20 million in new loans while Giannoulias was a senior loan officer. There's no evidence Giannouias approved the loans, but he did some work on them. Still, we think it's awfully misleading to suggest losses on risky loans to convicted felons led to the bank's demise (though they certainly didn't help). In all, we think that all shakes out to a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966D7900>],/factchecks/2010/jul/08/mark-kirk/senate-candidate-mark-kirk-says-rival-gave-mobster/

Alexi Giannoulias says Kirk mixed politics and military service
","A race for President Barack Obama's old Illinois U.S. senate seat features enough negative attacks to keep an army of fact-checkers busy.Democrat Alexi Giannoulias' go-to dig has been numerous misstatements made by his Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, about his military record.An ad entitled ""On and On"" from the Giannoulias campaign hits on a number of them rapid-fire -- splicing Kirk's words with TV news commentary and print media reports calling Kirk out for misstatements. The idea is to paint Kirk as a ""typical Washington politician"" who cannot be trusted.Kirk has copped to misspeaking and being ""careless"" with facts about his military records. We'll discuss each of the misstatements cited in the Giannoulias ad briefly before delving more deeply into one of the most recent and controversial claims in the ad, that, ""He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.""Before we get started, though, here's a little on Kirk's military history. He has served in the Naval Reserve for 21 years as an intelligence officer, and currently holds the rank of commander. In 1999, Kirk was called into active duty and deployed to Aviano, Italy, in support of Operation Allied Force, the war in Kosovo. He was the team leader for an ad-hoc intelligence team used to support air combat operations during Kosovo. Commanding officers raved about his ""phenomenal performance"" and described Kirk as ""a natural and charismatic leader"" and ""head and shoulders above any intelligence officer I have ever met."" Elected to Congress in 2001, Kirk has continued his military service, which included two two-week training stints in Afghanistan, in late 2008 and 2009. According to Navy records, Kirk has been awarded two Navy Marine Corps Commendation Medals, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation, a National Defense Service Medal, a Navy E Ribbon and a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. For this item we are going to do a Truth-O-Meter ruling on Giannoulias' claim that Kirk ""did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.'' But before we get to that part of the ad, we're going to examine other quotes from Kirk that Giannoulias also uses in the ad. ""I was the Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year.""This is perhaps the highest-profile of the military gaffes by Kirk, one he boasted about both on his resume and on the floor of Congress.He didn't win that award. Rather, in 2000, the National Military Intelligence Association awarded the intelligence unit led by Kirk with the Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Navy Reserve Intelligence Award, which honors exceptional achievement by outstanding intelligence professionals. And Kirk was tapped to physically accept the award at the National Military Intelligence Association’s annual awards banquet.Kirk has since acknowledged that he incorrectly referred to himself as the “Intelligence Officer of the Year."" ""Most importantly, I wasn't thinking,"" Kirk said in a press conference. ""This was a carelessness that did not reflect well upon me.""""I served in Iraq and Afghanistan.""At other times, Kirk or his campaign literature have described him as ""a veteran of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Enduring Freedom."" He actually served as an intelligence officer stateside in Maryland as a reservist during both operations. The Kirk campaign later changed his record to read that he served ""during"" the operations. And again, his service in Afghanistan consisted of two two-week training sessions. ""The last time I was in Iraq, I was in uniform flying and the Iraqi air defense network was shooting at us.""In 2000, Kirk trained with a squadron based in Turkey, and flew over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch, enforcing a no-fly zone in the northern part of the country.In a June 4, 2010 interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Kirk later clarified ""that while he heard reports of enemy fire, he cannot be sure his plane was ever fired on in Iraq or Kosovo.""""I want to be very contrite and say there is a casualness with which I sometimes describe military details,"" Kirk told the Sun-Times. ""And if it gave the impression that my military record is larger than it was, I want to apologize.""""I command the war room in the Pentagon.""Another misstatement. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, and acknowledged in an interview with Kirk, he commands one of two rooms -- the intelligence unit -- for eight hours at a time on his once-a-month weekend Naval reserve duties. Kirk told the newspaper he misspoke as he was trying to explain that to a civilian audience.But our ruling here is on this claim by Giannoulias:  ""He did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.""This was an issue first brought to light by blogger Terry Welch, who posted a Dec. 18, 2009, memo from Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Gail McGinn approving an exception to allow Kirk to train in Afghanistan. The memo contained this intriguing concluding paragraph:""As a candidate for the vacant Senate seat in Illinois, Commander Kirk must complete the appropriate acknowledgment of limitations required for all candidates on active duty. ... Ordinarily this acknowledgment must be completed within 15 days of entering active duty. Because of the short period of active duty and concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty, Commander Kirk must complete this form prior to his entry on active duty."" Kirk campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski released a statement: ""Mark Kirk has served our nation in the U.S. Navy for two decades and has done so honorably. The fact is, Congressman Kirk never violated Defense Department policies. He has misspoken about his record, acknowledged it and apologized. Mark Kirk left for Afghanistan and he did not engage in political activities -- even in the face of radio commercials accusing him of being gay. The memorandum in question is simply off the mark. Furthermore, this raises grave concerns and questions about who gained access to Kirk's confidential records. The document in question should be viewed for what it is -- a baseless political ploy by partisans bent on defending a U.S. Senate seat at any cost."" The Pentagon, however, later clarified, saying that on two occasions, Kirk was ""counseled"" about violating military policy regarding getting involved in politics while on active duty, and that Kirk was required to sign a statement acknowledging he knew the rules and wouldn't break them again, the AP reported. Specifically, the Pentagon said Kirk gave video interviews in late 2008 about Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich being arrested. And in July 2009, Kirk or a staff member wrote on the candidate's Twitter account that he was on duty at the Pentagon's National Military Command Center. According to a Department of Defense directive on political activities by members of the Armed Forces: ""In keeping with the traditional concept that members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity, and that members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities imply or appear to imply official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement."" Specifically, the rules say that ""a member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall not ... participate in any radio, television, or other program or group discussion as an advocate for or against a partisan political party, candidate, or cause."" According to AP coverage of a Kirk press conference published on June 30, 2010, ""As Kirk apologized (for some of his misstatements about his military record), however, he also acknowledged something his campaign had flatly denied just two weeks ago — that he was twice scolded by the Pentagon for improperly mingling politics with his military duties."" He stopped short of acknowledging that he had actually violated military policy, though. The Giannoulias ad states, ""He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service."" The Pentagon released a statement to AP saying that Kirk was twice ""counseled"" for mixing politics with military service. And we have a memo from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense referring to ""concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty."" The fact that Kirk was merely ""counseled"" suggests these were not deemed terribly egregious violations of military policy. But the Pentagon did tell AP that Kirk signed a statement acknowledging that he knew the rules and wouldn't break them again. You don't sign such a statement if you aren't deemed to have skirted the rules. We rule this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971AC980>],/factchecks/2010/jul/08/alexi-giannoulias/alexi-giannoulias-says-kirk-mixed-politics-militar/

Illinois GOP Senate candidate Mark Kirk smears opponent with BP link
"," These are not good days in politics to have even a whiff of BP crude on your campaign.

And the campaign of Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias has just such a whiff.

In the increasingly nasty race for President Barack Obama's old Illinois U.S. senate seat, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, the Republican candidate, is making the most of it.

A recent Kirk ad begins, ""America's biggest environmental disaster ... Where do the candidates stand?""

The announcer first touts Kirk's record and then says, ""In contrast, Alexi Giannoulias' top aide was a longtime BP lobbyist.""

The aide in question here is Endy Zemenides, a Chicago attorney who is an unpaid senior advisor to the Giannoulias campaign.

Online records of lobbyists filed with the City of Chicago Board of Ethics show Zemenides and his then-law firm Acosta, Kruse, Raines and Zemenides (and later Acosta, Kruse and Zemenides) registered as lobbyists for BP Bovis Global Alliance from 2003 to 2007.

Giannoulias spokesman Matt McGrath called the ad's claim ""a real misrepresentation and distortion of facts."" Zemenides was a real estate attorney for BP Bovis Global Alliance, a partnership between BP and Bovis to develop the retail, gas station side of the business, McGrath said. Zemenides helped the company on landscaping and zoning issues as the company converted a number of Amoco stations to BPs in the Chicago area. Zemenides was never a lobbyist for BP, McGrath said. It's simply the policy of the City of Chicago that real estate attorneys handling zoning cases register as lobbyists.

""This is not exactly the guys drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico,"" McGrath said. ""This group is not involved in refining or oil exploration. This is strictly to do with retail enterprises. It's guilt by association. He worked for a subsidiary involved in retail gas stations.""

The Illinois Republican Party website mocked the Giannoulias campaign response, asking sarcastically, ""When is a BP lobbyist not a BP lobbyist? Answer: In Alexi’s world. In Alexi's world, when you're a registered lobbyist, you're actually just an attorney who is required to register as a lobbyist. In Alexi's world, BP gas stations have nothing to do with BP -- they just happen to bear the name and logo. In the real world, Alexi Giannoulias' political director and top aide was a registered BP lobbyist from 2003-2008 -- and that's a fact.""

It is a fact that as a zoning attorney for BP Bovis, Zemenides met the definition of a lobbyist under the City of Chicago's Governmental Ethics Ordinance. According to the ordinance, "" 'Lobbyist' means any person who, on behalf of any person other than himself, or as any part of his duties as an employee of another, undertakes to influence any legislative or administrative action, including but not limited to ... a zoning matter. ... The term 'lobbyist' shall include, but not be limited to, any attorney, accountant, or consultant engaged in the above-described activities.""

But this issue isn't as clear as the Kirk campaign would have you believe, said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money on campaigns. The rules and regulations about who is a lobbyist vary greatly from city to city and state to state, Levinthal said.

""What might be considered a lobbyist in one large city might not be in a large city 30 miles away, even if they are doing the same kind of work for the same client,"" Levinthal said.

""Is there a distinction between actively lobbying for BP North America or BP International and someone who may have worked for a subsidiary of BP that is not involved in oil drilling? I think a reasonable person would see there is a distinction to be drawn there,"" Levinthal said.

It's true, he said, that Zemenides had a financial relationship at some level with the company. ""Of course, it happened several years back, and then, certainly, no one was targeting BP as a corporate pariah, as they are today. There is definitely some difference between currently, actively lobbying for BP at the federal level and lobbying for a BP subsidiary several years ago."" Zemenides was never registered as a state or federal lobbyist. ""That's a tough one,"" said Edwin Bender, executive director of National Institute on Money in State Politics. ""It's not quite cut and dried."" ""He may be doing technical legal work for them, but on the face of it, that's what he is, a lobbyist,"" Bender said. Still, he said, ""I don't know that I'd make a big connection to the spill."" But that's exactly what the Kirk campaign ad does. It begins, ""America's biggest environmental disaster ... Where do the candidates stand?"" By the City of Chicago's definition, Zemenides was a lobbyist for a BP subsidiary. We think it's highly misleading to suggest that he lobbied in any way for a federal policy that allowed the oil spill to occur. We're not saying a lobbyist isn't a lobbyist. But some cities define lobbyist differently. It's one thing to be an attorney handling landscaping  and zoning issues for a company developing retail gas stations; quite another to lobby for lax federal legislation on deepwater oil drilling. The Kirk ad makes too much of very little. We rate the claim Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097675A40>],/factchecks/2010/jul/08/mark-kirk/illinois-gop-senate-candidate-tars-opponent-bp-cru/

Jan Brewer says law enforcement supports Arizona's immigration law
","Appearing on Fox News with Greta Van Susteren, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer rejected President Barack Obama’s claim that the White House had talked to police officers opposed to Arizona’s controversial immigration law. She shook her head no and said, “Law enforcement in the state of Arizona supports Senate bill 1070,” referring to the new law that directs police to question individuals if they reasonably suspect they are in the U.S. illegally.Later in the interview, she said, “We have many organizations and groups of the officers on the ground that understand the problem, need another tool in order to address the problem and support it wholeheartedly. And everybody that I come across in law enforcement, other than a couple of sheriffs in a couple of areas--other than that, you know, the majority of law enforcement support the bill! So that’s just a misrepresentation again on behalf of the federal government!”She summed it up later by saying of Obama’s comments, “the bottom line is that he’s wrong” about law enforcement opposition to the bill. Listening to the governor, you get the distinct impression that law enforcement opposition to the bill is either non-existent or negligible. But, is that accurate?Brewer's office sent us a document listing those who favored and opposed the law, which the Obama administration is now challenging in federal court.Supporters include groups representing police officers, such as the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, and the Arizona Police Association, which describes itself as “an association of associations, not an association of individual members.” Nonetheless, its website says that it “represents nearly 9,000 federal, state and local law officers in the state of Arizona.” The governor’s office notes that the two are the state’s largest law enforcement groups.The same document noted, however, that the 140-member Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police had spoken in opposition to the measure. The document also noted that Gregg Stanton, Arizona’s deputy attorney general for legislation, policy, and strategic planning, had also opposed the law. Attorney General Terry Goddard, the state’s top law enforcement official, is running for the Democratic nomination for governor and will likely face Brewer as an opponent. His office has opposed the law. When the Obama administration filed suit July 6 to block the law from taking effect, it filed supporting declarations from the chiefs of police in Arizona’s two largest cities, Phoenix and Tucson, and from the sheriff of Santa Cruz County, which includes Nogales, Arizona’s largest town on the Mexico border. All three opposed the measure. So, was Brewer right to claim law enforcement support for the measure? She has numbers on her side, because there are more rank and file officers than there are chiefs of police. But to minimize the opposition as “a couple of sheriffs in a couple of areas,” doesn’t convey the split in law enforcement when it comes to the law. The police chiefs who filed declarations supporting the Obama administration’s attempt to block it stressed their own concerns about illegal immigration. But when it came to the new law, they expressed worry that it will stop undocumented witnesses from coming forth in serious crimes, impose large new amounts of work on police forces without additional compensation, invite lawsuits against police departments and divert police from focusing on crimes such as kidnappings and illegal drug smuggling. Brewer suggests unified support from police. Yes, there is support from two police groups, but there’s also opposition from police chiefs. We find her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A35C5C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/08/jan-brewer/jan-brewer-says-law-enforcement-supports-arizonas-/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Ralph Hudgens']","
Insurance commissioner candidate Hudgens says office can't do ""squat"" about health care
","Candidates in the Republican primary for insurance commissioner are in a snit over “squat.” The tiff began June 22, when one hopeful for the office, state Sen. Ralph Hudgens of Hull, was a guest on ""The Martha Zoller Show."" The radio talk show is broadcast by Gainesville-area WXKT-FM and through a video feed on the Internet. Zoller and Hudgens discussed the race, which for many has become a contest over which candidate can stop provisions of the massive federal health care bill passed in March from taking effect in Georgia. Bashing the bill, which is unpopular among Republicans, is a favorite tactic for candidates wooing conservative voters. Hudgens criticized the rhetoric, arguing that the insurance commissioner's power over federal health legislation is limited. The show went to break. Hudgens and Zoller chatted off-air. Unknown to Hudgens, the Internet feed streamed on. So while radio listeners heard commercials, Web viewers heard Hudgens in a moment of what he thought was off-the-air candor:“The insurance commissioner can’t do squat about health care,” Hudgens told Zoller. But is that the case?Response to Hudgens was swift. The Twitter account of Republican opponent Maria Sheffield, a favorite with the tea party movement, fired off a post: ""Seriously, Ralph?"" it read. ""GA needs a conservative to stop Obama -- I will.""Hudgens was unfazed. He publicly embraced the gaffe. In an interview with PolitiFact Georgia, he said voters need to understand the limits of the insurance commissioner's power over federal health legislation. No recording of Hudgens' statement is available, but he said he was trying to make the point that the insurance commissioner's power to keep the new federal health legislation from taking effect in this state is limited. Zoller confirmed with PolitiFact Georgia that this is what he meant.Hudgens' argument goes like this: The post of insurance commissioner is an administrative office. It cannot set public policy, tax or pass legislation. It can't sue in federal court to have the law struck down. It therefore cannot block the federal health care law from taking effect in this state. The insurance commissioner can influence how the health care overhaul takes shape in Georgia by creating regulations and making other decisions about how the federal bill will be implemented in Georgia, Hudgens said. For instance, in April, current insurance commissioner and Republican gubernatorial candidate John Oxendine decided that the state will opt out of becoming involved in the creation of a state ""high-risk"" pool for people with pre-existing conditions. ""As far as fighting Obamacare, I'll say it again. He [the insurance commissioner] can't do squat,"" Hudgens said. Experts said that because thousands of pages of rules and regulations that outline how the bill will be implemented have yet to be written, much of what an insurance commissioner can do has yet to be established. But the consensus is clear: What an insurance commissioner can do to block federal health care law is limited. Sandy Praeger is commissioner of the Kansas Insurance Department and chairwoman of the Health Insurance and Managed Care Committee for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Federal officials are consulting with the group as they write health insurance regulations. ""It is the law of the land. I think we have to obey the law,"" Praeger said of the health legislation. ""But there are ways to comply with the letter of the law and not the law's spirit."" Praeger and others pointed out two major provisions of the federal health care bill over which the state has significant say: high-risk pools and health insurance exchanges.High-risk pools are designed to help people with pre-existing conditions get coverage until Jan. 1 2014, when broader insurance provisions go into effect. A state may contract with the federal government to set up the pool itself or opt out as Georgia did. Still, state residents will be able to get insurance from a high-risk pool, said Glenn Allen, a spokesman for the state Insurance Commissioner's Office. ""This decision does not mean that Georgia citizens will not have access to a high-risk health pool, they will; but the federal government and not the state of Georgia will bear the financial risk,"" Allen said in an e-mail. The federal government will put a pool in place that Georgians can use, Allen said. So even though Georgia has chosen not to be involved, high-risk pools will be created. The same goes for health insurance exchanges. They were created to make the pricing of policies easier to understand. Initially, individuals buying insurance on their own and smaller employers will be the primary participants. If the federal government decides that a state won't have an operational exchange by Jan. 1, 2014, or that what it has is not up to snuff, the U.S. secretary of health and human services will create one or contract with a nonprofit that will. Bill Custer, an expert on health policy and director of Georgia State University's Center for Health Services Research, said the state has an important but limited role in such exchanges: ""[T]he law specifically gives the states a great deal of flexibility in the design of the exchanges and the regulatory authority over health insurance. It also states that if the states decline to act the Feds will."" Even Hudgens' opponent Sheffield acknowledged the limits of the insurance commissioner's power. ""As insurance commissioner you can't stop it [the federal health care law] from happening and you can't override that,"" Sheffield told PolitiFact Georgia. Hudgens' overall point was accurate. There's little dispute that while the insurance commissioner can shape how the federal legislation is enacted in Georgia, he cannot stop it from going into effect. The problem is that Hudgens overstated his position. He used the word ""squat,"" as in ""diddly squat."" Bupkis. Nada. Nothing. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but Hudgens still earns a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA79C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/08/ralph-hudgens/insurance-commissioner-candidate-hudgens-says-offi/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Bud Chiles']","
Chiles needs schooling on education rankings
","Bud Chiles has long been critical of Florida's public education system. He has bashed the Florida Legislature for directing insufficient dollars toward Florida schools and, most recently, launched the ""Worst to First"" initiative, a statewide effort publicizing Florida's low ranking in a variety of categories concerning children.It came as no surprise, then, when he made education a cornerstone of his independent gubernatorial campaign. ""Too many of our children are failing in schools because Florida is failing our children... Today, Florida is in 50th place in spending on education,"" reads his campaign website.Florida's education reputation has never been stellar, but Chiles' dead-last claim seemed worth verifying. His campaign offered this clarification, ""Florida is currently ranked 50th out of 50 states in per capita funding for K-12 public education and 39th in per-pupil funding."" They directed us toward the U.S. Census Bureau's public education finance report and Education Week's ""Quality Counts 2009,"" two respected rankings of the nation's public schools. What we found raised more questions than cafeteria mystery meat. The Education Week source earned Chiles a big ""F"", for false. It placed Florida 31st in its national ranking of school finance in its January 2010 report, not 50th. The rankings consider equitable distribution of school dollars and regional cost differences. Its results were based on 2007 spending levels. The report showed Florida was improving from previous years, when the state ranked 39th in 2009 and 38th in 2008. Education Week also ranked the states on simple per-student spending. In its 2010 report, Florida ranked 38th on that list. It was 41st in 2009, and 39th in 2008.""I’ve looked at the past three years reports, but Florida wasn’t ranked last in any of the school finance indicators during the period,"" said Hajime Mitani, a research analyst for the EPE Research Center, which conducts research for Education Week's annual rankings. But the Chiles campaign had done its homework when it came to the Census report. In per-pupil spending, Florida was below the national average in 39th place, according to the Census' most recent findings from June 2010, which looked at 2007-2008 spending. But when the Census looked at what states spent per every $1,000 of personal income, Florida dropped to 50th. In fact, Florida came in 50th in that same category in every report from 2010 through 2007. The state wasn't dead-last, however. The Census report includes Washington, D.C., in its ranking, so every time Florida finished 50th, it placed before the nation's capital. Still, Florida never ranked below 40th place in overall per-pupil spending during those years.  We went back to the Chiles campaign, which then sent us toward the National Education Association, a teachers union.The union's December 2009 report ranked Florida 50th in per-capita state education expenses during the 2006-2007 school year. It also ranked Florida 50th in total state government education spending for every $1,000 of personal income during the 2006-2007 school year. But, as with the Census report, the report's findings weren't conclusive. Although the Chiles campaign highlighted the findings having to do exclusively with state spending, the union's report also determined:  Finally, the union's report offered this caveat: ""Of course, no set of tables tells the entire story of a state’s education offerings. Consideration of factors such as a state’s tax system, provisions for other public services, and population characteristics also are needed. Therefore, it is unwise to draw conclusions based solely on individual statistics in this report.""That Chiles directed us toward three education reports that didn't fully support his claim is also telling: Depending on how the numbers are massaged, Florida's spending record can vary widely. ""If you are comparing states, everything is relative,"" said Jack Jennings, president of the Center on Education Policy in Washington, D.C. ""Like with anything, your outcome depends on how you define the process. So you can use different factors and come out with different results.""Other education experts cautioned against putting too much faith in the various rankings, which often compare distinct state education budgets. For example, one state might include construction costs toward its total education dollars, but Florida does not. Critics also warn that demographic and geographic differences render the rankings moot.""Unless everybody is doing the same thing, it is not really fair,"" said Cheryl Etters, a Florida Department of Education spokesman.Consider that the National Center for Education Statistics, another highly regarded education group, determined Florida spent $9,084 per pupil during the 2007-2008 school year in its most recent May 2010 report. New Jersey spent the most, at $17,620. Utah spent the least, at $5,978. Using these numbers, Florida would place 35th in spending.But the center did not rank the states according to these findings. Instead, states were listed in alphabetical order. ""We never rank. We list it alpha. In many ways, it’s not really fair to compare Florida to Nebraska,"" said Tracy Dell'Angela, communications director for the Institute of Education Sciences, which oversees the National Center for Education Statistics.Chiles himself questioned the authenticity of such rankings when Education Week placed Florida 10th in overall quality of education in 2009.""It's bunk, it's just wrong to say that we're 10th in education or to say we're progressing nationally,"" Chiles told the Miami Herald in August 2009. ""It's just clearly not true."" Now, let's revisit what Chiles said on his campaign website: ""Today, Florida is in 50th place in spending on education."" We think that statement deserves red marks on several grounds. His campaign cited two outdated reports. The Census data's most recent report was based on 2007-2008 school year spending. The union's ranking was from the previous school year. That doesn't count as ""today"" in our book. What's more, these reports and various others put Florida's spending record all over the map. It is true that the Florida Legislature has not made any gains in public school spending in recent years because of the stalled economy. This year, overall per-student funding increased from $6,842.29 to $6,843.51, or $1.22 per student, but the state got there by asking local governments to contribute more. There's no way to know whether that's enough to change any of these rankings, no matter which measurement is used.So no gold star here. We give this a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097184FC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/07/bud-chiles/chiles-needs-schooling-education-rankings/

Marco Rubio critical of oil spill clean up
","Everything from human hair to industrial vacuums has been used in the effort to soak up the globs of oil floating along the Gulf coast. But when it comes to getting rid of the tar balls washing up on the Florida Panhandle’s pristine beaches, Marco Rubio, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has some misgivings about the clean-up efforts.“We are talking about the richest and most powerful country in the world, and we are picking up oil with shovels and paper and plastic bags,” Rubio said June 26, 2010, during an interview on the show “Fox and Friends.”He added: “You would think that at this point every skimmer on the planet earth would be working off the coast of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, etc., and they are not. They are not out there.”Rubio has not backed down from his initial support of off shore drilling, “so long as it can be done safely,” said campaign spokesman Alex Burgos. During a May 5th press availability in Washington D.C, Rubio noted: ""I've not heard anyone say you cannot safely drill for oil because there are thousands of rigs drilling even as we speak that are not leaking, that are not causing this ecological disaster.""As tar balls, tar patties, tar mats, and any other conceivable name for the patches of rusty brown and black oil, continue to wash up on the Panhandle’s white sand beaches, we decided to take a closer look at Rubio’s statement on “Fox and Friends.” More specifically, his claim that only “shovels and paper and plastic bags” were being used in the effort. If hair and rubber tires are being used in the on-water efforts, surely there are other ways the gunk is being removed from the beaches?(By the way, we bring first-hand experience to this one. This PolitiFact Florida reporter is just back from weeks of reporting in the Panhandle, in between fact-checking duties. We walked the beaches in 100-degree heat with BP clean-up crews and saw first-hand the painstaking work of sifting through the sand to pick up gooey tar balls.)When we turned to Rubio’s campaign, Burgos told us to look no further than this June 29 photo from the Pensacola News Journal to prove Rubio’s claim. Sure enough, the picture, like hundreds of others taken along the Gulf Coast, shows plenty of plastic bags and shovels in sight. Paper bags, not so much.BP has said it plans to hire nearly 6,850  local beach clean-up workers along the Panhandle, to perform work like scooping up tar ball-mixed sand into “into 6-millimeter-thick plastic bags known as drum liners that they fill up to 20 pounds and then seal off with duct tape,” as detailed in a June 22 Miami Herald article. Those bags are eventually sent to Alabama to be incinerated or sent to a landfill in Campbellton, FL, on the Georgia border.The majority of clean-up efforts rely on manual labor, with workers wearing protective gear like thick rubber gloves and plastic cover-up suits. BP is largely steering away from using large machinery on the beach for several reasons. Bulldozers, for example, are not able to distinguish between oil debris and eggs laid by endangered sea turtles and shore birds. BP officials also say thick tar clogs mechanical rakes. The machinery that is being used is largely out on the water, in the form of skimming vessels, that scoop up the thick mats of oil that have formed on the surface of the water. There are currently five state-leased skimming vessels working off the Florida panhandle, but elected officials and Panhandle residents alike have complained, as Rubio does, that more skimmers should have been deployed by BP and the federal government right after the oil rig explosion to keep oil from creeping toward the shoreline in the first place. So while Rubio may have been slightly off when saying paper bags were used in the clean-up effort, there’s plenty of plastic bags and shovels being used to haul off the tar balls. We find his claim True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F5DE00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/07/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-critical-oil-spill-clean-efforts/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Crime', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Al Hunt']","
Bloomberg's Al Hunt says crime is down in Arizona
","The debate about immigration often involves discussions about whether illegal immigrants cause more crime. The topic came up on ABC's This Week on July 4, 2010, when Al Hunt, the executive editor in Washington for Bloomberg News, criticized John McCain for the Republican senator's comments about crime in Arizona.McCain had explained his shift on immigration by saying, ""The violence is incredibly high. The human smuggling and drug cartels are at a level of violence where 25,000 -- 23,000 Mexican citizens have been murdered in the last few years, 5,000 already this year. There's a level of violence which has increased to a significant degree, which makes the situation far different than it was in 2007"" when the Senate last considered immigration reform. He added, ""But I invite the president to come to the border, and he can see for himself the absolute necessity of getting our border secure before more violence spills over onto our side of the border... It is not the same as it was in 2007. And the people deserve not to have our ranchers murdered, not to have a deputy shot by a drug smuggler with an AK-47 in Pinal County. The situation has dramatically changed, and the statistics absolutely back that up."" During the roundtable discussion on This Week, Hunt told host Jake Tapper: ""I must say, John McCain, in his interview with you, Jake, that was extraordinary to say that crime is up there. He's talking about Mexico. Crime is down in Arizona. Every single academic study that's been done shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes."" It is unclear whether McCain was suggesting that crime in Arizona was up because of illegal immigrants, but we were curious about Hunt's claim that crime in Arizona -- a state that ranks 6th for the estimated population of illegal immigrants -- was down.Because Hunt did not specify the types of crime, we'll examine all types. We checked the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports as well as data from Arizona's Department of Public Safety and found Hunt is correct that crime is down. From 2004 to 2008, data from Arizona's DPS shows a 23 percent drop in the overall crime rate, while the FBI's statistics on Arizona show a 19 percent drop. Although the FBI has not released all of the data on 2009, Arizona's statistics show the crime rate in 2009 dropped an additional 12 percent. ""Crime has been going down, overall, in Arizona,"" said Tony LaRose, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Tampa, but he noted it has been a national trend for the past almost three decades.""The trend holds even if you only measure violent crime, which James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said is the type of crime people think of when discussing crime and illegal immigrants. The violent crime rate fell 11 percent from 2004 to 2008 in Arizona.Whether or not Hunt was correctly interpreting McCain's comments is outside of the scope of the claim, but he is right about Arizona crime going down. So we rate Hunt's claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFE2600>],/factchecks/2010/jul/07/al-hunt/bloombergs-al-hunt-says-crime-down-arizona/

John McCain said that Barack Obama voted against part of immigration reform
","Back in 2007, Congress came close to hammering out legislation to overhaul laws about immigration, but the deal collapsed in the Senate. Three years later, that failure is still being discussed and dissected. It came up again on ABC News' This Week, in a question for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.Host Jake Tapper first showed video of a speech President Barack Obama gave on July 1, 2010. ""Under the leadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator John McCain, we worked across the aisle to help pass a bipartisan bill through the Senate,"" Obama said. ""And now, under the pressures of partisanship and election year politics, many of the 11 Republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed away from their previous support.""""Senator, that's you he's talking about,"" Tapper said. ""Why have you backed away from comprehensive immigration reform, which you spoke so passionately about in 2006 and 2007?""McCain responded, ""I don't enjoy bringing this up, but the fact is, then-Senator Obama supported amendments which would have gutted the proposal that we had before the United States Senate, which he said he would propose, an amendment that basically gutted the legal temporary worker program.""McCain phrases his statement a little awkwardly, but we wanted to know if it was true that Obama supported amendments that would have derailed the temporary worker program.   It turns out we actually looked at this issue before; McCain made a similar charge during the election of 2008 as evidence that Obama was willing to engage in partisanship when it suited his purposes. Back then, he said Obama ""voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the (immigration overhaul) legislation."" In his 2008 broadside against Obama, and again Sunday on This Week, McCain refers to a series of votes the Senate took in early June 2007 at a particularly sensitive time in the immigration debate. The following is a a recap of our previous reporting, but the history on those 2007 negotiations hasn't changed.The immigration issue scrambled the usual political divisions between Democrats and Republicans. President Bush supported comprehensive legislation and reached out to Democrats after they gained control of Congress in 2006. Some Republicans opposed the plan, criticizing the citizenship provisions as amnesty and saying that border security needed bolstering instead. Some Democrats, though, opposed it as well, because their allies in organized labor were against more non-citizens being allowed into the U.S.to work. McCain, together with the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., worked out a compromise measure that included several pillars: a path to citizenship for workers illegally in the country, increased border security, improved enforcement of employment law, and more visas for temporary workers.The Senate took up the compromise package, with supporters warning that it could be derailed by any amendments that changed its substance. On June 6, Obama proposed an amendment to end after five years a new merit-based system for awarding green cards that confer permanent resident status. The new system would have apportioned green cards based on the nation's economic needs and moved away from the existing system, which rewards family ties. A coalition of immigrant rights groups endorsed Obama's measure, saying the new system would discriminate in favor of immigrants with higher education and training in specialty occupations. But Obama's amendment was unsuccessful; the Senate rejected it, 42-55.Hours later, though, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., offered an amendment to end after five years a different program, one that allowed more temporary workers. Dorgan said the program would bring in cheap labor through the back door and squeeze out American workers. Supporters of reform warned that the amendment could scuttle the deal, but the Senate adopted the amendment in a 49-48 vote, with Obama voting with Dorgan.The bill's supporters branded Dorgan's effort a ""deal-breaker."" Soon after, the legislation collapsed amid three failed votes to cut off debate on June 7, 2007. Obama was on the losing end of these votes, so he was voting to allow the bill to go forward.Immigration experts we spoke with in 2008 said that Obama was one of a host of senators who tried to influence the package, but was not a pivotal participant in the debate. Obama did, however, vote for Dorgan's amendment, which is what McCain was referencing. Among experts who wanted the bill to pass, we found mixed opinion on the importance of the Dorgan amendment limiting temporary workers.Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, said that Dorgan's amendment significantly undermined a critical provision allowing more workers into the U.S. Jacoby's organization represents employers, who favored more temporary workers.""Everyone thinks that amnesty is the big debate,"" Jacoby said. ""But whether or not we're going to have worker visas is an equally important debate.""Obama's vote on the Dorgan amendment may not have killed the bill, she said, but it was ""a profound misunderstanding of what reform was about.""Another point of view, though, is that the Dorgan amendment was a minor bump in the road, and something that could have been stripped out later. That's the view of Frank Sharry, now executive director of America's Voice, a left-leaning, pro-immigration group. The Dorgan amendment, Sharry said, was payback for a successful amendment supported by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that would have removed confidentiality from applications for citizenship, to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants who were refused citizenship. Both the Cornyn and the Dorgan amendments would have come out later, before the bill could move toward final passage, he said.""The Cornyn amendment rocked the boat one way, and the Dorgan amendment rocked the boat the other way, so it was a rocking boat,"" Sharry said. He rejected the idea that the Dorgan amendment sunk the deal, and as evidence, he pointed to the fact that weeks later, the Senate tried again to revive the package. On June 28, 2007, the bill went down yet again when it failed still another cloture vote. Obama voted to move forward then, too. We should note that back when we looked at the issue during the 2008 election, we found McCain went too far in his rhetoric, and we rated his statement Half True. Here, McCain's statement is a bit more limited and therefore more precise. He said that Barack Obama supported an amendment ""that basically gutted the legal temporary worker program."" Clearly Obama did vote for a bill that would have curtailed the legal temporary worker program, an important part of comprehensive immigration package. Still, Obama did cast other votes to move the bill forward. We feel it's important to note that the vote was not a clear-cut refusal of the entire package. So we rate McCain's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A33BE00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/07/john-mccain/john-mccain-said-barack-obama-voted-against-part-i/

Bill White says Rick Perry threatened to secede
","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White hearkened to a moment we’ve reviewed before when White told delegates to the Texas Democratic Party’s convention in Corpus Christi June 25: “In Rick Perry’s Texas, the governor threatens to leave, to secede from the greatest country in the” world.White spokeswoman Katy Bacon later confirmed White was referring to the Republican governor’s reply to a reporter after he spoke at a tea-party rally outside Austin’s city hall on April 15, 2009.Did Perry threaten to secede?The cited moment played out after an Associated Press reporter, Kelley Shannon, asked Perry after the 2009 rally if he thought the gathering reflected a national movement. Perry answered that it could be. He said people feel strangled by spending and taxation and they want help, according to an AP recording we reviewed in April 2010.Shannon then asked Perry about some associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas. “Oh, I think there’s a lot of different scenarios,” Perry replied. “Texas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that.“You know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention,” Perry continued. “We’ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we’re a pretty independent lot to boot.”Perry next fielded a question from someone else about whether Texas might now be considered a natural terorrist state — no, Perry said — and the question-and-answer period closed.At the time, Perry’s comments were widely interpreted as indicating the Republican governor believed secession could legally occur; he subsequently did not back down from that conclusion.However, a constitutional expert advised at the time that the Civil War long ago vanquished secession as a legal option.Sanford Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution nor the Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States of 1845, bestows an explicit right for the state to return to a Republic. Levinson said there is “no possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a ‘right’ to secede.”Levinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows Texas to break into five new states, and it doesn’t specify whether that would require congressional approval. But, he said, that’s distinct from secession.Does Perry’s “who-knows-what-might-come” comment support White’s statement that Perry threatened to leave the union?Using the Nexis search tool, we found 169 major newspaper articles linking Perry and secede. None quoted Perry threatening to push for secession, though critics and comedians framed his words in that way.Typically, San Antonio Express-News reporter Roy Bragg wrote in an April 19, 2009 article: “The governor didn't make an actual threat to secede.” Bragg also quoted Harvey Tucker, a Texas A&M University political scientist, suggesting Perry saw political gain by speaking to secession. “He didn't intend (to) talk about it. He didn't plan it. He was just drawn into it,” Tucker said.An October 2009 article in The Dallas Morning News quoted Allison Castle, the governor's spokeswoman, saying Perry's intention in his April comment “was to point a critical finger at the federal government, not to encourage abandoning the U.S.”Bacon told us in an e-mail that Perry’s “speculation, saying the state could secede if it wanted to, is a saber-rattling threat. Think about secession and all that is associated with it. He was not talking about it in a historical navel-gazing” or constitutional-interpretive fashion.What we find: In a politically theatrical moment, Perry edged toward a secession threat. Then or since, however, he hasn’t said Texas should quit the United States. (You wudda read all about it.)White’s similarly theatrical statement at his party’s convention is False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F2440>],/factchecks/2010/jul/07/bill-white/bill-white-says-rick-perry-threatened-secede/

Ga. Secretary of state hopeful Doug MacGinnitie said Republican incumbent voted for Democrats
","The barnyard brawl otherwise known as the Republican primary for Georgia secretary of state reached a new political milestone: its first attack ad. And guess what? Secretary of State Brian Kemp, your rival Doug MacGinnitie says you should be ashamed. MacGinnitie's commercial, which he posted on YouTube, emerged in an online skirmish over which of the two Republicans is a better Republican.  On June 9, Kemp posted on YouTube a speech he made during a Cobb County GOP breakfast in which he accused MacGinnitie of failing to vote in a Republican primary for two decades. We ruled that claim False in an earlier item. MacGinnitie, a former Sandy Springs city councilman, fired back June 23 with an attack ad on his campaign's YouTube page. It said that Kemp, a Gov. Sonny Perdue appointee who said he helped build the GOP in Georgia, voted in Democratic primaries.  ""When you were casting your vote for Republicans, Brian Kemp was voting for Democrats,"" a voice said on the YouTube video.   Kemp defected three times: 1996, 1998 and 2000, according to the announcer.  ""Saying one thing and doing another -- that’s hypocrisy. You should be ashamed,"" it concludes. A Republican candidate voted for a Democrat? Say it ain't so.We requested Kemp's voting history from the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, which keeps election records. They show Kemp did cast votes in three state Democratic primaries: 1996, 1998 and 2000. This means that Kemp voted three times for Democrats, as the commercial said. But those same records also show those votes were exceptions to the rule. Kemp has voted 33 times since 1992. Of his votes in primary elections, eight were in Republican contests: the 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 presidential primaries; and the 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 state primaries.Kemp also voted in three other Republican races: two state primary runoffs (2002 and 2006) and a special election in 2007. Kemp voted in Democratic primaries to have a say in local politics, campaign consultant Joel McElhannon said. He lives in Clarke County, where Athens is located. Historically, the area has been so heavily Democratic that many conservatives run as Democrats, McElhannon said. Some races are decided in the Democratic primary.  ""To have input in local offices like County Commission -- where decisions are made that directly impact his businesses and his family’s quality of life -- Brian voted in a few Democrat primaries in the '90s to support conservative, pro-business local candidates running in those Democrat primaries,"" McElhannon wrote in an e-mail. Elections records support the Kemp campaign's assessment. In the 2000 general primary, in which Kemp chose a Democratic ballot, there were no Republican challengers in several races, according to Athens-Clarke County Board of Elections records. They included contests for sheriff, two county commissioner seats and two state House slots. Although Democrats have become less dominant in Clarke during the past decade, they remain a driving force in local politics. In the 2008 Clarke general primary, Kemp was among only 39 percent of voters who chose a Republican ballot, according to Georgia secretary of state records. Sixty-one percent of voters selected a Democratic ballot.While MacGinnitie is correct that Kemp voted in three Democratic primaries, his conclusion that his opponent is guilty of ""hypocrisy"" is misleading. It ignores the political dynamics of Kemp's home county as well the bulk of his voting history. We rate MacGinnitie's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CF4A80>],/factchecks/2010/jul/07/doug-macginnitie/secretary-state-hopeful-doug-macginnitie-said-repu/
"['Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist's oil response evolved over time
","The Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig exploded and caught fire in the Gulf of Mexico on the night of April 20, 2010. A week later, on April 29, as the first of many oil-soiled birds were being washed down, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency.Florida Gov. Charlie Crist also made an announcement that day. He was leaving the Republican party to run as an independent for U.S. Senate.In the weeks since waves of oil began seeping into the Gulf of Mexico, Crist has appeared on the nightly news on a near-daily basis to discuss the oil crisis. He regularly tours the Panhandle. He meets with affected business owners. And, he highlights his response to the oil disaster whenever he is in a large, bustling room. ""You know, when this thing first hit, I signed a declaration of emergency for the six counties that were directly affected, impacted in the Panhandle,"" he told a crowd at the Florida Association of Counties conference in Tampa on July 1, 2010. ""Then, I extended that not long thereafter down into Sarasota County. And then we started to hear about the loop current -- I mean we've all become sort of mini-experts in the study of this spill -- after hearing about the looper and the possibility that this could get all the way down into Monroe County and even up, you know, to Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, we extended that emergency declaration through Palm Beach County.""Crist's message: I've been getting things done. But, we wondered, was Crist's response really that nimble?It wasn't until the day after he announced he was running as an independent that Crist signed a 6-page executive order declaring a state of emergency for six Florida counties: Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Bay and Gulf. In that April 30 order, he also tapped the state Department of Environmental Protection to coordinate the response effort. Crist added 13 more counties on May 3, extending the state of emergency south along the Gulf Coast through Sarasota County.The proclamations were good enough for Florida, but Crist still needed to let the federal government know Florida was in crisis if he wanted federal help.That step didn't come until more than two weeks after the rig explosion with a May 6 letter to President Barack Obama requesting a $50 million disaster grant from the federal Department of Labor. He later requested help from the federal Small Business Administration on May 12, which allowed business owners to qualify for federal grants.A month after the explosion, Crist extended the state of emergency further south and back up the Atlantic coast through Palm Beach County. In all, the May 20 executive order brought the number of Florida counties in a declared state of emergency to a total of 26. Crist explained his decision by citing reports that oil from the spill had entered into a loop current that could potentially carry it out to other counties bordering the gulf and the Atlantic seaboard.Crist broke out his special executive order pen one more time on June 18, extending the state of emergency through Aug. 28. ""Depending on weather and ocean currents, this ecological disaster poses a potential threat to Florida's entire coastline,"" read the order. We weren't sure how Crist would define ""when this thing first hit.""For context, we looked at what the governors did in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, the other gulf states immediately threatened by the oil spill.Alabama Gov. Bob Riley also declared a state of emergency on April 30, but his covered the entire state. More recently, Riley reached out for some divine help when he declared Sunday, June 27, a ""Day of Prayer,"" and urged his residents to ask God for a solution.April 30 was also a productive day for Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who declared a state of emergency in all areas affected by the oil leak, including, ""but not limited to, Hancock, Harrison and Jackson counties, the littoral areas of these counties, any state, national or international waters through which state or federal personnel shall traverse or operate in responding to this oil leak.""Then there's Jindal, one of the few government leaders whose outspokenness on the oil leak might rival Crist's. Jindal was the first of the four gulf coast governors to declare a state of emergency. His came April 29 and covered the entire state of Louisiana. That same day, Jindal shared his declaration with the federal Small Business Administration, the first step in ensuring small businesses in areas ravaged by the oil spill would be eligible for low-interest loans of up to $2 million to cover basic operating expenses. He also asked that the Small Business Administration temporarily suspend loan repayments for coastal businesses impacted by the spill that had received earlier loans related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike and Gustav. So, that means Crist was mostly in step with his peers when he declared a state of emergency in six Florida counties 10 days after the oil rig explosion. And he did go on to expand the emergency declaration to include 20 more counties within a month. On the other hand, of the four states closest to the oil disaster, Florida is still the only state with a limited emergency area. And, unlike Jindal, Crist did not immediately seek financial help from the federal government. Crist's initial emergency proclamation was timely and he did continue to expand it. But given that he didn't immediately reach out for federal dollars and that other gulf governors beat him to the punch by issuing broad state of emergency proclamations from the beginning -- we give him a Mostly True.

"['National', 'Military', 'Stimulus', 'Sarah Palin']","
Palin says defense spending was tiny portion of stimulus
","President Barack Obama's recent decision to halt plans for a missile defense system in Eastern Europe has opened the door for Republicans to rekindle an attack they've used before: that Democrats are weak on defense. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, in a Sept. 23, 2009, speech to investors in Hong Kong, joined Fox talk show host Sean Hannity, Republican chairman Michael Steele, and others in attacking Obama for being too soft on defense. ""Though we are engaged in two wars and face a diverse array of threats, it is the defense budget that has seen significant program cuts and has actually been reduced from current levels!"" she said. She added, ""the Defense Department received only one-half of 1 percent of the nearly trillion-dollar stimulus package funding — even though many military projects fit the definition of 'shovel-ready.' "" She went on to cite examples of defense projects that she said Obama wants to cut. We recently examined a claim by Hannity that Obama has cut defense spending (we found it Half True), but we wanted to see if Palin was right that a tiny sliver of stimulus spending will go toward defense projects. The total cost of the stimulus, known officially as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is $787 billion. According to the Defense Department, $7.4 billion will be spent on defense projects when the spending from the economic stimulus package is all said and done. That works out to slightly less than 1 percent of its total cost. That's slightly higher than Palin's ""one-half of 1 percent,"" but still very much in the ballpark. The White House says that the $7.4 billion for the military in the stimulus bill comes on top of an already increased military budget (indeed, when we checked Hannity's claim, we found that Obama increased defense spending 3.9 percent from 2009 to 2010, while the budgeted amount for future years would essentially be flat). And the goal of the package was to directly stimulate the economy. So Palin's underlying point that Obama is going soft on defense is a bit of a stretch. The amount of defense spending in the stimulus bill is not a good measurement of the administration's overall commitment in that area. But she is correct that defense was a small portion of the stimulus and her number is off only slightly. So we find her statement to be Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809700F0C0>],/factchecks/2009/sep/29/sarah-palin/palin-says-defense-spending-was-tiny-portion-stimu/

E-mail claims Democratic Congress to blame for no COLA increase in Social Security
","So every year you've gotten a little bump in your Social Security check due to inflation. Maybe you've come to consider it an annual raise from Uncle Sam. Well, this January, you might not get one. And a chain e-mail making the rounds tells you to blame Democrats in Congress. ""For the first time in history, the Democratic Congress will not allow an increase in the Social Security COLA (cost of living adjustment),"" the e-mail states. There are actually two versions of this e-mail floating around. One pins the blame generically on ""Congress,"" while the other says ""the Democratic Congress."" The second version seems to have gotten more traction on the Web, so we focused on the latter version. Up until 1975, it took an act of Congress to adjust Social Security payments for inflation. But a law enacted in 1972 — and signed by President Richard Nixon, a Republican — created a formula to automatically calculate the COLA every year. The  Social Security cost of living adjustment  was tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The government compares that index in the third quarter (July, August and September) of the current year to the third quarter of the previous year. Every year since the formula was put into effect (1975), it has resulted in a  cost-of-living increase  . High oil prices last summer contributed in large part to a sizable COLA increase in January of  5.8 percent  , the highest increase in more than 25 years. This year, the CPI-W is expected to decrease. That's due in part to lower consumer prices and low inflation from the recession. But mostly, it's tied to oil prices, which fell markedly from last summer's highs. As a result, a  Social Security Trustees report  last fall forecast no COLA next year. And the  Congressional Budget Office recently projected  that the formula will fail to yield a COLA in 2010  or  2011. The law does not allow COLA to be  adjusted downward  , so the effect is that Social Security payments would remain stagnant next year. This all has consequences for Medicare as well. For the three-quarters of seniors who have premiums for Part B of Medicare withheld from their Social Security checks, the COLA freeze will also mean a freeze in Part B premiums. That's because of a ""hold-harmless"" provision in the law. But millions of  seniors exempt from the provision  — some wealthy people, people new to the program and those who don't have Part B premiums withheld from their Social Security payments — could actually see smaller Social Security checks. ""It has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans,"" said Mark Hinkle, a spokesman for Social Security. ""It's been the law since 1975, and it's based strictly on the numbers."" Congress could vote to increase Social Security payments even though the COLA formula doesn't call for it. And, in fact, several pieces of legislation have been offered with that very goal. One is the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, introduced in the Senate by Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and in the House by Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. It would provide a one-time payment of $250 to Social Security recipients next year. Another is the Emergency COLA Bill, introduced earlier this week by Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C. It would provide a COLA for 2010 equal to the average of the COLA over the past 10 years — roughly 3 percent. Obviously, these bills are coming from both sides of the aisle. If this e-mail had merely gotten some facts wrong, we'd be comfortable rating it False. But given that it targets senior citizens on an important pocketbook issue with an incorrect allegation that has no basis in fact, we have to go one more notch and set the meter ablaze.

Health reform includes a tax penalty if you don't have insurance
","
The Republican National Committee launched a new ad attacking health care reform as a big tax increase.
 
""Barack Obama and Democrats promise that health care reform will lower costs, but their plans deliver increased taxes,"" the ad says. It then lists several taxes it says the Obama plan will increase.
 
Here we're checking the claim that ""they've even proposed a tax for not having health insurance.""
 
The ad then flashes to video of Obama and George Stephanopoulos arguing over the meaning of the word tax on

This Week with George Stephanopoulos

, with Stephanopolous reading the dictionary definition. Obama said the measure is necessary to make sure that everyone takes responsibility for having health insurance. He also said that a tax penalty is not the same thing as raising people's taxes.
 
The tax in the Democrats' bills won't affect anyone who has insurance. But if health care reform passes, it will be an issue for those who don't have insurance.
 
The tax is the mechanism that Democrats want to use to prod people to get health coverage. If they fail to get insurance, they would have to pay it.
 
We've studied the health reform proposals being considered in Congress right now, and the main Democratic versions propose a tax penalty on people who don't carry health insurance. Policymakers usually call this provision the ""individual mandate.""
 
Among Democrats, there is much consensus that an individual mandate is needed to make sure everyone is covered, especially when coupled with other measures to make affordable coverage more widely available.
 
Obama opposed the individual mandate when he was a candidate, but he has since

changed his mind

and now supports it, as long as it contains a hardship exemption for individuals who are truly unable to find affordable coverage.
 
The proposals in Congress each handle the individual mandate differently.
 
In the bills in the House of Representatives, a person who failed to get coverage would face a penalty of 2.5 percent of their modified adjusted gross income up to the cost of basic health insurance, as defined by the new national health insurance exchange. The House grants exemptions for dependents, religious objections and financial hardship.
 
In the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee caps the penalty at $750. It exempts residents of states that don't establish health insurance exchanges, those for whom affordable coverage is not available, and those without coverage for fewer than 90 days.
 
The Senate Finance Comittee specifies a tax penalty of $950 for an individual and a maximum penalty of $1,900 per family. The penalties are a little lower if the person's income is below 300 percent of the poverty level. People are exempt from the mandate if they live below the poverty level, if the lowest cost insurance exceeds 10 percent of their income, or if there is financial hardship or religious objections.
 
We should note that the bills tend to leave the definitions of financial hardship up to other officials, such as the secretary of Health and Human Services.
 
We're going to duck, for now, the question asked by Stephanopolous, about whether Obama is breaking his promise on raising taxes. If health reform passes, then we'll evaluate the mandate with respect to our Obameter campaign

promises database

. Promise No. 515, ""No family making less than $250,000 will see 'any form of tax increase,'"" is currently rated

Compromise

.
 
The details for these mandates are very much a work in progress, and Congress will ultimately have to vote on one set of standards for the mandate. But all of the Democratic plans include the mandate, which is a tax penalty on those who don't have insurance. The RNC called it ""a tax for not having health insurance,"" and there's no doubt that it is a form of tax. There are provisions for those who face hardship, but absent special circumstances, everyone will have to have coverage. We rate the RNC's statement True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Steny Hoyer']","
Hoyer claims Republicans have no health care alternative
","
No matter which party controls Congress, its leaders usually refer to the opposition as ""the party of no."" The Republicans did it when they were in control, and now it's Democrats' turn.

 

The latest complaint from House Democratic leaders is that Republicans have failed to produce an alternative to the five major health care bills circulating in Congress. 

 

In a Sept. 28, 2009, news release, Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer made this claim:

 

""In June, House Republicans pledged to introduce a bill to reform America’s health care system. Now, over 100 days and numerous excuses later, the 'Party of no' has not only failed to produce legislation, but they have yet to offer any real solutions or ideas on how to make health care more affordable and accessible to American families.""

 

It's a matter of opinion whether Republicans have offered any ""real solutions."" But we can fact-check whether the GOP has, indeed, failed to introduce an alternative.

 

Back in June, when the health care debate was just starting to heat up, Republicans were quick to say they wanted to be involved. Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio said there would be a Republican alternative, one that he said would make health care affordable for everyone; protect people from ""being forced into a new government-run health care plan""; let people keep their doctors and their coverage; ensure that medical decisions are made by doctors; and improve health through prevention and disease management programs.

 

""We believe our plan is a big improvement on the current system that will cost far less than what the administration is proposing,"" said Boehner.

 

Republican Roy Blunt of Missouri, who is leading the GOP's Health Care Solutions Group, pledged his party would offer a bill based on those principles soon enough. ""I guarantee you we will provide you with a bill that costs less and provides better care for the American people,” he said.


Let's pause for a moment to explain some important Washington parlance. On Capitol Hill, many lawmakers present ""plans"" or ""blueprints."" Think of them as a rough draft for an eventual bill. Actually writing a bill is a slightly bigger step, although thousands of bills get introduced every year that never see the light of day — let alone the lights of a committee hearing.


In that regard, Republicans have been prolific. Since the beginning of the year, they have introduced more than 35 health care reform bills. Many deal with small slices of the health care debate. For example, one, by Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas, would allow small businesses to band together to negotiate health care plans with providers. Another, by Rep. Darrell Issa of California, would allow nonfederal employees to enroll in the same health care plan that is currently enjoyed by members of Congress and federal employees.


One bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee, got our attention because it has 44 co-sponsors and tackles many of the goals the GOP leadership outlined early in the summer. The Empowering Patients First Act, would, for example, allow patients to keep their coverage, as Republicans vowed.


But neither that bill nor the others from Republicans has emerged as the Republican alternative. That's partly because the Democrats are in control and have used their own bills as the main legislation, but also because no GOP bill has drawn enough support to get momentum.


We asked Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman, whether Price's bill is the Republican-backed legislation that Blunt promised back in June.

 

""It's an alternative,"" he said of the Price bill, pointing us to a

Web site

that lists several Republican health care bills.

 

For now, there is no single Republican bill, Steel said.

 

A single bill is exactly what the Democratic leadership is looking for, said Hoyer spokeswoman Stephanie Lundberg.

 

""The RSC bill is not the Republican alternative,"" she said. ""When we say that the Republicans don't have a bill, it's because they said they would have an alternative bill,"" backed by the party.


So, back to Hoyer's claim. He contends that the Republicans ""pledged to introduce a bill to reform America’s health care system"" but have failed to do so. That's incorrect in that there are dozens of GOP bills, including several that are highlighted on the Republicans' Web site. But he's right that the Republicans have not rallied behind a single bill the way they suggested back in June. That leaves the Truth-O-Meter stuck in the middle. Half True.

GOP claims video shows public B. Bernice Young Elementary School students made to sing about Obama
","
When we first saw a copy of the

now-viral video

of young school kids singing the praises of President Barack Obama on Sept. 24 (""Hooray, Mr. President, we honor your great plans/To make this country's economy No. 1 again!""), we looked at our watches to see how long it would take for Republican leaders to react.
 
Turned out, not long.
 
The following morning, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sent out a blast e-mail with a link to the video and a plea for donations to the RNC to ""fight this leftist propaganda and elect more Republicans this year and next.""
 
The issue also made the rounds on political radio and TV talk shows. Fox News' Sean Hannity and Kimberly Guilfoyle talked about whether Hannity's head would spontaneously combust or simply explode if his kid had been among those at the school.
 
""That's not too creepy,"" Fox News host Glenn Beck said sarcastically on his Sept. 24 show after showing a clip of the video. ""Did anybody in the room stop and think for a second, 'Wait a minute. I really wouldn't want my kids chanting a song about George W. Bush, so maybe I shouldn't do it with this one?'""
 
By Friday, the number of people who had viewed the video neared half a million.
 
In his e-mail, Steele said he was so stunned and outraged by the video, he felt the need to circulate it immediately.
 
""In the video, impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey, most of whom are no more than six or seven years old, have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama,'"" Steele wrote.
 
""Friend, this is the type of propaganda you would see in Stalin's Russia or Kim Jong Il's North Korea. I never thought the day would come when I'd see it here in America.""
 
You can argue whether or not Steele laid the political rhetoric on a little too thick.
 
The fact we wanted to check was the question that immediately popped into our head when we saw the video, ""Did this really happen at a

public

school?""
 
The short answer is yes. It happened at B. Bernice Young Elementary School in Burlington Township, N.J. That's a public school in the Burlington Township School District. In the video, about 18 second-graders are in an auditorium singing two songs about Obama.
 
Here are some lyrics to the first song:
 

""Mm, mmm, mmm!


 

Barack Hussein Obama


 

He said that all must lend a hand

 

To make this country strong again


 

Mmm, mmm, mm!


 

Barack Hussein Obama


 

He said we must be fair today


 

Equal work means equal pay


 

Mmm, mmm, mmm!""

 
The second song is set to the tune of

The Battle Hymn of the Republic

.
 

""Hello, Mr. President we honor you today!


 

For all your great accomplishments, we all doth say ""hooray!""


 

Hooray, Mr. President! You're number one!


 

The first black American to lead this great nation!


 

Hooray, Mr. President we honor your great plans


 

To make this country's economy No. 1 again!""

 
According to school district officials, the video was shot in February 2009 and was part of a program to recognize famous and accomplished African-Americans during Black History Month.
 
""There was no intention to indoctrinate children,"" District Superintendent Christopher Manno said in a released statement. ""There was no political agenda underlying the activity.""
 
The New Jersey Department of Education also responded via prepared statement.
 
""The commissioner has directed the superintendent to conduct a thorough review of what happened to ensure students can celebrate the achievements of African-Americans during Black History Month without inappropriate partisan politics in the classroom, as well as ensuring the privacy of children is not violated,"" said Beth Auerswald, a spokeswoman for the district. ""In addition, it is our understanding the teacher in question retired at the end of the last school year.""
 
It's unclear who wrote the lyrics or shot the video. In a note to parents and the media on Sept. 24, Superintendent Manno said ""the recording and distribution of the class activity were unauthorized."" Fox News reported that the video was originally posted on the Internet by Charisse Carney-Nunes, author of the children's book

I Am Barack Obama.

We sent an e-mail to the address on Carney-Nunes' Web site and received a response that, ""At this time, Charisse has no comment for press.""
 
On Friday, Fox News caught up with a few parents in the drop-off line at B. Bernice Young Elementary School. Opinions varied about the appropriateness of the songs.
 
Next stop Stalinist Russia? We'll leave that to parents, school officials and political pundits to argue about. We were checking Steele's comment that ""impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey, most of whom are no more than 6 or 7 years old, have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama.'""
 
Yes, they were second-graders, which makes them 7 or 8 years old, and therefore, ""impressionable."" And the video shows the teacher directing them to sing. Most importantly, this was at a public school. So we find Steele's claim to be True.

Barack Obama got many campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs
","
Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore has a new film coming out —

Capitalism: A Love Story

— and he appeared on Comedy Central's

The Colbert Report

to promote it.
 
The show's ironically conservative host, Stephen Colbert, defended capitalism and the bailouts of late 2008, which led to a mock debate between them.
 
At first, Wall Street was actually angry about the bailouts, Colbert claimed. ""Because it might come with strings attached,"" he explained. ""But they forgave Obama when he didn't add any. Now all is forgiven.""
 
""That's why you like Obama so much now?"" Moore asked.
 
""I don't like Obama so much,"" Colbert said. ""On this, I do. And your film is helping me like Obama, because you're a critic of his. You think he's in the pocket of guys like Goldman Sachs.""
 
""I point out in the film that Goldman Sachs is his No. 1 private contributor,"" Moore answered. ""But I voted for the guy. I'm still hopeful that he's going to do the right thing and side with us, and not Wall Street. But the jury's out on that.""
 
We'll let you draw your own conclusions on their debate. We wanted to check Moore's statement about Obama's contributors and the financial services firm Goldman Sachs.
 
Obama made a big deal during the election that he didn't accept money from federal political action committees or lobbyists.
 
But laws require individuals to disclose their occupation and their employer when they donate to federal political candidates. We checked with the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonpartisan group that specializes in analyzing campaign data. Their numbers include contributions from employees and their immediate families.
 
Their analysis of the 2008 presidential campaign found that University of California employees were Obama's top donor, giving a collective $1.6 million. That system is run by the state of California, and hence is a public employer.
 
No. 2 was Goldman Sachs. Goldman employees gave Obama $994,795.
 
Obama's next biggest donors were the employees of Harvard University, Microsoft, Google, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase,  Time Warner, the law firm Sidley Austin, and Stanford University. View Obama's

complete list and amounts

here. Incidentally, Goldman Sachs ranked No.4 on

John McCain's list

of employee contributions, at $230,095.
 
Moore said that Goldman Sachs is Obama's ""No. 1 private contributor."" The data shows that is correct. We rate his statement True.

Hannity says Obama is ""cutting back on defense""
","
During an interview with Sen. John McCain, Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity closed by asking the former Republican presidential candidate whether President Barack Obama was getting soft on defense.
 
""Do you think the president is adopting a pre-9/11 mentality?"" Hannity asked McCain. ""I know those are pretty strong words, but I believe he is. I believe he is weakening our national reaction. I think if you look at Gitmo, Mirandizing enemy combatants, cutting back on defense, you know, slowing down our nuclear. It seems to me it's beyond the pre-9/11 mentality.""
 
For this item we'll focus on just one of Hannity's assertions: that Obama is ""cutting back on defense."" After speaking to several defense budget experts, we've found a clear consensus on that question: maybe.
 
Hannity did not include a time frame or provide qualifiers, so we need to look at his claim by examining some different ways to measure defense spending:
 
--

The base budget vs. the war budget

. Anyone looking at the defense budget must consider two main numbers. One is the base budget, which includes most everything outside of direct war spending. The second is war spending.
 
To compare apples to apples, our sources advised us to stick to the base budget. That avoids lots of budgetary volatility, since war spending can quickly spike or decline depending on the needs on the front lines. The base budget, by contrast, is a more stable indicator of Obama's priorities.
 
Comparing Obama's fiscal year 2010 base budget request for defense to the 2009 fiscal year (which was funded under President Bush) shows an increase from $513.4 billion to $533.8 billion — a jump of 3.9 percent. That's certainly not a cut, and if the budget for 2010 were the only measurement considered, Hannity would be flat-out wrong to say the budget is decreasing.
 
(We should point out that the fiscal year 2010 number includes a one-time shift into the base budget of some items that had been categorized under the war budget during the administration of President George W. Bush. This shift effectively increases the base budget by about $13 billion without affecting how much money is spent on those items. However, even subtracting the newly shifted amount from the fiscal year 2010 increase, the base budget still increased from one year to year the next, so it would not be correct to call that year's change a cut.)
 
And President Obama has proposed that the base budget will continue to rise in absolute dollars through 2014, though by smaller percentages. For fiscal year 2011, it rises by 1.5 percent; for fiscal year 2012, it rises by 1.6 percent; for 2013, it rises by 1.9 percent; and for 2014, it rises by 2.4 percent. Again, using this factor, Hannity would be wrong to say that Obama is cutting defense.
 
--

But what about inflation

? Is it possible for an increase in spending to actually be a cut? In the topsy-turvy world of Washington wonkery, it's possible — if inflation rises more quickly than spending.
 
In the case of the 2009 to 2010 comparison we cited above, experts say inflation is currently so low that it's unlikely to make much of a dent in that increase.
 
Generally, though, inflation plays a significant role. Michael O'Hanlon of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution wrote in a June 10, 2009, op-ed that under Obama, the average increase in the base defense budget between 2010 and 2014 would be about 2 percent a year, which in his view translates into ""no real growth"" because that increase would be largely eaten up by inflation.
 
""The administration is hardly slashing funds for defense; it is simply adopting a policy of zero real growth in the base budget,"" he wrote. ""With the inflation rate expected to average over 1.5 percent, the net effect is essentially no real growth. Cumulatively, that would leave us about $150 billion short of actual funding requirements through 2014.""
 
Making the problem worse is that inflation for defense costs is traditionally higher than inflation for the economy as a whole. ""The cost of almost everything we've been doing in defense has been accelerating upward too fast even for growing budgets to keep up,"" said Stephen Daggett, a defense specialist with the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, in congressional testimony he gave in February 2009. Daggett and O'Hanlon agree that such increases have been driven by personnel costs, including health care and benefits; operations and maintenance; purchases of increasingly complex equipment; and efforts to reorient the military branches to new threats.
 
In other words, just to keep pace, defense spending should really run a couple percentage points higher than general inflation — and under the Obama blueprint, it probably would not do that. (By contrast, during the Bush years of 2001 to 2009, the base defense budget grew at an average real rate of 4.6 percent annually, according to Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments

.)

 
If you factor inflation into the equation, then, Obama is effectively decreeing a slowing of the rate of growth. Hannity could certainly make a case that this amounts to a cut even though Obama is still increasing spending on a year-to-year basis.
 
--

How big is the defense budget compared to gross domestic product

? Another measure of defense spending is to compare it to the United States' gross domestic product.
 
According to Mackenzie Eaglen of the conservative Heritage Foundation, the Obama defense budget drops from 3.81 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.01 percent in 2019. These calculations are always iffy because it's hard to predict GDP a full 10 years out — and the decrease could result from an expansion in the economy rather than a fall in defense spending. But if this measure were used, Hannity could argue with some legitimacy that this amounts to a defense cut.
 
--

Do cuts of particular programs count

? Setting aside what's happening with the defense budget as a whole, the administration is clearly making specific cuts in programs.
 
The administration has said it would cut such programs as the F-22 fighter, the DDG-1000 destroyer, parts of the Army's Future Combat System, the presidential helicopter fleet, aircraft carrier production runs, the airborne laser missile defense program and the next-generation bomber. These certainly qualify as ""cuts"" by the strictest definition of the word, but a more appropriate description might be that they represent a reshuffling of priorities.
 
""These are specific cuts, but they are balanced by increases in other areas,"" said Harrison of CSBA. ""The cuts to specific programs get a lot of attention, but the additions to others don't.""
 
In our view, the cutting of specific weapons programs doesn't count as ""cutting back on defense"" as long as the defense budget is increasing as a whole. So if Hannity was using specific program cuts as his yardstick, his assertion about Obama's defense budget would be unfair.
 
Now it's time to recap. By some measurements, including defense spending as a percentage of GDP, Hannity is right that Obama is ""cutting"" defense. But from 2009 to 2010, the Obama administration is increasing the defense budget, and for a few years after that, he's increasing it in absolute terms (albeit at a slower rate than expected inflation). So whether Hannity is accurate depends on what measurement you use. We're rating his assertion Half True.

Massachusetts legislature flip-flops on governor's senatorial appointment power
","
We've never put an entire legislature to the Flip-O-Meter before. But the recent move by the Massachusetts legislature in filling the seat held by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy was too bold to pass up.


Massachusetts legislators this week approved a bill that allows the governor to appoint a temporary successor to Kennedy. But that came just over five years after legislators stripped the governor's longstanding power to appoint a U.S. senator to fill a vacancy. Both moves were consistent in one sense: In the strongly Democratic state, they advanced the Democratic Party's interests. But the two actions amount to a resounding flip-flop.


In 2004, the state's junior senator, John Kerry, was the Democratic presidential nominee. Party leaders knew that if Kerry won in November, state law allowed the governor — then Republican Mitt Romney — to appoint Kerry's successor, and that person would presumably be a Republican. So, the Democratic leadership of the legislature drew up a measure to strip the governor of his senatorial appointment power.


Under this bill, a special election would be held between 145 and 160 days after the incumbent senator left office. Until that special election was held, the seat would be vacant, and the governor would be unable to appoint an interim senator, something the governor had the right to do previously. The measure passed both chambers and was vetoed by Romney. The Democrats then muscled a two-thirds majority to override the veto. Of course, Kerry never won the presidency, but the law remained on the books.


Fast-forward to 2009. Democrats realized that the law they had enacted in 2004 forced the state to have only one senator for roughly five months — and after Kennedy's death, that meant the state would be short one senator. From a political standpoint, that meant the U.S. Senate would have one less Democrat at a time when a Democratic president was trying to reach a 60-vote threshold to enact landmark legislation on Kennedy's signature issue, health care. And this time, the governor, Deval Patrick, is a Democrat and presumably would appoint someone from his party.


So legislators quickly passed legislation that would keep the special election but still allow the governor to appoint an interim senator to serve until the special election. The measure passed both chambers, and on Sept. 24, 2009, Patrick named former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk, a Kennedy family friend, as the interim senator.


To gauge the magnitude of this flip-flop, we looked back at the roll call votes in the state House from 2004 and 2009. (We were unable to locate the Senate roll calls online.) We found 50 state House members who effectively voted in 2004 to keep Kerry's seat in Democratic hands and also voted this month to appoint an interim senator who — no surprise here — ended up being a Democrat. All 50 were Democrats.


It's worth pointing out that the votes were not about exactly the same thing. The 2009 vote kept in place the 2004 legislation's provisions on the special election, with both bills ultimately putting the choice for the Senate seat in the hands of the voters. Indeed, if we compared the votes on this basis alone, we might have suggested that the legislature had done a Half Flip.


But two factors made the flip-flop more egregious. One was the rhetoric that Democrats used to defend the initial effort to strip gubernatorial appointment power. Many legislators argued that the power to choose U.S. senators ought to reside with the voters, not with one person.


For instance, Democratic state Rep. J. James Marzilli Jr. told the

Boston Globe

in 2004, ""It's ridiculous. We choose senators and members of Congress in elections. We shouldn't let politicians make those choices for us."" The article added that Marzilli ""was unconcerned"" about leaving the seat vacant until the special election. ""We already have a congressional delegation, and we'll always have at least one member in the United States Senate,"" he said.


Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas Finneran charged that Romney wanted to name the next senator ""in a back room,"" according to the

Boston Herald

. He added, ""That's reform? Please.""


And Senate President Robert E. Travaglini said, according to the

Globe

, ""We have always felt that this position is significant enough that no one person should make that determination. It should be decided by the people."" (None of the three Democrats were serving in the legislature by 2009.)


The second factor that underlined the magnitude of the flip-flop is that Democratic legislative leaders in 2004 specifically rejected an entreaty by Romney to allow the governor to pick a temporary senator. In fact, Romney even offered to let Democratic leaders have a say in whom he picked.


As the

Globe

reported on July 12, 2004, a top aide to Romney unveiled the proposal on the steps of the state Capitol, saying the governor was willing to submit the name of a temporary appointee to the House speaker and the Senate president. That appointee would serve until the special election. (The temporary appointee could run in the special election; Kirk has promised not to.)


But in 2004, key Democrats dismissed the governor's proposal. State Sen. Brian Joyce, the Democratic co-chairman of the Election Laws Committee, called it ""a clever political ploy."" It went nowhere.


To be fair, we should note that Republicans also said some things during the 2004 debate that would eventually clash with what they argued in 2009. But we are rating the Massachusetts legislature, which was, and is, controlled by Democrats.


So let's recap. Democratic legislators in 2004 sought to take away the power of a (Republican) governor to appoint an interim senator, arguing that doing so would enable the people to take up their rightful responsibility instead. Five years later, many of those same legislators passed a law enabling a (Democratic) governor to name an interim senator — and in doing so, enacted something very similar to what they had rejected when the (Republican) governor proposed it in 2004. We rate this a Full Flop.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Tim Pawlenty']","
Pawlenty changes course on cap-and-trade
","He hasn't made it official yet, but it seems everything Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty does these days points to a White House run in 2012.

Case in point: his stance on a cap-and-trade plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 
Back in 2007, Pawlenty was positioning himself as an environmental leader, pushing for aggressive reductions in greenhouse gases and a regional cap-and-trade plan.
 
Fast-forward to 2009, and he's writing letters to Washington calling a Democratic plan to curb climate change ""overly bureaucratic, misguided"" and ""very burdensome on our economy.""
 
""His position has evolved very dramatically from someone our group, quite frankly, viewed as a champion"" for the climate, said Steven Morse, executive director of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership, a coalition of more than 80 Minnesota environmental organizations.
 
To track Pawlenty's evolution from treehugger to cap-and-trade skeptic, we need to turn the clock back to 2007. At the time, the Minnesota Legislature was debating the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007, which outlined the state's goals for greenhouse gas reductions. The bill required the state to reduce its emissions 15 percent by 2015 and 80 percent in 2050. It also endorsed the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group, a panel charged with drafting a comprehensive greenhouse gas emission reduction plan to meet those goals.

On May 25, 2007, the day Pawlenty signed the bill, he said the state should have taken action 30 years ago.
 
""The nation has been asleep at the switch, but here in Minnesota we are kick-starting the future by increasing our nation-leading per capita renewable fuel use, boosting cost-saving measures and tackling greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said.
 
Morse said the bill was a major victory for the state, in no small part because it was a bipartisan effort; indeed, Pawlenty had actively pushed for the legislation. 
 
Pawlenty grew his reputation as an environmental pioneer when he played a leading role in persuading members of the Midwest Governors Association to sign the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, an agreement that the states would develop a cap-and-trade mechanism to achieve greenhouse gas reductions in the area.
 
The list of Pawlenty's climate change achievements goes on, including the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group, which he formed to study the impact of climate change and make recommendations for the state. You get the picture. So it was surprising to Morse and other Minnesota environmentalists when Pawlenty wrote a letter to the Minnesota delegation in Washington expressing his opposition to a bill authored by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey that would set up a national cap-and-trade program to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 — only slightly more ambitious than Pawlenty's climate change goals for Minnesota.
 
""This legislation would place significant burdens on individuals and job creators, while doing little to impact its intended goal of changing climate change,"" he wrote on June 24. He described the cap-and-trade provisions in the bill as ""overly bureaucratic, misguided"" and ""very burdensome on our economy.""
 
""I oppose any cap-and-trade system that does not set emissions caps at pragmatic levels or fails to provide free allowances to producers instead of creating an expensive auction that would bid up prices and in turn dramatically increase energy costs,"" Pawlenty wrote in ending the letter.
 
Generally speaking, Minnesota environmentalists say Pawlenty has recently been less aggressive on other climate issues, such as implementing the recommendations of the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group.
 
""He's silent where he used to be a leader,"" said Samantha Chadwick, an environmental associate for Environment Minnesota.
 
Pawlenty has even used the issue to poke fun at the Obama administration.
 
""Apparently, they're announcing that President Obama is making great progress on climate change,"" he said in a July speech to the Republican National Committee. ""He's turning the political climate of the country back to Republicans.""
 
Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., says Pawlenty's conservative tone is a signal of his impending run for president.
 
""Republicans in Minnesota tend to be an ideologically conservative bunch,"" he said. ""If anything, Pawlenty is a bit to the left of his party. His rhetoric has been more conservative in the last few months than it's been most of his career as governor of Minnesota. ... He's repositioned himself.""
 
No matter what Pawlenty's motivations, ""I would call it pretty much a 180-degree evolution,"" said Morse.
 
We couldn't have said it better. Pawlenty has clearly changed his tune on cap-and-trade. We give him a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097644640>],/factchecks/2009/sep/24/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-changes-coursse-cap-and-trade/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Barack Obama']","
No difference between Medicare and Medicare Advantage? Maybe
","President Barack Obama defended plans to cut funding for a program called Medicare Advantage in an interview on  This Week with George Stephanopolous  . Stephanopolous cited defenders of Medicare Advantage, such as Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who say cutting the program isn't fair to people who are currently enrolled in the optional Medicare program. Obama vigorously defended his plan. Medicare Advantage programs, he said, get ""about 14 percent more (in) overpayments, basically subsidies from taxpayers for a program that ordinary Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy. ""Now, they package these things in ways that, in some cases, may make it more convenient for some consumers, but they're overcharging massively for it."" Obama added that he would use the money to close the so-called ""doughnut hole,"" a gap in prescription drug coverage for seniors. We know from our  previous reporting  that Medicare Advantage is more costly than regular Medicare. But we were curious if it had been proven that Medicare and Medicare Advantage produced the same patient outcomes. For those who need a little help on Medicare basics: Traditional Medicare is health insurance that the government offers to senior citizens. Seniors go to their regular doctors (as long as the doctors agree to accept Medicare), and Medicare picks up the bills. The billing system is called fee-for-service, which means that doctors bill for every service they provide. Anyone who is eligible for Medicare can choose to sign up for Medicare Advantage, which pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. It was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened. Some people prefer Medicare Advantage plans, though, because of convenience or because some plans offer extra benefits, such as additional coverage or even cash back through rebates on co-pays. About 23 percent of Medicare beneficiaries choose a Medicare Advantage plan. Medicare Advantage includes several types of programs, everything from HMOs to PPOs to traditional fee-for-service plans. The details of each plan tend to differ depending on geographic location. All this diversity means it's hard to talk about one set of outcomes for Medicare Advantage. We asked the White House what evidence it had to show that ""Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy"" as Medicare Advantage. Staffers pointed us to a March 2009 report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, an independent congressional agency that advises Congress on Medicare policy. We read MedPAC's report, and it seemed pretty down on Medicare Advantage, primarily because of its expense. ""Paying a plan more than the cost for delivering the same services under the FFS (fee-for-service) system is not an efficient use of Medicare funds, particularly in the absence of evidence that such extra payments result in better quality compared to FFS,"" the report said. But the report also noted how difficult it is to compare Medicare Advantage with traditional Medicare. The indicators of quality ""differ greatly among plans and across plan types in MA (Medicare Advantage), and we currently do not have a basis for comparing plan performance with the quality of care in FFS Medicare."" MedPac said it plans to study the topic and issue a report in March 2010 under a mandate from Congress. MedPac was able to report, however, that Medicare Advantage HMOs, especially established HMOs, tend to have better outcomes than other Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, a report from America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said that Medicare Advantage HMOs in California and Nevada reduced hospital days and readmissions compared with traditional Medicare. But HMO plans are not the areas of Medicare Advantage that are growing the most. ""While payment policy in the MA program has led to growth in the number of plans available, growth in access to plans across the country, and increased enrollment, the additional funding has not necessarily resulted in cost containment or better quality of care for enrollees,"" MedPac concluded. ""Much of the enrollment growth is in new plans, which are not showing improvement in quality."" MedPAC is an independent agency, but we wondered if there was any other research on the topic. We checked with two independent policy experts on Medicare — Stuart Guterman of the Commonwealth Fund and Marilyn Moon of the American Institutes for Research — and they both said the information was limited. ""There's not a lot of good data to compare, so there's not really good evidence to say one way or another,"" Guterman said of Medicare versus Medicare Advantage. ""All the plans have to provide the same benefit package that traditional Medicare provides."" Moon said that while Medicare Advantage is open to everyone, there is evidence that the oldest and sickest beneficiaries tend to stay in traditional Medicare, probably because they are more change-averse. So it's possible that Medicare Advantage is paid more to take care of healthier seniors. ""That bothers me considerably,"" Moon said. We also reviewed consumer advice on Medicare plans. Most of the advice says that individuals should research and select their plans carefully based on their own health conditions and preferences. We didn't see any advice that drew broad conclusions about which was better, Medicare or Medicare Advantage. Finally, the White House sent us a statement emphasizing the president's point and renewing his promise to curtail extra payments to Medicare Advantage. ""There is no evidence that this extra payment leads to better quality for Medicare beneficiaries,"" said White House spokeswoman Katherine Bedingfield. ""Insurers, not beneficiaries or the Medicare program, determine how these overpayments are used — and this includes marketing and other administrative costs. This means that seniors do not always get the full overpayments back in the form of extra benefits. Additionally, some plans offer lower cost-sharing for drugs and vision care but higher cost-sharing for services such as hospitalizations and home health services. As a result, seniors can end up spending more out of pocket under a Medicare Advantage plan, not less.     ""Reducing these Medicare overpayments will affirm President Obama’s promise to strengthen the Medicare program, extend its solvency and reduce premiums for all beneficiaries."" President Obama said, ""Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy"" as Medicare Advantage. We found little statistical evidence that would definitively confirm or refute this. MedPAC, the independent agency that reports to Congress, said it had no reason to think that Medicare Advantage overall was superior to regular Medicare. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty that merits further study. We rate Obama's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DBB040>],/factchecks/2009/sep/24/barack-obama/difference-medicare-medicare-advantage-maybe/

Hannity says U.S. is reducing its nuclear arsenal
","
It's no secret that conservative talk show host Sean Hannity has issues with the Obama administration's direction on national defense.
 
On the eve of a global summit in New York, Hannity questioned the wisdom of the Obama administration's commitment to reducing the nation's nuclear arsenal.
 
""Here is the situation,"" Hannity said during a Fox News interview with Sen. John McCain on Sept. 22. ""We've got (Iranian president Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, just on the heels of coming to New York, again denying that the Holocaust took place. Our own National Security Agency says that their nuclear ambitions are advancing, and at the same time we see what happens — we are slashing our own nuclear arsenal.""
 
We decided to look into Hannity's statement, if only to put it into proper context.
 
First off, during a speech on Sept. 18, Ahmadinejad did again question whether the Holocaust was a ""real event,"" and said that the Jewish state of Israel was created out of ""a lie and mythical claim."" And intelligence reports do, in fact, suggest that while Iran does not yet have nuclear weapons, and claims not to be pursuing them, it has made progress in its ability to enrich uranium and might only be a few years away from developing nuclear weapon capabilities.
 
As for the United States slashing its nuclear arsenal, that's also true.
 
In fact, it's been true for a couple decades, ever since the Cold War ended. Under treaty agreements that started under President Ronald Reagan, and due to retirement of old weapons, the United States and Russia have been steadily cutting the number of nuclear weapons that are ready to be used either from bombers, submarines or ground-based missile silos.
 
The current treaty that covers the counting and verification of nuclear weapon reductions is called START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), and it expires in December. It has resulted in the reduction of some 80 percent of all strategic nuclear weapons.
 
President Barack Obama has said that his goal is to reduce nuclear weaponry in the United States and Russia even further.
 
During the presidential campaign, Obama promised ""deep, verifiable reductions in all U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons — whether deployed or nondeployed, whether strategic or nonstrategic — and to work with other nuclear powers to reduce global stockpiles dramatically by the end of an Obama presidency.""
 
In his defining speech on nuclear weapons as president, Obama in April spoke to an audience in Prague about his long-term vision for a world free of nuclear weapons.
 
""So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons,"" Obama said. ""I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly — perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, 'Yes, we can.'


In July, Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in London to set up the framework for a new START treaty. And both sides have committed to seeking a new agreement by the end of the year to make further reductions in their nuclear arsenals. Currently, the U.S. and Russian arsenals comprise about 95 percent of all the nuclear weapons that are known to exist in the world.
 
But neither side is talking about eliminating its nuclear arsenal any time soon. The number of weapons possessed by both sides is, and would remain under any new treaty, enormous relative to the number of weapons possessed by other countries.
 
So Hannity is clearly right that the United States is reducing its nuclear arsenal. It was even one of Obama's

campaign promises

. But the statement implies that this is a change in strategy under Obama. In fact, it is a continuing policy that began under President Reagan (a Hannity favorite). And while Obama may talk of a nuclear free world, it's in long-range terms. So we find Hannity's claim Mostly True.

Obama right that Roosevelt was called a socialist and a communist
","
Sound familiar?
 
The president was accused of being ""a socialist, not a Democrat."" His plan was described as ""undisguised state socialism."" One critic, who controlled some powerful media outlets, suggested that communists had infiltrated the president's administration.
 
Those are some of the attacks that Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced in the 1930s — attacks cited recently by President Barack Obama to emphasize that he's not unique.
 
Obama has mentioned the Roosevelt comparison several times recently, including during an interview on

Late Night with David Letterman

on Sept. 21, 2009:
 
""What's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes, particularly during times of economic unease, then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up,"" Obama said. ""FDR was called a socialist and a communist.""
 
Indeed, Roosevelt was called a socialist or a communist many times. Most of that criticism came in the 1930s, when he was enacting programs intended to pull the country out of the Great Depression.
 
• ""Roosevelt is a socialist, not a Democrat,"" declared Republican Rep. Robert Rich of Pennsylvania during a debate on the House floor on July 23, 1935. That remark came after Republicans hinted they were considering a move to impeach Roosevelt, according to the

New York Times

.
 
• ""The New Deal is now undisguised state socialism, declared Senator Simeon D. Fess (R-Ohio) today as he pictured President Roosevelt as the New Deal's leading socialist,"" reported the

Chicago Daily Tribune

on Aug. 7, 1934. ""The president's recent statements,"" Fess said, ""remove any doubt of his policy of state socialism, which necessitates increased activities of the government in either ownership or operation of industry, or both.""
 
• ""The Russian newspapers during the last election [1932] published the photograph of Franklin D. Roosevelt over the caption, 'The first communistic President of the United States,'"" said Sen. Thomas Schall, a Republican from Minnesota. ""Evidently the Russian newspapers had knowledge concerning the ultimate intent of the President, which had been carefully withheld from the voters in this country.  In fact, the voters of the United States were meticulously misled as to such intentions."" We found Schall's comments in the book,

All But the People: Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Critics, 1933-1939

.
 
And then there's FDR being called a socialist by William Randolph Hearst. 
 
Hearst, a newspaper mogul, initially supported Roosevelt. But he gradually became disillusioned with the new president's policies. He especially hated Roosevelt's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, and his papers routinely referred to the New Deal as the Raw Deal.
 
By 1936, when Roosevelt was running for re-election, Hearst decided to support Republican Alf Landon and oppose Roosevelt with all the power of the press he could muster.
 
Historian Ben Procter summarized this moment in history in his book

William Randolph Hearst: The Later Years, 1911-1951

:
 
""On September 6, Hearst newspapers began a prolonged assault on the administration. The

New York American

published a front-page editorial titled, 'The Radical Brand on the New Deal.' It charged that radical and communist leaders had already given their approval to support Roosevelt against Landon. During the next two weeks Hearst editors trumpeted these recurring themes: that communists had infiltrated the New Deal; that communism was un-American and undemocratic; that 'America can only judge Mr. Roosevelt and his administration by the strange silence that has prevailed in official quarters.'""
 
That was as much as Roosevelt was willing to take. The White House issued a statement that mentioned ""a certain notorious newspaper owner,"" and rebutted the accusations. The statement concluded, ""The American people will not permit their attention to be diverted from real issues to fake issues which no patriotic, honorable, decent citizen would purposefully inject into American affairs.""
 
Hearst shot back in a front-page editorial, which he signed personally. ""Let me say that I have not stated at any time whether the President willingly or unwillingly received the support of the Karl Marx Socialists, the Frankfurter radicals, communists and anarchists, the Tugwell bolsheviks, and the Richberg revolutionists which constitute the bulk of his following,"" Hearst wrote. ""I have simply said and shown that he does receive the support of these enemies of the American system of government, and that he has done his best to deserve the support of all such disturbing and destructive elements.""
 
Hearst's efforts were for naught. Roosevelt won the 1936 election in a landslide, while the Hearst newspaper chain slid into bankruptcy.
 
There's not much controversy on this one, but it did provide an interesting opportunity to review American history. We rate Obama's statement True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Bruce Braley']","
Iowa Democrat says families spend $13,000 a year for health coverage
","
One of the biggest skirmishes in the health care debate has been over how much ordinary Americans pay for coverage — either under the current system, as Democrats like to point out, or under the new Democratic proposals, as Republicans regularly emphasize. In a Sept. 16, 2009, speech on the House floor, Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley of Iowa argued in favor of the House health care bill, H.R. 3200, by asserting that the status quo is financially unsustainable.
 
""Recent census data shows that the average American family spends over $13,000 a year for health care coverage,"" Braley said. ""And if we don’t change what we are doing right now, in 10 years the average American family will be spending over $25,000 a year on health care coverage. That’s why the time to act is now, and H.R. 3200 does that by expanding access to quality, affordable coverage and bringing true health care reform to the American people.""
 
For this item, we'll focus on the assertion that the average American family spends over $13,000 a year for health care coverage. We called Braley's office, and staffers acknowledged that Braley misspoke when he said the numbers come from the Census Bureau. In fact, the numbers come from a study released the day before Braley spoke — a survey of employer-provided health care undertaken annually by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust, an affiliate of the American Hospital Association.
 
The Kaiser/HRET study found that the average annual premium for family coverage under an employer-based plan is $13,375. To come up with that figure, the study used data from 3,188 randomly selected employers with three or more employees.
 
But there's a problem: It's not accurate to say, as Braley does, that ""the average American family spends over $13,000 a year for health care coverage."" It's true that Kaiser/HRET found the total cost of health care premiums for a family to be $13,375 — but that is

not

the amount the average family pays out of its own pocket.
 
This is not a trivial distinction. For employer-based health care, which was the only kind Kaiser/HRET studied, the employer pays nearly three-quarters of the freight — $9,860 to be exact, compared with $3,515 for the employee.
 
Now, there are legitimate concerns about health care costing $13,375 per family per year. It's a substantial economic burden for companies to pay so much for their workers' health care, and doing so probably holds down employee wages and economic growth.
 
But Braley didn't say that the high premiums are an economic burden on the economy or on companies. He specifically said that $13,000 is what ""the average American family spends."" And that's not correct.
 
The Kaiser/HRET estimate of the family share being $3,515 is in the same ballpark as others. The Consumer Expenditure Survey, produced by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, found that household health care expenditures — which go beyond just health insurance premiums — were $2,853 in 2007, the last year for which data are available. (Only Americans with employer-sponsored health care are included in the Kaiser/HRET survey, which accounts for much of the difference between the two surveys.)
 
A third study, brought to our attention by Braley's staff, was by Milliman Inc., a health care and benefits consulting firm. A study of 2009 health care costs found that the average cost for a family of four is $16,771. The number is a bit higher than Kaiser/HRT's because it also includes family out-of-pocket costs rather than just the cost of insurance premiums.
 
Calculating it this way does increase the size of the employee share of all health care costs. According to the Milliman study, employees paid $4,004 for health premiums and $2,820 out of pocket, for a total of $6,824. (The employer contribution was $9,947.) So, Milliman has employers paying a larger dollar amount than what Kaiser found, but the family portion is still well short of the $13,000 Braley cited.
 
As was the case in a number of other recent PolitiFact items we deemed False (including

this one

and

this one

), Braley would have been correct if he'd simply tweaked what he said. If he'd cited data showing that ""the annual health care premiums for the average American family are greater than $13,000,"" he would have been right.
 
But by adding confusion to the debate, Braley has muddied some already murky waters. In a Sept. 20, 2009, column prompted by the Kaiser/HRET study, Ezra Klein of the

Washington Post

summarized why misconceptions about the cost of health care matter.
 
""Imagine if people who touched a hot stove felt only a small fraction of the pain from the burn,"" Klein wrote. ""That's pretty much what's happening in our health care system. It hurts enough that we would prefer it to stop, but the urgency is lost. That's the dilemma for Washington wonks trying to fix this mess: They look at the numbers and see health care costs crushing our economy, overwhelming our government, swallowing our wages. But the public isn't feeling it. Virtually no one cuts a $13,375 check for health care. Most pay 27 percent of it, or even less.""
 
Jeff Giertz, the communications director for Braley, acknowledged PolitiFact's interpretation of the data, but added, ""Regardless of how you measure it, the costs are high and getting higher — there’s certainly no disputing that.""
 
Still, even inadvertently glossing over the meaning of these numbers gives the false impression that American families are paying approximately four times as much as they actually are for health care. We rate Braley's statement False.

Did Obama flip on whether he would continue to pursue a missile shield in Poland?
","
When President Barack Obama announced on Sept. 17, 2009, that he had decided to scrap the Bush administration's plans for a long-range missile defense shield in Poland in favor of a different missile defense plan, an astute PolitiFact reader called our attention to an interview Obama did during the campaign in which Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly tried to pin Obama down on this very issue.
 
""Here's a Flip Flop for you from Obama!"" the reader wrote, with a helpful

YouTube link to the interview

(fast forward to about the 3:40 mark).
 
After introducing the issue of a missile shield in Poland, here's the full text of the exchange on Sept. 10, 2008:
 
""Putin doesn't like it,"" O'Reilly said. ""Are you gonna keep that missile shield in there?""
 
""I've said this before,"" Obama responded, ""the Russians are playing a game when they pretend this missile shield is directed against all their ICBMs.""
 
""It's ridiculous,"" O'Reilly agreed. ""It's a defensive thing.""
 
""It's a defensive thing,"" Obama repeated.
 
""So you're going to keep them then?"" O'Reilly asked again.
 
""Given what has happened in Georgia, I think we have to send a clear signal that Poland and other countries in that region are not going to be subject to intimidation and aggression,"" Obama said.
 
""Okay, I just want to get this on the record,"" O'Reilly said. ""You're elected president, you're keeping the missile shield in Poland.""
 
Said Obama: ""I think the missile shield is appropriate. I want to make sure it works though. I want to make sure it works, which is actually one of the problems we've got.""
 
Back in December 2006, President George W. Bush — on the advice of Defense Secretary Robert Gates — announced plans to place 10 ground-based interceptor missiles in Poland and an advanced radar in the Czech Republic. Although the idea was to destroy any long-range missiles that might be fired from the Middle East (specifically from Iran), the plan was sharply criticized by Russian officials who said they saw the missile shield as a threat to Russia.


Fast-forward nearly three years to Sept. 17: The White House announced a shift in missile defense policy that called for scrapping the plans for advanced radar in the Czech Republic as well as the missile defense shield in Poland. Instead, the announcement said, President Obama called for a reshaped system designed to shoot down short- and medium-range missiles from sites closer to Iran.
 
The change in focus was immediately criticized by Republican rivals.
 
""Only a year since Russia invaded Georgia, and 70 years to the day since the Soviet Union invaded Poland, the Obama administration is continuing its policy of appeasing adversaries at the expense of our allies,"" said Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
 
In a op-ed response in the

New York Times

, Defense Secretary Gates said it was he who recommended the change. The missile defense plan that included a long-range missile defense shield in Poland was ""the best plan based on the technology and threat assessment available"" at the time Gates said he recommended it to Bush in 2006. But based in part on new intelligence, Gates said, he and other members of the national security team and senior military leadership decided on a ""more suitable approach"" to deploy ""proven, sea-based SM-3 interceptor missiles — weapons that are growing in capability — in the areas where we see the greatest threat to Europe.""


""This will be a far more effective defense should an enemy fire many missiles simultaneously — the kind of attack most likely to occur as Iran continues to build and deploy numerous short- and medium-range weapons,"" Gates wrote. ""At the same time, plans to defend virtually all of Europe and enhance the missile defense of the United States will continue on about the same schedule as the earlier plan as we build this system over time, creating an increasingly greater zone of protection.
 
""We are strengthening — not scrapping — missile defense in Europe,"" Gates concluded.
 
We're not wading into the debate over the appropriateness of the new missile defense strategy. Our concern here is whether Obama has flip-flopped on the issue since the campaign.
 
O'Reilly was pretty persistent in trying to pin Obama down to a verbal commitment for or against the missile shield in Poland. And Obama finally answered that he thought the missile shield was ""appropriate."" But he left himself a little wiggle room when he added, ""I want to make sure it works, which is actually one of the problems we've got.""
 
We went back and looked at some of Obama's other comments about a missile shield in Poland at that time to get a better sense of his position then.
 
In campaign literature, Obama said, ""We must seek a nuclear missile defense and demand that those efforts use resources wisely to build systems that would actually be effective. Missile defense requires far more rigorous testing to ensure that it is cost-effective and, most importantly, will work.""
 
After his election victory, the Obama-Biden transition Web site said its administration would ""support missile defense, but ensure that it is developed in a way that is pragmatic and cost-effective; and, most importantly, does not divert resources from other national security priorities until we are positive the technology will protect the American public.""
 
After Obama made a courtesy call to Polish President Lech Kaczynski shortly after his election in November, a statement released by Kaczynski's office claimed Obama pledged ""that the antimissile shield will be continued."" But Denis McDonough, Obama's senior foreign policy adviser, quickly responded that Obama made no such commitment.
 
""His position is as it was throughout the campaign, that he supports deploying a missile defense system when the technology is proved to be workable,"" McDonough said.
 
In an interview on CBS's

Face the Nation

on Sept. 20, 2009, Obama said it simply ""hadn't been shown"" that the missile defense shield in Poland would meet his requirement that it be ""cost-effective, that the technologies are operable, that it's our best possible strategy."" Rather, he said, Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff ""came back to me and said, you know what, given what we know now we actually think that this is a better way of doing it. So we're not eliminating missile defense — in fact what we're doing is putting a system in that's more timely, more cost-effective, and that meets the actual threats that we perceive coming from Iran.""
 
There's no question that Obama changed his position from calling the missile-defense shield in Poland ""appropriate"" when pressed by O'Reilly in September 2008. And that change surely disappointed a number of officials in Poland. But then, as on numerous other occasions, Obama tempered his support for the long-range missile defense shield in Poland with the qualifiers that he wanted to ""make sure it works,"" that it is cost-effective and ""does not divert resources from other national security priorities."" Obama ultimately decided the plan did not meet those tests. And so we give this a Half Flip.

National Right to Life Committee claims under Baucus bill, federal funds would subsidize abortions
","
In his plan for health care reform, Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., hoped to eliminate abortion as a wedge issue.
 
Good luck with that, senator.
 
With an issue as contentious and complex as abortion, appeasing both sides is almost impossible.
 
""This is a health care bill,


not an abortion bill,"" Baucus


said. ""The attempt here is to find language that just maintains the status quo.""
 
The National Right to Life Committee is having none of it.
 
In a sharply worded news release on Sept. 16, NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson said the Baucus bill ""contains an array of proabortion mandates and federal subsidies for elective abortion.""
 
Legislators on both sides of the abortion issue are choosing their words carefully as they discuss the health care reform plans. We decided to look at two claims by Johnson that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric.
 
In a separate item, we examine a claim from Johnson that the Baucus bill ""contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion."" The Baucus plan would, in fact, allow private companies participating in the exchange, as well as the co-op, to offer abortion services. And people in both those plans could see federal subsidies. We looked at this issue in some detail here and ruled the claim

True.

 
But in this item we delve into a second claim in Johnson's statement.
 
Contrary to President Barack Obama's pledge before Congress on Sept. 9 that ""no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions,"" Johnson said, under the Baucus bill, ""federal funds would subsidize coverage of elective abortions.""
 
Some may say this Johnson statement is the same as the other one. If the government subsidizes people who are allowed to get plans that provide abortion coverage, then taxpayers are subsidizing abortion, right? It's not that simple, and we'll explain why.
 
First let's look at some of the particulars of the Baucus plan as it relates to abortion.
 
According to Baucus' chairman's mark, which provides a blueprint for the plan, abortion cannot be mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. However, health plans in the exchange or co-op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage. The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan. Baucus' alternative to a public option, a co-op, would be one alternative on the exchange (think of it as a credit union for health insurance).
 
The Baucus plan explicitly states that no federal funds — whether through tax credits or cost-sharing credits — could be used to pay for abortions (again, unless the pregnancy is due to rape, incest, or if the life of the mother is in danger).
 
Insurers participating in any state-based exchange that offers coverage for abortion ""must segregate from any premium and cost-sharing credits an amount of each enrollee's private premium dollars that is determined to be sufficient to cover the provision of those services."" The Health and Human Services secretary would also have to estimate, on an average actuarial basis, the cost of abortion coverage (not less than $1 per month). And any money used for abortions would have to come out of that pot of money. So the dollars would be technically segregated. And lastly, every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not.
 
But Johnson said that still ""amounts to a surcharge specifically for elective abortions.""
 
The wording in the bill isn't entirely clear, but by our reading, the way it would work is that the government would provide health care subsidies of a certain amount whether an insurer covers abortion or not. So if an insurer wants to cover it, that additional cost would be on the insurer, who would presumably pass that cost on to the insured. And the insurers would have to keep a tab on the extra amount paid for abortion coverage and make sure that any money used for abortion comes strictly from premiums paid by its customers, not from federal subsidies. The bottom line is that people who choose plans that cover abortion would have to pay the added cost of such coverage.
 
But according to Johnson, that's little more than a bookkeeping exercise.
 
""Funds spent by federal agencies are, by law, federal funds,"" Johnson stated. ""The claim that under these bills, a federal agency would use 'private funds' to subsidize abortions is absurd on its face — a political hoax.""
 
When this issue came up in a House version of the plan, we at PolitiFact ruled that an amendment from Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., seemed like a reasonable effort to segregate funds so that tax dollars would not go to directly fund abortions.
 
We caught a lot of flak from people who argued the public option envisioned in the House plan, because it might include abortion and certainly would pay subsidies to some who bought into it, was tantamount to federal subsidies for abortion.
 
In an article titled, ""Does Health Care Cover Abortion or Not? Fact Checking the Fact Checkers,"" BeliefNet editor in chief Steven Waldman took us to task a bit for our black-and-white finding and concluded, ""Some of this does not involve matters of 'fact' or 'truth' or 'lies' but rather subjective judgment calls, a land where ideologues don't function well but legislators must.""
 
In an article this week, Waldman wrote that Baucus may have solved the abortion riddle, largely because Baucus' plan does not include a public option, which left open the possibility that it would cover abortions.
 
""There's a more nuanced debate about whether it would subsidize abortion directly, but Baucus short-circuits that debate by eliminating the public option entirely,"" Waldman wrote.
 
Johnson highlights another part of the Baucus plan to bolster his case. The Baucus plan would provide $6 billion in federal seed money to cover startup costs and meet solvency requirements for the co-ops. Johnson argues there's no telling how co-ops might use this money, that there isn't any language to prohibit it from being used to fund abortions.
 
We think the earlier language — that specifically prohibits federal funds to be used for abortion — covers that. And while we can see an argument that that $6 billion provides a benefit to co-ops that may have abortion coverage, we think it's a stretch to call that subsidizing abortions.
 
""You get into some real gray areas,"" Waldman told us in a phone interview.
 
In Waldman's estimation, the Baucus bill still allows for some indirect federal funding of abortion.
 
""The only question is, is it indirect enough?"" Waldman said. ""Is it very indirect or very, very, very indirect subsidizing. And that's a legitimate question.""
 
Here's Planned Parenthood's take on the Baucus plan: ""Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward, and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable, quality health care from the provider of their choice. While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance bill specifically singles out abortion, we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward.

 

""As it currently stands, it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited — and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades, while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion.""
 
We agree with Johnson that federal dollars would be going to insurers that may provide abortion coverage — and this is some new territory for the federal government. And we see the argument about the bookkeeping shell game of segregating premiums from government funding so that abortion costs are not pulled from the pot of money kicked in by the government. But if the government isn't paying any more to an insurance company to pay for abortion coverage, it means that insurance companies that offer such coverage are. So essentially that cost will be passed on to the insured people who select plans that cover abortions. Perhaps a federal court would view this differently, but we think the court of common sense says that if someone claims abortion would be subsidized with federal funds, it suggests more federal tax dollars would pour into plans that cover abortion. But they won't. The added cost will be borne by the people who select plans that include abortion coverage. Those premiums will pay for abortions.
 
We found Rep. John Boehner's claim that Democratic plans for health reform would provide federal subsidies for abortion

False as it related to the Capps Amendment

in a House version of health care reform, and we find it's even more of a stretch in Baucus' plan, which does not even include a public option. And so we rule this claim False.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'National Right to Life Committee']","
National Right to Life Committee says Baucus bill would permit federal subsidies to go to insurance plans that cover abortions
","
With the recent release of the Senate Finance Committee plan for health care reform, the abortion issue has re-emerged in the health care debate.
 
And both sides are choosing their words carefully to score political points.
 
We are examining two seemingly similar statements from the National Right to Life Committee that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric.
 
One is that under the bill proposed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., federal funds (tax dollars) would subsidize abortions; and the other is that federal subsidies would go to insurance companies that offer abortion coverage. They sound similar, but we ended up with rulings at opposite ends of our Truth-O-Meter.
 
We take a look at the first claim, that federal tax dollars would subsidize abortions, in a separate item and conclude the statement is

False

.
 
In this item, we deal with a statement from NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson that the Baucus bill ""contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion.""
 
If you look carefully, the issue here is government involvement in plans that offer abortion.
 
And that's a big deal.
 
The 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees.
 
Baucus said he attempted to ""find language that just maintains the status quo"" on abortion, because he didn't want the issue to be a distraction. ""This is a health care bill, not an abortion bill,"" Baucus said.
 
Maintaining the status quo, however, is a matter of perception. And that's because there are two competing realities.
 
On the one hand, as President Barack Obama acknowledged in a July 21 interview, ""We ... have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care."" In other words, the more than 250 private health plans that cover federal employees — because they are subsidized by the federal government — cannot offer full abortion services.
 
On the other hand, many private plans (outside the government) currently offer abortion services. If the government starts providing health care subsidies but bans the participation of any plan that offers abortion services (as some legislators have suggested), abortion rights groups argue it would strip millions of women of benefits they currently get.
 
According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women have health insurance that covers abortions.
 
According to Baucus' chairman's mark, which provides a blueprint for the plan, abortion cannot be a mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. However, health plans in the exchange or co-op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage. In fact, every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not. The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan. Baucus' alternative to a public option, a co-op, would be one alternative on the exchange (think of it as a credit union for health insurance).
 
The plan provides federal dollars — through tax credits or cost-sharing credits — to subsidize the cost of insurance for people with modest incomes. 
 
So clearly, you'd have federal subsidies going to plans that cover abortions. But no more federal money would go to plans that offer abortion, so the added cost would presumably be passed on to consumers who choose plans that offer abortion, and efforts have been made to segregate funding so that only money from premiums — not tax dollars — would be used to pay for abortions.
 
But if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude the Baucus plan (or any other Democratic plan under consideration) would mean more women would have access to abortion services.
 
That obviously doesn't sit well with National Right to Life and other antiabortion groups. Johnson said they'd like to see an amendment that would prohibit any insurer that gets federal subsidies from offering abortion services. Amendments to that effect failed in the House.
 
The plan, as proposed, would lead to more abortion coverage, and therefore more abortions, Johnson said.
 
The Hyde Amendment, he said, is ""one of the most important abortion reduction policies adopted by Congress."" Not only can't the federal government subsidize abortion, he said, it can’t subsidize plans that offer abortion. The Baucus bill, he said, is ""a big departure from where we are now.""
 
Here's Planned Parenthood's take on the Baucus plan: ""Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward, and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable, quality health care from the provider of their choice. While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance Bill specifically singles out abortion, we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward.

 

""As it currently stands, it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited — and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades, while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion.""
 
In the abortion debate, nothing is simple. And as we said, words are chosen carefully. Regarding Johnson's claim that the Baucus plan would result in ""federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion,"" we think he is on solid ground. One could argue whether or not this is a departure from making the bill ""abortion neutral"" — each side has its take on that — but the fact is the plan would allow insurers to offer abortion. And the plan includes federal subsidies to some who might choose to join such a plan. And so we rule Johnson's statement True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Michelle Obama']","
Michelle Obama claims that domestic violence counts as a pre-exisiting condition in some states
","
In his effort to pass a health care overhaul, President Barack Obama has enlisted help from a close ally — his wife, Michelle.

 

On Sept. 18, 2009, the first lady gave a speech about the importance of health care reform to women, and cited several reasons she thinks the current system is gender-biased.

 

This line caught our attention:

 

""Women are affected because, as we heard, in many states, insurance companies can still discriminate because of gender,"" she said. ""And this is still shocking to me. These are the kind of facts that still wake me up at night. ... In some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence.""

 

Health reform bills under consideration by Congress would prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-exisiting conditions, an issue we've already

explored

; we've also examined how

pregnancy can sometimes be

a basis to deny coverage, and how pre-exisiting conditions already lead to

health care rationing

by private health insurers.


But we'd never heard domestic abuse could count as a pre-existing condition, so we decided to look into the claim. 


The issue first came to light in 1994, when a Pennsylvania woman was denied health, life and mortgage disability insurance because of domestic violence, according to the Women's Law Project. That group, along with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, began advocating for legislation to expressly prohibit the practice. Since then, most states, including Pennsylvania, have adopted laws prohibiting the practice.


But, as Mrs. Obama said in her speech, denying coverage due to a history of domestic abuse is still legal in some states. Those states are Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming, and the District of Columbia, according to the National Women's Law Center.


The claim has become a

popular talking point

for groups supporting health care reform such as the Service Employees International Union. (It's been discussed so much recently that Arkansas, which had no prohibition, this year passed a law prohibiting discrimination against domestic violence victims.) A

Huffington Post story

about the laws last week prompted several states and insurance companies to say that the laws have been changed or that the companies don't treat domestic violence as a pre-existing condition.


The North Carolina situation is a matter of some disagreement. Although the Women's Law Center says the practice is still allowed, state officials say they interpret the laws to mean it is not.


Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney told the

Jackson Free Press

that he wanted to explore whether insurance companies were taking advantage of the law:

 

""I've got to get some of my lawyers to do some research on this, but we have only six mandated (conditions that must be covered) in our state statues, and we have 25 or more optional coverages, but domestic abuse doesn't seem to be one of them. ... The whole situation is bad. Let's say a woman works with a company that had Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and she gets beat up in her house and Blue Cross says 'we're not covering you because getting beat up is your pre-existing condition.' That's terrible.""


Meanwhile, Wyoming Department of Insurance staff attorney James Mitchell told the

Huffington Post

that state law does not expressly prohibit insurers from using domestic abuse as grounds to deny coverage, though he'd found no cases of the practice in his state.


Mitchell's response raises an important point: Just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean that insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole.


Back in the 1990s there was evidence that the practice was widespread. In 1994, a House Judiciary Committee panel conducted an informal survey and found that eight of the 16 largest insurers in the country used domestic violence as a factor in deciding coverage. And a year later, the Insurance Commission of Pennsylvania reported that a formal survey showed that 24 percent of accident, health and life insurers took domestic violence into account when deciding whether to issue and renew insurance policies.


But that data is more than 10 years old, so we asked Lisa Codispoti, senior counsel for the National Women's Law Center, if insurance companies are still denying health care coverage based on domestic violence history.


Examples are hard to come by, she said, because people who get coverage through an employer don't usually face exclusions about pre-existing condititions. Only people who apply for individual coverage would, she said.


""It's such a small number of people who apply for individual insurance,"" she said. ""And it's not like insurance companies have to tell you why you're being denied coverage.""


Indeed, underwriting standards are private, said Nancy Durborow, health projects coordinator for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, making it difficult for groups such as hers to find out how widespread the practice still is.


""This is very secretive stuff,"" she said.
 
A spokesman for the association representing insurance companies told us he's not aware of any insurers that deny women coverage based on history of domestic abuse. And the group supports a proposal by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that would fully prohibit the practice.


""No one should be denied coverage because they are victims of domestic abuse,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans.


We find that the first lady is correct that ""in some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence."" Putting aside the disputed North Carolina law, there still are several other states — including Mississippi and Wyoming — that have no specific laws prohibiting the practice. It's important to note that we couldn't find this was happening on a widespread basis — or even just a little bit. But still, Mrs. Obama is correct and we rate the claim True.
