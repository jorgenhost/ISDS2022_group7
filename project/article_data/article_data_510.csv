Jerry Patterson says Barack Obama broke his promise to have an immigration reform bill during the first year of his presidency
","
Texas Republicans descended on the Capitol en masse when President Barack Obama was in Austin last week. But they weren't exactly welcoming. 
At the GOP's Aug. 9 ""Hands Off Texas"" rally demanding that Obama, well, keep his hands of Texas, Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson suggested Obama just tells voters what they want to hear. He rattled off a list of promises that the president has failed to keep. 
Immigration reform is a hot-button issue running up to the mid-term elections, so we wondered about Patterson's flip question to the crowd: ""Remember when he said there will be an immigration bill in the first year?"" 
Incidentally, when we asked Patterson to point to the promise in question, he pointed back at us. ""Got that from the PolitiFact website, I think,"" he said. ""The details are on there."" 
The national PolitiFact site has endeavored to track the president's promises on its ""Obameter."" PolitiFact has compiled more than 500 promises Obama made during his campaign, which it then rates as Kept, Broken or a Compromise. 
Which brings us back to a pledge Obama made as a candidate in May 2008, during an interview with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. 
""I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,"" Obama said. ""But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible."" 
But well into Obama's second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by the president has been introduced in Congress. 
PolitiFact searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org, a nonpartisan website that tracks politicians' voting records, and turned up pages of speeches where Obama mentioned immigration reform. Notably, in April 2009, Obama said that he saw the immigration reform ""process moving this first year"" and in June 2009, he assigned Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to put together a framework for comprehensive reform. In September 2009, he said he anticipated ""that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting."" 
Famous last words? The year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On Dec. 15, 2009, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, introduced a bill, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies told PolitiFact that it was not promoted or publicly supported by the Obama administration. To gain legal status under the bill, illegal immigrants already here would have to demonstrate they have been working, pay a $500 fine, learn English and undergo a criminal background check, among other provisions, according to the New York Times. 
Saying he was frustrated with Obama for not leading an overhaul of immigration laws, Gutierrez, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' immigration task force, was arrested with other protesters after a sit-in in front of the White House on May 1. Gutierrez ""said he believes he has a responsibility to point out that Mr. Obama has not fulfilled a campaign pledge to pass overhaul legislation, which is known to supporters as comprehensive immigration reform,"" according to the New York Times. 
This year, Obama has continued to push immigration reform in his speeches, like his State of the Union address Jan. 27: ""We should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system — to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation,"" he said. 
In March, he announced that Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had finished working on a bipartisan framework ""to fix our broken immigration system."" In April, Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, Schumer and Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, issued a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the president called ""a very important step."" But the senators have not yet introduced a bill. 
And during a July speech at the American University, Obama sounded another call for bipartisan reform: ""In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we've seen across America... Everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken."" 
It's worth noting that many Republicans have said they won't consider comprehensive immigration reform until the federal government secures the borders — another promise Obama made as a presidential hopeful that PolitiFact has rated ""In the Works,"" since the administration announced it was beefing up border security. On Aug. 13, Obama signed into law a $600 million bill funding 1,500 new border agents, additional unmanned aerial drones, and new Border Patrol stations on the border. 
Still, we're now in year two of the Obama presidency, with no comprehensive bill backed by the administration on the horizon. PolitiFact rated the promise Broken, and we rate Patterson's statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/21/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-barack-obama-broke-his-promis/
"['National', 'Religion', 'Tamara Holder']","
Crowd in GOP big tent doesn't include many Muslims
","
Republicans already have minimal support among the Muslim community, so they better watch what they say about building a new Mosque near Ground Zero, said Tamara Holder, a liberal Fox News Contributor in an August 18, 2010, segment of Sean Hannity.

""I just like to make the point that we can argue all day whether this is a moral issue or religious issue or whatever. But the bigger issue here on this political show is that the Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote, 2 percent. Most Muslims, like 77 percent, are Americanized. They've been here for 20 years. Not all Muslims are radical,"" Holder said.

It's a little known secret that we're suckers for arguments involving statistics, so we decided to look into Holder's claim that Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote.

We began by reading American Muslim Voters and the 2008 Election, a report put out in January 2008 by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a non-profit group that works to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America. The study results come from a random sample telephone survey of 1000 American Muslim registered voters. The group found that 49 percent of Muslim Americans consider themselves Democrats, 36 percent independent, and 8 percent Republicans.

The survey, taken before the 2008 election, also asked participants about the presidential candidates. Nearly 45 percent said that they ""don't know"" or ""haven't decided,"" but among those who declared a preference, Democrats took the lead. ""Republican Ron Paul, who is regarded by many Muslims as fair-minded, was mentioned by 2 percent, more than any other Republican hopeful,"" the report stated.

Those numbers are consistent with at least one post-election analysis. On November 7, 2008, the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections, an umbrella group for various Muslim advocacy groups, released the results of phone interviews with 637 registered Muslim American voters. The organization found that among those who voted, 88.9 percent backed President Barack Obama; only 2.2 percent voted for Republican John McCain. 
Then there is the Muslim West Facts Project -- a partnership between Gallup and the Coexist Foundation -- which released Muslim Americans: A National Portrait in early 2009. According to the report, 49 percent of Muslims identified themselves as Democrat; 37 percent said that they were independent and 8 percent considered themselves Republican. Gallup researchers did not analyze what percent of Muslim Americans voted for President Obama, but they found that from January through the end of October 2008, eleven percent said that they would vote for McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin. Eric Nielsen, who heads Gallup media relations, told us during a phone interview that the 11 percent is a ""rough proxy"" of how many Muslim Americans actually voted for the Republican duo.

Finally, the Pew Research Center published Muslim Americans in May 2007. The survey found that 11 percent of Muslim Americans identified as Republicans, 63 percent as Democrats, and 26 percent as either independent or having no leaning. During the 2004 presidential election, 14 percent voted for Bush and 71 percent voted for Kerry, according to the study.

So, to recap, Holder claimed that Republicans only have 2 percent of the Muslim vote. We found that roughly 8 to 11 percent of Muslims consider themselves Republicans. Muslims voted overwhelmingly for John Kerry during the 2004 election, and at least one post-election analysis shows that McCain only received 2 percent of the vote in the 2008 election. Gallup does not have data on how many Muslims voted for McCain, but we're told that it may be roughly 11 percent, a bit higher than what Holder claimed. Still, that's quite low compared to the support that Democrats have, so Holder's underlying point that Republicans lack significant Muslim backing is valid. We rate this Mostly True.

"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Josh Burgin']","
Hillsborough Commission candidate Josh Burgin says taxes are 18 percent higher.
","
First, incumbent Mark Sharpe sent out a mailer saying he cut property taxes by 17 percent, making the case that his fiscal conservatism is a top reason he should be returned to the Hillsborough County Commission in these trying times. 
Oh, no he didn’t, challenger Josh Burgin shot back in a flier of his own. It was the first of at least four mail pieces that carried the teaser: ""Voter Fraud Alert."" Property taxes are actually ""18 percent higher than when (Sharpe) first took office,"" said Burgin, who is seeking to unseat Sharpe in the at-large District 7 Republican primary. 
Awesome, we thought. Two politicians vying for the same seat making wildly opposing claims. This is why PolitiFact Florida exists! 
We looked at Sharpe first, and ruled that his claim was Barely True. 
Now we turn to Burgin’s claim, first calling him to ask him how he derived his figures. He sent us the numbers he used – the overall property tax revenue figures for each of the years Sharpe has been in office since 2004. 
We confirmed the numbers were accurate using Hillsborough County budget documents. In 2004, Hillsborough County collected $553.4 million in property taxes. This year, the number is projected to be $659.8 million. 
That’s actually a 19.2 percent increase. So Burgin was being cautious, gentle even, right? 
There’s just one significant problem with his calculation. And there’s another big asterisk. 
The county prepares its budget books and calculates its revenues and expenditures by fiscal year. And the fiscal year doesn’t mirror the calendar year. 
Fiscal year 2004 covers the period from Oct. 1, 2003 to Sept. 30, 2004. Sharpe first took office in November 2004. To calculate changes in tax revenue or tax rates involving Sharpe, the proper base year would be fiscal year 2005. It was not until September 2005 that Sharpe cast his first budgetary votes, setting property tax rates for fiscal year 2006. 
This is indeed significant because, while this may be hard to remember with property values now plummeting, home and business values were soaring during Sharpe’s first years in office. From fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005, property tax revenues jumped from $553.4 million to $610.8 million. 
With fiscal year 2005 as the base year, that means overall county property tax revenue has increased by nearly 8 percent during Sharpe’s tenure. Burgin claimed a tax increase of well more than double that – a gross exaggeration. 
That one year could make such a difference is a reflection of how overheated the real estate market was in the middle part of the decade. We can illustrate the phenomenon in reverse now, with property values plummeting. 
Sharpe has voted on next year’s tentative budget. If the tax rate approved so far holds, county budget officials project another nearly $74 million drop in property tax revenue. By that time, tax receipts will have fallen 4 percent below what they were when Sharpe took office. That’s right: Up by 8 percent this year, down by 4 percent next year. 
Now for the other asterisk to Burgin’s calculation. Property tax revenues are not a perfect measure of how taxes increased or decreased. That’s because the revenue includes property taxes collected from new construction. Owners of those properties may be paying more in taxes, but it’s a reflection of, say, their home sitting on what a year or two earlier may have been an orange grove. 
Take new construction out of the mix, particularly during the heady building days of Sharpe’s early tenure, and the alleged tax increase is something less than 8 percent, potentially much lower. Even during the anemic market of the current fiscal year, when property values are dropping across Hillsborough County, a projected $1.2 billion in new construction is expected. 
Burgin knows, or should know, his way around a budget book. He spent part of 2004 and 2005 as an aide to former County Commissioner Brian Blair, who tasked him with just these sorts of exercises. 
Fraud is a serious charge to level at anyone, even though some politicians tends to toss the word at opponents rather casually. Burgin has done it at least four times so far this campaign. 
But before accusing someone of an intentional perversion of the truth, it’s probably good to double- and triple-check the basis of your claim. We have no way of knowing if Burgin’s claim was an intentional distortion or an innocent miscalculation. 
Either way, we find this statement to be False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/20/josh-burgin/josh-burgin/
"['Florida', 'Jeff Greene']","
Greene says Meek is 0 for 70 in bills
","
UPDATE: We first published this item on Aug. 13, 2010, and rated Greene’s claim Half True. We received a number of complaints urging us to take a second look. We assigned a new reporter and editor and re-reported the claim with additional research on all the bills and resolutions Meek has proposed. In the end, we reached the same conclusion on the rating, Half True, and are posting the newer version of our report. 
Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jeff Greene says the poster child of the do-nothing Congress is a do-nothing congressman named Kendrick Meek.

""Since he has been in the House the last eight years, his track record in authoring bills is 0 in 70. ... 70 bills he authored, not one of them has passed,"" Greene said during a televised Orlando debate on Aug. 10, 2010.

Meek, a member of the U.S. House for eight years, said his ideas have been incorporated into laws and it's misleading to consider only the bills he sponsored as a scorecard of his time in Congress.

We'll explore Meek's retort in a moment.

But first, is he really 0-for-70 in passing bills like Greene claims?

First a little Schoolhouse Rock moment.

Greene, in his claim, is talking about bills. Bills, as you know, become laws. A member of Congress proposes a bill. That bill is then usually referred to a series of committees or subcommittees, where it is debated and possibly altered. If it passes out of committee, it is heard by the House or Senate, depending on who authored the bill. If it passes one full chamber, it then goes to the other. More debate. Maybe more amendments or alterations. More votes. If it passes both houses of Congress, it then goes to the president. You can probably guess, but most bills don't get this far. The president can then sign the bill into law, or veto it. If a bill is vetoed, Congress can come back and override the president's veto by a two-third's vote of both chambers -- making the bill law without the president' signature. We're not trying to go all fourth grade on you here, but we need to make the distinction about bills, because Congress passes things all the times that aren't bills.

End Schoolhouse Rock moment.

The Library of Congress tracks federal legislation (meaning bills and other things) through a system called Thomas. The site also allows users like us to search each session of Congress for legislation Meek sponsored. The website includes information about whether or not the legislation came to a vote and was signed by the president.

In his four terms in the U.S. House, Meek sponsored a total of 80 pieces of legislation, according to Thomas -- 35 in the current Congress, the 111th, 23 in the 110th Congress, 12 in the 109th Congress, and 10 in the 108th Congress.

Of the 80 pieces of legislation, none were specifically enacted into law. Two Senate versions of Meek bills were signed by the president. The bills were both non-controversial.

H.R.1361 and Senate companion S.111 directed the Secretary of Interior to conduct a resource study of the Miami Circle archaeological site. It was signed into law on Oct. 3, 2003.

H.R.2538 and Senate companion S.1904 renamed a courthouse in Miami after Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. It was signed into law on May 7, 2004.

Another 71 bills, designated appropriately with an H.R. prefix and a number are not law, and are either awaiting action or died in committee. The other seven pieces of legislation are called simple resolutions, designated with the prefix H. Res. and a number.

Simple resolutions are not laws. They are adopted by the House and included in the Congressional Record. That's it. Of those seven simple resolutions, we should note that Meek sponsored three that passed, a resolution recognizing the armed service response in Haiti, a resolution commemorating Haitian soldiers who fought for American independence, and a resolution recognizing Rafael Jose Diaz-Balart.

So out of 73 bills Meek sponsored, two are now law. The Greene campaign contends, however, that Meek shouldn't get credit for the two Senate versions that passed instead of the House version, hence their 0-for-70. The Meek campaign says Meek simply took up the Senate versions out of expediency or for some other reason.

We think the overall difference of opinion is minor -- neither bill was controversial and whether Meek was 0-for73 or 2-for-73 isn't all that critical.

What we think is worth noting is the collaborative way that bills become law. Any single bill is often the collective work of many. In some cases, entire bills become amendments to other bills that pass. Bills also must be reconciled between the Senate and the House -- the courthouse bill and the Interior study being a perfect example.

PolitiFact has looked at bill sponsor figures before, after Barbara Boxer was accused of passing only three bills in 18 years.

Back then, Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the metric meaningless.

""There is no good, strong, objective, consistent way to measure productivity as a legislator,"" Orstein told us.

Agreed, said Clay Shaw, a Republican who represented a South Florida Congressional district for nearly 25 years.

A lot of times a chairman of a committee will take another member's bill and rewrite it and put his own name on it, Shaw said.

""If you have an appropriation, you try to get the appropriations committee to do it for you,"" Shaw said.

Meek's campaign said many of his ideas were incorporated into other bills that became law. For instance, Meek filed a bill to accelerate the income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions for the relief of victims of the earthquake in Haiti. His bill was referred to a House committee in January 2010. A related bill with the same goal, filed by Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Rep. Charles Rangel, was passed into law later that same month.

And in 2005, Meek filed a bill that would allow duty-free treatment for apparel assembled in Haiti. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act passed with similar language the following year, though Meek was not a sponsor.

We looked into a few different accounts of Meek's legislative accomplishments. CQ's Politics in America 2010 edition noted that Meek has become ""one of the House's swiftest-rising young Democrats,"" and noted his prominent assignment to the Ways and Means Committee, which handles health care, tax and trade policy.

CQ said Meek previously served on the Armed Services panel, where he pushed for a deadline to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq.

And, ""in February 2009, he responded to the public furor over Bernard L. Madoff -- who pleaded guilty to a vast Ponzi scheme that bilked investors of billions of dollars -- by introducing a bill to provide tax relief to individuals harmed by the investment scam based on paying early investors money from later ones,"" CQ wrote. The bill never made it out of committee, but the Internal Revenue Service changed some of its rules in March to provide victims some tax relief.

A July 25 profile of Meek in the St. Petersburg Times described Meek's record this way:

""He has been the primary sponsor of more than 70 bills and nothing major has passed. ... And yet, most House members toil for years without passing a substantial piece of legislation. Victories are achieved by attaching ideas to other bills, usually bearing the names of committee chairs, or plying other channels.""

Ruling on a statement like Greene's can be tricky. He said: ""Since (Meek) has been in the House the last eight years, his track record in authoring bills is 0 in 70."" Of the 73 bills we found through the Library of Congress' Thomas website, Meek either passed none or two out of the 73 depending on whether you count the Senate companion bills. That, by itself, might rate a ruling of True or Mostly True. But the claim neglects to properly detail how Congress works and might give voters an unrealistic impression of Meek's time in Congress. While Meek may have not passed significant legislation, that's not necessarily a measure a Congressman's effectiveness.

We define Half True as a statement that is ""accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" We think that's about right in this case. Greene has his number just about right, but leaves out those Schoolhouse Rock details of how a bill becomes a law. We rate Greene's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/20/jeff-greene/greene-says-meek-0-70-bills/

Bill McCollum group attacks Rick Scott's new health care company Solantic
","
Can you believe it? There's another ad in the Republican primary for governor accusing Rick Scott of fraud.

This one comes from the Bill McCollum-backed group Florida First Initiative. But the subject isn't Columbia/HCA, the for-profit hospital company Scott helped build to become the nation's largest.

This ad is talking about some other, unnamed company.

The ad is called ""Private."" It opens with a narrator talking over newspaper headlines.

""Rick Scott's company pleaded guilty to one of the largest Medicare frauds in American history,"" the narrator says, referring to Columbia/HCA. Then, the screen flips to an image of Scott ripped from one of his commercials. It shows Scott saying: ""And as CEO, I take responsibility.""

The narrator returns. ""And now, reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won't come clean.""

Video returns to Scott. ""It's a private matter,"" an angry-looking Scott says.

Then, the narrator responds. ""Rick Scott, it's not a private matter. It's a failure of character.""

The ad's final frame includes big type that spells out ""Rick Scott,"" only the C and O of Scott's last name have been replaced by handcuffs. As the ad ends, the handcuffs interlock. If our meter measured tackiness, that over-the-top symbolism would rate pretty high, but in this case we can only examine the facts surrounding the ad.

So we decided to look at this statement: ""Reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won't come clean.""

Scott company background

The narrator doesn't identify the company in question by name, but when he makes the claim a tearsheet of an Aug. 5, 2010, St. Petersburg Times article appears on the screen.

The article is titled ""Lawsuits point to trouble at Rick Scott's current health care business.""

That headline refers to this story about a company Scott co-founded in 2001, Solantic.

Solantic is a chain of walk-in urgent care centers, primarily around northeast Florida. The company currently operates 30 walk-in centers across the state.

The article, which was written by the Miami Herald and St. Petersburg Times reported that Scott was deposed in a Solantic civil suit just six days before he announced his bid for governor.

The suit, brought by Dr. P. Mark Glencross, alleged that Glencross' medical license was misused by the Jacksonville-based chain of walk-in clinics. Glencross said Solantic, without his knowledge, used his name in 2004 when it filed state paperwork designed to ensure that clinics have a medical director in charge. 
Within a month of Scott's deposition, the 2-year-old case was settled and both parties signed a confidentiality agreement.

The story went on to mention nine other court actions filed against Solantic since 2001, which were settled. Solantic chief executive Karen Bowling told Herald/Times reporter Marc Caputo that Solantic settled the cases at the request of its insurance company, which found protracted court fights too expensive.

A spokesman for Scott noted that while he is a major investor in Solantic, he doesn't run its day-to-day operations, and that Scott was involved in only two of the suits.

A few days later, on Aug. 10, Scott appeared at a Tallahassee press conference where reporters asked him repeatedly if he would release the sealed deposition in the Glencross case.

That's when Scott provided the line used in the Florida First Initiative ad: ""It's a private matter,"" he said. Later in the press conference he said: ""It's a private matter and I will not release the deposition.""

Glencross case is civil, not criminal

Based on the whole of the ad -- the words of the narrator, the clips flashed on the screen, and the choice of Scott's words -- viewers and fact-checkers are left to assume that the ad is talking about the Solantic/Glencross case.

In that case, there are two large distortions.

First, the Solantic/Glencross case is a civil matter, not a criminal one. There are no charges of criminal wrongdoing.

Second, the allegation that Scott won't come clean is misleading. He gave a deposition.

He just has said he won't share that deposition with reporters. He has no legal requirement to do so, either.

We tried to reach the registered agent of Florida First Initiative, J. Nottingham, for an explanation. But the number on file at the Florida Division of Elections rang dead.

We should note that there is another allegation surrounding Solantic currently making news. Another former Solantic physician, Dr. Randy Prokes, sent an e-mail to the McCollum campaign claiming that Solantic billed Medicare at full rates for patients seen by a nurse practitioner, when federal rules require that billing be at 85 percent of the fee paid for physician examinations.

The McCollum campaign passed the letter on to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

The FDLE then sent the letter on to the inspector general’s office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

That's where the letter sits today. There is no formal investigation. Solantic executives, meanwhile, have described Prokes as a disgruntled former employee who was fired in 2009 for fraudulently prescribing drugs last year.

Even if Prokes' claim has merit, it's not what the Florida First Initiative ad is referencing based on the ads visuals and wording. So we're not considering it.

Our ruling

The ad says that ""reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won't come clean.""

The line refers to a civil lawsuit involving Solantic, a company Scott co-founded, and Dr. Gary Glencross. Glencross alleged that his medical license was misused by the Jacksonville-based chain of walk-in clinics. A month after Scott gave a deposition in the case, it was settled. Terms of the settlement are confidential.

The case was a civil one, not criminal. And Scott provided a deposition as required. The only instance of him failing to ""come clean"" is not providing the results of that deposition to the public. Which he doesn't have to. We rate the accusation False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/20/florida-first-initiative/bill-mccollum-group-attacks-rick-scotts-new-health/

Republican Josh Mandel touts his electability, coming from a district with a largely Democratic constituency
","
Josh Mandel, a Republican from the left-leaning region of Northeast Ohio, knows the importance of cross-over appeal to winning an election.

That’s why Mandel, a state representative running for Ohio treasurer, has been telling voters this year about the overwhelmingly Democratic makeup of his constituency. The message is part of Mandel’s strategy to snatch up some Democratic votes in his bid against incumbent Treasurer Kevin Boyce, a Democrat.

""In 2008 (Mandel) was re-elected to a second term, representing a district with a 2:1 Democrat to Republican voter ratio,"" according to the online biography on Mandel’s campaign website.

Mandel, of Lyndhurst, was first elected in 2006 to represent the 17th House District, made up of more than a dozen suburbs in eastern Cuyahoga County. He was re-elected in 2008, securing 72 percent of the vote.

Northeast Ohio long has been a region that favors Democrats. But does Mandel's district, which includes some of the wealthier suburbs in Cuyahoga County, lean to the left as much as his online biography suggests? Is his cross-over appeal that strong?

Mandel’s campaign cited voter registration statistics recorded at the time of his re-election in November 2008. They showed 38,575 registered Democrats in Mandel’s district compared to 16,449 registered Republicans.

""The voter registration of the district is actually over 2-to-1,"" campaign manager Michael Lord said in an e-mail. ""Josh will continue using this number because it’s true and he’s proud to have been elected with a strong mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents.""

Although Mandel’s math is right, voter registration records usually aren’t the best way to size up an electorate, said Ohio State University political science professor Paul Beck, whose specialties include voting behavior and political parties.

""The registration records themselves are not a very good litmus test,"" Beck said.

That’s because the party affiliations only attach when voters participate in primary elections and choose a specific party’s ballot. Those who only vote on issues and do not declare for a party and those who don’t vote in the primary election at all remain classified as independents and would not show up in Mandel’s numbers.

And depending on the races in a primary election, voters may switch parties. Consider this scenario: A moderate voter opts to vote in the hotly contested 2008 primary between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even if that voter had supported Republicans in the past and even if he voted for Republican John McCain in the general election, that voter remains a Democrat on county voting records until opting for  Republican ballot in another primary.

Beck also noted that voter registration records can be inflated with voters who may have moved away without canceling their registration.

Recent election results are a better gauge of a voting population’s tendencies, he said,  because they include a larger sample of voters and lack the fundamental flaws of registration statistics.

Using recent election results, Mandel’s district has favored Democratic candidates, but by a much slimmer margin than he asserts.

The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association studied results of five recent elections for its 2010 Ohio Election Guide. It found that Republicans in the 17th House District tend to receive about 46 percent of the vote.

In the 2008 presidential election Mandel's district split nearly evenly between Democrats and Republicans. Obama received 37,350 votes, about 51.5 percent. McCain received 35,207 votes, about 48.5 percent.

What all this shows is that depending on which gauge you use, the ratio of Democrats to Republicans can vary significantly. Yet by one measurement, Mandel is correct

We rate his statement as Mostly True.

Liberal bloggers say candidate for governor Nathan Deal ""dabbled"" in birther conspiracies
","What a difference a day makes.

GOP gubernatorial candidate Nathan Deal spent months during the primary convincing voters he's more conservative than his opponents.

The day news broke that Deal clinched his party's nomination, liberal bloggers asked whether he was too far to the right.

The most high-profile instance took place during a White House press briefing Aug. 11, when a correspondent from the liberal Huffington Post asked White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs about the election.

""In the Georgia Republican gubernatorial primary, the winner in that race, Representative Deal, has actually dabbled in birther conspiracies,"" Sam Stein said.

Deal? Dabbling in conspiracy theories that Obama is not a natural-born citizen?

Birther conspiracies were discredited as far back as 2008. The notion is so closely tied to conservative extremism that many politicians won't touch it.

During the primary, at least one of Deal's Republican opponents complained Deal went too far down the birther path.

Deal needs to woo moderates to win in November. If his opponents tie him to the birther movement, they may damage his chances.

For the most part, major left-leaning news outlets and bloggers avoid calling Deal an actual birther. Stein said Deal ""dabbled"" in birtherism. A liberal blog and news site, Talking Points Memo, classified Deal as a ""birther-curious"" politician who ""dipped a toe in the birther pool.""

Dabble generally means to take part in something casually or superficially -- to not take it seriously. We will focus on claims that he did that with birther conspiracies.

Deal's spokesman Brian Robinson said the candidate is in no way a birther, and he didn't dabble in the subject.

""That is untrue. He did not dabble in birther conspiracies,"" Robinson said.

""He is saying, 'I have no reason to believe you (President Obama) are not a natural born citizen. Just show it. That's all. We could put this to rest and move on,"" Robinson said.

Deal's constituents were concerned, but Deal didn't focus on the issue, Robinson said.

Deal's most widely-publicized brush with birthers took place in November, while Deal was still a congressman. A reporter asked in an online chat if Deal thought Obama was born in the States.

""I am joining several of my colleagues in the House in writing a letter to the president asking that he release a copy of his birth certificate so we can have an answer to this question,"" Deal replied.

Deal sent the letter in December, though no one else signed on. In January, one of his congressional staffers gave that scoop to a birther-sympathetic Web site.

""P. Patriot"" of The Post & Email, which describes itself as a web site of ""citizen journalists"" who ""speak the truth without the restrictions or doctrinaire principles of Socialism and Marxism"", said the letter showed Deal understood the ""magnitude and gravity of the situation."" The post's title: ""Deal Challenges Obama’s Eligibility.""

At the time, whether the letter said what birthers claimed wasn't clear. No one released a copy.

Last week, the Deal campaign gave one to PolitiFact Georgia. It's no birther manifesto.

Deal wrote, ""I accept your assurance you meet that requirement, and in no way intend to show anything but respect for the Office of President and for you personally.""

Deal said that his constituents were concerned about the President's citizenship. He asked where he could find a publicly available ""birth certificate or other documentary evidence"" that lays out Obama's case.

So the letter bolsters the Deal campaign's claim that he is not a birther. But Deal's other statements muddy the waters.

In a July 2009 video aired on MSNBC, Deal talked to liberal blogger and activist Mike Stark. Stark provided an unedited version to PolitiFact Georgia.

""There’s been a lot in the news about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Do you believe he was born in America and anyone who believes otherwise is a little bit cuckoo?"" Stark asked Deal.

""I wouldn’t say that. I have no idea where he was born at,"" Deal replied.

Deal added this caveat: ""I take his word for it. He’s the President and he’s sworn to tell the truth, so I assume that he has.""

Deal elaborated on his doubts to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a November 2009 article. He said he had ""no reason to think"" that Obama is not a legal U.S. citizen but the documentation ""leaves many things to be desired.""

""It obviously does not have the signature of a doctor. Most birth certificates or even certificates of live birth have those kinds of verifications,"" Deal said.

If Deal had a change of heart between November of last year, when he expressed these doubts, and December, when he told the president he had none, we found no evidence that he tried to make that clear to the public.

Deal had a chance to clarify his position during a January GOP gubernatorial debate. Opponent state Rep. Austin Scott, now a candidate for Congress, accused Deal of ""calling for childish things like the president to show his birth certificate.""

""I have simply asked the president, 'tell me where I can refer these constituent inquiries to a source that you think is credible so that we can answer their questions',"" Deal replied. ""I think that's a reasonable proposition and certainly something that I think the president should respond to. Although at this point he has not.""

In a February video posted on the Web, Deal distanced himself from birthers by saying ""I'm not questioning his legitimacy as the president."" But he did not say he accepted Obama's explanation.

Instead, he said this: ""I know that some folks have tried to to label this [Deal's letter] as politically incorrect. I want to tell you something. Political incorrectness is paralyzing our society. These kind of things deserve straightforward responses.""

So did Deal dabble in birther conspiracies?

PolitiFact Georgia found no evidence that Deal is a birther. In fact, we found proof to the contrary. But Deal did give birthers the chance to think he was taking some of their theories seriously.

Privately, in an unreleased letter, he told the President that he did ""accept"" Obama's assurances that he met the office's citizenship requirements. Publicly, Deal expressed doubts about Obama's birth certificate.

The letter was only released now, so birthers were free to fill in the blanks. And it's clear they saw Deal as an ally.

Deal said that all the letter did was relay constituent concerns to the President. But when he sent the letter, he lent birthers a credence that others would not.

Birther claims were discredited by 2008. Deal still treated their claims as if they had substance in 2010.

Yes, Deal dabbled in birther conspiracies. We rule this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/20/blog-posting/liberal-bloggers-say-candidate-governor-nathan-dea/

Bill White says Rick Perry's proposal on denying dropouts driver's license has been law since 1989
","
Stumping in East Texas, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said GOP Gov. Rick Perry's proposal regarding high school dropouts and drivers' licenses has a glaring weakness. 
""You know the problem with that plan?"" White told a group, according to an Aug. 9 news report by Houston's KRIV-TV. ""That's been state law since 1989. And he's been responsible for enforcing it. We're tired of the spin."" 
Was Perry's plan really old hat? More than White knew, as it turns out. First, let's review. 
Back in January, Perry issued a press release saying: ""I believe that in order for high school-aged individuals to get and keep a driver's license they should be enrolled in school, be it bricks and mortar or our virtual high school, and, most importantly, working toward their diploma or GED."" 
Perry said he was calling on the Department of Public Safety and the Texas Education Agency to ""work with local school districts to further leverage the privilege of a driver’s license as an incentive to keep students engaged in the education process."" 
Problem: White's campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, pointed out state law already stipulates that minors seeking a driver's license submit proof that they're in school, specifically a Verification of Enrollment form. 
Bacon cited information posted online by the TEA, including this: ""A Texas law was passed in 1989 requiring that persons under 18 years of age must be enrolled and attending school as a condition of licensing that person to operate a motor vehicle. There was an exception: if the person had a high school diploma or a GED, the driver license could be issued."" 
The Texas Transportation Code specifies the requirements for provisional driver's licenses, the kind usually issued to people under 18: The applicant must be at least 16 years old, have passed a state-approved driver-education course, have a high school diploma or its equivalent or be a student who attended school (including home school) for at least 80 days in the fall or spring semester preceding the application date. 
Former State Rep. Bill Hammond, R-Dallas, authored the school-attendance requirement that passed in 1989. Hammond, now president of the Texas Association of Business, told us that he reacted as White did when he heard of Perry's 2010 proposal. ""My thought was that it's (already) in the law,"" Hammond said. 
Game over? 
Not so fast, Perry's campaign told us: The governor is focusing on students who got their licenses and then dropped out. In other words, his proposal applies to teen drivers keeping their licenses, not getting them -- though Perry himself has not always been clear on that point. 
For instance, in a speech prepared for delivery Aug. 12 in West Texas, Perry said, ""I have proposed a simple accountability measure requiring school enrollment or progress to a GED if they want to keep a Texas driver's license."" Yet on July 15, KVUE-TV reported that Perry told a Houston news conference: ""If you are of high school age and you are not in a bricks and mortar or virtual high school, you are not going to get a driver's license. It's that simple."" 
Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the governor's concept is simple: He wants the education agency and DPS to figure out what legislation would be necessary to revoke the licenses of high school dropouts. ""High school students should not be able to have the privilege of driving if they are not enrolled in school,"" Frazier said. 
Advantage Perry? Nope, said White's campaign, which argued that existing law also has this covered, since it requires teen drivers to renew their provisional licenses every year until they turn 18. (Typically that means only one renewal, at age 17.) ""Dropouts who already have licenses cannot renew them; so they will effectively be relinquished,"" Bacon said. 
Then we discovered that in 2009, the Legislature passed -- and Perry signed -- a measure that repealed that provision. House Bill 339 also imposed some new requirements on teen drivers. But once a typical 16-year-old gets a license, he or she can now keep it until turning 18, when proof of school attendance is no longer required. 
Why did lawmakers take that step? Sara Haenes, chief of staff for the bill's author, Rep. Larry Phillips, R-Sherman, said the intent was to set up a more efficient way for DPS to find out when kids drop out of school so it could revoke their licenses without delay. The bill called for the DPS and TEA to ""enter into a memorandum of understanding"" under which the law enforcement agency can access state electronic records to verify a student’s enrollment in public school. 
That sounds a lot like what Perry is proposing. According to a July 19 online report by El Paso's KVIA-TV, Perry would have the education agency alert the DPS when a student drops out of high school, and the DPS would revoke the teen's license. Frazier confirmed that the TV station had accurately presented the proposal.

When we asked her how Perry's plan differs from the bill he signed into law in 2009, Frazier said it would keep closer track of a teen driver's school status, while the new law specifies that DPS ""may only access information necessary to verify the identity and enrollment status of a license renewal applicant.""

Since teens no longer have to renew their licenses, we're not sure how that would work. Besides, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us that while the agency is still talking with TEA, ""there is currently no process available that provides the timely data necessary to accomplish enrollment verification electronically.""

The upshot: Instead of cracking down on teen drivers who drop out of school, state law has lightened up, since teens no longer have to submit proof of enrollment to keep their licenses.

That was news to White's campaign, which fired another salvo after learning of the change last week. ""The old law kept dropouts from keeping their licenses,"" Bacon said. ""Then he (Perry) took that away. Now he wants it back.""

It was also news to Hammond, who told us he would have opposed the change had he known about it. It's not mentioned on the DPS website page for under-25 drivers, which still says provisional licenses expire every year, unless renewed.

As for White's claim, the candidate is right that a 1989 law required teens under 18 to show they're in school or have graduated before they can get their driver's licenses -- and on that point, Perry offered nothing new.

But White overlooked the fact that Perry did propose a change, aimed at toughening the law that was in place for the past 20 years to cause dropouts to lose their licenses at renewal time.

However, it wasn't entirely new. Last year Perry signed a bill into law that had a similar goal but removed the renewal requirement entirely.

Robitaille says Caprio never worked in private sector
","
Candidate biographies have long been fertile ground for political foes in search of a quick hit. And it's true that many politicians have gotten in trouble for inflating their resumes. So when a candidate attacks his opponent's CV, we sit up and take note.

In a news release emailed Aug. 11 and posted on his campaign website, Republican gubernatorial candidate John Robitaille slammed Democratic opponent Frank Caprio for statements he made about a $75-million loan guarantee for former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling's video-game company, 38 Studios.

Specifically, he faulted Caprio for suggesting the state should have an equity interest in the company, a stance Robitaille said was ""anti-business"" and would torpedo efforts to attract new employers to the state.

Robitaille didn't stop there.

""Mr. Caprio is a career politician who has never worked in the private sector, and so it’s no surprise that he thinks the state government should own and run our businesses,"" he said. Robitaille went on to tout his own experience owning a small business and employing workers.

Could it be true that Caprio, whose campaign mantra is putting the ""wind at the back of small business,"" hasn't ever actually worked for a private company?

A quick search proved Robitaille's accusation is just plain wrong.

Caprio's resume, provided to us by his campaign, and stories in the Providence Journal archives, show that Caprio graduated from Suffolk University Law School in 1991 and then worked briefly at the Providence law firm Adler Pollock & Sheehan before turning to his own law practice, which he ran out of the same office as his father, Providence Municipal Court Chief Judge Frank Caprio, and his brother, David Caprio.

By 1995 -- in an only in Rhode Island scenario -- Caprio took a job as an in-house legal counsel at Cookson America, the electronics and precious metals conglomerate, where he worked under its then-CEO, Donald Carcieri, now Rhode Island's governor.

We contacted Adler Pollock & Sheehan and confirmed that Caprio worked there. We also called Cookson, where a human resources manager confirmed that he indeed worked there from 1995 to 1998.

The irony, of course, is that Carcieri, once Caprio's boss, went on to be Robitaille's boss. Robitaille worked as his communications director, a job he left last winter to focus on his own run for governor.

When a Journal reporter asked about Robitaille's claim the day he made it, the Robitaille team acknowledged its error in saying Caprio ""never worked in the private sector."" But it didn't correct its website until PolitiFact inquired about it nearly a week later.

The campaign stood by the first part of its statement, that Caprio is a career politician who puts his political interests, and not those of small business, first.

Robitaille is correct that Caprio has worked in politics for nearly his entire career. He took office in the state's part-time House of Representatives in 1991, the same year he graduated from law school. And he served in the House and later in the state Senate until he won the treasurer's seat in 2006.

But to call someone ""a career politician"" suggests that's all he did. And the fact remains that Caprio had a legal career that spanned 15 years. Not only that, in working for himself as a private practice lawyer, he ran precisely the kind of small business that Robitaille says Caprio has no experience with.

It's clear the Robitaille team issued this statement without doing even the smallest bit of research, so it's tempting to award him a Pants on Fire. But since the campaign corrected the mistake, we'll leave the lighter fluid alone and call his claim exactly what they acknowledged it to be: False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/20/john-robitaille/robitaille-says-caprio-never-worked-private-sector/

Kendrick Meek: ""There's a mosque at the Pentagon""
","
Plans to build a mosque two blocks away from Ground Zero in New York City have stirred a national debate over the site’s appropriateness, and politicians from New York City’s Mayor  Michael Bloomberg to President Barack Obama are chiming in.

So it seemed a timely question for Michael Putney, host of WPLG-10’s ""This Week in South Florida,"" to ask Kendrick Meek and Jeff Greene about the mosque during a televised debate between the two Democratic Senate hopefuls on Aug. 15, 2010.

When asked by Putney whether the location was the ""right site"" for a mosque and Muslim center, Greene responded, ""Absolutely not.""

""I think that it may be legal,"" Greene added. ""I support freedom of religion, freedom of speech, I understand that, but you know what, thousands of Americans died there, not just the victims in the building but how about all the rescuers and firefighters. I don't think when all the families have to go to mourn their losses, they should be looking at a mosque right there... It's insensitive to the victims.""

Meek wasn’t as direct in his response, noting that he wasn’t on the New York City Zoning Board and saying he was ""not going to step in front of a decision that’s already been made in New York City.""

He added: ""There should be some sensitivity there and I recognize it ... I might add there is a mosque inside of the Pentagon ... and also a chapel.""

Is there a mosque inside of the Pentagon? 
The official word from Pentagon spokesperson George Wright: ""There is not, I repeat there is not a mosque inside of the Pentagon."" 
""There is a non-denominational chapel ... about 20 steps from the center of impact,"" Wright told PolitiFact Florida, in a phone interview. 
The 80-seat interfaith chapel was opened in November 2002, part of a memorial to the 184 people killed on the flight and inside of the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, Wright said.

American Airlines Flight 77 was one of four planes hijacked on Sept. 11. Two of the jets were crashed into NYC’s Twin Towers, and the other was brought down in a field in Pennsylvania, after passengers and the flight crew fought with the hijackers to regain control of the plane.

The chapel was built during the reconstruction of heavily damaged portions of the Pentagon, where 125 employees died, in addition to the 66 passengers on board the flight.

Inside a room with stained glass windows, a wooden altar and a standing American flag, various religious services are held throughout the week. There are services for Catholics, Jews, Hindus, Mormons, Muslims and various Christian denominations. Footage from inside of the chapel was recently aired on CNN for those interested in taking a peek.

Wright said that Muslim employees gather for daily prayer services Monday through Thursday at 2 p.m., and attend a Friday worship service run by an imam from a local mosque. A storage room at the chapel keeps prayer rugs that Muslim followers roll out facing East toward the city of Mecca. 
We wondered what classified a space as a mosque according to Islamic tradition, so we asked Shafayat Mohamed, imam of the Darul Uloom mosque in Pembroke Pines, Fla. 
""The main thing that makes a mosque a mosque is the establishment of praying five times a day at that spot,"" Mohamed said. ""If people pray five times per day, then it is considered a regular mosque."" 
While the chapel does not meet that definition, because prayer only occurs there once a day,  Mohamed said the room could be considered another sacred space known as a ""mussallaah."" 
A mussallaah, according to Mohamed, is a place where Muslims consistently performs their mid-day prayer when they do not have access to a mosque. Any place from a university classroom to an office break-room could be considered a mussallaah so long as it is the venue that is consistently being used for prayer. 
""It may not officially be a mosque,"" Mohamed said of the Pentagon's chapel. ""But if it’s somewhere where they repeatedly go to pray, someone working at the Pentagon might consider it their mussallaah, a place where they can all pray."" 
So back to the question -- Was Meek correct in stating there is a mosque inside of the Pentagon? No; the Pentagon spokesman is emphatic that it's not a mosque. While Meek later added in his statement that there was also a chapel, the two are one and the same. He was correct in identifying that there was a place of worship and daily prayer for Muslims, but misspoke when calling it an actual mosque inside of the Pentagon. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/20/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-theres-mosque-pentagon/

U.S. Senate candidate Jeff Greene ""rethinks"" position on Cuban embargo and travel
","
On Aug. 17, 2010, Jeff Greene, vying for the Democratic bid for U.S. Senate, sat down for some cafecito and conversation at Miami’s famed Versailles restaurant -- a political rite of passage for any candidate hoping to score some votes with Miami’s Cuban exile community.

Greene, who is running against U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek in the Aug. 24 primary, was met by some heckling from several of the restaurant patrons.

""You say now that you favor the lifting of the embargo on Cuba and you want to come here and have Cuban coffee and get the Cuban vote? I don’t think so,""  a customer at the restaurant told Greene, according to the Associated Press.

Greene might have fallen out of the good graces of some Cuban-Americans when recently voicing his willingness to open travel and trade back up to Cuba, but it’s a position that Greene himself has admitted to changing over the course of his campaign.

""I have thought about this a lot, you know, the past few weeks and I’m really beginning to rethink my own opinion on that,"" he said during a televised debate against Meek on Miami’s ABC affiliate TV station WPLG-10  ""I’m thinking now we have to take a close look at opening travel to Cuba, and the trade embargo.""

We decided to put Greene up against our Flip-O-Meter to determine if he had flip-flopped his positions regarding the U.S embargo against Cuba and travel restrictions to the island.

PolitiFact Florida already ruled that Greene flopped on the issue of Cuba before. Namely, he gave varying accounts of a 2007 trip to Cuba. At first Greene denied traveling to the communist island, later he recanted and said he was there on a humanitarian trip with a Jewish group, and finally his campaign spokesperson said Greene’s yacht had docked at the Hemingway Marina due to mechanical issues with the vessel.

To determine just how much Greene has reconsidered his position on Cuba, we decided to look at statements he has made on relations with the island compared to his most recent epiphany on the WPLG debate.

June 15, 2010 -- In a Miami Herald story Greene says he supports President Barack Obama’s policy on allowing Cuban-Americans to freely travel to visit their families on the island.

Aug. 1, 2010  -- During a televised debate with Tampa’s Bay News 9, Greene said he firmly supported the U.S. embargo of Cuba.

Aug. 15, 2010 -- During a debate against Meek, Greene says he’s beginning to ""rethink"" his opinion, calling the embargo ""a 50-year plan that’s failed."" He added: ""I’m not saying let’s open the doors tomorrow, but I’m saying when I get to the Senate I want to take a close look at considering making a revision to this, what is absolutely a failed policy.""

Aug. 17, 2010 -- Over Cuban coffee at the Versailles Restaurant in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood, Greene defends his new-found position to several of the disgruntled Cuban exiles on hand. He states: ""It’s a 50-year program that hasn’t worked."" 
Aug. 19, 2010 -- In an interview with Rob Lorei on the talk show Radioactivity on WMNF-FM 88.5, Greene acknowledged his change of position, and elaborated on his view. 
""It's almost a 50-year embargo. The purpose was to do what, to get rid of the Castros, to free the Cuban people from communism so that they could have a democracy and have their rights restored. None of that has happened,'' he said. The embargo has impoverished Cuban citizens, left Fidel Castro in control, and the country is drawing tourists from Europe and Canada, he said. Without the embargo, German visitors might combine a trip to Havana with a stop in Orlando. There might be more trade, helping the Florida economy. 
When pressed, Greene said he's not ready to completely ditch the embargo. ""I say I want to look at it,'' he said. Maybe lift a few restrictions, or go further.  
""The craziest thing is the Cubans have all the American products, they just get them through Canada,'' he said. ""So the whole thing is, it's just accomplishing nothing.''        

For his part, Meek says he supports the embargo. The congressman shares a close working relationship with Ileana-Ros Lehtinen, and Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, all Cuban-American Republicans from the South Florida congressional delegation.

Republican Senate hopeful Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban exiles, strongly supports the embargo and favors limiting travel to the island. Independent candidate Gov. Charlie Crist has said he supports the embargo, but is in favor of easing travel restrictions.

Whether on the Senate floor or in cable television, Florida’s Congressional delegation is often asked to chime in on Cuba-related issues -- considering the state has the largest Cuban-American population in the U.S. (nearly 1.1 million according to Census figures). The issue of travel -- which older exiles staunchly oppose, but more recent arrivals approve, according to polls -- is brewing again as the Obama administration considers easing travel restrictions to the island. The administration may announce as early as this week plans to expand opportunities for American students, educators and researchers to visit the island.

So back to the question at hand. Did Greene reverse course on his position regarding the embargo and travel to Cuba? From stating his firm support for the embargo during an Aug. 1 debate to calling the embargo a failure just 16 days later, we rule that Greene completed a Full Flop on his stance on U.S./Cuba policy issues.",/factchecks/2010/aug/19/jeff-greene/jeff-greene-rethinks-position-cuban-embargo-and-tr/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Mark Sharpe']","
Hillsborough Commission candidate Mark Sharpe claims he cut property taxes 17 percent.
","
The District 7 at-large Republican primary race for Hillsborough County commissioner has focused a great deal on taxes, mostly a proposed sales tax increase.

That’s because challenger Josh Burgin has consistently bashed incumbent Mark Sharpe for backing a ballot question that asks voters if they support raising the sales tax by 1 cent. The proceeds would pay for new commuter rail, expanded bus service and roads.

Sharpe has tried to shore up his image as a fiscal conservative, claiming in a July 20 mailer that he’s a tax cutter. ""Mark Sharpe has lowered property taxes by 17 percent,"" his piece claims.

His number seemed a bit generous to the skeptical eye, so PolitiFact Florida dusted off its copies of Hillsborough County’s budget.

First, we parsed his word choice and immediately puckered. Sharpe claims he lowered property taxes. That struck us as overly boastful, since it takes a majority vote of commissioners to approve county spending plans.

Sharpe has voted on five final annual budgets, and each vote was unanimous. If property taxes were indeed cut, Sharpe can’t take all the credit.

We also immediately seized on the assertion that he cut property taxes, period. We wondered if he meant that he supported cutting the tax rate. It’s an important distinction.

Hillsborough commissioners regularly brag about the number of consecutive years they have lowered the tax rate. But, as the St. Petersburg Times has shown in the past, tax revenue soared in the early and middle part of this decade at a pace that far outstripped population growth and inflation. (See ""The Money Vat"" here.)

That’s because the generally modest annual tax rate cuts didn’t come close to offsetting the money brought in by escalating property values and a building boom. If you didn’t own a house with a homestead exemption that capped annual tax increase in those years, your property tax bill skyrocketed.

Of course, the market has tanked since then. So perhaps it’s possible that Sharpe can claim commissioners cut the tax rate — and taxes.

We checked with Sharpe’s campaign, which said it got the base numbers from one of his aides. The aide provided the figures used and a percentage-change calculation. As suspected, his calculation was based on tax-rate figures, not actual tax bills or county tax revenues.

The aide compared only the portion of the tax rate that applies to all county property owners, not the extra amount tacked on in unincorporated areas for such things as police and fire protection. Fair enough, perhaps, as long as he was using consistent figures.

However, the aide used the wrong budget figure from the year before Sharpe took office. If he had used the correct starting number and year, his boss might have legitimately claimed a role in reducing the countywide property tax rate by 20 percent.

PolitiFact decided to start from scratch, comparing the combined rate for all property taxes commissioners control from the time Sharpe took office until now. Then we looked at how much money that brought in annually through the same time period.

Sharpe took office in November 2004. The county’s fiscal year runs from October through September. That means Sharpe began working in fiscal year 2005, and his first budget vote in September 2005 set spending levels for fiscal year 2006.

When he took office, the county’s overall tax rate was 13.0164 mills. That means that for every $1,000 of property owned, Hillsborough County taxes were roughly $13.02.

Commissioners voted each year since to lower the millage. It currently stands at 10.7614 mills. Do the math, and it turns out that the tax rate is indeed currently 17 percent lower than when Sharpe took office. 
Yet there’s still one problem with that. In 2007, the state legislature took action forcing most local governments across Florida to sharply roll back their property tax rates to compensate for their failure to do so aggressively in the boom years.

While the tax rate has fallen by 2.2550 mills while Sharpe has been in office, well more than half of that — nearly 1.5 mills — came in the budget that immediately followed the state order. In other words, it was a direct response to what the legislature did.

Legislators gave local governments the option of ignoring their edict if commissioners could muster a super-majority vote of five of the seven commissioners. While Hillsborough commissioners opted not to do that, the impetus for the 2007 tax cut further undermines Sharpe’s assertion that he reduced taxes by 17 percent.

Then there is the question of whether, in fact, taxes have fallen that much. The county’s combined property taxes brought in $610.8 million during Sharpe’s first year in office, budget records show. They are projected to bring in $659.8 million this year.

That’s an 8 percent increase. A good part of that is new construction. But it’s also a reflection that tax rate cuts, combined with plummeting property values, still haven’t quite offset the boom years that included the early part of Sharpe’s tenure. It’s why your tax bill may still be higher than when you purchased in 2005, despite politicians’ claims of tax cuts.

With another modest tax reduction tentatively approved for next year and property values still falling, tax receipts are finally projected to be 4 percent less than when Sharpe got elected.

Sharpe told PolitiFact that it’s difficult to capture all the nuances in a short sentence aimed at grabbing voters’ attention. We understand that. But with a couple of slight word adjustments — Mark Sharpe supported a 17 percent cut in the tax rate — he could have easily earned a better rating.

There is obviously a grain of truth in Sharpe’s claim. But he claimed full responsibility for cuts enabled by others and largely mandated by the state. And those cuts still have not produced an overall drop in tax revenues. So we must rate his claim Barely True. ",/factchecks/2010/aug/19/mark-sharpe/hillsborough-commission-candidate-mark-sharpe-clai/

Is the ""Ground Zero Mosque"" at Ground Zero?
","
In all of the debate over the so-called Ground Zero Mosque, we thought it made sense to start with the most basic fact-check -- whether it was accurate to even call it the Ground Zero Mosque or a mosque at or on Ground Zero? 
For the sake of discussion, we picked a statement from gubernatorial candidate Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who said in a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity on Aug. 17, 2010: ""If you take ... this imam at face value who says that this is about healing divisions, why would you want to have a mosque at Ground Zero when you know it's opening the wounds of the families of the victims of 9/11 that are still feeling this pain as if it was yesterday?"" 
The phrase ""Ground Zero Mosque"" has become a bit of media shorthand for the heated political issue, and has been used by a number of political figures discussing the propriety of the mosque's proposed location. 
For example, in a campaign ad, Rick Scott, a Republican candidate for Florida governor stated, ""Mr. President, Ground Zero is the wrong place for a mosque."" 
The proposed mosque is not at or on Ground Zero. It does not directly abut it or overlook it. 
But it is near Ground Zero. How near? Just over two blocks. The Washington Post has an interactive map of the location in relation to the World Trade Center site, including actual panoramic views. 
The addresses of the buildings in question are 45-51 and 49-51 Park Place, between West Broadway and Church Street. That's two blocks north of the northern edge of the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan. Two long blocks, in fact. The Washington Post noted that the location is ""roughly half a dozen normal lower Manhattan blocks from the site of the North Tower, the nearer of the two destroyed in the attacks."" 
According to Sharif El-Gamal, owner of the building and developer of the Park51 project, the site is as close to City Hall as it is to Ground Zero. 
""You can’t see Ground Zero from our current building and on completion of our planned building some years from now, there won’t be any views of the Ground Zero memorial from the building,"" Gamal said in a July 24, 2010, interview with altmuslim.com, an Islamic news site. 
So it's not at Ground Zero, but the proposed location for the mosque is close enough to have symbolic value -- as was acknowledged by those trying to build it. The Washington Post noted that the top of the 5-story building --formerly a Burlington Coat Factory -- was damaged by landing gear from one of the planes used in the attacks. 
In an Aug. 8, 2010, story in Newsweek, Daisy Khan, wife of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who would lead the mosque, said the location had symbolic import. ""We want to provide a counter momentum against extremism. We want peace, and we want it where it matters most. This is where it matters most."" 
The plan for the center includes a September 11th memorial, Gamal said in his interview with altmuslim.com, ""and quiet reflection space where people of different faith traditions and beliefs, sacred and secular, can find quiet time and solace."" 
While we're considering the term ""Ground Zero Mosque,"" we also wondered whether it was proper to call the project a mosque. A mosque is, in fact, planned there, but it's part of a plan for a much larger, $100 million cultural center. According to the project web site , plans include a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios and childcare services. Organizers say the center would be open to all New Yorkers, regardless of faith, and would promote cultural diversity. The center would be overseen by a 23-member Board of Directors and they say membership will not be limited to Muslims. But the center would be geared toward ""engaging New York’s many and diverse Muslim communities and promoting empowerment and compassion for all."" 
A mosque is also planned, though according to the site it would be run separately from the rest of the facilities. According to Gamal, the mosque would not tolerate ""any kind of illegal or unAmerican activity and rhetoric."" Imam Rauf has been leading prayer services in one of the buildings since 2009. 
Again, we realize many politicians and media figures are using the phrase the ""Ground Zero Mosque"" -- or as Lazio did, ""a mosque at Ground Zero"" -- as shorthand to describe the controversial project. It's nearby -- close enough to carry symbolic value to those who oppose it, and even to those proposing the project. But we think those characterizations often give the misimpression that the project is either on the old World Trade Center site or immediately next to it. And that's not right. And so we rate the claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/19/rick-lazio/ground-zero-mosque-ground-zero/

Tom Ganley's first video ad touts role in FBI investigation
","
Tom Ganley is the largest automobile dealer in Ohio, and the owner of other businesses including insurance, real estate, aviation, and finance companies. But it is a reference to his encounter with organized crime in the 1980s that opens the first TV ad in his GOP campaign for Congress against 13th district Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton:

""An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his business, threatening his family, but he fought back and won the FBI's highest civilian award.""

PolitiFact Ohio earlier gave Ganley a rating of Barely True rating for his claim, in a Sept. 13 interview with The Plain Dealer’s editorial board, that he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio.

That claim overstated his role.

Truth be told, though, we felt bad about putting a mark against Ganley’s reputation in what is, by all accounts, a laudable act: endangering himself in the interest of justice. He was instrumental in helping the Justice Department put several dangerous criminals behind bars.

We wondered whether his overstatement to the newspaper’s editorial board is how he has been portraying his role in the investigation to the public.

Before we get to what we found, we note, in the interest of transparency, that Ganley is a major advertiser in The Plain Dealer.

We did not find that Ganley has overstated his role in the investigation when speaking to the public, although others have. Generally, Ganley has portrayed his role the way he portrays it in his political ad: someone who helped the FBI with an investigation. Our reporting for the earlier PolitiFact item backs up what the TV ad says.

Articles in The Plain Dealer archives show that two organized crime figures -- former Teamsters Union leader John J. (Skip) Felice and Joseph C. Ilaqua -- were sent to prison by U.S. District Judge Alvin I. Krenzler in July 1983 after pleading guilty to conspiring to extort $10,000 and a car from Ganley in 1981 and 1982.

The indictment against Felice said he told Ganley in April 1981 that high ranking organized crime figures wanted Ganley killed, and that Felice could get the contract canceled in exchange for money. Ganley wore a wire when he met with the extortionists and asked questions at the FBI's request to help the bureau crack other cases, former FBI agents said.

""During this investigation, it became evident to these organized crime members that Mr. Ganley was cooperating with the FBI and that he would be testifying against them at trial,"" says a 2007 press release the FBI issued when it gave Ganley its Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award. ""This realization resulted in additional death threats directed at Mr. Ganley and his family. Mr. Ganley refused to be intimidated by these criminals and consented to having FBI agents live at his residence to provide security for himself and his family.""

Retired FBI agents contacted by The Plain Dealer described Ganley’s actions as courageous and important to the FBI’s investigative strategy.

Jim Huffman blames Ron Wyden for not getting more federal money

","
In his underdog bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Republican Jim Huffman has consistently railed against the senior senator for spending too much taxpayer money, in particular for voting for the $787 billion federal stimulus package approved by Congress last year. So it seemed a little strange when Huffman issued a statement accusing Wyden of failing to bring home the federal bacon.

The Sept. 2, 2010, press release is headlined ""Oregon draws short straw"" and starts with the statement: ""Oregonians watch as their tax dollars go into other states."" In it, Huffman cites a U.S. Census Bureau report that shows Oregon fifth from the bottom on federal money spent per person in the state. Huffman, a constitutional law professor at Lewis & Clark Law School, uses the report to show how Oregon was ""all but forgotten"" as the federal government spent $3.2 trillion last fiscal year.

""It is insulting to Oregonians that Ron Wyden keeps voting for deficit spending despite knowing that twice as much money is going back to Hawaii, Virginia and Alaska than is coming home to Oregon.""

Intrigued by such passion, we were curious to find out if Huffman was accurately describing the gap between Oregon and those other states. Turns out the answer is yes -- but he’s also sweetly cherry picking the three states with the highest numbers.  

It is correct that those states get twice as much as Oregon, per person. Federal spending per person in Oregon is $8,800, according to the Census Bureau, compared with $19,000 in Hawaii, $19,700 in Virginia and $20,350 in Alaska. (It’s worth noting that those states have major military installations. Oregon does not.)

Still, his underlying point is correct. Oregon falls short of the $10,400 U.S. average per person. The state ranks 46 of 50 states for federal money per capita, although you should keep in mind that two dozen states are crowded in the $8,000 to $10,000 bracket and 17 clustered in the $10,000 to $12,000 bracket.   

Oregon is a ""donor"" state. In 2005, the state received 93 cents in federal spending for every $1 sent to D.C.  in taxes. California and Washington also are donor states. The last time Oregon received $1 for every $1 sent to D.C. was in 1988, when it ranked 29th among states in taxes paid to the federal government and 39th in the amount of spending received, according to the Taxpayer Foundation. That’s also when former Sen. Mark Hatfield chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee, the pork farm of Congress.

Still, we wanted to know whether Huffman thought it OK to spend money Congress doesn’t have -- also known as deficit spending -- if more of the dollars come to Oregon.

Huffman campaign manager Amilyn Gordon said Huffman doesn’t like overspending and he doesn’t like the idea of sending pet projects to Oregon. But Gordon said it’s more than fair to point out that Oregon is tops in unemployment and in the bottom in dollars from Congress. ""Here’s just another example of how Oregon is drawing the short straw,"" she said.  

Huffman is right that Oregon lags behind other states, but he stretches his point by singling out the three highest states for comparison and by saying that Oregon was ""all but forgotten."" This claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

Bill White says Texas has a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states
","
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White has charged Gov. Rick Perry with taking undue credit for Texas job growth and ducking the limelight when the economy looks bleak. 
Earlier this month, we rated True Perry's boast in a TV ad that Texas has created more jobs than the other states combined. 
""Does he accept responsibility for one million Texans unemployed and a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states?"" White asked in a Sept. 27 e-mail. 
White's hammered the number of unemployed Texans before — in March, we rated True his claim that nearly 1 million Texans were unemployed, a state record. As of August, the number of unemployed crept up to 1,004,388, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. We wondered whether Texas has a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states. 
So we consulted the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks unemployment data in each state, to see how Texas compared to the four states it borders: New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. 
In August, Texas and New Mexico had an unemployment rate of 8.3 percent, followed by Louisiana (7.6 percent), Arkansas (7.5 percent), and Oklahoma (7 percent). 
Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, confirmed that Texas had a higher unemployment rate than three of the four adjacent states, and noted that ""nearby states"" Colorado and Kansas also had a lower rate (8.2 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively). 
Next, we looked at Augusts past starting in 2001, Perry's first full year in the governor's office. We found that Oklahoma and Louisiana have had lower unemployment rates, and until this year, New Mexico had a lower unemployment rate than Texas. Arkansas had a higher unemployment rate than Texas in 2006 to 2008. 
Nationally, the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent in August. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia had higher unemployment rates than Texas. 
Upshot: In August, Texas had a higher unemployment rate than Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, but not New Mexico. 
We rate White's statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/30/bill-white/bill-white-says-texas-has-higher-unemployment-rate/

President Barack Obama says kids in U.S. need longer school years
","
It's not the most popular plank in the Obama platform among too-young-to-vote crowd.

Nonetheless, in an interview on the Today Show on Sept. 27, 2010, that focused on education, President Barack Obama stuck to his long-held position, saying, ""I think we should have longer school years.""

The following day, Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert took aim at Obama's plan, saying, ""This has got to be Obama's worst legislative initiative since the 'You Forgot to Give Us Homework Act' of 2009.""

Whether summer vacation ought to be shortened is a matter of opinion. But what Obama said to back up his position is a checkable fact.

""We now have our kids go to school about a month less than most other advanced countries,"" Obama said. ""And that makes a difference.""

In the United States, kids go to school 180 days a year.

We looked at statistics from 2008 provided by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), a research group sponsored by most of the world's advanced industrialize nations. Among the 31 OECD countries that reported statistics, the average for primary grades of public school was 187 days. The average for countries in the European Union, which includes several countries which are not part of the OECD, was 184 days per year.

So it's certainly accurate to say that kids in the United States go to school fewer days than most other advanced countries. But ""about a month"" less? Taking out weekends, we figured a generous figure for ""about a month"" was at least 15 days. According to the OECD, there were eight countries with 195 or more days of school a year. Again, that's out of 31, so it's not ""most.""

Obama had it right when he raised this issue last year and cited a similar, but different statistic.

""We can no longer afford an academic calendar designed when America was a nation of farmers who needed their children at home plowing the land at the end of each day,"" Obama said. ""That calendar may have once made sense, but today, it puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea. That is no way to prepare them for a 21st-century economy.""

With regard to South Korea, Obama was on the mark. American children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea (220 days).

The issue of longer school years has been debated intensely in academic circles for years. Some studies have made a case for longer school days, rather than more days of school, while others have shown longer schools years have been of particular benefit to poorly performing students.

But our focus here is on Obama's claim about the length of the school year in the United States compared with other advanced countries around the world. We think Obama has a solid argument about American kids going to school fewer days than many other kids, but it's a stretch to say they go about a month less than students in most other advanced countries. Students in those countries on average go about a week and a half longer. Students in only about a quarter of those countries go to school close to a month longer than American kids.

Mark Belling says Sen. Russ Feingold faked his TV ad
","
In a new TV ad, U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold goes back in history, reviving images from his successful 1992 campaign when he painted promises on his garage door in Middleton. Facing a tough re-election battle, the Wisconsin Democrat tells voters he owns the same house and is still the small-town fella they elected 18 years ago -- except that today he posts promises on a website instead of his garage.

It’s not exactly what you would call an attack ad. But it was enough to open the door for an attack by WISN-AM talk radio host Mark Belling.

""I’m going to make an accusation here, and I am very confident that I am correct in my accusation,"" Belling said in the first hour of his Sept. 28, 2010 program. ""That ad is a fake. That ad is a fake. Feingold is not standing in front of his house in this new ad. They faked it.""

Belling said he checked out the ad himself and cited an expert source he said he could not identify.

""Ninety minutes of my life today was spent frame-by-framing this through the Internet to find the tipoffs that have convinced me the ad is fake,"" he told his listeners. ""…My contention is Russ is standing in the studio.""

On his website, Belling posted a link to the ad with this headline: ""This Feingold Ad Is A Fake: He’s Not Standing In Front of His House.""

While our primary focus at PolitiFact Wisconsin is fact-checking the promises, claims and accusations made by elected officials and candidates, we will also examine the words of other voices who shape the political discourse.

This was a strong accusation: Did a U.S. Senate candidate aiming to show off his roots back home fake the scene from a far-off TV studio?

Belling wasn’t the only person to suggest it.

A political blog affiliated with the conservative National Review said it appeared that Feingold had filmed his portion of the commercial elsewhere, in front of a ""green screen,"" and then was superimposed in front of the Middleton house. This note was picked up by National Public Radio in a weekly game show heard by some 3 million people.

Both the blog and NPR withdrew their suggestions after the Feingold campaign complained it wasn’t true.

We asked Belling for his evidence.

""I have none,"" he said in an e-mail to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""It’s an accusation. They can deny it and if they're right, I'll admit it.

""But it's very fishy.""

He went on to highlight his suspicions, including: ""The bushes throw off a shadow; Feingold doesn’t""; and ""His wave to the house looks fake. Why wave to a house when you’re in front of it."" Also, the light is shining from the left, but Feingold’s left side ""doesn’t seem lit,’’ Belling wrote.

And the feet: ""Why do you not see Russ's feet?  It's much harder to make it appear he's
standing on something than in front of it.""

Belling declined to name his source, other than to say he was involved in video production and shared his suspicions.

""I have no proof,’’ Belling said. ""I'm making an accusation that it's faked, and they can confirm or deny it.""

So, we asked Feingold.  Was he standing in his driveway when the ad was shot?

""I’m trying not to laugh,"" Feingold said. ""Yes.""

After spending the night at  his Middleton house, Feingold said, he attended the dedication of a war memorial in Sauk Prairie on Aug. 28 while the production crew set up in the driveway. Then he returned home to shoot the commercial.

His campaign provided a still photo shot during the filming that shows Feingold in front of the house with a crew member identified as Rob Wernette, a freelance grip from Milwaukee.

An employee for the WisPolitics.com website also saw the ad being filmed, with Feingold standing in his driveway.  Jeff Mayers, president of WisPolitics, said one of his employees saw Feingold filming the ad in front of his home and the employee confirmed it when contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin.

Feingold said plenty of folks passed by the house during the two-hour filming, some beeping and giving him a thumbs up.

Feingold complained that he has received a lot of ""cheap shots,’’ but that ""this is the dumbest one of all time.’’

We’re  not aware of any ranking of cheap shots, so we won’t weigh in on that.

As for Belling’s accusation, the veteran talk show host tried to turn Feingold’s own ad against him, to suggest he’s so out of touch with state voters that he was even out of state when the ad was filmed. He said he based his assertion on his own review of the photography and on one unnamed source, who had no knowledge of how the shoot was conducted but who thought it looked fishy. As for Belling’s proof, we’ll use his own words to describe it: ""I have none."" 
And we’ll add three words of our own: Pants on Fire. 
(Note: On Sept. 30, 2010, Belling changed his position and said the Feingold ad was not faked).",/factchecks/2010/sep/29/mark-belling/mark-belling-says-sen-russ-feingold-faked-his-tv-a/

Ants in the stimulus? Office space for politicians? Ad attacks New Hampshire Senate candidate
","
In the New Hampshire U.S. Senate race, pork is the theme of dueling ads.

Paul Hodes, the Democratic candidate and member of the U.S. House of Representatives, started the ball rolling with footage of himself at a hot dog eating contest, promising he would be a senator ""who gets rid of the pork.""

The group American Crossroads fired back. American Crossroads is a conservative, Republican-backed political advocacy group that's launched ads against Democrats around the country. Some are calling the group a ""SuperPAC"" (PAC stands for political action committee) because of its fund-raising prowess and national reach.

The ad against Hodes features a hot dog cart and carnival music. Here's what the ad says:

""In New Hampshire, Congressman Hodes claims, 'You deserve a senator who's a real fiscal conservative... and who gets rid of the pork.' But Hodes voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians. Billions wasted and unemployment still higher. No wonder the Union Leader says 'The guy just can't tell the truth.'""

We wanted to check whether the stimulus had ""$1.9 million to study ants"" in Africa and ""$39 million for office upgardes for politicians."" Both projects are on a list of stimulus projects put together by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that American Crossroads pointed us to. The list included  ""100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues.""

Let's start with the ants. Several candidates have been facing this line of attack over their votes in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the economic stimulus. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon looked at the charge made against Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon's Democratic incumbent.

We checked Hodes' voting record and found that he did indeed vote for the stimulus bill.

But the stimulus didn't release money for ant research directly, and you won't find a ""study of ants"" in the bill's text.

Instead, the federal stimulus gave $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which otherwise had a budget of about $6.5 billion in 2009. The foundation is an independent federal agency devoted to the progress of science. It distributed the stimulus money using the same peer-review process that it normally uses to decide which scientific research deserves funding.

Here, it's best to quote from PolitiFact Oregon's report:

""As it turns out, one scientist's study on ants of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa made the cut. PolitiFact Oregon caught up with Brian Fisher, the project's leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, to pick his brain about the recent political celebrity of ants. He was, maybe surprisingly, pretty unfazed.

""'I think it's legitimate,' he said. 'There's no reason why people shouldn't challenge this and question what we're doing.'

""What exactly are they doing? Well, over the course of the next five years, Fisher and his team will be studying arthropods -- a category that includes ants -- in a part of the world he describes as immensely diverse, biologically speaking. While ant research might not seem like an obvious target for government funds, Fisher provides a logical defense.

""Ants, Fisher says, offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. 'You can't monitor every single living thing, (but) there are key groups that can serve as indicators for other taxa, ants being one of them,' he said. 'Without them, we wouldn't have a functioning ecosystem.' (Taxa are groups of organisms.)

""It's also worth noting that the project has so far helped employ 16 people, at Fisher's last count.""

Now, what about the other claim, that the stimulus spent ""$39 million for office upgrades for politicians""?

The basis for this claim is a project in to renovate the Kansas State Capitol, a historic structure that dates to the late 1800s. A major renovation has been going on since 2000 to improve the building's wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning. And yes, the legislators also wanted more office space and upgraded meeting rooms, according to a 2009 Associated Press report. Hence ""office upgrades for politicians."" The overall project is expected to cost upwards of $285 million.

The $39 million from the stimulus bill is not direct funding. Instead, it comes from a special bond program, Build America Bonds, created by the stimulus to help local governments save money on building projects.

""As a result of this federal subsidy payment, state and local governments will have lower net borrowing costs and be able to reach more sources of borrowing than with more traditional tax-exempt or tax credit bonds,"" said a statement on the U.S. Treasury Department website.

Last summer, state officials decided to use the program to pay for the project, and $39 million is the amount that the federal bond program subsidizes. A Kansas official said that it would save the state about $500,000 in debt service costs.

""There's not stimulus money that's directly going to the renovation,"" said Amy Jordan Wooden, press secretary for Kansas Gov. Mark Parkinson. ""It gives us a lower interest rate than we could get on the market.""

Finally, a small bonus fact-check: We were curious about the ad's statement that ""the Union Leader says 'The guy just can't tell the truth.'"" The newspaper's conservative editorial page did indeed say that about an attack ad Hodes launched against his opponent, former attorney general Kelly Ayotte. Our friends at Factcheck.org debunked Hodes' attack on Ayotte, finding he was inaccurate when he suggested she had hidden e-mails that were relevant to a state investigation of an alleged Ponzi scheme. In July, the Union Leader lashed him for ""blatantly false attacks against his leading rival.""

For our ruling, we're looking at the ad's statement that "" Hodes voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians."" It's true that Hodes voted for the bill, but at the time he had no way of knowing that those particular projects would be funded. It is a stretch to say that he voted for ""$1.9 million to study ants in Africa,"" because he voted to add $3 billion in funding for the National Science Foundation. Its explanation of ""$39 million for office upgrades for politicians"" also leaves out significant details. It's a bond program, not a direct subsidy, and the money supports a large historical renovation, not simply ""office upgrades for politicians.""

Tom Barrett says gubernatorial rival Scott Walker eliminated economic development office during recession
","
In the wake of a major recession, and with state unemployment stubbornly high, there’s little surprise jobs have been a central focus in the Wisconsin governor’s race.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic nominee, is faulted by Republicans for job losses in the city. And Barrett is slamming Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, his GOP rival, for not doing enough from his office -- and even doing more harm than good.

In a new television ad, titled ""The Difference is Jobs,"" Barrett makes this claim:

Scott Walker ""eliminated his own office of economic development in the middle of this recession.""

That’s a pretty strong shot. But is it true?

Let’s start with the recession piece of this:

While economic times are still unquestionably tough, the official time frame for the Great Recession is December 2007 through June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The Barrett campaign is basing its claim on Walker’s two most recent budgets, for 2009 and 2010.

In the 2009 budget, introduced in September 2008, Walker eliminated the county’s Economic Development Department, moved the seven staff members to other departments and downgraded the director position to a lower level bureaucrat.

""We didn’t eliminate the office that office as much as reassign it,"" Walker said, when asked about the claim. He noted that the economic development activities already were limited -- such as handling real estate deals, low income housing and block grants.

""It represents more of a realistic expectation of what the county is doing,"" Walker said at the time the office was moved. ""We still very much want to play a role.""

In the fall of 2009, Walker switched gears and proposed creating a new county office of business development within his own office as part of the 2010 budget. He called for three staff members and a director. But the County Board approved only the position for the director, deleting the staffers. And it put the post in the Department of Transportation and Public Works.

So, while the Barrett TV ad focuses on Walker’s action, it leaves out an important detail: the board’s involvement in approving -- or blocking -- the executive’s proposals.

Additionally, the ad leaves the impression the county has played a large role in economic development.

To be sure, there are economic development issues facing the county, from development of the County Grounds in Wauwatosa, to the sale of county land in the Park East Corridor in downtown Milwaukee, and increased interest in the area surrounding booming Mitchell International Airport.

But the county has never placed as high a priority on economic development as the city, which has many more tools at its disposal to induce projects, including controls over zoning and the ability to create special tax financing districts. The Department of City Development is one of the most powerful -- and largest -- departments at City Hall.

We turned to Bill Drew for a little insight.

Drew is director of the Milwaukee County Research Park on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. In the past, he served as commissioner of city development and also was director of administration for a time at the county, under former County Executive F. Thomas Ament’s administration. (He has contributed $1,000 to Walker’s gubernatorial campaign).  

What role should the county play?

""The county has struggled to come up with an answer,"" Drew said. ""We’ve been in and out of that business in one way or another since the early ’90s.""

The situation is exacerbated by fighting between the board and the executive.

""It’s the culture of the institution that is causing a problem,"" Drew said. The board and executive have to agree ""on the same vision and make a commitment that’s longer than one year.""

Drew said there hasn’t been a professional economic development specialist at the county since Tim Casey, now economic development coordinator in Brookfield, held the post in the 1990s.

Under Walker, two of his recent selections to lead economic development efforts -- Bob Dennik and Tim Russell -- came from his campaign organization and didn’t last long.

While Barrett’s claim is very specific -- on whether the department was eliminated -- it aims to make a broader point: That Walker has not done what he could have done when it comes to jobs.

So we will delve a little deeper into how the position has been handled.

After the battle over reinstating the office in 2010, Walker could have filled the position starting in January. In August, he hired Damon Dorsey. There was no official announcement of the hiring. It did not become public until it appeared on a County Board committee agenda.

Most recently, Dorsey had worked for the administration of outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle on a proposed $810 million high-speed rail connection -- opposed by Walker -- between Milwaukee and Madison. He made $25 an hour, or $52,200 a year, to assist getting communities involved along the rail line.

In the county job, he will make $80,500 a year.

Dorsey is the former leader of the North Avenue Community Development Corp., which developed several apartment and retail buildings in the central city. In 2007, he developed a commercial building at N. 37th St. and W. North Ave. for a custard and burger stand called Scoopz that was publicly financed in part by the Milwaukee Economic Development Corp. and state Department of Commerce.

The business closed after less than a year, and Dorsey and his wife, Maria, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2009. That case has since been closed. As part of the bankruptcy, Dorsey was required to take a personal financial management class, a routine hurdle required by federal law.

Dorsey said the Scoopz experience shows that he understands the challenges facing businesses in this economic climate.

""I’ve been on the front lines of the war,"" he said. ""I’ve seen the blood.""

So, let’s return to the job -- and claim -- at hand.

To draw a contrast on the critical issue of jobs, Tom Barrett says Scott Walker shut down his economic development office in the midst of a recession. The office did disappear, but in less than a year Walker was already trying to reinstate it -- though the County Board sliced back his plans. While the Barrett TV ad leaves the impression the county’s department was large, economic development has never been a major priority or function of the county.

Says “$30 million gap” in stadium funding forced the Portland Beavers to leave
","
To hear Mayor Sam Adams explain it, the Portland Beavers this month played their last game in Portland because city leaders couldn’t plug a ""$30 million gap"" toward the cost of building a new stadium for the minor league baseball team.

Adams repeated that ""$30 million gap"" claim, or cited finances, eight times during a heated 15-minute radio exchange with The Oregonian’s sports columnist John Canzano on Sept. 7, 2010. Adams said city leaders did everything they could to keep the Portland Beavers in town, but a lack of money, not political effort, caused the team’s pending departure.

""Well, some of us have to exist in the real world of finance,"" Adams told Canzano. ""And the fact of the matter is, is that baseball, the Beavers, great, great tradition. That’s why I’m absolutely interested in keeping them in the city of Portland. That’s why we looked at 20 sites. That’s why we spent 18 months, almost two years doing that. But the fact of the matter is, there’s a $30 million gap. And there’s no amount of rhetoric on your part that’s going to make up for that gap.""

We decided to dust off Adams’ year-old funding proposals for the Portland Beavers. And the fact of the matter is, the gap never did reach $30 million, although it came close. But Adams’ financial assertion glossed over the more significant political pressures that dogged proposals for a baseball stadium at the Rose Quarter or Lents Park.

It was those political pressures -- not money -- that derailed plans to build at the two most-viable sites.

First, a review of the numbers:

The Portland City Council voted 3-2 in March 2009 to support a preliminary deal to turn PGE Park into a soccer-specific facility for the Portland Timbers and to build a new stadium for the Beavers in the Rose Quarter.

The proposal outlined estimated costs and funding sources. There was, in fact, a sizable gap: $26.8 million that city leaders and Merritt Paulson, the Beavers and Timbers owner, had to fill. Roy Kaufmann, Adams’ spokesman, said the mayor rounded up when citing the $30 million gap. We’ll give him that.

The city later floated a plan to build a baseball stadium at Lents Park. That proposal also included estimated costs and funding sources, much of it largely tied to a controversial plan to dip into urban renewal money. That proposal included a $9 million funding gap, and Paulson -- not the city -- was required to find the missing money. In this case, Adams’ ""$30 million gap"" is significantly inflated.

As for the politics:

The Rose Quarter proposal fell apart amid public push-back over tearing down Memorial Coliseum to make way for a baseball stadium. The City Council was scheduled to vote on the issue in April 2009, but Adams postponed action twice amid criticism from the architecture community, which wanted to preserve the glass-framed building. Adams in May 2009 announced Memorial Coliseum would be spared.

City officials and Paulson then focused attention on Lents Park in Southeast Portland. Vocal Lents residents who disliked the proposal booed Paulson during a hostile June 2009 meeting. The next day, Paulson withdrew his proposal citing ""a lack of community support.""

Fast-forward to September 2010, when the Portland Beavers played their final game in PGE Park. Paulson is expected to sell the baseball team, and new ownership will likely move it to California.

Kaufmann said Adams would have addressed the location and political challenges -- and not kept repeating the ""$30 million gap"" claim -- had Adams and Canzano had a reasoned discussion instead of their rancorous back-and-forth.

So here’s the umpire’s call: Adams is correct in citing a funding gap, but he overstated it by between $3.2 million and $21 million, depending on the location -- Memorial Coliseum or Lents Park. Adams at the same time largely ignored the political challenges that ultimately killed both proposals. This historical revisionism makes Adams look like a fiscal steward, when in fact Adams and City Commissioner Randy Leonard were working most closely with Paulson to broker deals that the public wouldn’t endorse.

We rate Adams’ statement Half True.

GOP auditor candidate Dave Yost says opponent David Pepper kicked off a jock tax
","
When LeBron James returns to Cleveland as a member of the Miami Heat during the upcoming NBA season, a small slice of his game-day check will be carved out and handed over to the city of Cleveland.

Taxing the income of visiting professional athletes – the ""jock tax,"" as some derisively call it – is a common practice around the country that was incorporated into Ohio law in 2000.

Ohio’s cities with major professional sports franchises have been collecting the tax for years, but recently the jock tax has become an issue in the state auditor’s race, a closely watched election because the winner will sit on the five-member Apportionment Board that will redraw Ohio’s legislative districts next year.

Republican Dave Yost, in his quest to paint Democratic opponent David Pepper as a serial taxer, has blamed Pepper for instituting a jock tax when he was a Cincinnati city councilman. (To be clear, the state auditor cannot levy taxes.)

""Pepper also kicked off a jock tax, imposing a levy on the sports and entertainment industry,"" according to a video Yost’s campaign produced in August.

PolitiFact Ohio asked Yost’s campaign to back up the claim. It pointed to legislation Pepper sponsored as a city councilman in 2002 that called on Cincinnati to begin collecting income taxes from visiting professional athletes and entertainers. The motion passed and Cincinnati began collecting the tax.

Pepper, now a county commissioner in Cincinnati’s Hamilton County, denies responsibility for imposing the tax. Pepper instead blamed state lawmakers who included the jock tax in a comprehensive municipal tax bill passed in 2000. Pepper said that bill, HB 483, forced cities to tax those athletes’ earnings.

We took a closer look at HB 483 and found a provision that prohibits cities from taxing the income of anyone who works in a city for 12 or fewer days in a calendar year. An exception to that rule, however, is ""a professional entertainer or professional athlete … as may be reasonably defined by the municipal corporation,"" the bill reads. That means an Ohio city can tax a professional athlete’s pay, no matter how many days he works there. (The provision originally was part of another bill that passed in 2000, HB 477, but was thrown into HB 483 for technical reasons.)

While Pepper argued state law requires Cincinnati to collect the jock tax, experts we talked to said the 2000 state law placed Cincinnati under no obligation to do so.

""It’s up the city,"" said John Mahoney, deputy director of the nonpartisan Ohio Municipal League, which represents the collective interests of the state’s municipalities.

Cities, under home rule powers, generally have the final say when deciding whose income to tax. State lawmakers can only limit this authority, Mahoney said. The Ohio Municipal League, he noted, worked with lawmakers on the issue during the legislative process.

Don Mottley, a former Republican state representative who sponsored both HB 483 and HB 477 and chaired the House Ways and Means committee hearings on each bill, agreed with Mahoney.

""There’s nothing in there that requires them to tax athletes and entertainers,"" Mottley said. ""It just permits them to.""

Mottley left the General Assembly at the end of 2000 and began practicing law. He also is a former chairman of the Ohio State Bar Association’s taxation committee.

He represented the Cincinnati Bengals before the Cincinnati City Council in 2002 in opposition of Pepper’s legislation. The Bengals feared Cincinnati’s tax on opposing players would prompt more NFL cities to pass similar laws, Mottley said.

But Cincinnati was far from the first city to collect a jock tax. Cleveland has been collecting the tax for more than three decades, and Columbus, home to an NHL team and a Major League Soccer team, has been doing so since the mid-1990s.

In his defense, Pepper said the video makes it seem as if he created a never-before-seen tax. Pepper said he wanted Cincinnati to be in step with state law that allowed it to tax visiting athletes’ income. He said city law mandates taxing all qualifying wage earners.

It is true that Pepper did not create the jock tax: It was collected in other cities before he pushed for it in Cincinnati. And a claim in the video that  ""CNN called it one of the strangest taxes in America"" is an overstatement. The jock tax was included in a 2005 CNNmoney.com article that described, in general terms, how athletes’ income is taxed in different states. The story did not mention Pepper or the city of Cincinnati.

However, Pepper’s legislation, while beneficial to the city budget, did institute the tax collection in Cincinnati. And the experts we talked to said collecting the tax was the city’s prerogative. Pepper can’t duck responsibility for starting the tax in Cincinnati.

Crossroads GPS ad blasts Joe Sestak for vote to ""gut Medicare""
","
Crossroads GPS, a deep-pocketed conservative advocacy group that has been running issue advertisements in a variety of key 2010 Congressional contests, recently produced an ad attacking Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., who's running for a Senate seat against former GOP Rep. Pat Toomey.

The ad's narration begins, ""Over half a million Pennsylvanians unemployed, and what's Congressman Joe Sestak done? He voted to gut Medicare, slashing benefits for Pennsylvania seniors. The Obama-Sestak scheme could jeopardize access to care for millions."" In the visuals, the ad says, ""Reducing benefits for 854,489 seniors,"" a statistic it attributes to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan group that studies health care policy. The ad also says on screen that Sestak ""voted to cut Medicare by $500 billion,"" citing his vote in favor of the Democratic health care bill that was signed into law earlier this year by President Barack Obama.

Focusing on seniors makes sense in Pennsylvania: It's the fourth oldest state in the union, with 15.5 percent of its residents over 65, trailing only Florida, West Virginia and Maine. So we thought we'd check to see whether the ad's claims about Medicare cuts were accurate.

Initially, we were puzzled by the reference to ""854,489 seniors,"" since it seemed like a remarkably specific number. When we contacted Crossroads GPS, a spokesman pointed us to a Kaiser Family Foundation database on Medicare Advantage, which is an option within Medicare -- the federal health care plan for Americans over 65 -- provided by private insurers. The Kaiser table shows that Crossroads GPS correctly cited the number of Pennsylvania seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage. That number accounts for nearly 39 percent of all Medicare enrollees in the Keystone State, which is higher than the national average of 25 percent.

Because the ad focuses on Medicare Advantage, we'll begin with that facet of the new law.

As we stated in a recent fact-check of a different ad, the Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more private sector efficiency to the Medicare program. But the program's higher costs made it a prime target for architects of the new health care law.

A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found that, on average, Medicare Advantage programs cost taxpayers 14 percent more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law phased out the extra payments Medicare Advantage programs were due to receive over the next three to six years, with the goal of bringing their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The changes were designed to save a projected $136 billion.

Would these changes translate into ""reducing benefits"" for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, as the Crossroads GPS ad says?

The cuts do put in jeopardy some of the more generous benefits that Medicare Advantage plans currently offer, such as dental and vision coverage, enhanced prescription drug coverage, coverage for the beneficiary's Medicare premiums and gym memberships. (The specific benefits differ by plan; indeed, variations in benefit packages are a major way that providers compete with each other for seniors.)

""Many insurers are expected to stop participating in the program, while others will increase the premiums they charge seniors,"" said Michael Tanner, a health care specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute.

On the other hand, the new law makes clear that Medicare Advantage providers cannot cut basic Medicare benefits -- just extra benefits that are not available to people getting traditional Medicare. This doesn't make the cuts any less real, but the ad, by not mentioning this context, might give viewers a skewed impression of the law's provisions.

In addition, other parts of the new law expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- the federal office that oversees Medicare -- announced last week that, on average, Medicare Advantage premiums will drop by 1 percent between 2010 and 2011.

All of this suggests that there will probably be benefit cuts to Medicare Advantage programs but not to the core program. And the exact shape of these changes is not known yet.

""It is not yet clear how plans will respond to payment reductions enacted in the health reform law, nor what these changes will mean for beneficiaries nationwide or in any given state,"" said Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

So looking back at the ad's claims, do the Medicare Advantage changes ""gut Medicare"" or ""jeopardize access to care for millions""?

We think ""gut"" is an overheated way of putting it. There will likely be cuts to Medicare Advantage, but to suggest that these will eviscerate the program seems exaggerated, since basic benefits must be preserved.

What about the possibility that the changes could ""jeopardize access to care for millions""? Setting aside the fact that there are not ""millions"" of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Pennsylvania, we'll acknowledge that there's a risk that some Medicare Advantage providers will look at their financial balance sheets and decide to pull out of the market. But Neuman said that Medicare beneficiaries have an average of 30 plans available to them in 2010 -- and if they can't find one they like, they can always sign up for regular Medicare. That doesn't seem to us like a situation in which access will be jeopardized.

What if you assume that the ad was referring to Medicare as a whole (not just to Medicare Advantage) when it talked about gutting Medicare and jeopardizing access to care?

Answering this question brings up the $500 billion cut referenced in the ad. The new law would indeed slow the rate of growth of the broader Medicare program by roughly that amount over 10 years. But it's not a slam-dunk that this represents a cut.

The new law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, it would slow the program's future growth over 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- in fact, the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' non-partisan arbiter on such matters, projects that Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

Such reductions could certainly squeeze future benefits, especially when inflation in the health care sector is taken into account. But once again, we feel that the use of the word ""gut"" and the notion that beneficiaries will find their access to care jeopardized amounts to an exaggeration.

The changes in the new law ""are not going to cause any hospital, and few other providers, to drop Medicare patients -- they couldn’t survive without them,"" said Henry Aaron, a health care specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.

So let's recap. The ad is on fairly safe ground in suggesting that Pennsylvania's 854,489 seniors on Medicare Advantage will see a decline in benefits, but it ignores the fact that no basic benefits will be cut. Meanwhile, the ad uses what we consider overheated language. The changes set in motion by the new law don't strike us, or several experts we spoke to, as ones that will ""gut"" the program or ""jeopardize access to care for millions."" So we rate the ad Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/28/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-ad-blasts-joe-sestak-vote-gut-medic/

Sen. J.D. Alexander says solar panels take as much energy to make as they generate
","
The Florida solar rebate debate begs for a little sunshine.

The state owes Floridians $52.7 million in unpaid solar energy rebates. But lawmakers recently ignored Gov. Charlie Crist’s request to tap federal stimulus money to dent the backlog.

Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, told a St. Petersburg Times reporter, ""It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life. I really doubt that this is a good investment for the people of Florida.""

His energy payback claim caught some eyes — and ours.

Steve Plice quickly e-mailed PolitiFact Florida. To the president of Tampa Bay Living Green, a nonprofit that teaches about environmental sustainability, Alexander’s claim stuck out. ""Could you please check this?"" he asked. ""I have seen estimates for the energy payback period ranging from 18 months to 11 years. Solar panels are expected to last 20-30 years, so Mr. Alexander's claims would seem to be very wrong.""

As Plice suggests, this isn’t unexplored territory. For years, energy payback studies have examined how much energy it takes to manufacture, install and operate various kinds of solar panels, also referred to as photovoltaic modules or arrays. The idea is, a solar panel should capture more energy over its lifetime than it saps. Otherwise, as Alexander notes, one would hardly be a ""good investment.""

We asked Alexander for support for his comments. He sent a link to a solar energy payback study he thought we ""may find helpful."" And did we ever.

The study published by Energy Bulletin, an online clearinghouse of news and analysis, did, indeed, address Alexander’s claim. It mentioned the most commonly cited — and ""possibly the only"" — study that says the energy payback time on a solar panel may exceed its lifetime. The Energy Bulletin authors hadn’t found any published studies that reference the work, a 1996 book by Howard Odum called Environmental Accounting. They did note the popularity of Odum’s analysis on Web forums. Then they explain why Odum’s findings can be rejected.

The Energy Bulletin authors, who reviewed other published work to reach wider conclusions about roof-mounted solar panel systems — a type a Florida homeowner might install — concluded the systems would generate enough electricity to cover their energy debt in two to eight years, and turn sunlight into energy for at least 25 years.

So, they wrote in 2006, the systems ""have a positive energy payback and are capable of contributing to a sustainable energy future.""

Alexander’s own link debunks his claim. But we were ready to examine other evidence, just in case.

In 1975, the Florida Legislature created the Florida Solar Energy Center to research, test and certify solar systems and develop education programs. Dr. James Fenton, a professor of mechanical, materials and aerospace engineering, directs the institute at the University of Central Florida.

Fenton pointed us to a study published two years later than Alexander’s that focuses on emissions from the life cycle of photovoltaic cells, and makes references to multiple energy payback studies. It explains that the life cycle of a photovoltaic system starts with mining quartz sand or metal ore, depending on the type of system, which then has to be purified and turned into silicon wafers or thin film. That takes a lot of energy, right?

Sure, but only as much as is generated by solar systems in three to six years, and sometimes as little as a year or so, especially in sunnier climates, the study summarizes.

The U.S. Department of Energy also weighs in on the topic, through a PV FAQs explainer piece called ""What is the energy payback for PV?"" produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. No good news for Alexander’s claim here. Instead, the FAQ says, ""Based on models and real data, the idea that PV (photovoltaics) cannot pay back its energy investment is simply a myth.""

It concludes that for an investment of one to four years worth of energy output, rooftop systems can provide 30 years or more of clean energy.

Other studies sent our way reached similar conclusions.

Now, when Alexander provided us with the Energy Bulletin study, he explained in support of his claim that ""the answer really depends on so many variables that are often difficult to control"" such as materials used to create a solar panel, the type of solar system and where it is located. (He noted that ""obviously some parts of the country get a lot more sunlight and cloud cover than others."" Perhaps he forgot he’s a lawmaker in Florida, the Sunshine State.)

""Given best materials and optimal conditions,"" he wrote, ""there clearly can be energy payback in two to eight years. Given other conditions, the answer is there will not be payback. So, the real answer is it depends on many factors, which is true for all things involving green/clean technologies.""

Sounds reasonable, right? The only problem is that the study he points to, and others, attempt to control for those variables — and make allowances for them. That’s why the ranges are so wide: from one to four years, or from two to eight. And Alexander’s claim doesn’t contain nearly the flexibility of his followup explanation. He said: ""It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life."" 
By saying ""as it likely generates in its entire life,"" Alexander suggests that he's talking about a typical example of solar panel output, not a fringe case with undefined ""other conditions.""

Thus, our ruling. Alexander’s own evidence says his view ""can be rejected,"" and a mainstream consumer publication call it ""simply a myth."" But he uses this long-debunked claim to help justify rejecting $13.9 million in federal funds for Floridians. We have no choice other than to focus a little sunlight his way and declare his Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/sep/28/jd-alexander/solar-panels-make-far-more-energy-they-require/

David Axelrod says independent groups behind ads attacking Democratic candidates are front groups for foreign-controlled companies
","
On ABC's This Week on Sept. 26, 2010, David Axelrod was asked about the growing influence of Republican strategist Karl Rove, former adviser to President George W. Bush, who is affiliated with American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, organizations that are spending millions on ads attacking Democratic candidates.

""Here's the thing about Karl Rove and what he's doing,"" said Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama said. ""The insidious thing about it is they are funding negative ads all over the country against Democratic candidates paid for by major corporate special interests who don't have to disclose their participation, the oil industry, Wall Street, insurance industry.

""We put a bill in the United States Congress asking one thing -- and this was a loophole that was opened by the Supreme Court earlier in this year -- we put a bill in the Congress saying, disclose who is funding these campaigns. Let the American people know who's paying for these ads. It's a very simple premise.""

Axelrod is talking here about the 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court on Jan. 21, 2010 in the landmark case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which struck down barriers to corporations spending money directly from their own treasuries to influence elections. And the bill that Axelrod said would close that loophole is the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act, which was recently derailed in the Senate.

According to Axelrod, these independent groups are ""spending tens of millions of dollars. In some districts, they're spending more money than the candidates themselves on negative ads from benign-sounding Americans for Prosperity, the American Crossroads Fund. No. These are front groups for special interests. These are front groups for foreign-controlled companies, which would have been banned under the bill that we put through Congress, and they don't want the American people to know, and the American people ought to be alert to that.""

The fact we are checking here is whether some of the independent groups supporting Republican candidates are front groups for foreign-controlled companies.

White House officials said that the two groups Axelrod cited by name -- Americans for Prosperity and the American Crossroads Fund -- were examples of ""front groups for special interests,"" but not necessarily fronts for foreign-controlled companies.

According to media reports, Americans for Prosperity is funded by oil magnates David and Charles Koch; and American Crossroads is a group created by GOP strategists Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie. According to a story in Roll Call, American Crossroads is almost entirely funded by 10 wealthy donors and corporations, including $1 million from a Dallas-based oil and gas executive. While the source of American Crossroads' money must ultimately be disclosed, many of the donors may not be known until after the elections. Crossroads GPS, on the other hand, was formed as an IRS code 501(c)4 non-profit, which must spend most of its money on issues rather than candidates, but does not have to disclose its donors.
 
In other words, we don't really know where some of these groups and others funding the negative ads are getting their money.

""The fundamental problem following Citizens United is that it is difficult to determine who is sponsoring these groups,"" said White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. ""And that comes at the expense of the American people, who no longer have the right to know who is financing these ads in an attempt to influence an election for their preferred candidate. Wall Street, the insurance lobby, oil companies and other special interests are now one step closer to taking Congress back and returning to the days when lobbyists wrote the laws. And that’s the point Axelrod is making here. He’s referring generally to front groups and lists Americans for Prosperity and American Crossroads as two specific examples of incorporated entities that can now use corporate money to pay for electioneering communications in light of the Citizens United decision. They don’t represent every single kind of incorporated entity that Axelrod is referring to; they’re just two examples of front groups with benign-sounding names.""

So far, it remains to be seen how much, if any, money comes from foreign companies.

In January, 2010 PolitiFact looked into a claim from President Obama that the Citizens United case opened the floodgates for special interests -– including foreign corporations. We found that the president had overstated the decision's immediate impact and rated it Barely True.

It is a matter of intense legal debate.

In the Citizens United case, the majority justices left intact current federal law that prevents ""a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country"" from making ""directly or indirectly"" a donation or expenditure ""in connection with a Federal, State, or local election,"" to a political party committee or ""for an electioneering communication.""

But the minority justices in that case warned the ruling could lead to foreign companies exerting influence. Some legal experts we spoke to said that the ruling could open the door to foreign companies spending on American campaigns, given the general direction of the majority's opinion. We concluded then that ""until test cases proceed and further rulings are handed down, Obama's claim about foreign campaign spending is a reasonable interpretation, and nothing more.""

  White House officials could not provide evidence that any of the groups funding campaign-related ads are fronts for foreign-controlled companies. Rather, they said, the issue was raised as a hypothetical problem created by the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court.

Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, said it's ""possible"" that donations could come from a foreign-controlled company.

""I'm certainly concerned this cycle because some of these donors fly under the radar,"" she said.

However, she said. ""I know of no specific organization that is foreign-controlled. I think (Axelrod) was incorrect if he said that. It is a legitimate thing to be concerned about. There have been many examples of it happening in the past. But I don't think there is any evidence of that happening.""

Democratic lawmakers sought, in part, to definitively close the door on foreign money through the DISCLOSE Act.

""The problem with our political system is that we don't have any idea where any of the money that is going to these groups that funds these ads is coming from,"" said Doug Thornell, a spokesman for Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the Democrats' House campaign committee chief. ""The DISCLOSE Act would have provided the American people with an important tool to use to find out who is trying to influence these upcoming elections.""

Section 102 of the DISCLOSE Act detailed how it would prevent foreign influence in U.S. elections. Again, the bill stalled in the Senate.

With regard to the financial backing for some of the attack ads against Democrats, we think Obama's wording was more accurate when he said in a fund-raising speech in Philadelphia on Sept. 20, 2010, ""The names always sound very benign - it's 'Americans for Prosperity,' 'Committee for Truth in Politics,' 'Americans for Apple Pie' -- I made that last one up. None of them will disclose who is paying for these ads. You don't know whether it's some big financial interest; you don't know if it's a big oil company, or an insurance company. You don't even know if it's foreign controlled.""

Obama here warned the groups could be using money from entities that are foreign controlled.

Axelrod went one step further and said they are front groups for foreign-controlled companies. That might make for a powerful sound bite, but it's a concern, not a known fact.

We think it's defensible for Obama and Axelrod to express concern that the Citizens United decision has created the opportunity for foreign companies to use money to try to influence the upcoming elections. But we don't see any evidence to support (or disprove) that it is actually happening.  Because Axelrod's comment was so definitive, we rate it Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/28/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-independent-groups-behind-ads-attack/

Alan Grayson says opponent wants to make divorce illegal in stinging new ad
","
U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson -- the man who described the Republican Party's health care plan as ""die quickly"" and who later equated the health care system to an American holocaust, who suggested former vice president Dick Cheney was a vampire who could turn into a bat and fly away at a moment's notice, and who said putting Republicans in charge of government was akin to making members of al-Qaida pilots -- is making another series of eye-catching claims.

Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? ""Taliban Daniel Webster.""

The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript:

Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) ""Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.""

Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) ""Wives submit yourself to your own husband.""

Female narrator: ""Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us."" Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL.

Webster: ""You should submit to me. That's in the Bible.""

Female narrator: ""Webster tried to deny battered women medical care and the right to divorce their abusers.""

Webster: ""Submit to me.""

Female narrator: ""He wants to force raped women to bear the child.""

Webster: ""Submit to me.""

Female narrator: ""Taliban Daniel Webster. Hands off our bodies. And our laws.""

The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that ""Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands"" as False.

In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers.

Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: ""SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990)."" So that's where we'll start.

The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said.

But the State Archives didn't have a copy.

The Capitol Branch Library did.

Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, ""creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery.""

Florida law currently allows married couples to divorce if a court finds that the marriage is ""irretrievably broken."" It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy.

Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary ""covenant marriage."" 
Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring:

""I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me.""

The covenant marriage agreement ""may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery,"" according to the bill Webster filed.

""A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted,"" HB 1585 reads.

The bill includes no mention of physical abuse.

It also discusses alimony, noting that ""no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife,"" but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man.

Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said.

But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage.

Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the ""original"" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida.

In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery.

Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce.

In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case).

Webster's proposal was ""significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.,"" Hawkins said.

What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed?

We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.)

And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't.

Back to Grayson's claim.

In his ad ""Taliban Dan Webster,"" Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives.

Here are the facts.

When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce.

Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce. Because all of that context is critical to understanding Grayson's claim, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/28/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-opponent-wants-make-divorce-ille/

Tom Ganley's first video ad touts role in FBI investigation
","
Tom Ganley is the largest automobile dealer in Ohio, and the owner of other businesses including insurance, real estate, aviation, and finance companies. But it is a reference to his encounter with organized crime in the 1980s that opens the first TV ad in his GOP campaign for Congress against 13th district Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton:

""An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his business, threatening his family, but he fought back and won the FBI's highest civilian award.""

PolitiFact Ohio earlier gave Ganley a rating of Barely True rating for his claim, in a Sept. 13 interview with The Plain Dealer’s editorial board, that he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio.

That claim overstated his role.

Truth be told, though, we felt bad about putting a mark against Ganley’s reputation in what is, by all accounts, a laudable act: endangering himself in the interest of justice. He was instrumental in helping the Justice Department put several dangerous criminals behind bars.

We wondered whether his overstatement to the newspaper’s editorial board is how he has been portraying his role in the investigation to the public.

Before we get to what we found, we note, in the interest of transparency, that Ganley is a major advertiser in The Plain Dealer.

We did not find that Ganley has overstated his role in the investigation when speaking to the public, although others have. Generally, Ganley has portrayed his role the way he portrays it in his political ad: someone who helped the FBI with an investigation. Our reporting for the earlier PolitiFact item backs up what the TV ad says.

Articles in The Plain Dealer archives show that two organized crime figures -- former Teamsters Union leader John J. (Skip) Felice and Joseph C. Ilaqua -- were sent to prison by U.S. District Judge Alvin I. Krenzler in July 1983 after pleading guilty to conspiring to extort $10,000 and a car from Ganley in 1981 and 1982.

The indictment against Felice said he told Ganley in April 1981 that high ranking organized crime figures wanted Ganley killed, and that Felice could get the contract canceled in exchange for money. Ganley wore a wire when he met with the extortionists and asked questions at the FBI's request to help the bureau crack other cases, former FBI agents said.

""During this investigation, it became evident to these organized crime members that Mr. Ganley was cooperating with the FBI and that he would be testifying against them at trial,"" says a 2007 press release the FBI issued when it gave Ganley its Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award. ""This realization resulted in additional death threats directed at Mr. Ganley and his family. Mr. Ganley refused to be intimidated by these criminals and consented to having FBI agents live at his residence to provide security for himself and his family.""

Retired FBI agents contacted by The Plain Dealer described Ganley’s actions as courageous and important to the FBI’s investigative strategy.

Alan Grayson calls opponent 'Taliban Dan Webster' in stinging new TV ad
","
U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson -- the man who described the Republican Party's health care plan as ""die quickly"" and who later equated the health care system to an American holocaust, who suggested former vice president Dick Cheney was a vampire who could turn into a bat and fly away at a moment's notice, and who said putting Republicans in charge of government was akin to making members of al-Qaida pilots  -- is making another series of eye-catching claims.

Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? ""Taliban Dan Webster.""

(We guess we should note in fairness that the ad starts out pleasantly enough -- with Grayson's disclaimer saying he approved of the message and a picture of him smiling and holding two of his children).

The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript: 
Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) ""Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.""

Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) ""Wives submit yourself to your own husband.""

Female narrator: ""Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us."" Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL.

Webster: ""You should submit to me. That's in the Bible.""

Female narrator: ""Webster tried to deny battered women medical care and the right to divorce their abusers.""

Webster: ""Submit to me.""

Female narrator: ""He wants to force raped women to bear the child.""

Webster: ""Submit to me.""

Female narrator: ""Taliban Daniel Webster. Hands off our bodies. And our laws.""

The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers and produced rebukes from Webster's wife, Sandy Webster, and Webster campaign manager Brian Graham.

""Alan Grayson's latest attack on my husband is shameful,"" Sandy Webster said in statement. ""Mr. Grayson seems to have a problem telling the truth and no problem misleading the public. Dan has been an amazing husband and father and the finest man I have ever known. Mr. Grayson should be ashamed of his nasty smears against my husband.""

We decided to immediately check to see if Grayson is correctly quoting Webster, and we will fact-check the other claims in another report to be posted quickly.

Grayson spokesman Sam Drzymala said the audio and video of Webster come from a speech he made for the Institute in Basic Life Principles, which Drzymala described as a ""right-wing cult.""

The Institute in Basic Life Principles describes itself as a Christian teaching organization that provides training and instruction on how to find success by following God’s principles found in Scripture. Some of its specific teachings are controversial. Among them, the Institute teaches that a mother violates Scripture when she works outside the home, that married couples are to abstain from sex 40 days after the birth of a son, 80 days after the birth of a daughter and the evening prior to worship, and that people should avoid rock and even contemporary Christian music because it can be addictive.

Webster has been involved with the group for nearly 30 years and continues to participate in training and also speaks at seminars.

In a 2003 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, Webster said he home-schooled his six children on Institute curricula and said the group's teachings have had a major influence on his life.

One of those Institute beliefs describes the complementary roles of a husband and wife. ""The man provides servant leadership and the woman responds with reverent submission and assistance,"" according to the group's website, which goes on to quote Ephesians 5:22–33 -- Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. . . . Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it . . . . Let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

According to the Institute, a wife is never supposed to ""take over,"" writing that ""in response to pressures within the family or within a marital relationship, a foolish wife will take matters into her own hands."" A wife also is to ""stay beautiful for her husband.""  
""Resistance or indifference to your husband’s need for physical intimacy is the unspoken crushing of his spirit,"" the Institute says on its website. In other places on the website, the Institute talks about a wife's need to submit to a husband's spiritual leadership. 
In his 2003 interview with the Times, Webster declined to discuss specific teachings and whether he disagreed with any of them. 
""I believe what I believe,"" he said in the 2003 interview. ""It has not affected the way I've served. I don't think anyone can tell you that I've forced my beliefs on anyone else.""

Bill Gothard, founder and president of the Institute, said the image and video of Webster was taken from a talk to fathers at the group's 2009 Advanced Training Institute Conference in Nashville. The Advanced Training Institute is a home-education curriculum provided by the Institute in Basic Life Principles.

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Gothard said the quote is severely distorted and manipulated.

""It couldn't be any more starkly misused,"" Gothard said. ""That gets my adrenaline up. A man who stoops to that level should not be in any office.""

Gothard said Webster was leading a talk to a group of fathers and was discussing prayers they should say. Webster's point was that they shouldn't pray for their wives to do something, rather they should pray for what they could control in their own life.

""I am stunned how he could have taken what Daniel said, and turned it around to say the opposite of what Daniel was saying,"" Gothard said.

PolitiFact Florida asked for, and received, a video with Webster's extended comments. The video confirms Gothard's recollection of the 2009 speech.
 
""Have verses for (your) wife. I have verses for my wife,"" Webster said in an unedited excerpt provided by the Institute. ""Don't pick the ones that say, 'she should submit to me.' That's in the Bible, but pick the ones you're supposed to do (laughs). So instead (laughs) that you'd love your wife -- even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it ... and, as opposed to wives submit yourself to your own husband. She can pray that if she wants to, but don't you pray it.""

Webster goes on to make the same point about praying for children. ""Pick out the ones that have your responsibility listed into it,"" Webster said. ""Yes, children are to obey their parents, but more importantly we're as fathers to, um, not provoke them to wrath.""

So in his message Webster was telling fathers that they should not pray for the first half of the passage in Ephesians (Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands) but pray for the second (Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it).

The Grayson ad clearly suggests that Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands, and the repeated refrain of ""Submit to me,"" is an effort to scare off potential female voters. But the lines in the video are clearly taken out of context thanks to some heavy-handed editing. The actual point of Webster's 2009 speech was that husbands should love their wives.

Maybe Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands. But there's no evidence in this ad, especially Webster's own words, to support that allegation. We rate Grayson's claim False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/28/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-calls-opponent-taliban-daniel-webster/
"['Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Rebecca Kleefisch']","
Republican lieutenant governor candidate Rebecca Kleefisch says state lawmakers raised taxes by $5 billion in 2009
","
Rebecca Kleefisch knows that some voters who might back the 2010 Republican ticket for governor distrust the media as a bunch of liberals. So the former TV anchor, and new GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, stresses she is a conservative committed to cutting taxes.

Perhaps to fire up the faithful, Kleefisch declared on her campaign website:

""The Wisconsin Legislature raised taxes more than $5 billion in 2009.""

That’s a lot of dough.

And with Assembly Majority Leader Tom Nelson winning the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor, it may be that much easier to tie the tax hike to the party’s candidate for governor, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

When we called and e-mailed the Kleefisch campaign, we were promised a response on where the $5 billion figure came from. We tried again the next day, but again got no reply. Finally, Kleefisch campaign spokeswoman Jeanne Tarantino referred us to the campaign of Scott Walker, the Republican nominee for governor.

Walker and Kleefisch are running as a ticket, she explained.

OK. But something didn’t smell right.

We rechecked the Kleefisch website and found that the Issues page -- which contained her claim about the $5 billion in tax increases -- had been taken down. Now, when you click on that section of Kleefisch’s home page, you’re redirected to the Issues section of Walker’s campaign site. That’s the only place on RebeccaForReal.com where you’re jettisoned to ScottWalker.org.

The switch was made, said Walker campaign spokeswoman Jill Bader, because Walker and Kleefisch ""have a shared platform.""  

That gave us a sense, as we reached for the calculator, of where Kleefisch’s claim was heading.  

Incidentally, Kleefisch gave the same quote about the $5 billion in new taxes to a website called ConservativeFeatures.com, according to a transcript of an interview. The transcript is still on that website.

So, on to the numbers. Don’t worry, it’s simple math.

The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the nonpartisan numbers cruncher of the state Legislature, said the Legislature raised taxes and fees twice in 2009. Kleefisch’s statement mentioned only taxes, but for simplicity we will include fees here. The hikes were done in a budget-adjustment bill approved in February and in the 2009-’11 state budget, adopted in June.

The total increases in taxes and fees break down like this: 
That tallies up to $3.14 billion.

A hefty sum, to be sure. But roughly a couple billion shy of Kleefisch’s claim.

The Walker campaign’s policy director, Ryan Murray, defended Kleefisch’s statement. He agreed that the two major actions taken by the Legislature in 2009 raised taxes and fees by $3.14 billion. But, to get past the $5 billion threshold, Murray added a $1.5 billion boost in net property taxes and $130.4 million more from ""enhanced collection measures.""

Let’s take those one at a time.

Property taxes: Those levies are set by local taxing bodies, such as the city and the county, not the Legislature. Murray conceded that fact. However, he said property taxes should be added toward the $5 billion total because action by the Legislature, such as cutting aid to schools, affects what happens to property taxes.

The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonprofit research organization, said the 2009-’11 state budget would put pressure on school property tax levies because, compared with 2008-’09, state aid would be 2.7 percent lower in the first year of the budget and 2.5 percent lower in the second. But state legislative action is only one of many factors that bear on property taxes; and it’s still the case that local officials, not the Legislature, ultimately decide how high to set the levy.

Enhanced collection measures: These steps include hiring 30 more state Department of Revenue employees for ""enhanced enforcement of current tax laws."" Said Murray: ""This is just the government hassling people to pay more taxes."" It is true that the measures, if successful, will bring more dollars into state coffers. But there’s no tax increase levied on residents. If anything, the action would lighten the load on those who are already paying up.

Where does that leave us?

In emphasizing that taxes are too high, Kleefish overstated by nearly $2 billion how much taxes were raised in 2009 by the Legislature and Gov. Jim Doyle. That’s no rounding error. The Walker-Kleefisch campaign, in an attempt to get past the $5 billion threshold Kleefisch set, adds in property taxes, which are ultimately set at the local level, and then throws in redoubled efforts to collect existing taxes. We rate Kleefish’s statement False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/28/rebecca-kleefisch/republican-lieutenant-governor-candidate-rebecca-k/

Jeff Merkley says with the economic downturn Oregon is seeing more child abuse
","
Sen. Jeff Merkley appeared at the new Children’s Center in Clackamas County to raise awareness about an increase in child abuse and, according to his news release, to highlight ""the correlation to the economic downturn.""

""Even one case of child abuse or neglect is too many, and with the ongoing economic downturn, the numbers of Oregon children suffering from abuse is on the rise,"" said Merkley. ""We must do everything in our power to reduce the number of children being abused and help provide sanctuary to those in need.""

The Children’s Center received some federal money last year. And the visit was a good photo op for a freshman senator during a congressional break.

But at Politifact Oregon, we wondered if child abuse really is on the rise and if there is actually a cause-and-effect connection between child abuse and dismal economic times.

Merkley is correct about the increase: More Oregon children are suffering abuse and neglect.

The Oregon Department of Human Services reports that 11,090 children were victims of abuse or neglect last year, a 6.4 percent increase from 2008.

Population growth isn’t the only culprit behind the higher numbers. The state reports that the rate of abuse increased from 11.8 victims per 1,000 children to 12.5 per 1,000.

A check with the agency’s number-crunchers indicates the trend holds this year, with abuse reports up between 6 percent and 7 percent between July 2009 and July 2010. Though reports don’t always turn out to be confirmed cases, officials say they expect the number of child victims will rise again for 2010.

But is the increase because of high unemployment?

Merkley’s spokeswoman, Courtney Warner Crowell, said she hadn’t seen any research linking a rise in abuse to an economic downturn. But she said several people she’d talked to blamed the increase in child abuse on the economy.

But there isn’t any statistical evidence drawing a direct link between increased child abuse and a bad economy.

""We can’t say that factually and we can’t prove it,"" says Katharine Cahn, executive director of the Child Welfare Partnership at Portland State University.

The number of child abuse victims can rise, even in good times, Cahn says, simply because more people are reporting the abuse.

State stats do show alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence and parental run-ins with police among the common stress factors that contribute to child abuse.

Cahn concedes that people do feel stressed and depressed when the economy goes bust and may drink or use drugs in an attempt to cope. And that, she says, may be the indirect tie to Oregon’s rising numbers.

So, it appears that while Oregon’s junior senator was right about the numbers of kids abused, the sour economy may not be deserve all the blame. We find the claim Mostly True.
