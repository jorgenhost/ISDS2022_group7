In Georgia, Dem attack on GOP's Handel falls wide of the mark
","The race in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District tests whether Democrats can turn anger toward President Donald Trump into votes, and whether Republicans can transcend that anger in a district that has long been safe GOP territory. With a little over a month before the June 20 special election, the Democratic ad campaign went on the attack. Both the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the electoral arm of House Democrats -- and the campaign to elect Jon Ossoff ran commercials targeting Republican Karen Handel. The DCCC ad cast Handel as a politician who enjoyed the comforts of office. ""Georgia experienced the worst budget crisis since the Great Depression,"" the ad said. ""For years, we saw cuts to education, cuts to law enforcement, and rising college tuition. Yet Secretary of State Karen Handel’s office budget increased a whopping 42 percent."" Is that true? The answer depends on what you think when you hear the term ""office budget."" State budget experts at Georgia State University and the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute helped us work through the official budget documents. There was general agreement that the first budget Handel helped shaped was in early 2007. She stepped down as secretary of state in December 2009, so the last budgets she worked under fell in 2009 and 2010. We compared both to 2007. We found the administrative cost of running the secretary of state’s office rose by nearly 39 percent from 2007 to 2009, or 47 percent from 2007 to 2010 -- which is close but not quite what the ad claimed. However, the cost of the department overall actually fell by about 8 percent from 2007 to 2009, or 10 percent from 2007 to 2010. Here are the numbers:   The key here is the distinction of administration costs versus the budget of the entire department. Evan Lukaske, DCCC spokesman, told us his group pulled the 42 percent figure from a 2010 Associated Press article, which said, ""During her three years as secretary of state, the office's administration budget jumped by about 42 percent, according to state records."" More recently, a local television station confirmed that figure. (The slight difference in numbers stems from the more conservative budget assumptions we used following the guidance of budget experts.) There’s an important backstory to the spending increase that puts the number in a different light. Between 2008 and 2009, there was a reshuffling of activities within the secretary of state’s office. It had investigators spread across three separate programs. Handel consolidated them. Handel spokeswoman Kate Constantini said the easiest way to do that was to add that work to an existing line in the budget. ""That line item was part of the front office budget, which necessarily showed an increase, but was the result of moving personnel that were accounted for in other parts of the budget,"" Constantini said. The state budget brief for 2008-09 backs up Handel’s account. The rise in the administrative budget was offset by decreases in certain activities of other divisions within the department. As such, the spending increases are largely only on paper. In reality, money was shuffled around. Democrats say Handel saw her office budget rise 42 percent. While some viewers might not spot the distinction between the administrative budget and the budget for the entire office, the raw numbers support the claim. But most of that increase came from moving around work -- and the money to pay for it -- inside the department. The rise in the administrative budget was offset by cuts elsewhere. The ad’s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/may/17/dccc-lgo/georgia-dem-attack-gops-handel-falls-wide-mark/

Conspiracy theorists concoct fake report of Obama arrest for drug smuggling
","A fake news story that said former President Barack Obama was busted for his links to a drug smuggling operation is part of an extensive and completely unsupported conspiracy theory popularized online. A May 2, 2017, headline on AmericanFlavor.news declared, ""Just in: Barack Obama arrested in a Japanese drug bust."" The story was flagged by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake reports in its users’ news feeds. The post was exceptionally short, saying that Obama had ""informed on his drug-dealing bosses,"" citing ""Japanese military intelligence."" It explained that ""an airplane filled with Afghan Heroin and North Korean amphetamines was impounded at Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean."" Obama had been arrested for some unspecified connection to a ship that was carrying more than 4 tons of cocaine. The proceeds of the future drug sales were to fund ISIS, the post read. The story is nonsense, because obviously Obama had not been arrested. And he was too busy negotiating $400,000 for speaking appearances to smuggle cocaine. The AmericanFlavor.news post was the latest stop for a conspiracy theory that goes back a few weeks. The article linked to a YouTube video: The video was created by Denise Stark, a conspiracy theorist who was citing an online radio show called Stillness in the Storm, a show its creators describe as ""an ongoing conversation about world events, hidden truths, and empowering information."" Stillness in the Storm’s website linked to a blog post written by Benjamin Fulford, who on March 31 had written the piece that later appeared on AmericanFlavor.news. Stillness in the Storm had warned on its site that ""Fulford's claims should not be considered to be true without substantiation."" Fulford, in turn, used his original post to link to a March 15 screed on WhatDoesItMean.com, a site rife with conspiratorial meanderings. The essay said that Obama had some nebulous link to a fishing boat called Lady Michelle, which had been busted in the Caribbean while smuggling cocaine. The post was written by Sorcha Faal, the pseudonym of a conspiracy theorist with a series of posts on WhatDoesItMean.com. Faal’s post makes some pretty big leaps in logic, including that George W. Bush and Obama operated cocaine-smuggling operations and that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had ordered their arrest. The photo that accompanied Faal’s post was of a ship called Lady Michelle, which had been stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard off the shore of Suriname on Feb. 16, 2017. Four Guyanese men were arrested for transporting 4.2 tons of cocaine worth about $125 million. There’s no mention of Japan, or any connection to Obama. Previously PunditFact had checked a claim that Obama was arrested at the Canadian border for wiretrapping Trump, which earned a Pants On Fire! rating. This post also is contrived, stemming from unfounded conspiracy theories that drew ridiculous conclusions and made provably untrue claims.

Testing Scott Walker claim on record education funding in Wisconsin
","As Gov. Scott Walker laid out his 2017-’19 budget, he touted the ""historic investment in our priorities"" -- including K-12 education. To that end, Walker declared: ""We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin."" More money than ever before? With Walker’s budget now before the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, where it will undergo changes, we wondered if that was the case. We took a look at the budgets back to fiscal year 1991, which provides about 25 years of data and shows the trajectory before state funding jumped significantly in the late 1990s. The answer, we found, depends on how you crunch the numbers. Total state aid vs. inflation-adjusted For starters, we took Walker’s statement to mean K-12 education, not a picture that would include colleges and universities, and the ""we"" to refer to money directly from the state. That’s based on the context within Walker’s Feb, 8, 2017, budget address and the K-12 education fact sheet linked from the address itself. And when we reached out to Walker’s office, a spokesman pointed us to page 6 of the ""Budget in Brief,"" where K-12 education is addressed. That page in the briefing document shows that state aid to schools for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (the years covered by Walker’s budget) would be the highest in raw numbers -- at least back to fiscal year 2009, where the chart on the page ends. The $11.5 billion over the two years would amount to the largest tally in state history. That figure shakes out to $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. But when you compare figures over time, it’s important to take inflation into account. That is, costs grow, prices grow, the economy grows. Adjusting for inflation puts everything on an equal footing. To get inflation-adjusted state aid, we took the raw numbers from past reports from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and gathered data back to fiscal year 1991. We put the figures through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator and also compared our inflation-adjusted numbers to those run by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Both calculations found that fiscal year 2003 was the highest inflation-adjusted year for state aid to schools. That year, the raw total in state aid was $4.8 billion. But the tally by the Taxpayers Alliance found that inflation-adjusted state aid that year totaled $6.5 billion. That’s far more than the $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion proposed for the next two years in Walker’s budget plan. The bigger picture Although inflation-adjusted state aid is the best measure, we decided to examine another calculation. In Wisconsin, state aid doesn’t tell the full story in terms of how much money is going to schools. What’s known as the ""revenue cap"" imposes a limit on funding by local school districts. That means that without a referendum to exceed the limit, if state aid to schools goes up, local property taxes would go down, leaving a district with the same amount of funding. At the same time, the state can give schools additional money outside the revenue cap. ""The revenue limit did not go up the last two years,"" said Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance. ""However, what they’ve done is for the past about six years they’ve been giving the schools money outside the revenue limit."" That brings us to ""per-pupil"" funding. Knapp took the inflation-adjusted total of state aid and property taxes allocated to schools and divided that by full-time equivalent enrollment for fiscal years 1997 through 2017. If you slice the numbers that way, fiscal year 2011 is the highest at $13,112 per student. That compares to $12,329 in the current fiscal year. The challenge with calculating per-pupil aid is knowing enrollment numbers, which are difficult to predict for 2018 and 2019. Knapp said even this number comes with another important caveat. ""Generally, per student funding has risen over the years, even after accounting for inflation,"" he said. ""That it peaked in 2011 is also not a surprise as funding was cut in 2012. However, Act 10 saved districts enough to cover those cuts. Thus, you have to be careful about how you think about that. ""Essentially, school costs were reset at a lower level in that year, and they have generally been rising since."" Our rating Walker said in his budget address -- and in the weeks and months since -- that Wisconsin is investing more in education than ever in the history of the state. This is true in raw dollars but the statement doesn’t account for inflation-adjusted numbers, which is the best way to look at figures over time. When adjusted for inflation, fiscal year 2003 would be the highest ever. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/may/17/scott-walker/testing-scott-walker-claim-record-education-findin/

Does the president have 'the ability to declassify anything at any time'?
","The blockbuster article in The Washington Post saying President Donald Trump had ""revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting"" didn’t just put the White House on the defensive. It also put Republican lawmakers in a tight spot. One of the members of Congress who commented after the newspaper’s revelations was Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho. According to CNN, he told reporters, ""The minute the president speaks about it to someone, he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process."" Is that accurate? Independent experts said Risch is on target concerning the legal powers of the president. Some experts added, however, that the senator’s formulation left out some context that is relevant for assessing Trump’s alleged actions. Experts agreed that the president, as commander in chief, is ultimately responsible for classification and declassification. When people lower in the chain of command handle classification and declassification duties — which is usually how it’s done — it’s because they have been delegated to do so by the president directly, or by an appointee chosen by the president. The majority ruling in the 1988 Supreme Court case Department of Navy vs. Egan — which addressed the legal recourse of a Navy employee who had been denied a security clearance — addresses this line of authority. ""The President, after all, is the ‘Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States’"" according to Article II of the Constitution, the court’s majority wrote. ""His authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security ... flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President, and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant."" Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, said that such authority gives the president the authority to ""classify and declassify at will."" In fact, Robert F. Turner, associate director of the University of Virginia's Center for National Security Law, said that ""if Congress were to enact a statute seeking to limit the president’s authority to classify or declassify national security information, or to prohibit him from sharing certain kinds of information with Russia, it would raise serious separation of powers constitutional issues."" The official documents governing classification and declassification stem from executive orders. But even these executive orders aren’t necessarily binding on the president. The president is not ""obliged to follow any procedures other than those that he himself has prescribed,"" Aftergood said. ""And he can change those."" Indeed, the controlling executive order has been rewritten by multiple presidents. The current version of the order was issued by President Barack Obama in 2009. The national-security experts at the blog Lawfare wrote in the wake of the Post’s revelation that the ""infamous comment"" by President Richard Nixon — that ""when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal"" — ""is actually true about some things. Classified information is one of them. The nature of the system is that the president gets to disclose what he wants."" So Risch’s comment holds water when it comes to the extent of the president’s powers. But some experts said that Risch’s formulation leaves out some notable aspects of the particular case involving Trump. The first caveat: While Trump has the power to declassify information, he doesn’t appear to have done that in this case, at least at the time the story broke. ""There’s no question that the president has broad authority to declassify almost anything at any time without any process, but that’s not what happened here,"" said Stephen I. Vladeck, professor at the University of Texas School of Law. ""He did not, in fact, declassify the information he shared with the Russians, which is why The Washington Post did not publish that information."" Instead, Vladeck said, Trump ""took it upon himself to authorize officials from a foreign government to receive classified national security information that was itself derived from a different foreign government’s intelligence gathering. That’s just not the same thing as what Sen. Risch described, and the law on this topic is far murkier."" Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center, agreed that Risch’s point speaks to general presidential authority but not what happened in this particular case. ""Trump surely would not concede that the information in question is now ‘unclassified’ and available to anyone who files a (Freedom of Information Act) request,"" she said. ""The relevant question, therefore, is not whether the president can spontaneously declassify information, but whether the president is permitted to disclose sensitive national security information to anyone he wishes."" Turner noted, however, that this isn’t necessarily a big distinction, since the president is ultimately the decider of what is classified and not. If his appointees disagree with his actions, ""he can overrule their decisions,"" Turner said. ""Within the Executive Branch the president is the boss."" The second caveat: Just because something is legal doesn’t mean that it’s a smart idea. ""The important caveat is that ‘legal’ and ‘sensible’ may be different things,"" said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org. ""It may be legal, but it may fail to avoid the appearance of impropriety."" Setting aside ethics, doing what Trump is alleged to have done could have negative practical consequences for the United States. ""It could wreck the underlying intelligence-sharing agreement and place the U.S. at a disadvantage,"" Aftergood said. That said, the line between wise and unwise is a judgment call. On the one hand, Turner agreed that alienating an ally by not following their orders ""could have very serious consequences."" On the other hand, he said, it’s not outlandish to argue that sharing closely held information with Russia could advance, rather than hurt, national interests. Turner said it may be ""in America’s interest to cooperate with Russia in the struggle against ISIS, including sharing intelligence information that may help save Russian lives and seeking information that may save American lives and those of other potential victims of ISIS attacks. Obviously, in the process we will want to safeguard sources and methods that might weaken our ability to keep track of what President Putin is up to--as he is potentially a greater threat to our security than is ISIS.  But the struggle against ISIS is an area where the United States and Russia have a shared interest."" In a statement to PolitiFact, Risch’s office said that criticism of the wisdom of Trump's action would be a personal opinion, but such sentiments would not speak to ""the letter of the law."" ""Sen. Risch can tell you that all former presidents of the United States spoke regularly with heads of states and discussed classified matter, if they determined it to be in the best interest of the American people,"" the statement said. Risch said, ""The minute the president speaks about it to someone, he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process."" We found broad agreement that a president, using powers granted by the Constitution, is able to declassify essentially anything. However, experts added that Risch’s comment was not entirely on point for the particular situation involving Trump. In this case, it appears Trump didn’t actually use his declassification power before talking to the Russian officials, and just because Trump’s actions were legal doesn’t necessarily mean they were wise. These caveats add nuance to analyses of what Trump did. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/may/16/james-risch/does-president-have-ability-declassify-anything-an/

Mostly True: Trump uses Russia's 'law firm of the year' to counter claim he's too close to Russia
","President Donald Trump made public a letter from his tax attorneys on May 12 saying Trump’s tax returns from the past decade contain no undisclosed income from Russian sources. That same day, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., found what was a too-good-to-pass-up irony about the firm Trump used to write the letter. ""Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal,"" Murphy said in a May 12 tweet. The post was certainly popular -- it has been retweeted 56,000 times as of the writing of this fact-check. It also elicited an eye-rolling .GIF from Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn. Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal. Given the continued interest in possible links between Trump and Russia, we decided to look into Murphy’s statement. Trump’s tax lawyers are partners in the Washington, D.C., office of Morgan Lewis, which employs some 2,000 attorneys in 30 cities around the world, including 40 lawyers and staff in Moscow. In the May 12 letter, Trump’s attorneys generally downplayed the president’s ties to Russia, and said Trump’s tax returns from the past decade contain no undisclosed income from Russian sources. Murphy is correct that Morgan Lewis was once named the ""Russia Law Firm of the Year."" This award was bestowed in 2016 by Chambers & Partners, a reputable source of law firm rankings, which cited the firm’s work in Russia’s energy, finance and technology sectors. Murphy’s spokesman, Chris Harris, also pointed us to an item on Morgan Lewis’ website trumpeting the accolade, calling it a ""prestigious honor"" that recognizes its Russia office’s excellence in client service, strategic growth and other achievements. Elsewhere on Morgan Lewis’ website the firm boasts about its Moscow office, saying ""Our lawyers are well known in the Russian market, and have deep familiarity with the local legislation, practices, and key players."" So Murphy is basically right on the facts: (1) Trump did use a letter from his Morgan Lewis tax attorneys to downplay Russia ties, (2) Morgan Lewis was named ""Russia Law Firm of the Year,"" and (3) the firm has extensive Russia ties. That said, it would be wrong to conclude that by hiring Morgan Lewis, Trump shares the firm’s extensive Russia ties. That’s unproven.   A Morgan Lewis spokesman told ABC News none of the firm’s attorneys have handled any business dealings for Trump in Russia. The spokesman added that Trump’s tax attorney, Sheri Dillon, has never been to Russia and does no work there. The reality is, beyond a laugh line, there’s not much people should read into Murphy’s statement. By the same logic, for instance, Trump’s tough talk toward Germany would potentially be undermined by the fact his tax attorneys work in a firm that operates an office in Frankfurt. And unless Murphy were willing to credit Trump for Morgan Lewis’ progressive telecommuting policy to help working parents, his position would lack coherence. Murphy said, ""Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal."" While any suggestion Trump shares the law firm's extensive ties is unproven, Murphy has the basic facts correct. The tax attorneys Trump has used to minimize his Russia ties are partners at Morgan Lewis, the 2016 ""Russia Law Firm of the Year,"" which boasts significant work in Russia. The firm, however, says that Trump’s lawyer has done no work in Russia. We rate Murphy’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/may/16/chris-murphy/donald-trump-chris-murphy-russian-law-firm-year/

Liberal troll behind Tucker Carlson death hoax being spread online
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson was the latest conservative media icon targeted by a death hoax after Internet stories surfaced that said he had been killed in a car crash that was no accident. ""Fox star Tucker Carlson in critical condition after head on collision driving home,"" read the headline on a May 13, 2017, post on DailyUsaUpdate.com, a known fake news site. Other suspect sites also ran the story. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on bogus news in users’ feeds. The fake story said that Carlson was driving home from Tucker Carlson Tonight in New York when he ""was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident."" The post claimed Carlson was taken to a hospital for surgery, while the driver of a Ford Explorer with a reinforced bumper and extra foam padding on the steering wheel fled the scene after hitting the news anchor. That article was followed the next day by another on DailyUsaUpdate.com that said Carlson had died from his injuries, and that police had ruled the death a homicide. The story strongly suggested the crash was deliberate, and had something to do with either the Clinton Foundation, former FBI director James Comey’s firing, or both. This follow-up, too, ended up on other websites. First of all, we know the story is fake, because Carlson is alive. A Fox News Channel spokeswoman confirmed to us that the articles are a hoax. She also noted that Carlson is based in Washington, not New York. The post is yet another fake news story created by the parody purveyor TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked.

The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately worked to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. The original fake post that Carlson had been in a crash appeared on the site on May 13, and its follow-up was published May 14. Then TheLastLineOfDefense.org published another story on May 14 that said the death rumors were actually a hoax perpetrated by someone who goes by the name Busta Troll. He had been paid more than $100,000 by billionaire George Soros to make up the story, the post said. While the update is written to make it sound as if TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled into thinking Carlson had died because of Busta Troll, the real story is that Wilekenmeyer (or whatever his true name may be) actually is Busta Troll. The troll character is part of a years-long saga involving the author ""goating"" conservative web pages and using pseudonyms to spread contrived stories aimed at fooling conservative readers. A complex scheme to expose the identity of Busta Troll in 2014 turned out to be yet another trolling scenario.

GOP health care bill 'yanks tax credits away from veterans,' Sen. Blumenthal says
","Among Democrats’ many gripes with the House Republican health care bill is the fact that it’s missing a special protection for veterans. ""What does Trumpcare do? Yank tax credits away from veterans unlike any other American,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., at a May 9 press conference. Does the health care bill supported by President Donald Trump actually strip veterans of a tax protection? This issue is more complex and less far-reaching than Blumenthal’s exaggerated one-liner suggests. It is possible that if the Republican bill were to become law in its current form, a subset of veterans might not be able to access financial assistance that would enable them to choose private insurance over health care through the Veterans Administration. But the language of the bill actually treats veterans like ""any other American,"" as opposed to what Blumenthal said. And there are regulations the Trump administration could pursue to blunt any impact (by taking a page out of the the previous administration’s playbook, we’d add). Both the Affordable Care Act and the Republican health care bill (the American Health Care Act) provide government financial assistance to low-income Americans buying health insurance plans on the individual market through tax credits that subsidize premiums. To qualify for the tax credits under either system, a person cannot also be eligible for other affordable health insurance options, like employer-provided insurance, Medicaid or military-related health care. Point being, if you have access to Medicaid or can get insurance from your company, the government won’t pay for you to get insurance a different way. But there is an exemption to that rule under the Democratic-supported Affordable Care Act. Veterans who qualify for Veterans Administration health care (not all do) but aren’t enrolled in the system are eligible for subsidized premiums — allowing these veterans to choose between VA health care or subsidized private insurance. The Republican bill doesn’t include language that would have the same effect. This means that if the Republican bill were to become law in its current form, some veterans might not be able to access the tax credit. That means they’d either have to get their health care through the VA or pay full freight for a different type of insurance. This could have a tangible impact on veterans who choose not to take part in VA health care for reasons outside their control, such as living far away from VA facilities. Blumenthal said the Republican bill in its current form could affect as many as 8 million veterans, which is the approximate number of veterans as of June 2014 who qualify for VA benefits but choose not to enroll in the program, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But not all 8 million are in the market for a tax credit to help them buy private insurance. Many get health care through other means, such as Medicaid, their employer, or TRICARE, the military health benefits program. And as we already explained, that means they could not get federal subsidies to purchase a plan on the individual market under either Obamacare or its possible replacement. A report by the Urban Institute, a social and economic policy think tank, found that subsidized premiums under the Affordable Care Act played a big role in the 40 percent drop in uninsured veterans between 2013-15. But the Urban Institute’s numbers suggest that the omission from the Republican health care bill would affect far fewer than 8 million veterans. In 2010, the year Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, there were 520,000 uninsured veterans eligible for subsidized premiums, according to a 2012 report. By 2015, that number dropped to 225,000. And it’s still a subset of these groups who would be impacted by the Republican bill — those who qualify for subsidies and VA benefits. For scale, there are 21.6 million living veterans as of 2014. Interestingly, an earlier version of the Republican health care bill did include the relevant language, but it was removed from the final version that passed the House — a point that Blumenthal’s staff emphasized to us. Including non-budgetary language, such as this veterans provision, could derail Republicans’ plan to get the bill through the Senate using a special procedure called reconciliation. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., has defended the omission, saying that existing federal regulations stemming from the Affordable Care Act will be able to ensure VA-eligible veterans can qualify for the tax credit. Why? There’s another wrinkle to all of this. The Affordable Care Act veteran exemption isn’t found in the text of the Affordable Care Act itself. It’s actually a 2012 IRS rule. Contrary to Roe’s point, however, regulations applied to one law don’t automatically apply to that law’s replacement, said Lisa Zarlenga, a Washington lawyer for Steptoe and Johnson who served as the Treasury’s tax legislative counsel during Affordable Care Act implementation. If the Republican health bill becomes law, the Treasury and IRS might decide that the Affordable Care Act veterans rule carries over, but it’s not guaranteed, she said. Close readers might have noticed an irony: The Democrats are criticizing the Republican bill for a protection that wasn’t built into the Affordable Care Act to begin with. In fact, the Treasury and IRS wrote the 2012 rule to deal with the difficulty of determining a particular veteran’s VA-eligibility. The fact that this rule also gives some veterans a degree of choice they otherwise wouldn’t have was an added benefit, Zarlenga said. Blumenthal said, ""What does Trumpcare do? Yank tax credits away from veterans unlike any other American."" A reasonable person might hear Blumenthal’s statement and think that under the Republican health care bill, most or all veterans won’t get a tax credit to which they are entitled. It’s much more nuanced than that. Under the Republican plan, like the Affordable Care Act, a person cannot qualify for financial assistance to help them buy an individual health insurance policy if they have access to other affordable health care options. Regulations written in 2012 to comply with the Affordable Care Act said this rule doesn’t apply to veterans who are eligible but not enrolled in the Veterans Administration health care system. The Republican bill doesn’t contain language that would have the same effect. So if it becomes law in its current form, a subset of veterans might not be able to access financial assistance that would enable them to choose private insurance over health care through the VA. But a Republican administration could do what the Democrats did before them and include the benefit as part of a regulatory change. Blumenthal’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2017/may/15/richard-blumenthal/gop-health-care-bill-yanks-tax-credits-away-vetera/

Donald Trump mentions tax deductions 'for birds flying across America,' and he should know
","There were a number of head-scratching exchanges in President Donald Trump’s interview with The Economist posted on May 11, including Trump’s claim -- easily debunked -- that he had coined the phrase ""prime the pump."" But one line that raised our eyebrows was about tax deductions for birds. ""I get more deductions,"" Trump said. ""I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions. They have deductions for birds flying across America. They have deductions for everything."" At first, we were mystified at what Trump was talking about. But as it turns out, he’s on target -- and as a golf course owner, he has reason to know about this obscure part of the federal tax code. We’ll walk you through it. The tax deductions in question involve what are known as ""conservation easements."" A conservation easement for a parcel of land is an agreement by which the landowner pledges to forgo future development. This way, the land remains in its natural state and, among other things, can provide habitat for animals, including migratory birds. In typical easements, the landowner continues to own the land itself, but the right to develop it is donated to a nonprofit organization that promises not to build on it. The difference between the pre-donation value of the land and the post-donation value of the land can be deducted on the landowner’s tax returns as a gift, said Steven Barshov, a land-use and environmental-law attorney at the firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, P.C. The exact loss in land value is determined by an appraiser. For large or expensive parcels of land, the tax break can be substantial -- it can eliminate up to half of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (or all of it, if they are a farmer or a rancher). And if the amount of the gift is greater than one year’s adjusted gross income, the balance can be carried over through up to 15 future tax years until the value of the donation is exhausted. Compared to popular tax deductions like those for the interest on home mortgages, deductions for conservation easements are relatively small. Still, they add up: Bloomberg reported that in 2010, almost 3,000 taxpayers used conservation easements to deduct $766 million from their tax returns, according to IRS data. As recently as 2007, that amount was as high as $2.2 billion. Where they have come in for criticism is for disproportionately benefiting the ultra-rich. Indeed, for a time, the administration of President Barack Obama tried to get rid of the tax break. ""They’re overwhelmingly for high-end individuals and provide little to no benefit to the public,"" Dean Zerbe, who examined easement donations as a Republican aide on the Senate Finance Committee, told Bloomberg. ""I don’t know if I could design a tax break that’s more targeted toward the millionaire set."" This may explain why this particular tax deduction popped into Trump’s head during the Economist interview. Forbes noted that when Trump gave the Associated Press a 94-page list of $102 million in charitable donations he had made since 2010, one of the entries was $63.825 million for ""various conservation easements."" The White House did not respond to a request for information about easements, but according to Forbes, Trump has donated easements for land on the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Beyond the golf-course easements, Trump has also donated easements for his personal estate in Westchester County, N.Y., as well as his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Forbes reported. Easements for golf courses have been particularly controversial, but they have been upheld in the courts, albeit with some restrictions. In one case, the U.S. Tax Court denied a deduction for an easement because the golf course used chemicals that rendered the land unsuitable for wildlife habitat. But in a 2009 case, the Kiva Dunes golf course in Alabama won its case to claim the deduction after demonstrating that it was used by 46 species of neotropical birds that migrate across the Gulf of Mexico. The court’s only quibble was the valuation; the donation’s value was reduced from $30.6 million to $28.7 million. ""Protection of significant wildlife habitat is a conservation purpose qualifying a conservation easement for a charitable deduction,"" David Wooldridge, the Alabama attorney who represented the golf course, told PolitiFact. There’s at least one other provision of the tax code where migratory bird habitat could qualify a landowner for tax deductions. ""In general, farm landowners and tenants can deduct expenses related to soil or water conservation, farmland erosion prevention, or endangered species recovery from their federal taxes, where otherwise these would be considered capital expenses,"" according to a guide for land conservation published by Texas A&M University. To qualify for this deduction requires a nearby endangered species and a conservation plan approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. For the record, neither tax benefit applies only or specifically to birds.   Our ruling Trump said the federal tax code includes ""deductions for birds flying across America."" He’s right -- conservation easements to protect wildlife, including but not limited to migratory birds, can be used as tax deductions.  And Trump should know -- by all indications, he’s saved millions in tax payments on the backs of these little creatures.

Florida House speaker touts record education spending, but there's more to grade
","Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran defended a controversial education bill by saying the Legislature had never spent more on the state’s children. Both educators and lawmakers have criticized the Legislature for approving only a meager increase for K-12 spending in the 2017 legislative session. But as this year’s overtime session wound down, Corcoran touted the overall level of spending the Legislature approved for schools in a May 6, 2017, tweet: Don't believe the hype. The @MyFLHouse sets record spending levels. And $$ goes straight to students, teachers, and principals. #HB7069 pic.twitter.com/rRoxBAAZER That $24 billion is for all education spending that isn’t for colleges and universities, but also includes $419 million in HB 7069. That 278-page bill was negotiated behind closed doors in Tallahassee near the end of this year’s budgeting process. It covers everything from virtual learning to testing reforms to teacher bonuses. One of the most contested components is $140 million for the ""schools of hope"" program, largely to attract privately managed charter schools to compete with near-failing schools in poor neighborhoods. Given the heated debate on school funding, we wondered whether the 2017-18 state budget really contained ""the greatest investment in education in Florida history,"" or if there’s more to the balance sheet we should consider. A marginal increase in base funding As a quick overview, the most common measure of education spending is the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP), the main source of dollars for K-12 education. When most people discuss K-12 school funding, this is what they are talking about. By law, it’s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the ""required local effort,"" in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars. For 2017-18, the Legislature increased the base education budget, or FEFP, from about $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion. In the current school year, spending is about $7,196 per pupil. The 2017-18 budget raises that to about $7,221 per student, a 0.34 percent increase. The small change has drawn jeers from educators and parents, and is $200 less than the $7,421 amount Gov. Rick Scott requested in his proposed budget. Corcoran is talking about more than the FEFP to reach his total. Getting to $24 billion His $24 billion figure includes several allocations for multiple programs outside the FEFP, and technically is the total for voluntary pre-kindergarten, as well as other programs including mentoring services and grants. We requested analyses from both the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle, and they came up with roughly the same figures: The entire education budget for the next fiscal year — including the FEFP, grants, special programs and more — is about $14.7 billion in state funds (including $3.2 billion from state trust funds), plus another $9 billion from the required local effort. That’s a total of $23.7 billion, give or take a few estimated millions. When you add HB 7069’s $419 million to that, you get about $24 billion. Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said that $24 billion outstripped all education funding from prior years, topping the current fiscal year’s $23.4 billion. He sent us a list of 10 years’ worth of spending, but would not specify what programs his office was counting when they compiled the figures. But that’s okay, because we don’t need to look at every program. Even with its tiny increase for next year, the FEFP is slated to be the highest it’s ever been. It’s been on the rise the last few years, after Scott cut education spending when he took office after the 2008 recession. Fiscal year Total K-12 budget Per-pupil spending K-12 enrollment 2007-08 $18.7 billion $7,126 2.63 million 2008-09 $17.9 billion $6,846 2.62 million 2009-10* $18 billion $6,846 2.63 million 2010-11* $18.2 billion $6,897 2.64 million 2011-12 $16.6 billion $6,217 2.67 million 2012-13 $17.2 billion $6,376 2.70 million 2013-14 $18.3 billion $6,769 2.705 million 2014-15 $18.9 billion $6,915 2.74 million 2015-16 $19.7 billion $7,105 2.77 million 2016-17 $20.2 billion $7,196 2.8 million 2017-18 $20.4 billion $7,221 2.83 million Now for the caveats. First of all, one would expect the FEFP to go up a bit each year, because generally the total number of students in Florida schools continues to increase. For 2017-18, the state projects an increase of about 300,000 students. That means despite a small funding increase, many school districts will actually see total allocations drop. Furthermore, Florida’s per-pupil spending lags far behind the national average of about $10,700 (a total that has been dropping in recent years). And even then, the per-pupil amount is less than $100 more than what it was a decade ago, and certainly has not kept up with inflation. Per-pupil spending would have to be roughly $8,358 next fiscal year to simply equal the 2007-08 level, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We also must note that unlike FEFP money, HB 7069’s cash is going to very targeted programs, like scholarships for disabled youth (initiated by former Senate President Andy Gardiner), Best and Brightest scholarships for teachers, and incentives for charter schools. That money also isn’t guaranteed, because Scott has to sign it first. School officials across the state, from Miami-Dade to Polk County and beyond, have called for Scott to veto the bill because they say it doesn’t adequately address their needs. Our ruling Corcoran tweeted that at $24 billion, the House has made ""the greatest investment in education in Florida history!"" In sheer dollars, that appears to be the case in large part because the Legislature agreed to an incremental bump in funding. Even if Scott doesn’t sign HB 7069, which targets very specific programs, the main state-local funding source alone is still at the highest total it’s ever been. But it's not a runaway difference. Compared with the current year, the per-pupil increase is less than one-half of 1 percent. The increases that do exist won't affect every school district equally, and some counties likely will see less money because of how the state allocates school funds. Corcoran is also including spending that hasn't yet been approved by the governor. The claim loses even more luster when taking into account that Florida's education spending, already lower than the national average, hasn’t kept up with inflation for years. The next fiscal year is no different. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2017/may/15/richard-corcoran/corcoran-touts-level-education-spending-there/
"['Abortion', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Women', 'Wisconsin', 'Glenn Grothman']","
Glenn Grothman says Planned Parenthood is leading abortion provider
","On April 30, 2017, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) provoked an outcry at a town hall meeting in Neenah when pressed to explain his support for defunding the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. A woman doing the questioning warned Grothman that he shouldn’t use Planned Parenthood’s abortion services as an excuse to pull funding, because the agency is already prohibited from using federal funds to support abortion procedures. Grothman’s quick response: ""Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country."" He added that the group is an outspoken advocate for what he termed ""controversial"" services. To be sure, Planned Parenthood does more than abortions. Services include screening for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control, sex education and general health care. Indeed, in a one-year period from  2014 to 2015, 87 percent of patients visited Planned Parenthood clinics for services other than abortion, PolitiFact Wisconsin found in February 2017. Grothman’s statement about the ""biggest abortion provider"" was one we’ve seen in various forms from House Speaker Paul Ryan, Cardinal Seán Patrick O’Malley of Boston and National Public Radio. Does it hold up? Running the numbers There’s no complete, centralized database that tallies abortions, much less breaks that number down by providers. But there is strong indirect evidence backing Grothman’s claim. Planned Parenthood self-reports that 323,999 abortions were performed at its facilities nationwide for the year ending September 30, 2015. That represents 35 percent of the 926,200 U.S. abortions estimated for calendar year 2014, the latest year studied by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization whose survey-based data on abortions is widely quoted by both sides in the abortion debate. Grothman maintains 49 percent of abortions are performed by Planned Parenthood. That’s because he uses the smaller base of 664,000 abortions -- the figure reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number is based on voluntary reporting. Here’s what we heard from two groups deeply involved in the abortion issue: -- Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion care in the United States, according to the Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion providers. It’s worth noting that local providers unaffiliated with a national organization -- including freestanding clinics and private practice hospitals -- collectively do the majority of the procedures. -- The 35 percent ""easily"" makes Planned Parenthood ""the nation's largest abortion chain,"" and there’s no evidence any other provider is close, according to the National Right to Life Committee. More about Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood’s abortion services grew rapidly between 2000 and 2015, rising by 127,000 procedures at a time when the total number of abortions nationwide was falling significantly. The agency operates some 660 centers across the country. About half offer abortions, according to  agency spokeswoman Beth Lynk. Its facilities see patients from all 50 states, though one state, North Dakota, has no Planned Parenthood health center. The Moorhead, Minn., health center is two blocks from the state border and serves predominately North Dakota patients. A Planned Parenthood spokesperson said the agency doesn’t track the numbers on other providers and wouldn’t venture an opinion on Grothman’s claim. But Jennifer Thibodeau, a spokesperson for the Abortion Care Network summed up the general feeling among informed observers this way: ""There is no other national organization that operate on the scale they do."" Our rating Grothman told constituents that ""Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country."" The agency’s national network of clinics stands apart from other providers as the undisputed leader when it comes to providing abortion services. This is one of those truisms that is basically, well, True. (Editor's note, June 7, 2017: An earlier version of this item quoted Grothman as saying that Planned Parenthood is an outspoken advocate for ""controversial"" services such as birth control. A spokesperson for his office said on June 7, 2017 that the video, in which Grothman's voice is hard to hear at times, may have led people to that conclusion, but that Grothman does not believe birth control is a controversial service. The birth control quote had no bearing on the congressman’s statement about Planned Parenthood and its role in abortions, so the rating of True is unchanged.)",/factchecks/2017/may/15/glenn-grothman/glenn-grothman-says-planned-parenthood-leading-abo/
"['Education', 'Missouri', 'Nate Walker']","
Missouri charter schools aren't 'failing'
","Since the confirmation hearing for U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, charter schools have been under increased scrutiny. In Missouri, charter schools have only been built in Kansas City and St. Louis, but a bill now before the legislature may make it easier for the schools to pop up in other towns. On March 17, the Missouri House of Representatives narrowly passed and sent House Bill 634 to the Senate to allow for the expansion of charter schools. One legislator who didn’t vote in favor for House Bill 634 was Rep. Nate Walker. The Republican from Kirksville told MissouriNet that Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, tried to persuade him to change his mind, but Walker wouldn’t budge. One reason, Walker said, was because ""(charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in greater capacity than public school systems."" But are they? Walker didn’t provide a definition for what he meant by failing, and the Missouri education department doesn’t have a specific definition, either. However, after looking at the education department's performance reviews, the data shows that charter schools are performing about the same as nearby public schools. Definitions of failing When PolitiFact called Walker and asked him where he got his data, he said he got it from a ""lot of different things,"" and began providing some numbers. ""Sixty-four percent of Missouri Charter Schools have failed or are failing,"" he said, without citing the source of these statistics. ""Since 1999, we’ve had 59 charter schools open in the state. Thirty-eight of the 59 charter schools have failed or are failing students."" However, according to the data from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, for the 2016-17 year there were 72 individual charter schools within 39 charter school districts. And since 1999, the year after charter school law was enacted, there have been 63 charter school districts, and 21 — or 33 percent — have closed. When we asked Walker in a phone interview what his definition was for ""failing,"" this was his response: ""Well, they’re not meeting the standards of the (education department). You go check the facts, I’m not a reporter. You’ve got a degree in journalism and understand factual information, but I stand by my comments, and all you need to do is go do your research and find I’m absolutely right. Probably more than right."" We went to the education department to learn more. Sarah Potter, the communications coordinator for the department, wrote in an email, ""There are no parameters in state statute for a ‘failing’ charter school."" However, the department does issue an Annual Performance Review score for both charter and traditional public schools to determine how well they’re educating the students. Charter schools are independent public schools freed from certain regulations. They are also subject to other rules defined by their contracts with their sponsors, such as universities, who then hold charter schools accountable for their results instead of the state. This performance review takes into account standardized test scores, attendance rates and graduation rates along with financial status and leadership stability. There are four levels of accreditation. ""Accredited with Distinction"" and ""Accredited"" signify that the school or district is meeting performance standards. Schools or districts must earn a 70 percent or higher on their performance review to earn those classifications. ""Provisionally Accredited"" and ""Unaccredited"" indicate that the school or district isn’t meeting performance standards and earned a performance review score below 70 percent and below 50 percent, respectively. In fact, in our phone interview with Walker, he did mention accreditation, saying: ""Of the 38 charter schools (districts) currently open for business, 11 have been deemed Provisionally Accredited, six would have been deemed Unaccredited and four were too new to receive a score. Right now 46 percent of the active charter schools would be classified as Accredited."" These numbers are correct — though there were 39 districts and not 38 as Walker said — according to the latest data available at the state education department’s website. For comparison, 99 percent of traditional public school districts earned Accredited or above while only 46 percent of charter school districts earned that status. It’s not looking so good for Missouri charter schools. Charter schools vs. traditional public schools Not so fast, said Doug Thaman, the executive director of the Missouri Charter Public School Association. ""One of the concerns we have is that when statements are made like (the one) Walker made, that’s a comparison of charter schools to an entire school district, and that is just not a true comparison,"" he said. ""You can’t compare a single school to an entire district or to the entire state."" What Thaman means is that performance scores are assigned to both individual schools and the districts in which several schools reside, and the scores are often different. He also pointed out that charter schools, which have to accept any student who applies, often educate lower-performing students whose needs haven't been met by traditional public schools, so charter schools score poorly on the performance review because they're helping students who score below grade level catch up.     Thaman suggested it would be better to compare the performance score of individual charter schools to individual competitor public schools within the same district. So we did.  In Kansas City, the charter schools reside inside public school district Kansas City 33, which had an overall performance score of 70 percent, which is also the lowest score to earn an Accredited or above rating. Both the Kansas City charter schools and traditional public schools in the district had 32 sites that were assigned a performance score in the 2015-16 school year, But more individual charter schools — 21— were performing at or above district’s rate of 70 percent than individual public schools — 12. And even when you compare charter school districts’ performance scores to Kansas City 33’s performance score, over 60 percent of the charter school districts meets or exceeds the district's score. So overall, it appears that most charter schools in Kansas City are doing just fine when compared to Kansas City 33 district and its schools.  Now let’s take a look at St. Louis. This one is a little harder to compare because the public school district the charter schools are located within — the St. Louis City district — has 71 sites with performance scores, compared to only 22 charter school sites. St. Louis City district has an overall performance score of 74.6 percent. Just as with Kansas City, it appears that individual St. Louis charter schools are performing about the same as their public school counterparts. Fifty percent of charter schools and 48 percent of public schools earned an Accredited rating, or a 70 percent performance score. However, when comparing districts’ scores, the scales tip toward the public schools. St. Louis City district has an overall score of 74.6 percent. Nine charter school districts, or 56 percent, score below that. However, 57 percent of the traditional public schools fall below their districts’ performance rate. Our ruling Rep. Walker said, ""(Charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in a greater capacity than the public school systems."" Neither Walker nor the education department gave a definition for a failing charter school. And although charter school districts performance scores are nowhere near the 99 percent of public school districts that are Accredited, current charter schools are performing on par with with the public schools in their city. Walker’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Donald Trump’s Mostly False claim that James Clapper said no collusion found in Russia probe
","President Donald Trump claimed that former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has definitively said the Trump campaign did not collude in Moscow’s interference with the 2016 election. Trump used his take on Clapper’s remarks as proof positive the FBI’s ongoing Russia probe is a witch hunt. ""When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?"" Trump said in a May 12 tweet. Clapper’s comments have not been as definitive as Trump said. Later that day, Clapper directly contradicted Trump’s claim in a TV interview. Here’s why Trump’s take is misleading. Trump mischaracterizes Clapper’s statement Trump appears to be referring to Clapper’s statement in a Meet The Press interview March 5 that he had no knowledge of improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Two months earlier, Clapper’s office released a report that expressed with ""high confidence"" that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump. As Clapper stated in his interview, however, the report did not include evidence of collusion. Chuck Todd of NBC asked him about that. Todd: ""Does intelligence exist that can definitively answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?"" Clapper: ""We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, ‘our,’ that's NSA, FBI and CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report."" Todd: ""I understand that. But does it exist?"" Clapper: ""Not to my knowledge."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., quoted Clapper’s exchange on Meet The Press in a May 8 Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and asked if it was still accurate. Clapper responded, ""It is."" That prompted Trump to issue the following tweet: Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. In his May 12 tweet, Trump referenced the judgment of ""virtually everyone else"" with knowledge. But some officials with knowledge of the FBI’s Russia probe have publicly declined to say there’s no evidence of collusion, citing ongoing investigations. During a March 20 hearing on Russian interference in 2016 election, recently ousted FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers refused to comment when asked specifically about whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Moscow. But when asked in general terms about whether or not any evidence exists, Comey explained that a case of this nature would have to reach a certain evidentiary threshold, and be considered high priority, before the bureau launched an investigation. Comey described the standard as, ""a credible allegation of wrongdoing or reasonable basis to believe that an American may be acting as an agent of a foreign power."" He added the central focus of the investigation would also have to align with ""threats that the FBI is trying to prioritize (under) limited resources."" Clapper: 'I don’t know if there was collusion or not' Asked about Trump’s tweet in a May 12 interview on MSNBC, Clapper explained that the director of national intelligence position would not necessarily offer a vantage point into FBI evidence. Clapper said that in his more than six years as DNI, he regularly deferred to the FBI when a counterintelligence investigation could possibly morph into a criminal investigation. ""That was certainly the practice I followed here,"" he said of the FBI’s ongoing Russia investigation. ""So it’s not surprising or abnormal that I would not have known about the investigation, or even more importantly, the content of that investigation. ""So I don’t know if there was collusion or not,"" added Clapper, who resigned at the end of President Barack Obama’s term. Later in the interview, Clapper was asked if he agrees with Trump that the Russian investigation is a ""witch hunt,"" to which he replied, ""I don’t believe it is."" Instead, Clapper compared it to a ""dark cloud"" that would continue to linger until the investigation is complete. ""What needs to happen here is to clear this cloud that’s hanging over the administration, over the president, the White House,"" he said. ""It would be in everyone’s best interest to get to the bottom of this."" Our ruling Trump said, ""When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?"" Some of the public statements by those with knowledge of the FBI investigation do not support Trump’s claim that ""virtually everyone"" privy to the probe says there’s no evidence of collusion. While Comey has not described specific evidence, he has confirmed that sufficient credible information exists for the FBI to consider the Russia probe a high enough priority to warrant an investigation. As for Clapper’s statement, it’s apparent Trump has twisted the former DNI’s words to make it appear as if he’s ruled out the possibility that evidence exists showing the Trump campaign colluded with Russian interlopers during the 2016 election. But Clapper’s statement was that he had no knowledge of collusion -- not that collusion didn’t occur. Clapper has since stated that his capacity as DNI would not necessarily give him the kind of access to the FBI investigation that one would need in order to determine whether or not evidence of collusion exists.

Scott Walker says Trek makes 99% of its bicycles overseas
","With his popularity among conservatives still high, and a poll showing his support dropping among independents, Gov. Scott Walker is working to dampen liberals’ enthusiasm for his main Democratic rival in the November 2014  election. Here’s part of his second campaign TV ad  hitting Mary Burke’s former employer, Wisconsin’s Trek Bicycles, for building products overseas: ""Mary Burke is trying to sell us on her experience at her family business, but she forgot to mention they make 99% of their bikes overseas, in places like China, where her company has outsourced jobs for years,"" a narrator says. The spot adds that ""Burke’s company  makes almost all their bikes overseas."" In her campaign, Burke has highlighted her former role as a manager at Trek, the company founded in 1976 by her father, Richard, in Waterloo. She has said that Trek, as a company trying to compete globally, does what it can to manufacture bikes in the United States and makes more bikes in America than any other manufacturer. The latest Walker ad cites an OnMilwaukee.com piece from Jan. 9, 2011, flashing what looks like a headline that reads: ""Over 99.5% Of The Bicycles That Burke’s Company Produces, Are Made Overseas."" So that’s where we’ll start. The piece, a question-and-answer feature with a Trek spokesman, does not mention either Mary Burke or a figure of more than 99.5%. It ran under the headline ""Trek Corporation Committed To Wisconsin"" and highlighted Trek’s employment of nearly 1,000 people in the state at three facilities and another 800 around the world at the time. The story does not call Trek Mary Burke’s company, as Walker’s ad characterizes it. In one of her own campaign videos, Burke calls Trek ""my family’s business"" and one she says she helped grow into a worldwide force. But Burke left Trek’s employment in 2004, and its board in  2005, though she still owns stock in the private company. So the Walker ad seemingly is off to a rough start. But that OnMilwaukee piece did contain two numbers that allow a reader get a feeling for the balance of overseas versus domestic production at Trek, at least as of 2011. In the piece, Trek official Eric Bjorling is quoted as saying that Trek makes roughly 10,000 bikes a year in Wisconsin. Later in the story, in response to a separate question, he said that Trek sells about 1.5 million bikes a year around the world. We should note that Bjorling characterized the 10,000 figure as a rough estimate, saying it’s ""almost impossible to give a number"" because production is seasonal and demand-based. Nevertheless, doing the math yields an answer of 99.33 percent built overseas. So that works in Walker’s favor. We asked Trek company spokeswoman Marina Marich to comment on the ad and the number it presents, and she responded in part, ""As a privately held company, Trek doesn’t disclose specific production data."" A Burke campaign spokesman simply referred us to Trek. Industry observers say that broadly speaking, the 99 percent figure makes sense. ""The bottom line is there is no major bicycle production in the U.S.,"" said Marc Sani, writer and former publisher of Bicycle Retailer & Industry News. ""It left when Schwinn went to China in the 1980s. That was the beginning of the end."" Trek and other U.S.-based bicycle companies have little or no choice but to build product in cheaper venues overseas in order to compete globally, Sani said. Trek has two manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin -- one in Waterloo and one in Whitewater. Overseas, it builds in Germany, Holland and China. In 2011, CEO John Burke said Trek’s sales were more than $800 million. Trek contends, without providing numbers to back it up, that it manufactures more bikes the United States than any other bicycle company and is the only ""major"" bicycle company that stills manufactures product in the United States. As PolitiFact Wisconsin reported in January, Burke and Trek also have declined to document her claim that  while at Trek the European division she oversaw went from $3 million to over $50 million in sales."" Jay Townley, a bicycle industry consultant based in Wisconsin, noted that because U.S. production is so low, the numbers are volatile. But even if it was 30,000 instead of 10,000, the overseas production share would be 98 percent, which still sounds a lot like the Walker ad’s phrasing that ""almost all"" of Trek’s bikes are made outside the United States. Our rating Walkers’ ad says that Trek Bicycle ""makes 99% of their bikes overseas,"" and it puts Mary Burke at the center of responsibility by saying Trek is ""Burke’s company."" The best available numbers, from Trek’s own mouth, lend credence to the 99 percent claim, as do the best educated guesses by industry analysts. So the ad’s main thrust is correct. Calling Trek ""Burke’s company"" is somewhat problematic, though. She held a management position there and still owns stock, but she left a decade ago and seven years before the 2011 story that yielded the 99 percent figure. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-trek-makes-99-its-bicycles-overs/

Claim exaggerates tax savings
","When Brookhaven became Georgia’s newest city in December 2012, supporters promised a local government closer to residents and their needs. Last month, leaders of the city of 50,000 mailed out a flier to every property owner in the north-central DeKalb County city, touting the ""facts"" about property taxes there. Two pie charts in the flier show details such as how the city uses its tax collections. But even more specific was a chart listing the hundreds of dollars city homeowners would save on their tax bills compared with their counterparts in unincorporated DeKalb. The chart shows owners of a home worth $200,000 save $260.84 vs. the same home in the county. For a home worth $500,000, the savings are $631.28, according to the chart. Claims of similar tax savings began when Sandy Springs became Georgia’s seventh-largest city overnight in 2005. Brookhaven backers promised in meetings a new city would mean lower taxes and better services. Opponents, meanwhile, have claimed the new cities overstate revenue in their budgets and therefore need to either cull services or raise taxes. Such broad battles are out of our purview for a single fact check. But PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d take the specific tax bill for a ride on the Truth-O-Meter to get at the general idea of whether cities can mean lower tax bills. Brookhaven Mayor J. Max Davis said the city mailed the fliers to address internal division in the city, which was created with 55 percent of the vote. The city had planned to maintain its municipal rate of 2.85 mills for the second year. Several vocal residents, though, correctly argued that the city was effectively raising taxes by not adopting the rollback rate of 2.569 mills. (Adopting the rollback rate ensures governments will raise the same amount of money through taxes, regardless of property values, each year. Even maintaining the same rate can mean higher taxes if an individual’s home value increases). Davis said leaders felt the rollback rate would be premature for the young city. The Brookhaven City Council finally adopted a rate of 2.795 mills in late June. ""Our main impetus behind the flier was to educate residents that we were not raising taxes, that they still save money from being in the city,"" Davis said. Brookhaven property owners with a homestead exemption qualify for the city’s assessment freeze, which will hold the value steady on the city portion of taxes. But that doesn’t address the more complex issue of county taxes. And that picture is plenty complicated in DeKalb, one of only two counties in the state where voters have approved the homestead option sales tax, or HOST, to offset property taxes. As long as buying is up, and values don’t explode, DeKalb then has the cash from sales tax revenue to offset about half of the county millage rate, which remains 21.21 in the unincorporated county. This year, the HOST credit will reduce county taxes on a home by about 58 percent. The chart that appeared in Brookhaven’s flier came from internal working documents, which estimated the HOST credit would be about 45 percent. The higher HOST credit means much lower county taxes. That disproportionately benefits homeowners in unincorporated DeKalb, who get the credit on a bigger part of their tax bill since they do not pay city taxes. That closes the gap between the tax bill for the same-value home in the city and county. But Brookhaven’s chart is also missing the 1.67 mill tax that residents of unincorporated DeKalb pay to cover the debt of new parks and libraries. Brookhaven residents must still pay that debt, since they were part of unincorporated DeKalb when the money was borrowed. Brookhaven’s finance director, Bonnie Kline, acknowledges missing the park/library debt in her calculations. Adding that cost – which does not qualify for any HOST credit – further narrows the gap between homes in the city and county. Based on millage rates alone, a homeowner with property valued at $200,000 in Brookhaven would save $58.52, assuming both a frozen assessment and homestead exemption. The tax bill for a home worth $500,000 would be $110.93 lower. Add in the fact that Brookhaven residents pay $12 more in stormwater fees than those in unincorporated DeKalb, and the final savings is less than $50 and $100, respectively, DeKalb Deputy Tax Commissioner Robert Goodman said. ""On the face of it, to say your property tax bill will be lower in Brookhaven is correct, but not nearly by the amounts stated,"" Goodman said. Brookhaven claimed very specific savings, to the tune of hundreds of dollars, to residents on their tax bills in a recent flier. The premise of savings is accurate, but the numbers are off significantly. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/28/city-brookhaven/claim-exaggerates-tax-savings/

Graham: Russia 'has an economy the size of Italy'
","While the fighting in Ukraine stirs memories of the Cold War, there's little appetite in the United States to get into a military showdown with Russia. Where's there's bipartisan support is to get Europe to take stronger stand. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday that President Barack Obama should be getting the European Union nations into line. ""They’re dysfunctional political organization, Europe is,"" Graham said. ""And without American leadership organizing Europe and the world, you see people like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, who has an economy the size of Italy -- he’s playing a poker game with a pair of 2s and winning."" Really? Russia is the world’s second-largest producer of natural gas and the third-largest producer of oil, and it has an economy the size of Italy? Turns out they largely do. The numbers Russia and Italy are very close to each other in terms of nominal gross domestic product, which is the standard unit used to measure the size of a country’s economy. Nominal GDP is the total cost of all goods and services produced or sold in a country in within a certain time frame. Russia’s 2013 nominal GDP was $2.1 trillion, and Italy’s was $2.07 trillion, according to the World Bank. That’s not the only way to measure a country’s economy, of course, and this is where the two countries differ. Purchasing power parity takes nominal GDP a step further and shows the value of this level of economic activity if it took place in America. (The Economist explains it by showing how much a McDonald’s Big Mac costs around the world.) Russia’s GDP calculated for purchasing power parity was $3.5 trillion, while Italy’s was $2.1 trillion. So in 2013, Russia had a higher level of economic activity than Italy, but because goods and services are more expensive in Italy, the overall value (nominal GDP) ended up the same. Also, Italy has more wealth relative to the size of its population than Russia does. Italy’s 2013 GDP per capita (per person) was $34,619, and Russia’s was $14,612. But nominal GDP is the standard way to measure an economy’s size compared to other nations, and Graham got that right. Russia’s influence Though Russia may have an economy the size of Italy’s, that hardly means it's too small to throw its weight around. Russia ranks eighth among the world’s top 10 economies, based on 2013 nominal GDP: United States -- $16.8 trillion; China -- $9.2 trillion; Japan -- $4.9 trillion; Germany -- $3.6 trillion; France -- $2.7 trillion; United Kingdom -- $2.5 trillion; Brazil -- $2.2 trillion; Russia -- $2.1 trillion; Italy -- $2.1 trillion; India -- $1.9 trillion. Also of note: the European Union’s 2013 nominal GDP was $17.4 trillion. Graham compared Russia’s economy to Italy’s to show how small it is -- but Italy’s economy isn’t that small compared to the rest of the world, so neither is Russia’s. In terms of level of economic activity -- purchasing power parity -- Russia is No. 6 in the world. In fact, their spot on the list today is close to what it was in the last couple years of the Cold War (the earliest data the World Bank has on Russia’s GDP). In 1992, the year the Soviet Union officially dismantled, their nominal GDP was ranked ninth in the world (America was No. 1). The Russians were also ninth in 1991 and 1990, and they were eighth in 1989.    Russia’s economic standing among other countries has been on the rise in recent years. Only in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013 has Russia’s nominal GDP been in the top 10. One likely reason for their growth is rising oil prices, which have quadrupled since 2002. Oil and natural gas make up nearly 70 percent of Russia’s exports. (Though this isn’t to say the rest of Russia’s economy is thriving.) Although some say Russia’s overwhelming dependence on oil won’t sustain them for long, Russia has used this natural resource to gain leverage in the Ukrainian conflict -- such as cutting off a major gas supply to Ukraine. And the origins of the conflict lie in whether Ukraine should strengthen its ties with Russia or the European Union -- proving that Russia still exerts a strong influence over some countries’ economic activity. Our ruling Graham said Russia ""has an economy the size of Italy."" In terms of nominal GDP, Graham is correct. But if you run the numbers a different way and measure purchasing power parity, Russia's economy is larger than Italy's. Graham's statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/27/lindsey-graham/graham-russia-has-economy-size-italy/

Marcus: If teens use marijuana 'regularly,' they drop 8 IQ points
","About two dozen states have moved to loosen the reins on marijuana. The legal ground is shifting and a New York Times Sunday editorial tried to shake things up a bit further. For more than 40 years, federal law has banned pot and lawmakers in many states have voiced reluctance to run afoul of Washington. The paper’s editorial board said the federal government should be silent on marijuana and let states decide for themselves. Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus said she was okay with letting states experiment, but in a discussion on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 27, 2014, Marcus said she was against letting states ""go the full legalization route."" Her main concern with state’s loosening the rules had to do with teenagers. ""It is a vast social experiment,"" Marcus said. ""We do not know the outcome except that the best evidence is that you lose -- if you use marijuana as a teenager regularly -- eight IQ points."" We didn’t hear from Marcus, but we’re pretty sure she is citing a 2012 study from Duke University researchers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Duke team led by Madeline Meier studied nearly every child born in the New Zealand town of Dunedin born in the early 1970s. By the time they turned 13, these children had taken their first IQ tests. Follow-up interviews as they grew older determined if they were using marijuana, alcohol or other drugs. They took another battery of IQ tests when they turned 38. The Duke researchers screened out those who had problems with hard drugs, alcohol or schizophrenia. They controlled for the kids who dropped out of school. What they found was the ones who began smoking pot weekly before they turned 18 showed an average drop of about eight IQ points. Some lost more and some lost less but all lost at least a bit. ""Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline,"" the researchers wrote. The study didn’t say this proved that that early and long-term use caused the drop in IQ results. Researchers acknowledged that some unknown variable might be responsible. At the same time, they said it was plausible that pot could be disrupting brain development in teenagers. The report attracted a fair bit of attention. Then, about a year later, another analysis emerged, again published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This one came from Ole Rogeberg, a Norwegian economist, who said he could get the same results as Meier by factoring in socioeconomic status. In short, Rogeberg said the kids from poorer households would lose ground on IQ tests over time because they tended to end up doing work that was less mentally demanding. ""The causal effects estimated in Meier et al. are likely to be overestimates and the true effect could be zero,"" Rogeberg wrote. ""Although it would be too strong to say that the results have been discredited, the methodology is flawed and the causal inference drawn from the results premature."" Meier shot back that Rogeberg had relied on an economic model and that when her team looked at the incomes of the families, they still found a loss in intelligence that was tied to marijuana. In particular, children from middle-class households were more likely to see a drop in their IQ scores if they started smoking pot early and continued as they aged. However, there was no mention of how large the drop was or how statistically robust it was. Annette Dobson, a statistician at the University of Queensland, commented on the debate. Dobson largely weighed in on Rogeberg’s side, saying the number of long-term pot users in the Dunedin group was small, only 124 reported regular use at any time. ""I suspect that the small sample size limited the extent to which the authors were able to take possible confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, into account,"" Dobson wrote. ""So are the original results by Meier et al. correct? I don’t believe we can say whether they are or not."" Our ruling Marcus said the best evidence shows that teenagers who start smoking marijuana will lose eight IQ points. This overstates the actual underlying report. It would be more accurate to say the study showed a higher risk of losing that many points on an IQ test, not that a person necessarily would. More fundamentally, an equally reputable analysis found that IQ loss could be tied to household incomes as much as marijuana use.  Clearly, a scientific consensus has yet to emerge, and Marcus ignored the ongoing debate.

Dan Patrick incorrectly says Texas has 40 percent to 50 percent dropout rates in inner-city schools
","Houston state Sen. Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor nominee, vowed to reach out to all Texans in his general-election campaign. Addressing his party’s June 2014 state convention, Patrick continued: ""I’m going to go into Democratic strongholds and I’m going to tell them about school choice and educational opportunities, because we have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools, and that cannot stand, for those families and for our state."" We wondered about those proclaimed dropout rates. The numbers from Patrick, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, contrast sharply with those cited by the the Texas Education Agency, which reported a statewide high school dropout rate for the class of 2012 of 6.3 percent. (Austin’s high schools averaged a 3.7 percent dropout rate, topping out at LBJ High School’s 8.4 percent rate, according to the agency.) The state said nearly 88 percent of more than 316,000 seniors graduated in 2012, with another 5 percent staying in high school and 1 percent receiving GED certificates. Patrick’s back-up information Asked how Patrick reached his percentages, Patrick’s campaign manager, Logan Spence, said by email Patrick looked at graduation rates for selected high schools in the Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth school districts. Spence listed 11 high schools in those districts that he described as having graduation rates ranging from nearly 60 percent down to 47 percent, implying dropout rates of more than 40 percent to 53 percent. Spence said Patrick’s numbers were based on raw data for the class of 2012 posted on TEA web pages for each school. Spence also suggested we contact Caroline Neary of the Houston-based Children at Risk Institute; she told us the group was the source of the graduation rates that Patrick used. Neary said the institute, which describes itself as a non-partisan research and advocacy organization dedicated to addressing the root causes of poor public policies affecting children, works from state data to calculate school graduation rates in part by choosing not to believe some of the reasons schools use to account for students leaving before graduation. Like the TEA, Children at Risk acknowledges students who have died or left for home-schooling and doesn’t count any of them as dropouts. The institute’s president, Bob Sanborn, told us it also credits a school with a graduate even if a student transfers to another Texas public school sometime before graduating. But unlike the state, the institute doesn’t assume students recorded by schools as leaving for private school or moving to a school in another state or country actually did so, instead considering such students all to be dropouts, Sanborn confirmed. Summing up: By Patrick’s approach, the dropout rates for his subset of 11 inner-city schools ranged from nearly 41 percent to 53 percent. By the accepted state and federal gauge, the rates ranged from 5 percent to 27 percent. We took a close look at Patrick’s dropout methodology. Snapshot: Lee High School, Houston To take one school as an example, we spoke with Houston school spokeswoman Sheleah Reed about the graduation rate result indicated by Patrick for students at the district’s Lee High. The school’s TEA profile page says the 2008-09 school year started with 608 ""brand new ninth graders. If you had visited our school in May 2012, you would want to see 608 students wearing caps and gowns, right?"" But students moved in and out of the school over the years, the profile says, leaving a net 531 students who ""you would expect"" to be 2012 graduates. Still, only 272 students received diplomas, the profile says. At a glance, this suggests a graduation rate of 51 percent, though not acknowledging students leaving or coming to the school over the four years yields a 45 percent graduation rate, a result based on dividing the 272 graduates by the 608 students in ninth grade four years earlier. This is close to the 47 percent graduation rate for Lee High presented by Patrick’s camp. Then again, drawing on the ""leaver"" codes employed by high schools, the state profile for Lee accounts for nearly all the students who didn’t graduate, stating that fewer than five students earned GEDs while 35 students remained at the school longer. Others were marked as returning to home countries (69 students); enrolling out of state (55) or in private school (41); or shifting to home schooling (less than 20). Also, 40 students dropped out or couldn’t be tracked, according to the profile. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Houston school district, Sheleah Reed, suggested it’s an error not to adjust for students who have left and entered a school over four years or not to consider the students enrolled for another year. By email, Reed noted that by the metric accepted by the state (the longitudinal definition we covered above), Lee High had an 80 percent graduation rate. We confirmed that figure from a state chart posted online, which further indicated Lee’s class of 2012 had a 9.4 percent dropout rate.  Source: Texas Education Agency, search of website starting here, July 2, 2014. Other analysts For outside expertise, we reached out to Grover J. ""Russ"" Whitehurst, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former U.S. Department of Education official. Whitehurst, testifying in December 2012 on behalf of the state in a lawsuit over its school funding system, expressed concern that high schools could game the dropout reporting system. He said what commonly happens is a student drops out but is instead listed as having moved or transferred when his classmates and even school administrators know the truth. Still, Whitehurst, by email to us, called Patrick’s calculations idiosyncratic, hence generating the problems noted by the Houston district. Also, at our request, Lori Taylor, an associate professor in Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, explored how Patrick reached his graduation/dropout rate result for Lee High. Taylor, a member of the Children at Risk Institute’s Public Policy Advisory Board, then replied that any calculation getting to the graduation rates cited by Patrick for Lee and three other high schools he singled out as ""bogus,"" she said by email, for ignoring certain students each school recorded as having left for other reasons. Taylor went on to say she didn’t see a way Patrick’s figures could be accurate. Responses from Patrick, institute We shared Taylor’s analysis with Neary and Spence, who emailed: ""Dan doesn't use the state definition of ‘dropout’ because it doesn't accurately reflect the significant number of students who are leaving our schools before graduating."" Neary said by email she could understand Taylor’s reasoning, adding: ""Of course we know that every student who moves from public school to private school (or another state, or their home country) isn’t actually a dropout, even though our model does assume this. Since there is no way to independently verify leaver codes,"" meaning how the schools account for each student who leaves, ""it is all or nothing in using them. We choose to use this more conservative estimate as a counterpoint to the state’s rates. We don’t claim to have a perfect calculation for exact graduation rates, but we are transparent in our method."" Sanborn said by phone the institute's calculations are ""the closest to the truth you’re going to get."" Our ruling Patrick said: ""We have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools."" Asked to back up his statement, Patrick failed to account for all the state’s inner-city high schools and the handful of schools he singled out had official 2012 dropout rates of 5 percent to 27 percent, far short of 40 percent or more. His proclaimed figures depend on assuming schools hide dropouts by misrepresenting them as leaving for private school or for schooling outside Texas. We rate this claim as False.

Glenn Grothman says he leads in grassroots financial backing
","When Republican moderate Tom Petri retires next year, his successor in Congress is likely to be a more conservative member of the party. Four Republicans are battling for the party’s nomination, and fundraising will help determine who emerges from the Aug. 12, 2014 primary in Wisconsin’s 6th Congressional District. The winner will take on Democrat Mark Harris. When state Sen. Glenn Grothman’s mid-year campaign fund balance trailed two of his Republican rivals for the seat, he put a positive spin on his showing. ""The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!"" he wrote in a Facebook post on July 16, 2014. Grothman, of Campbellsport, says it is smaller donations from Wisconsin that define his stronger ""grassroots"" support when compared to better-funded rivals Joe Leibham, a state senator from Sheboygan, and Duey Stroebel, a state representative from Saukville. We wondered if Grothman really has an edge among regular Joes and Janes giving $1 to $199 at a time in contrast to the deep-pockets givers. So we did what we do -- crunched the numbers. We trained our calculator mainly on Leibham, who raised $302,940 so far in 2014, and Grothman, who’s taken in $147,638. That’s because Grothman clearly has more financial support from regular folks than Stroebel ($368,206), who’s mainly using his own money, and than Tom Denow of the Oshkosh area, whose scant fundraising did not require reporting. We found a virtual dead heat between Grothman and Leibham on some indicators of small-bore support -- but better news for Leibham on key bottom-line measures. To the numbers: Concentration of Wisconsin support:  More than 99 percent of Grothman’s donors are from the Badger State, compared with Leibham at 98.1 percent. A broader way to look at it is donations, not just donors (some donors give multiple times). By that measure, Leibham and Grothman each got between 98 and 99 percent from Badger State residents. Concentration of small givers:  Slightly more than 76 percent of Grothman’s individual donations were $100 or less. The comparable figure for Leibham: just over 75 percent. Again, basically even. On donations of under $200 -- the threshold at which the Federal Election Commission allows candidates not to itemize donors by name -- Grothman had a larger advantage: 79 percent to 74 percent. (Leibham discloses names and other information on all donations; Grothman, as is true for many candidates, discloses smaller donations only as a lump-sum number, as the FEC allows. He shared additional detail with us for this story. The candidates’ fundraising reports are on the FEC website.) Money total from small givers: Leibham ran ahead of Grothman on total funds from those giving $100 or less per donation, $46,000 to $41,000. Number of small and in-state donations: Leibham attracted almost 200 more sub-$101 contributions than Grothman, and about 300 more total donations from Wisconsinites. Big money donations: Leibham gets a slightly larger share of his contributions from people giving $1,000 or more. In short, the pair get basically the same, very large share of their support from in-state donors and from small donations, but Leibham does more volume. Grothman campaign spokesman Brandon VerVelde told us Grothman should get credit for winning straw polls at GOP events.   Perhaps he should, but the candidate’s statement was about fundraising. Our rating Grothman boasted that, ""The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!"" But the numbers show that Leibham matched or out-did Grothman on most measures.

Ken Block says Cranston Mayor Allan Fung increased the garbage tax by as much as $200
","Cranston’s new automated trash collection system, approved in February, is just getting under way, but it has already raised a stink.    Ken Block, a Republican candidate for governor, argues that the new program comes at an additional cost. He claims that Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, his gubernatorial primary opponent,  has raised ""the garbage tax"" by ""as much as $200 for some residents.""  Block raised the issue during a debate with Fung on Rhode Island Public Radio on July 15, 2014.  When it was Block’s turn to ask Fung a question, he said,  ""You know, I’ve heard from a number of Cranston residents, including a few CPAs, that the increase in the garbage tax that you’ve imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200 dollars. And for a number of people in Cranston, that’s equivalent to what is in effect a five-percent increase in their property tax … ""So my question to you is: When you talk about not increasing taxes but you’re charging some people the equivalent of 5 percent increase in property taxes, with $200 to collect garbage where they paid much less than the year before, how do you explain that, and do you think that’s acceptable? I hear from a ton of people we talked to in Cranston; they’re very unhappy with this."" In response, Fung said he’d heard from many residents that they’re happy with the new system.  ""I’m not sure where you’re talking about a garbage tax,"" he said. ""We haven’t raised taxes."" Garbage tax? $200 increase? Equivalent to 5-percent tax increase?  Is this just a lot of trash talk? Here are the facts, according to the city’s website and the mayor’s office: Cranston’s new automated trash pickup system,which started in June, is intended to boost the city’s recycling rate from 23 percent to the state’s goal of 35 percent and potentially earn rebates; keep the city cleaner by using closed containers; and reduce the rodent population by using the largely chew-proof barrels. All in all, it should make for a cleaner, sweeter-smelling Cranston with an eased ""critter"" problem.  As part of the program, Cranston residents have received two new, free  65-gallon rolling barrels, one for trash, the other for recyclables. Residents can opt for smaller, 35-gallon bins if the larger ones are too unwieldy.  Residents who want a third barrel must pay $150 per year. There’s another change: the city no longer removes bulky items and appliances for free. Residents must pay $18 per bulky item, and $25 per mattress or box spring.   The bottom line: There is no new ""garbage tax,"" but there new fees for services that were free before. Now let’s examine Block’s claim.  When we asked the Block campaign what he was talking about, they emailed us a five-page response, contending that he was referring to the charge for the optional extra barrels, and the new removal fees for bulky items. We should note that, in his back-and-forth with Fung, Block at one point said: ""You don’t want to call it a tax - let’s call it a fee. They’re now paying a fee …"" But he also used the words ""tax"" or ""taxes"" six times in roughly 30 seconds. In his email, Block explained his math. ""The fact of the matter is that the citizens of Cranston are paying much more for trash removal than they were in the prior year when it was already done as a service paid for by their tax dollars,"" Block wrote. ""Collectively every household that has an extra bin ($150), plus any household that has a large curbside item ($18 per item) adds up to a sum of money that Cranston taxpayers are collectively paying for out of pocket that they didn’t pay for the year before -- call it a fee, call it a tax, call it whatever, but many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago."" As for the five percent: ""If a homeowner has an annual property tax bill of $4,000 and he/she needs to purchase an extra bin, and also pay for three curbside items, ""then he /she is paying approximately $300 in new fees, which is a 5% increase over their $4,000 tax bill."" OK, but just a second. How many is ""many"" when we’re talking about people paying for additional bins? Block cites 2008 Environmental Protection Agency estimates that each person in the U.S. ""creates a daily average of 4.5 pounds of solid waste."" From that, Block extrapolates that ""each person creates approximately 30 pounds of solid waste per week"" in concluding that ""larger families will need an extra bin or bins."" Block also noted that the 65-gallon barrels provided in Cranston are smaller than the 90-gallon barrels provided in nearby Warwick. And he noted that residents who previously could discard bulky items such as sofas, carpets and mattresses will now have to pay extra fees.  It’s a little early to predict how many people in Cranston will be paying extra for bulky waste or renting extra bins.  But to date, out of 28,600 residential units that have received barrels, only 80 have requested an additional trash bin - or 0.3 percent, the mayor says.  Fung also called Block’s statement ""false in a number of respects"" and noted that there hasn’t been an increase in property taxes for three years. ""So even if a portion of the regular property tax were to be segregated or designated as paying for refuse removal services, the statement that there has been an ‘increase’ is false, because the overall tax rate has stayed constant for three consecutive years,"" he said. Our ruling During a radio debate, Ken Block said, ""The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200."" He then mentioned the word ""tax or taxes"" five more times. But there is no garbage tax. And only those who request an extra barrel or are discarding bulky items and mattresses will pay any extra fees. In fairness, Block later used the word ""fee,"" and ""additional fee."" But we believe the average listener  would conclude that Block was talking about a hike in -- or extra fee beyond -- an existing ""garbage tax."" In addition, Block’s claim that ""many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago,"" is sweeping generalization. Only 80 residents have so far requested an extra barrel.  We won’t say that Block’s claim is a whole lot of garbage. But it certainly misleads and exaggerates.  We rule his statement False.

Is Oregon the most trade-dependent state in the nation?
","Gov. John Kitzhaber’s first debate with Republican challenger state Rep. Dennis Richardson covered a lot of ground, with both candidates spending considerable time on economic issues. Their exchanges made clear that the economy will continue to be a pivotal issue as the campaign heads toward the November election. The claim: Kitzhaber, a Democrat seeking a historic fourth term in office, touted his job-creation work and said his policies have helped stabilize the state’s budget. Looking ahead, he said, the state has untapped gold in the form of international trade possibilities. Then Kitzhaber added this: ""We are the most trade-dependent state in the nation."" PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. The analysis: We called Christian Gaston, a policy adviser for the governor’s campaign. He was sitting in the front row at the debate and said the claim caught his ear as well. In a subsequent email, Gaston said, ""The governor misspoke. He meant to say that Oregon is one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation."" The latter claim is one Kitzhaber has made before, Gaston said. His email included a YouTube link to an interview in December 2013 in which the governor does say ""is one of"" the most trade-dependent states. For context, we looked at where Oregon ranks. ""Determining trade dependence is extremely difficult,"" said Robert Whelan, an economist with ECONorthwest, a Portland-based company that provides economic analyses and professional consulting services to public and private entities. ""It’s one area that cannot be absolutely checked."" For instance, Whelan said, Oregon exports about $1.6 billion worth of chemicals a year, much of that in soda ash and potash. ""Most people would see that figure and say, ‘Wow,’"" Whelan said, ""‘where’s the chemical factory?’ Well, there isn’t any. It’s mined elsewhere, brought in by rail and shipped. But it shows up as an export."" All of the products made at a Boeing plant near Gresham, on the other hand, are hauled to Seattle, where they are finished and shipped. Those are counted as Washington exports, not Oregon. Still, Whelan said, ""there’s no way to say we are the most trade-dependent, but we are certainly one of them."" The value of exports from Oregon to foreign countries this year will be about $19 billion, a figure that ranks 23rd among the 50 states, according to International Trade Association statistics. A trade study released in 2010 by the Portland Business Alliance ranked Oregon seventh nationally in the share exports hold -- 12 percent -- of the state’s economy. A more recent study prepared for the same group indicates that nearly 80,000 jobs in Oregon are directly tied to exporting goods and services, with one in four manufacturing jobs in the state being export-related. Those same numbers are far larger in states that dwarf Oregon in terms of population. But according to the Portland Business Alliance’s study, Oregon exports ranked seventh on a per capita basis in 2013. The ruling: Gov. John Kitzhaber, in a debate with Republican challenger Dennis Richardson, claimed that Oregon is ""the most trade-dependent state in the nation."" A spokesman said Kitzhaber has previously said that Oregon ""is one of"" the most trade-dependent states in the U.S. If he had said that, we would have reached a different ruling. As it is, we find Kitzhaber’s claim False. Thoughts on this ruling?

Charlie Crist says Rick Scott cut Bright Futures in half
","Former Gov. Charlie Crist continued his attacks on Gov. Rick Scott’s education funding record in a TV ad set at St. Petersburg High School, Crist’s alma mater. ""This isn’t just a doorway to a school. It was my doorway as a public school kid to opportunity. And I want to make sure every child has that same chance for a better life,"" Crist says in the ad. ""But Rick Scott's education cuts are closing that door on Florida's kids, spending almost $200 less per student than when I was governor and cutting Bright Futures scholarships in half."" Here we will fact-check whether Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships in half. Bright Futures funding and scholarships Launched in 1997, Bright Futures is the higher education scholarship program funded by the Lottery and designed to keep high-achieving students at Florida schools. The program’s costs spiraled up from an initial price tag of $70 million in 1997 to $437 million in 2011. Those rising costs led the Legislature to rein in the program. In 2010, Crist’s last year as governor, the Legislature reduced Bright Futures scholarships by $1 dollar for every credit hour. The law also raised SAT/ACT requirements incrementally over a few years, which was expected to lead to a drop in the number of students who would qualify. For example, the Legislature raised the minimum SAT requirement for Florida Medallion Scholars -- one subset of Bright Futures -- from 970 in 2010-11 to 1050 in 2013-14. So that means that the Legislature and Crist reduced the number of eligible students in the future, after Scott took over as governor. When Scott took over, he and the Legislature continued on that same path -- but made it even harder for students to qualify. In 2011, Scott’s first year as governor, the Legislature decided to further raise test scores for 2013-14 graduates. For example, those Medallion Scholars would now have to score 1170 on their SAT by 2013-14. When Crist says that under Scott the scholarships were cut in ""half,"" it’s possible for viewers to mistakenly believe that refers to total dollars spent, or the amount of individual scholarships. Instead, what the ad is referring to is the number of scholarships distributed. The text on the screen shows that it refers to a May 2014 Sun-Sentinel editorial criticizing Bright Futures cuts, and this is what the Crist campaign pointed us to regarding the ad. As the requirements rose, not surprisingly the number of students who obtained the scholarship has dropped. Due to the tougher standards, ""the number of new Bright Futures scholarship students will be cut almost in half – from 41,107 last fall to 21,340 this fall,"" the editorial board wrote. That number for this fall is based on an estimate from the state regarding how many students will qualify. After schools verify that scholarship recipients enrolled in eligible courses, the schools submit for reimbursement to the state -- and that’s when we learn the actual number of scholarships that were used. Here are recent years’ numbers on Bright Futures. The spending picture is not settled for the current and future fiscal years, so we have included an estimate for 2013-14 and 2014-15.   Budget Year Initial students disbursed Total number of students served Amount of money disbursed Average award per student 2007-08 50,499 159,170 $379.8 million $2,387 2008-09 52,497 169,366 $429 million $2,533 2009-10 53,520 177,612 $423.5 million $2,385 2010-11 53,800 179,076 $423.3 million $2,364 2011-12 51,751 174,047 $333.8 million $1,918 2012-13 44,846 162,980 $312.1 million $1,915 2013-14 estimated 41,107 154,160 $309.4 million $2,007 2014-15 estimated 21,340 127,573 $266.2 million $2,087 Source: Florida Department of Education We think there are three main issues with the accuracy of the ad: • The ad could create the false impression that the amount of money per scholarship (or total money) was cut in half, when it’s actually referring to the number of scholarships. • The number of scholarships dropping by a half is based on the state’s estimate of how many will qualify this fall. But we don’t yet know the final number. • Though the ad points the finger at Scott, Crist also oversaw changes to Bright Futures that reduced the number of eligible students during Scott’s administration. Our ruling A Crist TV ad says Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships ""in half."" Viewers could mistakenly think that Scott cut the dollar amount of scholarships in half -- but he didn’t. Instead, Crist’s campaign zeroed in on the number of scholarships that were distributed last year compared to an estimate for the upcoming school year. While the ad blames Scott, under Crist the Legislature also raised the standards to reduce the number of scholarships awarded. Scott and the Legislature later raised the standards again, which is projected to reduce the number more. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Liberal PAC says Senate candidate Thom Tillis’ tax plan will 'overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy'
","Controversial changes to North Carolina’s tax code passed under Thom Tillis’ leadership are now a target in his Senate campaign. In 2013, the North Carolina government received national attention for a wave of conservative legislation. The Republican-dominated General Assembly -- with Tillis as speaker of the House -- passed laws increasing voter ID requirements, lowering business regulations, upping restrictions on abortion providers, tightening education spending and trimming unemployment benefits. Now, Patriot Majority USA, a liberal political action committee, has released a television ad saying Tillis’ policies have disproportionately benefited the wealthy. The ad notes in particular the tax legislation enacted last summer -- which Tillis touts in his campaign against incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. The ad says Tillis is cozy with Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who cofounded Americans for Prosperity, an influential conservative PAC. And his policies are designed to benefit people like them. ""Thom Tillis thinks the wealthy, like the Koch brothers, deserve tax breaks, while teachers get a pay freeze,"" the ad says. ""Tillis thinks corporations like the ones owned by the Koch brothers should also get tax breaks, while seniors see their pensions taxed and pay more for prescription drugs. Thom Tillis: He may not be a Koch brother, but he certainly treats them like family."" At one point, text on the screen says the Tillis tax plan will ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy."" We looked into it and found that the law does not overtly harm those at lower-income levels, but the wealthy reap more of the benefits. Let’s go to the numbers. Income taxes Supporters of the tax plan most often point to the reduced income tax rate, which they say cuts taxes for people in every income bracket. That’s true. However, people in higher-income brackets get bigger cuts than those in the lowest brackets. The income tax part of the law sets the rate for everyone at 5.75 percent. Previously, the state had a graduated three-tier system, with rates of 6 percent for the lowest earners, and rates of 7 percent and 7.75 percent for higher earners. The lowest earners’ tax rates shrunk only marginally -- 0.25 points, while higher earners’ rates went down 1.25 and 2 points, respectively. Lower earners get a small break, though, in the income tax changes. The child tax credit goes from $100 to $125 per child for those earning below $40,000. The North Carolina Legislature’s Fiscal Research Division calculated how much people in various scenarios would owe on average based on the changes to the income tax (other tax changes not included). Here’s a sample of what they found: Scenario Tax owed before change Tax owed after change Change in taxes owed Married, two children, $20,000 income $40 $38 -$2 -5% change Married, two children, $250,000 income $15,832 $13,398 -$2,434 -15% change Married, no children, $20,000 income $540 $288 -$252 -47% change Married, no children, $250,000 income $16,142 $13,398 -$2,744 -17% change Single, $20,000 income $870 $719 -$151 -17% change Single, $250,000 income $17,858 $13,786 -$4,072 -22% change   In none of the scenarios examined by the Fiscal Research Division do people owe more in income taxes than they did under the previous tax code. But some benefit more than others. ""There’s no question who benefits the most -- the people at the upper end of the income distribution,"" said Lawrence Zelenak, a tax law professor at the Duke University School of Law, which is in North Carolina. ""For most people, it hardly makes any difference. But the people who get the major decrease have incomes of $200,000 or more."" Other changes Critics say the new tax law also disproportionately benefits the wealthy because the Legislature did not renew -- effectively eliminating -- the State Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. In 2011, about 907,000 North Carolina tax filers claimed the state EITC, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a liberal advocacy group. The maximum credit ranges between $24 for a single person and $302 for a family with three or more children. Additionally, the Legislature expanded the sales tax base -- making more goods and services subject to the tax, which everyone pays regardless of income. The tax base widened to include natural gas, electricity and some entertainment services, including admissions charges.    The law also eliminated North Carolina’s sales tax holidays and several sales tax exemptions, such as those for newspapers, vending machines and meals sold in schools. Opponents of raising the sales tax and other regressive taxes say they are unfairly burdensome on lower-income people because a higher percentage of their income is subject to these taxes than wealthier people. For example, if two people -- one making $500 a week and the other making $2,000 a week -- spend $100 each on groceries, the person with the lower income is spending a greater share of their income on these taxed items than the person with a higher income. It’s worth noting that in 2011 -- Tillis’ first year as speaker -- the Legislature reduced sales tax rates from 5.75 percent to 4.75 percent. Tillis and other Republicans also say the new law’s reductions in corporate tax rates (down from 6.9 percent to 5 percent, and 3 percent if certain parameters are met) will bring business and jobs to North Carolina, which will benefit everyone and bring in more revenue over the long term. In total, the new tax code will reduce tax-collected revenue by about $684 million between 2013 and 2015, according to the Fiscal Research Division. Less revenue means less money for the state to spend on social programs, which hurts people in low income brackets, Zelenak said. Even if the law does not obviously harm poor people, this is a possible indirect effect. Our ruling A Patriot Majority USA ad said Tillis’ tax plan would ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy."" North Carolina’s tax code saw a wide array of changes in 2013 under Tillis’ leadership. We found that changes to the income tax code reduced taxes for everyone, but much more for wealthier people than lower-income people. Additionally, sales tax expansions, less government revenue and eliminating the state EITC are especially burdensome on poorer people. But some changes -- such as the increased child credit for lower-income tax filers and the possibility of more jobs and business due to lowered corporate tax rates -- could benefit the whole. ""Overwhelmingly"" is a strong word. For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/25/patriot-majority-usa/liberal-pac-says-senate-candidate-thom-tillis-tax-/

Glenn Beck says 9-year-old girl raped in Austin by man previously released four times
","When talk-show host Glenn Beck said a horrific crime occurred in Austin, we wondered what he was talking about. Beck made his statement, in a July 17, 2014, interview of Gov. Rick Perry shared online more than 32,000 times by the next day, after Perry said he was looking at deploying National Guard troops to secure the Texas-Mexico border; he later said up to 1,000 troops would be dispatched. In the interview, Perry expressed concern that over 3,000 homicides had been committed ""by illegal aliens over the"" last six years. ""That’s unacceptable,"" Perry said, ""and that’s the reason that we have to secure that border."" We rated this murder count as Pants on Fire; the state-gathered information behind Perry’s claim had to do with homicide charges (not convictions) leveled against both legally authorized and unauthorized U.S. residents over an unstated period of time. Beck replied to Perry: ""OK. In Austin Texas yesterday, a rape of a 9-year-old girl, of a guy who had been caught four times and released,"" his implication being the attacker wasn’t living in the country with legal permission. We were unable to reach Beck to glean the basis of his claim--and we didn’t find other reports of such a crime in Austin. But an online search revealed an alleged crime committed near Fort Worth with some details aligning with Beck’s statement. Perpetrator northwest of Fort Worth? According to a July 13, 2014, news story in the Dallas Morning News, a man previously deported to Mexico four times had been arrested in Parker County the day before after he entered a house through a window and fondled a 9-year-old girl. The story, quoting county authorities, said the incident in Springtown, 20 miles northwest of Fort Worth, resulted in the arrest of Israel Andrade, 35, who was jailed on a charge of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit another felony. A blog post by the Parker County Sheriff’s Department said the other felony was ""indecency with a child by sexual contact."" By telephone, Sheriff Larry Fowler told us the attacker did not commit a rape; he was groping and fondling, Fowler said. The News’ story said the girl told investigators she had been awakened where she slept on a couch by a man who groped her. The man spoke in broken English, the story said, and motioned for her to follow him back to the bedroom, but the girl screamed and he fled. Authorities said they later found him at a relative’s home, also finding two pair of children’s underwear in a pair of his jeans, and tennis shoes with a tread pattern matching the footprints outside the girl’s home, the newspaper reported. The child’s mother identified the underwear as her daughter’s, the story said. His relatives told authorities he’d returned to the U.S. from Mexico a month before, the story said. According to a web page drawing on Parker County records, Andrade was held on $500,000 bail and had an INS ""detainer"" placed on him. A detainer, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement says, means the agency intends to assume custody of an individual once the person is no longer subject to local detention. Three confirmed deportations, no Austin arrest Parker County’s blog post said that according to federal records, Andrade had been deported in July 2003, February 2004, September 2009 and December 2010. Carl Rusnok, a Dallas-based ICE spokesman, confirmed three deportations of Andrade, telling us by email they occurred in 2004, 2006 and 2012. Also, Andrade was thrice sentenced to federal prison for illegally entering or re-entering the country, Rusnok said. Finally, we looked into whether Andrade had been arrested in Austin. Roger Wade, spokesman for the Travis County Sheriff’s Department, emailed that no one by that name showed up in the agency’s computer records. Veneza Bremner, spokeswoman for the Austin Police Department, said by phone Andrade’s name wasn’t in department arrest records. Our ruling Beck said a 9-year-old girl was recently raped in Austin, Texas, by a guy previously ""caught four times and released."" Beck got the alleged crime and location wrong, but authorities northwest of Fort Worth did detain Israel Andrade, an unauthorized U.S. resident previously deported three times, on a charge of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit another felony, which local officials referred to as indecency with a child by sexual contact.

Saslaw says 40 percent of rural hospitals will close in states that don't expand Medicaid
","State Sen. Richard Saslaw says rural hospitals are imperiled in Virginia and other states that don’t expand their Medicaid programs. ""We all get that magazine, `Governing,’ and they’ve estimated that in the states that don’t expand Medicaid, a minimum, they said of 40 percent of rural hospitals will close in those states..."" Saslaw, D-Fairfax, said during a recent radio interview on the John Fredericks Show. We hadn’t heard of such a dire estimate and we wondered whether Saslaw was correct. Let’s start with some background. Saslaw, the Senate minority leader, strongly backs expanding eligibility in the state’s Medicaid program to as many as 400,000 additional low-income and disabled Virginians. Under the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, the federal government would always pay at least 90 percent of the cost. General Assembly Republicans have blocked the expansion, however, saying Washington can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. Obamacare, when it was approved in 2010, required all states to extend Medicaid eligibility to households earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line. The idea was to make sure that people who couldn’t afford health insurance could gain coverage either through broadened Medicaid programs or subsidized policies bought on by newly-created health exchanges. Because more people would have coverage, the ACA called for the gradual reduction of federal payments -- Disproportionate Share Hospital , or DSH -- to hospitals that treat large numbers uninsured patients. But the trade-off was upset by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2012 ruling that allowed each state to decide whether to expand Medicaid. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have opted in. Twenty-four states, including Virginia, have declined to broaden their programs. The DSH payments, however, are still scheduled to be deeply cut. That means states like Virginia that refuse to accept federal money to expand Medicaid also will be losing federal dollars to help compensate hospitals for treating patients who can’t afford health insurance. The hospitals, in other words, will lose revenue. Saslaw told us his comments were based on an article this April in Governing, a national magazine directed towards elected officials and bureaucrats. But contrary to Saslaw’s assertion, the story didn’t estimate that 40 percent of the rural hospitals would shut down in states that don’t expand Medicaid. What it said is that more than 40 percent of the rural hospitals nationwide are ""operating in the red,"" according to the National Rural Health Association, and those located in states that don’t broaden Medicaid may see their financial  problems worsen. We asked the association if it’s made any predictions on the percentage of rural hospitals that will close in states that don’t expand Medicaid. ""We don’t have an estimate or a guess on that,"" said Lindsey Corey, the group’s communications and marketing director. During a subsequent second conversation we had with Saslaw, he acknowledged he ""misread"" the article. Our ruling Saslaw says Governing magazine has estimated that 40 percent of rural hospitals will close in states that don’t expand their Medicaid rolls. The magazine article didn’t make that dire prediction and neither did the health organization that’s quoted in the story. What they said was that 40 percent of rural hospitals are running in the red and those located in states that don’t broaden Medicaid eligibility may see their problems exacerbated. No doubt, many rural hospitals face significant challenges. But Salsaw, who admits he erred,  misstated the peril to his advantage in arguing for Medicaid expansion.

Federal government required states to adopt Common Core school standards, congressional hopeful says
","Gov. Scott Walker joined other potential Republican candidates for president when, in a surprise move, he called on the Wisconsin Legislature to repeal the Common Core education standards. State Sen. Joe Leibham, one of four Republicans seeking the GOP nomination for an open seat in Congress, applauded the announcement two days later. ""Like Governor Walker, I believe education decisions should be made at the local and state level, not through federal mandates like Common Core,"" he said in a July 19, 2014 news release. Common Core -- a federal mandate? No. That's a lesson we've learned before. Let's review. The race GOP U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, who has represented east-central Wisconsin in Congress since 1979, announced in April 2014 that he would not seek re-election. That was a week after state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-Campbellsport, announced he would run. Jumping in later were Leibham, of the Town of Sheboygan, state Rep. Duey Stroebel of the Town of Cedarburg and political newcomer Tom Denow of the Town of Algoma in Winnebago County. The winner of the Aug. 12, 2014 primary will face Winnebago County Executive Mark Harris, who is running unopposed in the Democratic primary, in the November 2014 general election. On the GOP side, much of the campaigning has centered on which candidate is the most conservative. Common Core's origins Increasingly, conservatives around the country have attacked the Common Core State Standards, a set of standards for English and math that were unveiled in 2010. The criticism has stirred debate about the federal government's role in the standards and whether the renewed focus on them is strictly political. Tony Evers, the elected Wisconsin school superintendent, used his authority to have the state adopt Common Core in June 2010. More than three years later, in October 2013, the GOP-majority Legislature began holding hearings with the aim of reviewing and perhaps replacing Common Core. At the time, Evers said the pushback in Madison and elsewhere ""is all about what's going on in Washington. It's all about controlling the message and the next (presidential) election."" Also in October 2013, we rated as Mostly True a claim by state Rep. Sondy Pope, D-Cross Plains, a Common Core supporter. She said Common Core ""is not from the federal government,"" they ""do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all."" Here's what we learned at the time: Common Core came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. In 2009, that council and the National Governors Association agreed to create Common Core. They developed the standards with the help of teachers, parents and experts. Although Common Core is voluntary, the federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards. States earned the equivalent of extra points in the competition for grants from Race to the Top, Obama’s signature education program, if they had adopted standards to prepare students for college and work. They didn't have to adopt Common Core, but they were better positioned for federal money if they did. Linking Race to the Top funding and Common Core is what Leibham cited to defend his claim. ""In this era of tight budgets, tying federal funding to the adoption of specific education initiatives like Common Core is inherently coercive,"" Leibham campaign spokesman Ryan Terrill wrote in an email. ""As Wisconsin struggles to maintain appropriate funding for K-12 education amid increasingly scarce (state) resources and declining property tax revenues in many districts, any individual suggesting that Wisconsin not try for RTTT funding would be ridiculed.  Therefore, Wisconsin’s grant application and the strings attached really were not entirely a matter of choice."" But that doesn't make Common Core a mandate -- a fact that has been reported repeatedly since we checked the Pope claim. Four examples, from March and April 2014: 1. PolitiFact Georgia noted that one of the leaders in developing Common Core, former Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia, said it was a way to ""prevent a federal mandate"" in education. 2. U.S. News & World Report, in an article headlined ""Common Core: Myths and Facts,"" labeled as the first myth: ""The Common Core State Standards are a federally mandated curriculum."" The article pointed out that the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act forbids the federal government from intervening in school curriculum development and that states independently adopted Common Core. 3. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, reported that Common Core is voluntary and, the curriculum and teaching methods are decided locally. 4. The Washington Post -- reporting on Indiana being the first state to pull out of Common Core after being among the first of 45 states to adopt it -- said Common Core isn't a federal mandate, and noted it was developed in part through the National Governors Association. Indeed, the fact that not every state adopted Common Core -- and that Indiana, as well as Oklahoma and South Carolina adopted it and later dropped it -- underscore that the standards aren't mandatory. As does the fact that Walker is calling on the Legislature to repeal them. Our rating Leibham said the Common Core education standards are a federal mandate. States put themselves in better position for federal education funding by adopting Common Core. But the school standards were voluntary for states to adopt, not mandatory, and some have since pulled out of the program -- just as Wisconsin is considering doing.

"['Georgia', 'Ending Spending Action Fund']","
Super PAC goes after Nunn on layoffs, raise
","Even before David Perdue’s snatched the GOP U.S. Senate nomination from longtime Congressman Jack Kingston on Tuesday, the Ending Spending Action Fund was out with a television ad attacking the Democrat in the race, Michelle Nunn. Nunn, the daughter of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, is viewed as one of the party’s best hopes for reclaiming a high-profile statewide office and for helping the party retain its majority in the U.S. Senate. The Ending Spending Action Fund is a conservative, well-funded super political action committee that originally focused on earmarks but has expanded its message and targets. It was founded by Joe Ricketts, the former CEO of TD Ameritrade and a known conservative backer whose family owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Brian Baker, the group’s president, was an adviser to former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. The group’s attack ad on Nunn began running last weekend and is being aired statewide. The 30-second spot tries to tie Nunn to President Barack Obama (opening with an image of the two of them) and the Affordable Care Act. It also criticizes her leadership as CEO of the nonprofit Points of Light Foundation. ""Come on -- Nunn earned as much as $300,000 running a nonprofit that had laid off 90 workers,"" the ad states. ""Do you really think she’ll look out for us in Washington?"" PolitiFact Georgia decided that was a claim worth checking. The Ending Spending Action Fund’s current attack ad makes some of the same charges that the group’s pre-primary spots did. Among them is a claim that Nunn supports higher taxes. PolitiFact in April rated that specific claim Mostly False. We reached out to Baker this week on the latest ad. He told us the PAC has spent about $900,000 on two anti-Nunn ads -- the one before the primary and the current spot. ""We opposed no other candidates besides Nunn and (Republican U.S. Rep. Phil) Gingrey,"" he said in an email. Gingrey lost in the crowded May 20th GOP Senate primary that landed Perdue and Kingston in the runoff. Baker sent us a summary of the PAC’s ad research, including excerpts from articles in Politico, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and National Review about the merger of HandsOn Network, a nonprofit Nunn helped establish and ran, and the Points of Light Foundation, a service-oriented organization inspired by President George H.W. Bush. The research also focused on the layoff of 90 to 95 of the two groups’ combined 175 employees, as well as a jump in Nunn’s salary from $120,00 at Atlanta-based Handsn Network to $250,00 at Points of Light. Tax records show that Nunn’s salary was $250,000 in 2007, the first year she took over as CEO at Points of Light. Her total compensation three years later exceeded $300,000. Those same tax records show that her Points of Light predecessor, Robert K. Goodwin, earned $325,000 during his last full year on the job. Nunn told Politico that an executive committee set her salary and that she had argued for it to be lower than Goodwin’s because ""of the tough times we were going through."" Of the layoffs, Nunn said, they were necessary ""in order to have the strength and success we’ve had today."" Two years after the two groups merged, Neil Bush, a son of the first President Bush and chairman of the Points of Light board, described to the Chronicle of Philanthropy why the merger was needed. ""The Points of Light Foundation, honestly, being an inside-the-Beltway Washington institution, became a little too dependent on federal funding, a little too bloated for the work it was engaged in,"" Bush told the Chronicle. Others said they initially wondered whether Nunn would make the hard decisions needed to make the merger work -- including the layoffs. ""She clearly came through,"" Walt Shill, a managing director at Accenture Management Consulting, told the Chronicle in October 2009. The Chronicle of Philanthropy recently described Nunn as one of the most visible faces in a burgeoning national movement to promote volunteerism. Under her leadership, Points of Light has a $30 million-plus budget and 250 affiliates across the country, according to the group. Nunn’s on leave from the organization while she campaigns. She and Perdue face off in November to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. At Points of Light, Nunn’s annual salary has fluctuated. It was $197,506 in 2008 and 2009, according to the organization’s Form 990s. The annual filings show Nunn received $322,056 in total compensation in 2010, with a base compensation of $285,533. She took a cut in compensation in 2011, down to $299,346, with a base salary of $274,793. To sum up our findings on the new ad: The Ending Spending Action Fund is correct that about 90 jobs were abolished when HandsOn Network and Points of Light joined forces. It is also correct that Nunn has earned as much as $300,000 annually as head of the charity, getting a significant raise after the merger. Nunn got a huge raise while some employees were getting pink slips.   But a bit of context is needed. Layoffs following mergers are common. And a nonprofit’s success can hinge on whether the public believes that it’s operating as efficiently as possible. Nunn’s salary at Points of Light, meanwhile, was less than her predecessor’s.  We rate the statement in the ad as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/25/ending-spending-action-fund/super-pac-goes-after-nunn-layoffs-raise/

Deirdre Imus: More illegal immigrants 'pouring in' now than under Reagan
","The crisis of young Central Americans showing up at the border has presented pundits another opportunity to compare the records of President Barack Obama and President Ronald Reagan. We caught Deidre Imus, a Fox Business contributor, debating presidential immigration scorecards with Fox News analyst Lis Wiehl on July 23, 2014. ""What has happened under President (Barack) Obama, is people thinking they can come here, especially unaccompanied minors, thinking they are getting amnesty,"" Imus said on her husband Don’s show Imus in the Morning. Wiehl shot back that this had been going on a long time and in fact, it was no different under Reagan. Imus was nonplussed. Imus: ""They were not pouring in like that, Lis. Are you really going to say that?"" Wiehl: ""Yes, they were. They were pouring in. Yes, they were.""   Imus: ""No, they weren’t. No, they were not."" A reader asked us to find out who was right. The weight of the evidence favors Wiehl, not Imus. Less people are illegally entering, or trying to illegally enter, the country under Obama than Reagan. There are two ways to measure the pressure at the border. You can look at total apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol and you can look at changes in the estimates of the undocumented population in the country. Neither is perfect, but apprehension numbers have the advantage that at least they are based on the actual reports of people detained by federal agents, rather than surveys by the Census Bureau. We’ll look at the apprehension data first. Apprehensions Using data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection we can see the number of people stopped along the southwest border. This table covers the number of attempted crossings during the Reagan years. Year Apprehensions 1988 942,861 1987 1,122,067 1986 1,615,844 1985 1,183,351 1984 1,058,276 1983 1,033,974 1982 745,820 1981 749,808 Average 1,056,500                           And this one covers the same border for the Obama years. Year Apprehensions 2013 414,397 2012 356,873 2011 327,577 2010 447,731 2009 540,865 Average 417,489                     It’s worth noting that apprehensions include everyone who is caught in the United States illegally. This would include the unaccompanied minors who have stirred such concern recently. We know the number of these young people has been rising rapidly and the data in this table only run through 2013. It’s fair to ask if the exponential growth among children would be enough to change the results of this comparison if we had a complete count for 2014. The answer is, not likely. In 2013, the unaccompanied children represented about 6 percent of the total. While they might be the focus of the current debate, even if they continue to grow dramatically, they have a limited impact on the overall numbers. There is another issue. Susan Martin, a migration policy expert at Georgetown University, cautions that border patrol tactics changed between the 1980s and today. ""The basic strategy in the 1980s, and before, was to apprehend and then return people immediately back to Mexico,"" Martin said. ""A substantial number attempted re-entry until they were successful. It was, in effect, a revolving door. Beginning in the Clinton administration, the strategy shifted to deterrence."" For a while, that deterrence strategy, which included fingerprinting and a hardened border, tended to push the numbers down. For the purposes of this fact-check, the point is that changes in tactics and policies will change the apprehension statistics. With that caveat, there were far more apprehensions during the Reagan administration than during the Obama administration. Estimated undocumented population Measuring the number of undocumented people during most of the Reagan years is difficult. Before 1986, the Census Bureau made no allowance for people who were in the country without authorization. The bureau’s best estimate was that starting in 1980, about 200,000 undocumented people entered the country each year. In 1986, the Census Bureau began tracking these numbers, but much more significant than survey methods, 1986 brought a major immigration reform law that offered amnesty to people who had been in the country continuously since 1982. In short order, more than 1.5 million people applied for and gained legal status. The standard way to measure the flow of unauthorized people into the country is to see how that population changes from year to year. But with people converting from illegal to legal status, simple comparisons became tricky during the last two years of Reagan’s term. Jeffrey Passel is a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center and is a leading authority on immigration statistics. Allowing for the people who changed their status, Passel finds ""a net increase of about 1.6 million"" during the Reagan years. To put that in annual terms, while the flow might have gone up and down, the average rate of 200,000 per year held true throughout Reagan’s administration. For Obama, Passel said the numbers are ""far less than under Reagan."" Passel said there was a net increase of 370,000 undocumented people and the average annual change was 120,000 from 2009-12.  Data from the Department of Homeland Security show an actual decline. The estimated undocumented population in 2010 was 11.6 million. For 2011, it was 11.5 million, and in 2012, it was 11.4 million. (We don’t include 2009 because of a major revision in Census Bureau methodology that prevents a direct comparison.) By definition, estimating is not an exact science and so Homeland Security summarized the trend as ""little to no change."" ""It is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased after 2007,"" the department wrote in 2011, ""given relatively high U.S. unemployment, improved economic conditions in Mexico, record low numbers of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at U.S. borders, and greater levels of border enforcement."" Martin at Georgetown University underscored that much of the trend is due to basic economics. ""Employer demand is certainly a major factor in explaining shifts in movement,"" Martin said. ""When the economy tanked in 2008, particularly in sectors such as construction, the number of new arrivals plummeted to what is estimated to be net zero growth in undocumented migration."" According to the Pew Research Center, the unauthorized immigrant population rose slightly in 2012 to 11.7 million. But that still leaves the Obama years with fewer new undocumented people than Reagan. Our ruling Imus said that people ""were not pouring in"" under Reagan like they are now. The numbers tell a different story. The apprehension figures, even allowing for changes in tactics, show an average of over a million attempts by people to cross the border during the Reagan years. For Obama, the average is about 417,000. If we count the size of the undocumented population, the best estimates are that it rose 200,000 per year under Reagan. The highest estimate for Obama is 120,000 per year. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jul/24/deirdre-imus/deirdre-imus-more-illegal-immigrants-pouring-now-u/

Rula Jebreal: 90% of people in Gaza 'don’t have access even to water'
","Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal slammed the U.S. media for ""biased"" coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict on July 21’s Ronan Farrow Daily. MSNBC had her back the next night on All In With Chris Hayes to talk about the balance between Israeli and Palestinian guests on major American news networks. We checked a claim from that back-and-forth here. Jebreal also took it upon herself to trumpet the news she says goes unreported in the United States. ""Most Americans think, okay, Israelis are minding their own business and Palestine woke up one day in Gaza and said okay, let me fire missiles,"" Jebreal said. ""That’s not what’s happening."" ""They don’t know anything about the siege, 1.8 million Palestinians living under siege in extreme poverty, with 90 percent that don’t have access even to water."" By all accounts, the situation in Gaza is bad, but we were surprised to hear that so few people have access to water. Since bombings started We weren’t able to reach Jebreal, but we did get in touch with Juan Cole, a history professor at the University of Michigan who frequently sounds off on Middle Eastern politics and who Jebreal cited during her interview. In a blog post concurring with Jebreal’s assessment of the U.S. media, Cole wrote, ""Israeli occupation has left 90% of people in Gaza without potable water."" That’s already a step removed from Jebreal -- who didn’t distinguish between access to water, and access to drinking water. (The difference would be in having running water available for cooking and showering). Cole pointed us to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which pointed us to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ (OCHA) office in Palestine. Since July 7, when Israel began its military actions against Hamas, OCHA has published daily reports about the circumstances in the Gaza Strip. OCHA’s latest report, covering the period from July 21 to July 22, estimates that ""1.2 million people have no or very limited access to water or sanitation services due to damage to the electricity system or lack of fuel to run generators"" that provide water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to OCHA, Israel’s bombings are causing definite harm to Gaza’s water systems. The UN has been unable to reach several municipalities because of the threat of bombings, leaving them unable to repair 15 broken wells and six inoperative sewage pumping stages. The Municipality of Gaza reports that they’re pumping less than half the ""required"" water. With a population of 1.8 million, that means that roughly 67 percent of people living in the Gaza Strip could be classified as having ""no or very limited access to water."" That’s less than the 90 percent Jabreal claimed and does not account for people who may have limited access to water. Water potability So in the most literal reading, Jabreal is overstating the statistic. But another way to look at Jebreal’s claim is the way Cole said it, that 90 percent of people in Gaza lack access to potable water. That’s close to being accurate. The only natural source of fresh water in Gaza is an aquifer on the southern part of its coast, and according to a 2009 Amnesty International report, 90 to 95 percent of that water isn’t safe for drinking because of seawater, sewage, and runoff from agriculture. That statistic has since been corroborated by the UN. Before the current crisis, roughly 97 percent of households in Gaza had access to water coming from the aquifer, but that the aquifer alone cannot sustain the Gaza Strip. In April 2013, the head of the Palestinian Water Authority estimated that Palestinians purchase 56 million cubic meters of water a year for drinking to make up for what he calls a ""severe shortage."" And according to the UN, four-fifths of privately sold water isn’t sanitary. What does that all mean? People living in Gaza have access to potable water, but they have to buy it from an outside source. The natural aquifer that people living in Gaza have access to largely is unsafe for drinking. We should note that this problem began well before Israel began bombing. The UN sent Princeton professor Richard Falk to the Gaza Strip in 2013 to report on humanitarian concerns, and Falk wrote that ""the Israeli blockade of Gaza has exacerbated water scarcity."" Among other things, Falk said, Israel takes a ""disproportionate share of water from the coastal aquifer,"" the Israeli-Palestine Joint Water Committee disproportionately rejects Palestinian proposals for water wells, and Israeli military operations often destroy existing Palestinian wells. Our ruling Jebreal claimed that ""90 percent"" of people living in Gaza ""don’t have access even to water,"" in the course of arguing that a significant part of the Israel-Palestine situation goes unreported in the United States. Recent estimates suggest that about 67 percent of people living in Gaza currently have little or no access to running water, a figure lower than Jebreal claimed. But what's true is that 90 to 95 percent of the water from Gaza’s coastal aquifer (their only natural source of fresh water) isn’t suitable for drinking. Jebreal’s claim needs that caveat. As such, we rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/24/rula-jebreal/rula-jebreal-90-people-gaza-dont-have-access-even-/

Fact-checking Rula Jebreal's claim that CNN interviewed 17 Israeli officials vs. 1 Palestinian
","Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal accused CNN of presenting a one-sided picture of the fighting in the Gaza Strip in a heated July 22 interview on MSNBC. A day earlier, she called MSNBC’s coverage ""disgustingly biased"" toward Israel. PunditFact wanted to see if Jebreal had a point, using the evidence she laid out in her interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. (Watch the video for more from their chat.) Jebreal told Hayes that on CNN ""between June 30 and July 10, you had 17 Israeli public officials vs. one"" Palestinian public official. While the statistic doesn’t necessarily prove bias, it does suggest lopsided coverage of the Israel-Gaza crisis. Is Jebreal right? The source of her count Biased coverage of the Israel-Gaza crisis has been a constant cable news subplot. ABC News’ Diane Sawyer acknowledged she mislabeled a Palestinian family assessing damage after an Israeli bomb strike as an Israeli family. NBC News raised questions for pulling reporter Ayman Mohyeldin off the story for a script he wrote about four Gaza children killed by a bomb on a beach because it was allegedly seen as too sympathetic to Palestinians. Jebreal emerged as a Middle Eastern voice in Western media after sharing her experiences about growing up in the West Bank and reporting in Egypt during the Arab Spring. While Jebreal did not respond to our attempts to reach her, we were able to find the source of her claim about CNN. Two years ago, Yousef Munayyer, executive director of The Jerusalem Fund and The Palestine Center, reviewed transcripts of CNN’s coverage of Gaza fighting from Nov. 14, 2012, when Hamas military commander Ahmed Jabari was killed in an Israeli airstrike, until Nov. 21, 2012, the day a cease-fire was announced. During that week, he found officials from Israel appeared on the network 45 times, compared to five appearances by Hamas officials and 20 combined appearances of spokespersons for the Palestine Liberation Organization, Palestinian Legislative Council and Hamas. Munayyer revived the media watching to document the current crisis, and on July 10, Munayyer tweeted new observations of CNN. Munayyer again relied on available transcripts of CNN programming.   In @CNN coverage of Israel/Palestine since 6/29 they have had 35 guests on the topic this is how they break down (1/2) 17 Israeli officials 4 Israel lay persons 1 Palestinian official 4 Palestinian lay persons 8 Unaffiliated 6 Michael Oren appearances (2/2)   In an interview with PunditFact, Munayyer said the exercise shows CNN alarmingly favored Israeli perspectives. Munayyer said a more thorough analysis will be done whenever the conflict ends. Munayyer started analyzing coverage to coincide with the discovery of the bodies of three missing Israeli teens in the West Bank on June 30. (The boys had been missing since June 12, the tipping point of the conflict. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced June 15 that Hamas was responsible ""for a fact."") On July 2, a retaliatory killing of a Palestinian teen escalated the fighting. Four days later, the beating of an American-Palestinian teen by Israeli police made the U.S. airwaves. On July 8, the Israelis launched an official offensive operation known as ""Protective Edge."" When Munayyer tweeted on July 10, the death toll in Gaza had reached at least 78. Who did Munayyer count? For starters, he was looking at appearances, not individual guests. He counted Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, as six Israeli officials because he gave six interviews. Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister’s office, was also counted six times. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner was counted twice and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was counted once. President Shimon Peres was counted twice, bringing Munayyer’s tally to 17 appearances from Israeli officials. (However, Munayyer told us he counted two more appearances from Peres on July 10, the same day as his tweet, upping the total for that period to 19. He says he thinks he sent the tweet without ""closing out"" the July 10 appearances.) Former Israeli ambassador Michael Oren got his own category in Munayyer’s tally because he is now CNN’s Middle East analyst. Conversely, Munayyer counted just one Palestinian official, -- Palestinian Ambassador Maen Areikat, though there were other Palestinian ""lay persons"" invited as CNN guests, including lawyers for the Tampa teen beaten up by Israeli police, and Muyanner himself. Munayyer told us he focused on CNN because it’s more mainstream than MSNBC and Fox News and typically throws more resources on the ground to cover international crises. His team reviewed transcripts for every hour of news coverage to see who was invited to weigh in. He excluded interviews within correspondent’s reports, looking instead for pundits and analysts asked to provide their take of the situation by phone or in-studio. ""The question we’re trying to ask is, who is CNN trying to give a platform on this issue, and is it done in a balanced way?"" Munayyer said. ""My hunch is there’s going to be slight improvement over 2012, but there’s still a lot of work to do to get towards parity."" In the interview with Jebreal, Hayes argued one reason for the uneven coverage is the difficulty of booking a spokesperson for the militant group firing rockets into Israel, Hamas. Still, Munayyer told us, ""that doesn't mean there aren't Palestinian voices who can speak to the situation on the ground from an informed Palestinian perspective that would provide a greater sense of balance to all of the Israeli perspectives that are there."" In a statement, CNN said, ""Our team of correspondents, anchors and contributors have been reporting live from the Mideast fairly across all our platforms. Our reporting represents all sides (Israeli, Palestinian and Hamas) daily. We're comfortable with the Palestinian voices we have included from Gaza, Qatar, Washington, D.C., and New York when supplemented with our countless live reports from Gaza with three correspondents on the ground."" We set out to match up Munayyer’s preliminary analysis with our own, using a computer program we subscribe to called Critical Mention. The program allows us to search video going back 30 days for all major news networks, and it allows us to search using the closed captioning transcript. We scanned the network’s discussion of Israel, Gaza and Palestine from June 29 to July 10, the same window as Munayyer. Our findings suggest Munayyer undercounted the number of Palestinian officials CNN had on air. The following breakdown somewhat mirrors the categories Munayyer outlined, which do not include voices from correspondents’ news packages. There is no perfect way to do this, however, as it’s awkward to classify appearances by people with neutral titles and biased commentary and vice versa. With that note, here’s what we found (and here’s a link to our chart of who appeared when): 20 appearances by Israeli public officials (four of these were replays); 2 appearances by Israeli laymen; 5 appearances by Palestinian officials; 11 appearances by Palestinian laymen, including Munayyer himself; 6 appearances by Michael Oren. While Munayyer found one appearance by a Palestinian official, we found five. Four were by Palestinian Ambassador Maen Areikat, and one was a prerecorded interview with PLO committee member Hanan Ashrawi. Other ""pro-Palestinian"" voices included four appearances by Palestinian-American relatives and lawyers commenting on the case of Tariq Abu Khdeir, the Tampa teen beaten by Israeli security. Former PLO legal adviser and spokesperson Diana Buttu accounts for five ""layman"" appearances, though one appearance was cut before it began when CNN lost the phone connection. Another former PLO adviser and current Brookings Institution fellow, Khaled Elgindy, appeared once on CNN. It’s also worth noting efforts to incorporate more Palestinian voices that fall outside of the timeline Munayyer and Jebreal talked about, closer to daily news. CNN host Jake Tapper, for example, interviewed Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad by phone on July 18. Seem complicated? It is. What drives the disparity Marda Dunsky, a former journalist who teaches at Northwestern University’s Medill School and author of Pens and Swords: How the American Mainstream Media Report the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, said the imbalance of Israeli and Palestinian news sources in most mainstream coverage is well documented, but it does not necessarily imply a deliberate attempt to mislead. It’s an accessibility issue. The shortage of Palestinian voices is more often a symptom of two very different warring societies, she said. ""The Israeli government has people in many different branches who are trained specifically to speak to the media,"" she said. ""The Palestinian government is not as well developed, and as a result it lacks the same depth of field when it comes to official sources."" Buttu, the former PLO spokeswoman and legal adviser, told us in an interview that her CNN appearances are a ""drop in the bucket"" compared to Michael Oren, the network’s on-hand Middle East analyst and former Israeli ambassador to the United States. ""No matter what any Palestinian commentator says on the show, at the end of the day they always have Michael Oren,"" she said. ""That’s quite problematic. Can you imagine if a former Palestinian ambassador of the United States served as a commentator on Fox, don’t you think they would be up in arms in that? It’s accepted as commonplace at CNN."" Buttu’s bigger issue is with the style of questions directed at Palestinian guests, and that she is often asked about the official Palestinian position even though she has not been an official for years. Another thing to remember: Both sides point to bias in reporting. Countering Munayyer’s media-monitoring group are U.S.- and Israel-based organizations such as the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) and HonestReporting. Our ruling Jebreal said, on CNN ""this time around, you have, between June 30 and July 10, you had 17 Israeli public officials vs. one"" Palestinian public official. She is referencing a preliminary tally of Israeli and Palestinian officials’ voices during that time by a pro-Palestinian media watcher. Our tally confirms there was a disparity, but it was not quite as lopsided as Jebreal said. We found 20 appearances by Israeli public officials on CNN compared to 5 appearances by Palestinian officials. Also, the tally is measuring appearances, not the number of officials from each side who appeared. And it's worth noting that any look at the media coverage is incomplete because the story is continuing to unfold. Because of those caveats, we rate Jebreal’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/24/rula-jebreal/fact-checking-rula-jebreals-claim-cnn-had-17-israe/
