Reading too much into McCain's ambitions
","Continuing his efforts to link Sen. John McCain to President Bush's most unpopular economic policies, Sen. Barack Obama is accusing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee of harboring ambitions to overhaul Social Security by, among other things, reviving Bush's attempt to create personal retirement accounts — a plan critics refer to as ""privatization."" ""Privatizing Social Security was a bad idea when George W. Bush proposed it. It's a bad idea today. It would cost a trillion dollars to implement at the front end, and would put the retirement plans of millions of Americans at risk on a volatile Wall Street. That's why I stood up against this plan in the Senate, and that's why I won't stand for it as president,"" Obama said in a speech in Gresham, Ore., on May 18, 2008. ""Sen. McCain's campaign went even further a few weeks ago, suggesting that the best answer to the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or to raise the retirement age."" Though McCain has repeatedly warned that the Social Security system is going broke and needs to be fixed to meet the needs of future generations, he is not proposing anything as ambitious — or as concrete — as what Bush attempted in 2005. At the time, Bush tried to make the case for diverting a portion of the program's payroll taxes to create personal investment accounts in order to reduce retirees' reliance on guaranteed Social Security benefits and keep the system solvent as tens of millions of baby boomers retire. The thinking was private accounts would give younger workers the ability to manage their retirement nest eggs, without government interference. But though Bush did a good job persuading the public the program was in trouble, he couldn't sell them on his solution. Large majorities rejected the idea of revamping a venerable program that has essentially delivered on all of its promises and kept a great number of senior citizens out of poverty. McCain, mindful of the passions Social Security debates tend to arouse, is vague about his plans for the program. His Web site says he wants to supplement the current system with personal accounts but adds the accounts will not be a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. It also notes McCain wants to work with Democrats on a Social Security plan but is prepared to go it alone if they don't want to play. Experts say McCain appears to back allowing workers to invest a portion of their paychecks in new tax-advantaged investments without tapping money currently dedicated to Social Security. ""That's very different from taking money out of Social Security and making a personal account part of today's benefit structure,"" said David C. John, a senior research fellow and Social Security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Politically, it (Obama's charge) is understandable, but factually, what McCain is proposing is different."" Obama's remarks also imply McCain is pondering other steps to shore up the system, such as raising the retirement age (currently 67 for individuals born in 1960 or later) or cutting benefits by slowing the annual indexing of benefits to keep pace with inflation. Both options were raised by McCain's chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, in a March 2008 interview with the  Wall Street Journal.  But Holtz-Eakin added no final decisions have been made. Obama has proposed his own fixes, chiefly raising the cap on workers' wages subject to Social Security taxes, which currently stands at $102,000. The proposal has the appeal of generating more immediate revenue for the system, though projections by the Social Security Administration show it would be only a temporary fix. McCain's campaign has derided the Illinois senator for proposing to raise taxes on middle-income Americans to solve the problem. Obama is largely correct in his assessment of some aspects of Bush's Social Security plan. Estimates put its up-front cost in excess of $1-trillion because it would force the government to borrow money in order to pay current and near-retirees the benefits they are guaranteed under law while new personal accounts are established for younger workers. But because Obama equates McCain's currently vague designs for the program with Bush's failed policy proposal, we judge his statement to be Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6D2B80>],/factchecks/2008/may/22/barack-obama/reading-too-much-into-mccains-ambitions/

He's rich, but that's not his housing fix
","MoveOn.org sent a 10-point e-mail attacking Republican Sen. John McCain. One of its items states: ""He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. … Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a 'second job' and skip their vacations.""
 
MoveOn is correct that the Senate is full of millionaires. Senators had a median net worth of about $1.7-million in 2006, the most recent year for which financial data is available, and 58 percent of the members rated as millionaires, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan research group Center for Responsive Politics.
 
Each senator has to file a financial disclosure statement that includes assets, liabilities and earnings. The catch is that the form does not require exact figures; officials instead check off a range under which each item falls.
 
Based on those filings, the Center for Responsive Politics analyzed the wealth of every member of Congress and ranked them based on averages. Their most recent ranking, based on 2006 disclosure forms, places McCain as the eighth-wealthiest senator, with an average net worth of $36.4-million.
 
Much of McCain's wealth comes from his wife, Cindy McCain, who is chairman of Hensley & Co., her family's Arizona beer distributorship. The Senate disclosure form has a check box for spouses with assets ""over $1-million,"" which is checked several times on McCain's forms. Cindy McCain's worth could exceed $100-million, according to an examination by the Associated Press. The couple files separate tax returns, and only Sen. McCain's return has been made public as of May 22, 2008. The senator's return showed him earning $405,409 in 2007. The campaign initially resisted calls to release Cindy McCain's returns, citing privacy concerns, but released summary pages on May 23, 2008, showing Cindy McCain reported income of $6-million in 2006. Sen. McCain's wealth may be based on his spouse's net worth, but nevertheless he is among the wealthiest senators.
 
John McCain is immediately followed at No. 9 on the center's ranking by Sen. Hillary Clinton, with an average net worth of $30.7-million. Sen. Barack Obama ranked 67th with an average net worth of $799,006. Since this 2006 analysis, however, Obama has joined the millionaire's club. His 2007 tax return showed earnings of $4.2-million, based largely on the sale of his books

Dreams from My Father

and

The Audacity of Hope

.
 
Now we have to take issue with the second part of MoveOn's statement. It points to a Bloomberg news story as evidence for McCain's housing solution. But in that story, it's clear McCain is praising people who already have second jobs and stay current on their mortgages, not suggesting it as a solution to people who are in trouble.
 
The story states: ""Of 80 million U.S. homeowners, 55 million have a mortgage and 51 million of these 'are doing what is necessary -- working a second job, skipping a vacation and managing their budgets,' McCain said. Homeowners should be required to make a down payment on property purchases to ensure they 'have skin in the game.'""
 
About a week after MoveOn's e-mail went out, McCain unveiled a plan to help mortage holders avoid foreclosure, allowing them to apply for new loans at more favorable terms. To be eligible, homeowners must meet the following criteria: hold a non-conventional mortgage taken after 2005; live in their home as a primary residence; prove creditworthiness at the time of the original loan; be either delinquent or otherwise demonstrate that they will be unable to continue to meet their mortgage obligations; and meet the terms of a new 30-year fixed-rate mortgage on the existing home.
 
In this statement, MoveOn makes the case that McCain is a rich millionaire who's out of touch with the everyday concerns of troubled homeowners. MoveOn is right about McCain's wealth, but it takes McCain's words substantially out of context. He was not suggesting that second jobs or canceled vacations could solve the housing crisis. Instead, he was praising people who took extra steps to meet their house payments. That's a significant distortion of what he was saying. So we find MoveOn's statement to be Barely True.
 

Update:

This item has been updated to include information about Cindy McCain's tax return, which was released on May 23, 2008.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'John McCain']","
He has said it again and again
","The issue of whether or not to meet diplomatically with the leaders of enemy nations is clearly shaping into an important wedge issue in the presidential campaign.
 
Sen. John McCain has hammered Sen. Barack Obama for saying he would meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is well known for his anti-America, anti-Israel rhetoric.
 
""Sen. Obama has declared, and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions, likening it to meetings between former American presidents and the leaders of the Soviet Union,"" McCain said in remarks before the National Restaurant Association in Chicago on May 19, 2008.
 
McCain argues this position ""betrays the depth of Sen. Obama's inexperience and reckless judgment.""
 
While McCain has criticized Obama's approach of meeting with leaders of isolated nations in general, McCain has particularly singled out Ahmadinejad.
 
""What does he (Obama) want to talk about with Ahmadinejad, who said that Israel is a stinking corpse?"" McCain asked. ""Who said that he wants to wipe Israel off the map, who is sending the most explosive devices into Iraq killing Americans. What does he want to talk about?""
 
Perhaps sensing political vulnerability on the issue, McCain's campaign fired off a number of press releases accusing the Obama campaign of trying to back off Obama's stated position.
 
When asked in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer how Obama could defend meeting without preconditions with Ahmadinejad, Obama's senior foreign policy adviser, Susan Rice, said Obama had promised only that he'd meet with the appropriate Iranian leadership ""not necessarily Ahmadinejad.""
 
More fuel was added to the debate when Joe Klein of

Time

magazine wrote in his blog that he could find no instance where Obama said he would negotiate specifically, by name, with Ahmadinejad.
 
""He (Obama) did say that he would negotiate with the Iranian leadership -- but, on matters of foreign policy and Iran's nuclear program, the guy in charge is the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,"" Klein noted.
 
""Why doesn't the McCain campaign and other assorted Republicans ever accuse Obama of wanting to negotiate with Khamenei? Well, because Khamenei isn't quite the flagrant anti-Semite Ahmadinejad is ... and, as we keep hearing, Obama has a Jewish problem.""
 
To be sure, when Obama raises this issue -- which he does often on the stump -- he usually says, generically, that he will meet diplomatically with the ""leaders"" of America's enemies.
 
For example, when asked in a press conference in Watertown, S.D., on May 16, 2008, about the McCain campaign accusing him of trying to distance himself from comments about meeting with the leaders of rogue nations, Obama said he hasn't distanced himself at all.
 
""I say that in every town hall meeting that we have and every rally,"" Obama said. ""What I have said is that I will meet with not just our allies and our friends but I will initiate tough diplomacy with our enemies. That includes Syria, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela. I would meet with them and I would meet with them without preconditions although with preparation. I would present to them very clearly what my expectations would be in terms of them changing their behavior. If it was in the case of Iran, stop threatening Israel, stand down on nuclear weapons development; stop funding Hamas and Hezbollah and stop stirring up problems inside of Iraq. If they are willing to change behavior, then, we would offer inducements and benefits diplomatically. If they don't, we will continue to ratchet sanctions and isolations on Iran. That has been a consistent policy that I have presented throughout. There are no contradictions. I have no idea where it is that they are suggesting that somehow there has been a change in policy.
 
But has Obama said specifically that he'd meet with Ahmadinejad?
 
We could find no public statements where Obama neatly says, ""I will meet with Ahmadinejad."" But we believe there are some instances where that was the substance of Obama's words.
 
One example came in a press conference in New York City on Sept. 24, 2007.
 
Question: ""Senator, you've said before that you'd meet with President Ahmadinejad. … Would you still meet with him today?""
 
""Nothing's changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries,"" Obama responded. ""I find many of President Ahmadinejad's statements odious and I've said that repeatedly. And I think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that don't have American interests at heart. But what I also believe is that, as John F. Kennedy said, we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate. And by us listening to the views even of those who we violently disagree with – that sends a signal to the world that we are going to turn the page on the failed diplomacy that the Bush Administration has practiced for so long.""
 
The McCain campaign provided snippets of news accounts of that press conference that left little doubt how the press interpreted Obama's comments at the time. Check out these headlines: ""Obama Stood His Ground Monday On His Controversial Remarks Earlier This Year That He Would Meet With Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"" (from CNN); and ""Obama: I Would Still Meet With Ahmadinejad"" (from CBS News).
 
In a Nov. 11, 2007, interview on NBC's

Meet the Press,

Obama again mentioned Ahmadinejad when discussing his open-door policy.
 
""Part of the reason it's important for us to talk to countries we don't like and leaders we don't like, it's not that I think that in a conversation with somebody like Ahmadinejad that I'm going to somehow change his mind on everything, but what we do is, we send a signal to other leadership in Iran, to the Iranian people and to the world community that we are listening and that we are willing to try to resolve conflicts peacefully.""
 
Host Tim Russert asked if Obama was afraid of being used in a propaganda way.
 
""I've got to say I'm not afraid of losing a propaganda war to somebody like Ahmadinejad,"" Obama said. ""You know, strong countries and strong presidents speak with their adversaries.""
 
In those contexts, Obama clearly counts Ahmadinejad among those with whom he would meet. We rate McCain's statement True.

McCain twists Obama's words
","In trying to portray Sen. Barack Obama as a neophyte when it comes to international relations, Sen. John McCain seized on some comparisons Obama made between the relative threat of Iran now vs. the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
 
""Senator Obama claimed that the threat Iran poses to our security is 'tiny' compared to the threat once posed by the former Soviet Union,"" McCain said before the National Restaurant Association in Chicago on May 19, 2008. ""Obviously, Iran isn't a superpower and doesn't possess the military power the Soviet Union had. But that does not mean that the threat posed by Iran is insignificant.
 
""On the contrary, right now Iran provides some of the deadliest explosive devices used in Iraq to kill our soldiers. They are the chief sponsor of Shia extremists in Iraq, and terrorist organizations in the Middle East. ... Should Iran acquire nuclear weapons, that danger would become very dire, indeed. They might not be a superpower, but the threat the government of Iran poses is anything but 'tiny.' ""
 
The jab provides the backdrop for McCain's repeated criticism of Obama for saying that he would meet without preconditions with leaders of rogue nations, like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
 
Here's the full context of Obama's remarks in Pendelton, Ore., on May 18, 2008:
 
""Strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries,"" Obama said. ""That's what Kennedy did with Khrushchev. That's what Reagan did with Gorbachev. That's what Nixon did with Mao. I mean, think about it. Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying we're going to wipe you off the planet. And ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war, and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the Berlin Wall. Now, that has to be the kind of approach that we take.
 
""You know, Iran, they spend one-one hundredth of what we spend on the military. If Iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us, they wouldn't stand a chance. And we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen. That doesn't mean we agree with them on everything. We might not compromise on any issues, but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest, and we can reduce some of the tensions that have caused us so many problems around the world.""
 
The first part of McCain's recap of Obama's quote puts the context accurately, that Obama noted the threat from Iran was tiny ""compared to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union.""
 
But McCain veers off the rails when he takes the next step, claiming that Obama characterized the threat from Iran as tiny or insignificant. Obama never said that.
 
Later in the same day, Obama issued a retort to McCain's comments: ""So John McCain, he said, 'Oh, Obama doesn't understand the threat of Iran.' I understand the threat of Iran. But what I know is that the Soviet Union had the ability to destroy the world several times over, had satellites spanning the globe, had huge masses of conventional military power all directed at destroying us, and so I've made it clear for years that the threat from Iran is grave, but what I've said is that we should not just talk to our friends, we should be willing to engage our enemies as well, that's what diplomacy is all about.
 
""So let me be absolutely clear: Iran is a grave threat. It has an illicit nuclear program, it supports terrorism across the region and militias in Iraq, it threatens Israel's existence, it denies the Holocaust. But this threat has grown, primarily – and this is the irony - the reason Iran is so much more powerful now than it was a few years ago is because of the Bush-McCain policy of fighting an endless war in Iraq and refusing to pursue direct diplomacy with Iran.""
 
This isn't the first time Obama has talked about the grave threat posed by Iran. Obama has repeatedly characterized it as such during his campaign.
 
Still, Reginald Dale, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Obama's comparisons of the threats posed by Iran versus the Soviet Union during the Cold War are misguided.
""Iran is a completely different threat,"" Dale said.
 
During the Cold War, both sides had stockpiles of nuclear weapons. There was mutually assured destruction.
 
""They could negotiate like people who are equals,"" Dale said. ""Neither side wanted to fire first. Both sides knew, more or less, how the other would behave.""
 
That provided some stability, he said. Iran, on the other hand, presents an ""asymmetrical"" warfare problem, he said.
 
""It's not one super power facing another super power,"" Dale said.
 
Iran is attempting to develop nuclear weapons, Dale said, while unapologetically supporting terrorist groups like Hamas, who would have little hesitation about setting off a nuclear weapon in the United States.
 
""You could definitely say it's more dangerous than the Cold War,"" he said.
 
One could argue whether it's wise to meet with leaders of rogue nations. One could also debate whether Obama wrongly downplayed the threat posed by Iran. But Obama never said the threat from Iran was ""tiny"" or ""insignificant,"" only that the threat was tiny in comparison to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union. In fact, Obama has repeatedly called Iran a grave threat. We rule McCain's statement False.

Obama goes too far to make his point
","Speaking to garment workers in Missouri on May 13, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama said he would fight for real economic improvements ""instead of gimmicks like a tax – a gas tax holiday – that every economist says will just go into the pockets of the oil companies.""
 
He was referring to proposals by Sens. John McCain and Hillary Clinton to suspend the 18.4 cent-a-gallon federal gas tax for the summer travel season.
 
It's true that economists have found oil companies don't pass the full benefit of gas tax holidays on to consumers. For that and other reasons, the vast majority of economists who have opined on the issue – in fact, every single one that we could find – oppose the holiday (aside from one outlier who liked it because it would benefit the oil industry). In fact, 308 economists have signed a

letter

opposing the holiday.
 
But to say

every

economist believes the break would

just

go to the oil companies is an exaggeration. Even harsh critics of a gas tax holiday said consumers would see some benefit. Obama takes a fact in his favor – that the nation's economists have come down on his side in the gas tax debate – and stretches it a bit too far.
 
Obama made his comments in a freewheeling question-and-answer session in Cape Girardeau, Mo., but his campaign has issued similarly unequivocal claims in television ads. ""Experts say it'll just boost oil industry profits,"" a narrator intoned in

one ad

early this month.
 
A 2006

study

of a state gas tax holiday in Illinois in 2000 found that three-fifths of the benefit went to consumers. In the case of a federal gas tax break, drivers would reap a smaller share, but would still probably see more than half the benefit, said Joseph Doyle Jr., co-author of the study and an associate professor of economics at MIT. ""My best guess is if you got rid of the 19-cent tax the price would go down by 10 cents,"" Doyle said.
 
Other studies suggest a similar result. In a 2007 paper in the B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy (published by the Berkeley Electronic Press), economists Hayley Chouinard and Jeffery Perloff found that consumers and oil companies share the burden of the federal gasoline tax – that is, consumers end up paying 9 to 12 cents of the 18.4 cent tax and oil companies pay the rest. That suggests that if the tax were lifted, consumers might see a price reduction in that range over time. In an interview, Perloff said they had studied a 20-year time frame, and cautioned that his findings might not provide an accurate picture of what would happen during a temporary, three-month gas holiday.
 
William Polley, an assistant professor of economics at Western Illinois University who reviewed much of the relevant economic scholarship on his

blog

, wrote that ""it is safe to say that we (economists) stand firm in agreement that this (gas tax holiday) is a bad, bad idea."" But he also said: ""The benefit to the consumer would probably not be

literally

zero.""
 
While Obama's statement accurately expresses the dominant view of the low worth of this gas tax proposal, he rhetorically overstates his point. For that, we rule Half True.

McCain's opposed, but he's not alone
","Seizing on an intensifying congressional debate over veterans benefits, Sen. Barack Obama is accusing Sen. John McCain of shortchanging individuals who volunteered to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan by resisting an effort to expand educational aid for ex-service members.
 
At issue is a proposal to give veterans educational benefits equal to the highest tuition rates of a public college or university in their state, as well as a monthly housing stipend determined by geographical area. Originally the subject of a standalone bill by Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., the plan has been bundled by Democratic leaders into an emergency war spending bill for fiscal 2008 and 2009 that now is under consideration in the House.
 
The proposal resonated with lawmakers eager to demonstrate continued support for active duty troops and veterans, but posed a quandary for fiscal conservatives concerned about ever higher costs as more individuals leave active duty.
 
McCain, echoing Bush administration objections, says the proposed benefit is so generous that it could actually encourage service members to leave the military as soon as they qualify, thereby undercutting recruitment and retention efforts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, provided some ammunition for this line of argument in an analysis for Senate Budget Committee Republicans released on May 8, estimating the plan would increase direct spending by $51.8-billion through 2018.
 
Obama, however, maintains it's important to provide robust levels of aid to returning service members at a time when rising tuition is pricing thousands of Americans out of a college education. And he's depicting McCain as a stubborn holdout, willing to turn his back on veterans to uphold his fiscally conservative principles.
 
""I have great respect for John McCain's service to this country … but he's one of the few senators of either party who oppose this bill because he thinks it's too generous,"" Obama said in a May 12 speech in Charleston, W.Va.
 
As we write this, negotiations continue on Capitol Hill to find a version of the bill that will be palatable to all sides. But we don't need to follow the ups and downs of the legislative efforts to effectively judge the accuracy of Obama's remarks on the original bill.
 
Obama says McCain is ""one of the few"" senators who considered that original legislation to be too generous. In doing so, Obama neglects to mention that McCain is one of 21 Republicans who, with independent Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, lined up behind an alternative proposal by Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., that would expand the government's Montgomery G.I. Bill program by increasing a monthly education stipend to $1,500 from the current $1,100 maximum. The stipend for individuals who complete at least 12 years of service would rise to $2,000. Graham's plan offered other benefits, as well, though it did not guarantee money for a full college education.
 
The Graham plan was defeated, but 42 senators voted for it. That, on top of the fact that 21 other senators were early proponents of the cheaper alternatives puts McCain in the company of more than ""a few."" With that in mind, we conclude that Obama's description of McCain as some kind of rare dissenter in discussions to improve education benefits for veterans to be Barely True.

Waterboarding one aspect of larger measure
","
MoveOn.org has targeted Sen. John McCain in a lengthy 10-point e-mail it sent to supporters, urging them to forward it to everyone they know.
 
In its third point, MoveOn brought up the issue of torture:
 
""His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban,"" the e-mail states.
 
We'll agree with MoveOn that McCain is known as a vocal opponent of torture. He is the rare elected official who has personal experience on this issue: He was tortured when he was a prisoner of war for 5 years in Vietnam.
 
McCain has also been persistent in arguing that waterboarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, is torture. ""It's in violation of the Geneva Conventions. It's in violation of existing law,"" he said at a November 2007 debate in St. Petersburg, Fla.
 
The Bush administration, however, has said that waterboarding is legal under certain circumstances. (It will not specify publicly what those circumstances are.)
 
The Central Intelligence Agency has publicly acknowledged waterboarding. Michael Hayden, head of the CIA, said three people have been waterboarded since Sept. 11, 2001, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, thought to be the mastermind behind the attacks. The CIA has not waterboarded anyone for the past five years, Hayden said.
 
MoveOn's e-mail claiming that McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding refers to a measure passed in February 2008 that would have forced the CIA to follow the Army Field Manual, which specifically forbids waterboarding, as well as other actions: forcing a detainee to perform sexual acts or pose sexually, placing hoods over the heads of detainees, threatening detainees with dogs, or using temperature extremes to cause physical trauma, among other things.
 
McCain opposed the measure on the grounds that the CIA should not have to follow the same guidelines as the Army, and it should have the flexibility to use valid techniques not mentioned in the field manual, McCain said.
 
""None of those techniques would entail violating the Detainee Treatment Act, which said that cruel, inhumane and degrading treatments are prohibited,"" he told reporters in February, defending his vote.
 
Before his vote, McCain had praised the standards set out in the field manual. ""I would hope that we would understand, my friends, that life is not

24

and Jack Bauer,"" McCain said at the debate in St. Petersburg, Fla. ""Life is interrogation techniques which are humane and yet effective. And I just came back from visiting a prison in Iraq. The army general there said that the techniques under the Army Field Manual are working and working effectively, and he didn't think they need to do anything else.""
 
MoveOn's statement that the bill McCain opposed ""bans waterboarding"" is a problematic summation. The bill would have banned waterboarding as one of its effects, but it also would have made other changes to how the CIA conducts interrogations and required the CIA to follow the Army Field Manual. It was not a straightforward up-or-down vote on waterboarding alone.
 
It's true that McCain voted against the measure, it passed anyway and Bush vetoed it. We couldn't find any examples of McCain going out of his way to congratulate Bush. Given the many nuances of the bill, we find MoveOn's claim to be Half True.

Government report backs up Obama
","During the Q&A; portion of a town hall meeting in Cape Girardeau, Miss., on May 13, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama talked about the need to focus on and provide more troops in Afghanistan.
 
""If we're going to catch (Osama) bin Laden, or most importantly, break down al-Qaida ... we've got to have the capacity to put more troops in Afghanistan ... both our troops and NATO troops.
 
""Right now, we don't have enough troops and NATO hasn't provided enough troops because they are still angry about us going into Iraq.""
 
With the addition of some 7,500 Marines in Afghanistan in early 2008, there are now about 32,500 American troops in Afghanistan; plus an additional 28,000 NATO troops.
 
Late in 2007, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates made several public, but largely fruitless, pleas to NATO countries for the commitment of more troops in Afghanistan.
 
A Congressional Research Service report for Congress, submitted Jan. 7, 2008, states that Gates ""acknowledged that domestic political problems are preventing some allies from increasing their force levels in Afghanistan. Allied government officials state privately that their populations are reluctant to follow the Bush Administration, largely due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and subsequent criticism of the United States in Europe and the Middle East.""
 
Later, the report cites a ""highly respected"" German Marshall Fund poll that found a sharp decline in European public opinion toward U.S. leadership due to the U.S. policy in the Iraq war.
 
The report concludes that, ""This decline is complicating the effort of allied governments to sustain support for the ... mission"" in Afghanistan.
 
Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a professor of International Relations at Georgetown University, said there is some truth in Obama's statement.
 
""The Iraq war has soured many European electorates on U.S. foreign policy,"" Kupchan said. ""Even though there was a groundswell of support for the war in Afghanistan, there is a certain amount of skittishness about Bush and his foreign policy.""
 
That creates a situation where the United States is finding it more difficult to garner support for more NATO troops. But that's not the only reason, he said. There is a widespread belief that the United States has not balanced the use of force in Iraq with reconstruction and assistance.
 
There is a feeling, he said, that the United States has ""overmilitarized"" the Iraq war, Kupchan said, that there are too many civilian casualties, ""that we are dropping too many bombs and not winning over as many hearts and minds.""
 
Many NATO countries also are uncomfortable with involvement in a war thousands of miles away.
""I think it (Obama's comment) is fair as long as one realizes that's one of several factors when looking at the shortfall of NATO contributions,"" Kupchan said. ""It is one of several issues in play.""
 
The British House of Commons' Defence Committee, in a report on British operations in Afghanistan, warned last summer that troop shortages in Afghanistan threatened to undermine the campaign, and that the size of NATO forces should be considerably greater.
 
So Obama is on solid footing when he says more troops are needed in Afghanistan. In a Pentagon news briefing in July 2007, Gen. Dan K. McNeill, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, said as much, calling the international military mission ""under-resourced.""
 
And even a U.S. government report concluded that European criticism of the U.S. war in Iraq has made some NATO countries less willing to commit troops to Afghanistan. While some NATO experts say that is not the only reason, they agree it is a big one. We rate Obama's statement True.

"['National', 'Military', 'John McCain']","
In protest, Obama voted against
","Responding to Sen. Barack Obama's assertions that he is shortchanging veterans by opposing a Democratic plan to expand education aid, Sen. John McCain's camp is depicting the Illinois senator as a lawmaker who has already voted against a key war funding measure that would have improved health services for veterans.
 
On May 12, 2008, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds singled out Obama's May 24, 2007 vote against a fiscal 2007 emergency war spending measure to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, saying it violated Obama's oft-stated dictum that it would be irresponsible to vote against funding troops in the field.
 
""It is absurd for Barack Obama to question John McCain's commitment to America's veterans when Obama himself voted against our nation's veterans and troops in the field during a time of war,"" Bounds said.
 
The McCain campaign went on to release a factually accurate breakdown of nearly $1.8-billion worth of veterans health funding provisions in the $120-billion bill, including $595-million for medical facilities, $326-million of construction funding for Veterans Administration-identified needs, $250-million for administration of the VA health system and separate line items for mental health services, counseling, trauma support teams, prosthetics and rehabilitation programs.
 
It's important to note that Obama didn't explicitly oppose any of this spending. Rather, he got involved in a contentious battle over whether to include language in the bill that would set a timetable for combat troop withdrawals from Iraq. Democratic leaders in the House and Senate initially viewed the addition of this condition as an effective way of challenging the Bush administration's war policies. But they soon backed down in the face of staunch GOP opposition, worried that they would be accused of delaying needed aid to troops in the field by not sending Bush a bill he could sign quickly.
 
On May 2, Bush vetoed an earlier spending draft that contained timetables for troop withdrawals, saying it ""infringes upon the powers vested in the Presidency by the Constitution.""
 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Democrats could try again when Congress took up a fiscal 2008 defense authorization bill. But Obama and 13 other holdouts (in all, 10 Democrats, three Republicans and one independent) registered their displeasure with a ""clean"" funding bill that didn't address troop withdrawals by voting against the measure. ""We should not give the president a blank check to continue down this same, disastrous path,"" Obama said in a statement on the day of the vote.
 
Obama has, in fact, shown an interest in improving military benefits, working in the spring of 2005 to insert language in a defense authorization bill reversing a policy that required soldiers receiving outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to pay for meals.
 
Through his proxies, McCain fails to put Obama's vote in the proper context, so we cannot rate this statement True. Still, even though Obama had his reasons, the fact remains that he voted against the bill, which leads us to conclude that McCain's statement is Mostly True.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Numbers don't add up
","Facing long odds in her quest to win the Democratic nomination, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been making the case that she would be a stronger candidate in the general election because she has won primaries and caucuses in important states.
 
""The White House is won in the swing states, and I am winning the swing states,"" she said in a speech in Charleston, W.Va. on May 13, 2008, after she defeated Sen. Barack Obama in the West Virginia primary.
 
Clinton is right that a handful of swing states are crucial to winning the general election, but her math doesn't add up.
 
First, a caveat: Just because a candidate wins a primary in a given state does not mean the candidate has an upper hand in that state in the general election.
 
""That's the most important fact here,"" said Amy Walter, editor of

National Journal's

""Hotline,"" a political Web site. ""Primary success in a state is no indicator of future success.""
 
That's because primary elections are very different than general elections. Primary voters tend to be more partisan and more active in politics, so candidates adapt their messages to appeal to them. In a general election, the candidates can usually depend on support from their own party, so they focus more on moderates and independents.
 
Also, many states lean toward one party, so a victory or loss in a primary does not indicate how the state will go in November. For example, Obama lost Massachusetts to Clinton. Yet if he is the nominee, he is a strong favorite because Massachusetts has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1984.
 
Still, Clinton argues that she is more popular with core Democrats, the white working-class voters who she says will be the party's base in the swing states. So let's examine whether she has indeed won more of those states.
 
Pundits and campaign strategists generally agree that there are about 14 battleground states -- Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. For our purposes, we'll examine all except Michigan because Obama was not on the primary ballot there. But it's also important to point out that the candidates agreed not to campaign in Florida, and some Democrats don't consider the Florida results a valid measurement of Obama's strength in the state.
 
Clinton has won the primaries or caucuses in six of them -- Florida, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, New Mexico and Nevada. Obama has also won six -- Virginia, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado and Washington. And he's favored to win Oregon's primary on May 20.
 
So to recap the score:
 
Clinton 6, Obama 6 (plus Oregon if he wins as expected).
 
That doesn't sound like she's ""winning"" the swing states. She's exaggerating her strength in those states, so we find her statement to be Barely True.

"['National', 'Religion', 'MoveOn.org']","
True, but Hagee has since recanted
","
In an e-mail to supporters, the liberal group MoveOn.org listed reasons people should not support Sen. John McCain for president.
 
""McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years,"" the e-mail said. ""McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church 'the Antichrist' and a 'false cult.'""
 
Some of MoveOn's points are correct. McCain has accepted an endorsement from Hagee, an evangelical minister with a national following. Since MoveOn's e-mail went out, however, Hagee has renounced his previous controversial statements.
 
Hagee heads the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, with 17,000 members. He has a nationally syndicated television show, John Hagee Today, a sprawling Web site and numerous books. His dominant issue is the defense of Israel: He founded the advocacy group Christians United for Israel in 2006, and his book

Jerusalem Countdown

takes grim satisfaction in predicting a nuclear confrontation in the Middle East with the United States and Israel on one side and Iran on the other.
 
Hagee's endorsement of McCain on Feb. 27, 2008, set off several rounds of controversy. The day after the endorsement, the Catholic League called Hagee an anti-Catholic bigot and lamented McCain's connection to him. The Catholic League monitors anti-Catholic bias and emphasizes Catholic teaching on abortion and other moral issues. It pointed to a video of Hagee in which Hagee discusses the Book of Revelation and the Catholic Church. Hagee clearly uses the words ""Antichrist"" and ""false cult"" as he discusses the Catholic Church, the Crusades and the Holocaust. (His statements are a little confusing; watch the video here.)
 
Hagee said he was only criticizing historical acts of anti-Semitism by the Catholic Church, not expressing anti-Catholic hatred. But Catholic League president Bill Donahue said Hagee's excuses weren't credible and continued calls for McCain to distance himself.
 
During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on April 20, McCain said he still welcomed Hagee's endorsement but strongly condemned ""any comments that he made about the Catholic church.""
 
The Catholic League was satisfied with McCain's comments but continued to criticize Hagee. On May 13, Hagee released a letter sent directly to Donahue in which Hagee expressed regret for his previous statements about the Catholic Church. Donahue accepted the apology.
 
""The tone of Hagee's letter is sincere,"" Donahue said in a statement. ""He wants reconciliation and he has achieved it. Indeed, the Catholic League welcomes his apology.""
 
While the back-and-forth was going on about the Catholic Church, Hagee also retracted his previous comments about Hurricane Katrina. Hagee had said in an interview on Sept 16, 2006:
 
""The newspaper carried the story in our local area that was not carried nationally that there was to be a homosexual parade on the Monday that the Katrina came, and the promise of that parade was that it was going to reach a level of sexuality never demonstrated before in any of the other Gay Pride parades. So I believe that the judgment of God is a very real thing. I know that there are people who demure from that, but I believe that the Bible teaches that when you violate the law of God, that God brings punishment sometimes before the day of judgment, and I believe that the Hurricane Katrina was, in fact, the judgment of God against the city of New Orleans.""
 
A publicist for Hagee sent us this statement dated April 25, 2008:
 
""As a believing Christian, I see the hand of God in everything that happens here on earth, both the blessings and the curses. But ultimately neither I nor any other person can know the mind of God concerning Hurricane Katrina. I should not have suggested otherwise.""
 
Hagee's modest backtracking isn't that surprising, said John C. Green, a senior fellow in religion and politics at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, a nonpartisan research group that does not take positions in policy debates. Hard-charging rhetoric against the Catholic Church and other religions such as Judaism or Islam used to be more common among evangelical leaders, but it's now falling out of favor, Green said.
 
""Most evangelicals today don't use that kind of harsh language, because they've discovered it has negative effects,"" Green said. ""It's hard to make converts when you use that harsh language with them, and they've also realized it's not appropriate.""
 
Of course, we can't definitively rule on whether Hagee's new statements represent a true change of heart or just a political repositioning.
 
MoveOn's attack was true when the group sent out the e-mail; it was only later that Hagee retracted his comments. With that significant caveat, we rate MoveOn's statement True.
 

UPDATE:

On May 22, 2008, McCain rejected the pastor's endorsement, after audio of Hagee preaching, reportedly during the 1990s, was posted to the Internet. In the recording, Hagee implied that Hilter and the Holocaust were part of God's plan to create the state of Israel. (Listen to the

audio here

.)
 
McCain said Hagee's comments were ""deeply offensive and indefensible,"" and ""I did not know of them before Reverend Hagee's endorsement, and I feel I must reject his endorsement as well.""
 
Hagee, meanwhile, issued a statement saying that he was withdrawing his endorsement and that critics were distorting his views.
 
""I am tired of these baseless attacks and fear that they have become a distraction in what should be a national debate about important issues,"" Hagee said on May 22, 2008. ""I have therefore decided to withdraw my endorsement of Sen. McCain for president effective today, and to remove myself from any active role in the 2008 campaign.""

Parsley and McCain relationship appears political, not spiritual
","
In an e-mail to supporters, the liberal group MoveOn.org attacked Sen. John McCain for his ties to leaders of the religious right.
 
""McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his 'spiritual guide,' Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a 'false religion.'""
 
It's true that Parsley has endorsed McCain, and Parsley has made strident statements about Islam.
 
Parsley is an Ohio minister who heads the World Harvest Church and an affiliated Bible college based in Columbus. He hosts a nationally syndicated television show and has authored books including

Silent No More

, a collection of Parsley's opinions on political and moral issues, and

Culturally Incorrect

, which urges Christians toward greater civic and political involvement. An advocacy group he founded, the Center for Moral Clarity, promotes his opinions on conservative social issues.
 
The MoveOn e-mail quotes Parsley's words from

Silent No More

:
 
""I cannot tell you how important it is that we understand the true nature of Islam, that we see it for what it really is. In fact, I will tell you this: I do not believe our country can truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand our historical conflict with Islam. I know this statement sounds extreme, but I do not shrink from its implications. The fact is that America was founded, in part, with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed, and I believe that Sept. 11, 2001, was a generational call to arms that we can no longer ignore.""
 
The book further explains that the Allah who inspired Mohammed was a demon spirit, that Islam enslaves women, and that it converts people by deception. (Needless to say, many Muslims would disagree with this description, and these charges are not what we're fact-checking here.)
 
A spokesman for Parsley said MoveOn took his words out of context and pointed to a Frequently Asked Questions page on the Web site of Parsley's Center for Moral Clarity.
 
""Q. Does Pastor Parsley hate Muslims?""
 
""Pastor Parsley loves people and hates the belief systems that keep them from the truth. Islam is a false, dangerous religion. Peace-loving Muslims need the full support of all Christians.
 
""There are two divisions of Muslims in the world – peace-loving and radical Muslim extremists. In fact, many peace-loving Muslims are appalled at what is being done in the name of their religion. They were horrified by the events of September 11, 2001, and they are appalled by the actions of suicide bombers across the world. Christians must provide understanding, cooperation, support, and friendship to peace-loving Muslims throughout the world who share our desire for democracy and peace.""
 
McCain, called Parsley ""a spiritual guide"" -- not his spiritual guide -- while onstage at a campaign event in Cincinnati on Feb. 26, 2008. McCain was welcoming some of the dignitaries who were on stage with him when he said, ""I'm very honored today to have one of the truly great leaders in America, a moral compass, a spiritual guide, Pastor Rod Parsley.""
 
McCain's campaign said soon after that event that McCain does not meet regularly with Parsley, and a spokesman for Parsley said McCain has never attended services at World Harvest Church. Given that context, it seems likely that McCain meant he and Parsley shared similar values rather than Parsley personally advised him.
 
People who read MoveOn's e-mail would probably think Parsley advises McCain on spiritual matters, and we find no evidence that that is the case. Rather, it seems more like a garden-variety political endorsement. Also, Parsley wrote that America was founded in part to see Islam destroyed, and MoveOn doesn't mention that caveat. MoveOn is right that Parsley has strong views opposing the religion. When we balance these facts against each other, we come to the conclusion that MoveOn's statement is Half-True.
 

UPDATE:

On May 22, 2008, McCain rejected Parsley's endorsement at the same time he rejected the endorsement of another minister, John Hagee. (For details on the Hagee controversy,

see our statement update here

.) A report from ABC News about Parsley had aired that morning discussing Parsley's views on Islam.
 
""I believe there is no place for that kind of dialogue in America,"" McCain said of Parsley.

2000, yes, but not 2004
","Setting the table for her resounding victory in West Virginia's primary, Sen. Hillary Clinton pumped up the state's role in the presidential election at a campaign stop in Logan.
 
""If West Virginia had voted for our Democratic nominee in 2000 and 2004, we wouldn't have had to put up with George Bush for the last 7 years,"" she said May 12, 2008, as reported by MSNBC.com's ""First Read"" blog. ""I am going to work as hard as I can between now and the time the polls close tomorrow, because I want to earn your support.""
 
Really? Five electoral college votes from a state of nearly 2-million people could have prevented the George W. Bush administration? Here we thought it was 537 popular votes in Florida.
 
Turns out, Clinton is half right.
 
In the bitterly contested election of 2000, Bush won the state of West Virginia with 336,475 votes to Vice President Al Gore's 295,497. That earned Bush 5 electoral college votes.
 
Now, Bush won the electoral college — and the presidency — 271-266. Funny how that's a 5-vote difference. If you subtract 5 electoral college votes from Bush's total, and add 5 electoral college votes to Gore's total, indeed the result is flipped, 271-266, in Gore's favor. And the world embraces the climate change crisis years earlier.
 
(Of course, many would argue a more significant factor was Florida's 27 electoral votes — in dispute until Dec. 12, 2000, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bush, saying it was too late for another recount.)
 
The 2004 election is another matter completely. On the simple question of the math, Clinton is wrong. Bush defeated Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, 286-251 in the electoral college. West Virginia's 5 votes wouldn't have put a dent in Bush's 35-vote margin.
 
But there's something incongruous about Clinton extending her argument to include the 2004 election. If Gore had won in 2000, then Bush almost certainly wouldn't have been running against Kerry in 2004 and who knows what the electoral map would have looked like in a Gore re-election race.
 
Clinton is right that Bush wouldn't be president if West Virginia had gone for Gore in 2000. That alone would have prevented 7 years of a Bush administration.
 
By raising the 2004 election, though, Clinton ruins her perfectly accurate argument. Suggesting that West Virginia voters had the same chance to defeat Bush in 2004 that they had in 2000 is just wrong, which is how we end up at Half True.

"['Crime', 'Texas', 'Lone Star Project']","
PAC says, like Todd Akin and Paul Ryan, all Texas Republicans in U.S. House cosponsored bill trying to distinguish “forcible rape”
","
Amid bipartisan outcry over a Missouri Republican’s reference to ""legitimate rape,"" a pro-Democratic political action committee drew attention to legislation supposedly containing similar language.

""Every single member of the Texas Republican congressional delegation cosponsored the same bill supported by (U.S. Rep. Todd) Akin and Paul Ryan that attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults,"" said a report circulated Aug. 23, 2012, by the Lone Star Project.

PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed in an Aug. 22, 2012, item that Akin and Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee and Wisconsin House member, co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act in July 2010 and again in January 2011.

Both versions were written by U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and referred to ""forcible"" rape; that word was removed from the 2011 bill during congressional deliberations.

In all versions of Smith’s legislation, rape or ""forcible"" rape was mentioned in a section defining exceptions -- that is, cases in which using federal money to pay for abortions would not be prohibited.

Lone Star Project researcher Erik Ruselowski emailed us (and we double-checked) that part of the version introduced in the House in 2011:
  
The limitations established in sections 301, 302, 303, and 304 shall not apply to an abortion -- 
(1) if the pregnancy occurred because the pregnant female was the subject of an act of forcible rape or, if a minor, an act of incest; or 
(2) in the case where the pregnant female suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the pregnant female in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. 
  
According to the text (2010’s HR 5939 and 2011’s HR 3) and numerous news stories about the act we read in the Nexis news database, the main purpose of the legislation was not redefining rape but limiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion.

Seeking background on the term ""forcible,"" we learned that forcible rape was and is listed as a specific crime in some states and, according to a Jan. 6, 2012, Justice Department press release, was from 1927 through 2011 a part of the definition of rape for purposes of the Uniform Crime Report data that law enforcement agencies supply to the FBI.

The ""longstanding, narrow definition of forcible rape,"" according to the release, ""is ‘the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will’ "" -- penile penetration of the vagina despite physical resistance by the victim. The new, broader definition is: ""The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.""

FBI Assistant Director David Cuthbertson said in the release, ""This change will give law enforcement the ability to report more complete rape offense data, as the new definition reflects the vast majority of state rape statutes.""

An Aug. 23, 2012, New York Times news story about Akin’s comment said, ""States have been adjusting their definitions of rape for the past 30 years, many moving away from the insistence on evidence of force because most rapes do not result in harm to the woman separate from the act itself.""

So, what did the failed legislation cited by the Lone Star Project propose to do?

Since 1976, federal health appropriations acts have included a modification commonly called the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal dollars to pay for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life.

Republicans said the Democratic-steered federal health care overhaul, signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010, did not provide enough protections against federal money being used to pay for abortions. One focus of the concerns was state-level insurance ""exchanges"" established by the act, in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people not insured through employers.

A Jan. 1, 2011, Boston Globe news story quoted Smith as saying that without an additional change in law, ""we are setting up a funding scheme to pay for abortions.""

According to the congressional database, Smith’s 2010 bill was short-lived and his amended 2011 bill won approval in the Republican-majority House by a 251-175 vote, with all Republicans and 16 Democrats in favor, but stalled in the Democratic-majority Senate.

Notably, the description of rape in Smith’s proposal went farther than the Hyde Amendment, which did not use the word ""forcible"" but stated simply that abortions are exempted from the bill’s funding restrictions when the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life or is the result of incest or rape.

Soon after Smith introduced the bill Jan. 20, 2011, critics called attention to its use of the phrase ""forcible rape.""  A Feb. 1, 2011, Washington Post news story reported that women’s groups objected to the word ""forcible"" in HR 3: ""Critics say the modifier could distinguish it from other kinds of sexual assault that are typically recognized as rape, including statutory rape and attacks that occur because of drugs or verbal threats.""

The Post quoted cosponsor Rep. Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill., as saying the bill ""was not intended to change existing law regarding taxpayer funding for abortion in cases of rape, nor is it expected that it would do so.""

However, Smith quickly agreed to delete the word because, the Post reported in a Feb. 3, 2011, news story, it was being ""misconstrued."" A CBS news story the same day quoted Smith spokesman Jeff Sagnip: ""The word ‘forcible’ will be replaced with the original language from the Hyde Amendment.""

House Judiciary Committee press secretary Charlotte Sellmyer told us by email, ""The bill was officially amended when the amendment was voted on in committee, which was March 3, 2011.""

In a phone interview, Lone Star Project founder Matt Angle told us that when he wrote the PAC’s report, he was referring to the Texas members of the U.S. House (the only group that could co-sponsor a bill with House members Akin and Ryan) cosponsoring the act when it was reintroduced Jan. 20, 2011, and afterwards before ""forcible"" was deleted.

""Everybody from District 1, Gohmert, to District 32, Pete Sessions, and all the Republicans in between,"" Angle said.

For perspective, we checked the cosponsors of both the 2010 and 2011 introductions of the bill using THOMAS, the congressional database.

The version introduced July 29, 2010, included among its eventual 186 cosponsors all 20 Texas Republicans plus two Democrats -- Solomon Ortiz of Corpus Christi and Henry Cuellar of Laredo -- from the 32-member Texas delegation.

The 20 Texas Republicans were, listed by district number, Louie Gohmert of Tyler, Ted Poe of Humble, Sam Johnson of Plano, Ralph Hall of Rockwall, Jeb Hensarling of Dallas, Joe Barton of Ennis, John Culberson of Houston, Kevin Brady of The Woodlands, Michael McCaul of Austin, Michael Conaway of Midland, Kay Granger of Fort Worth, Mac Thornberry of Clarendon, Ron Paul of Lake Jackson, Randy Neugebauer of Lubbock, Lamar Smith of San Antonio, Pete Olson of Sugar Land, Kenny Marchant of Coppell, Michael Burgess of Lewisville, John Carter of Round Rock and Pete Sessions of Dallas.

Voters in November 2010 elected three additional Republicans to the Texas delegation. And in 2011, all 23 Texas Republicans in the House but no Texas Democrats were among the 227 legislators who eventually signed on as cosponsors of Smith’s HR 3.

The Texas cosponsors were the 20 Republicans from 2010 plus GOP freshmen Bill Flores of Bryan, Francisco ""Quico"" Canseco of San Antonio and Blake Farenthold of Corpus Christi. Seventeen of the Texans were original cosponsors. Five joined Feb. 8, 2011.

The last one, however, got on board March 8 -- after the deletion of ""forcible."" The latecomer was Culberson, whose office offered no comment when we asked about his timing.

We looped back to Angle with our findings on the cosponsors and the intent of the bill. Angle told us that he believes the Texas Republicans showed by cosponsoring the bill that they supported making a legal distinction between rape and forcible rape.

Our ruling

Except for Culberson in 2011, all Texas Republicans in the House cosponsored versions of the legislation using the word ""forcible.""

But, absent from the PAC’s claim is the fact that two Texas Democrats cosponsored the 2010 proposal, which dampens the suggestion that Republicans alone were committing to placing ""forcible"" rape into the proposal. And though the PAC said the ""bill ... attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults,"" redefining rape was not the proposal’s purpose. Also, its author agreed to delete the term when critics singled it out.

New Jersey leads world in number of scientists, engineers per square mile
","
New Jersey has long held the title of most densely populated state in the country.

But the Garden State has an even more prestigious ranking, according to a recent advertisement placed by Choose: New Jersey in the Wall Street Journal.

The July 30 ad reads in part: ""New Jersey has a rich tradition of bringing the world some very big thinking. In fact, we have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world, making ours one of the most highly skilled and educated workforces available.""

That’s quite a claim for any state to make so for this fact check, we are focusing only on the statistic about scientists and engineers. And it seems Choose: New Jersey’s calculations add up.

Let’s look at how Choose: New Jersey, a nonprofit group that markets the state to attract businesses and jobs, came up with their statistic. Choose: New Jersey is part of the Partnership For Action, the Business Action Center and state Economic Development Authority.

Melissa Hensley, chief marketing officer for the group, said the group compared geographic and employment data from four organizations: the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, the CIA’s World Fact Book 2012, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the National Science Board.

""All of it came down to an apples-to-apples comparison to the extent possible between a state and country,"" Hensley said.

The Census Bureau’s Population Reference Bureau listed New Jersey as having 260,655 scientists and engineers in 2010. That number divided by New Jersey’s total land area of 8,722.58 square miles equals 29.88 scientists and engineers – the highest number among all states and a list of 37 countries.

""I read somewhere that New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the U.S., so I guess you could extrapolate from that that there are more scientists per square mile than anywhere else,"" Brian Bell, a spokesman for the California Institute of Technology said in an e-mail. ""Although Massachusetts might give N.J. a run for its money. California has lots of smart people, but we have huge deserts and lots of empty space too.""

Bell’s guess is accurate.

Massachusetts has the second highest number of scientists and engineers, at 23.47 per square mile, followed by Maryland, at 20.97. California is 10th on the list.

A similar calculation was used for other countries by measuring the number of researchers – a more broad term that includes scientists and engineers – per 1,000 of employed people. Breaking that figure down and comparing it against country size, we determined that Israel tops the international list, with 5.10 scientists and engineers per square mile (Choose: New Jersey’s calculations were adjusted to consider countries in square miles instead of kilometers). Rounding out the top three are Japan, at 4.46, and Belgium, at 3.16.

If both lists are put together, New Jersey and 11 other U.S. states lead the world in number of engineers and scientists per square mile before Israel joins the rankings.

""The numbers reflect what we regularly hear from businesses considering locating or expanding in New Jersey – that if a company is looking to benefit from a high concentration of very skilled talent, New Jersey is a prime location,"" Hensley said in response to our findings.

Our ruling

Choose: New Jersey said in an advertisement that ""we have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world,"" making the state’s workforce one of the most skilled and highly educated.

Choose: New Jersey used a variety of data to reach its conclusion, from the U.S. Census Bureau to the CIA World Fact Book and more. PolitiFact New Jersey vetted the calculations and found that the Garden State does top the world in number of scientists and engineers per square mile: 29.8.

We rate this statement True.

Bill Clinton says Barack Obama cut taxes for 95 percent of people through stimulus
","
Update, Sept. 6, 2012, 10:43 a.m.: When we first posted this item, we did not address the distinction between all Americans and all American workers. Our report now addresses that difference, and we have changed the rating from True to Half True.

In making the case for President Barack Obama’s re-election, former President Bill Clinton vouched for job creation under Obama’s reign despite the ""deeply damaged economy"" he inherited.
   
Clinton singled out Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus program, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as a positive step for the economy.
   
""In 2010, as the president's recovery program kicked in, the job losses stopped and things began to turn around,"" Clinton said in his keynote Democratic National Convention speech. ""The Recovery Act saved or created millions of jobs and cut taxes -- let me say this again -- cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people.""
   
Clinton borrowed this factoid from the man of the week, who made it part of his 2008 campaign and bragged about it in his 2010 State of the Union speech. That night, Obama said, ""We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families."" PolitiFact rated that claim True.
   
Here’s why: The stimulus included tax cuts for many Americans, including a broad cut known as ""Making Work Pay"" intended to offset payroll taxes, which are automatically taken out of most workers’ paychecks and are not refundable.
   
Because of the stimulus, single workers collected a $400 tax credit, and working couples got $800. The credit didn’t come in the form of a check; it worked out so that most workers had about $400 less in federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks.
   
The result mostly mirrored what Obama promised he would do on the campaign. Obama pledged tax cuts of $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. We rated the promise a Compromise on our Obameter because the resulting tax cut was a little lower than what Obama wanted.
   
Ahead of the 2008 election, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed the effects of Obama’s tax proposals for workers. The center determined about 95 percent -- more precisely, 94.3 percent -- of tax filers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan based on the tax credit to offset payroll taxes.
   
The 5-percent sliver of workers who wouldn’t qualify included couples who make more than $250,000 or a single person making over $200,000
   
The tax cut expired at the end of 2011. Obama won another round of tax cuts for most workers in a December 2010 tax deal with Republicans in Congress. Those tax cuts -- worth about 2 percent a week -- expire in 2013.

However, Clinton left out an important qualifier: It’s a tax cut for 95 percent of working families.

Not everyone works -- think seniors or the unemployed, for example -- and when you account for those people, the percentage of people who get a tax cut drops to approximately 75 percent.

That’s still tax cuts for many Americans, but not close to the 95-percent range. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF8F300>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton/clinton-says-obama-cut-taxes-95-percent-people-thr/

Bill Clinton says Democratic presidents top Republican presidents in job creation
","Are Democratic presidents better than Republican presidents at job creation? Former President Bill Clinton said so -- forcefully -- in his speech to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. ""Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24,"" Clinton said. ""In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)."" In the packed convention hall, it was one of the night’s biggest applause lines. In 2010, we checked a similar claim from Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who said that Democratic presidents ""have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs."" After crunching the numbers back to President Harry Truman, we found that jobs did indeed grow faster under Democratic presidents when adjusted for a president’s years served in office. So we rated the claim True. Clinton’s claim at the convention was worded differently, so we quickly re-crunched the numbers based on his specifications. Let’s cut to the chase. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, here are the net increases in private-sector employment under each president, chronologically by party: Republicans

Richard Nixon: Increase of 7.1 million jobs
Gerald Ford: Increase of 1.3 million jobs
Ronald Reagan: Increase of 14.7 million jobs
George H.W. Bush: Increase of 1.5 million jobs
George W. Bush: Decline of 646,000 jobs

Total: Increase of 23.9 million jobs under Republican presidents

Democrats

John F. Kennedy: Increase of 2.7 million jobs
Lyndon B. Johnson: Increase of 9.5 million jobs
Jimmy Carter: Increase of 9.0 million jobs
Bill Clinton: Increase of 20.8 million jobs
Barack Obama: Increase of 332,000 jobs Total: Increase of 42.3 million jobs. So Clinton is right. But we’ll bring up a few points worth noting. This does not include government jobs The combination of private-sector jobs and public-sector jobs is a broader measurement of job creation than private-sector alone. But excluding government jobs would presumably hurt Democrats more than Republicans, given the two parties’ historical stances toward the role of government. The fact that Democrats finished so far ahead despite taking government jobs off the table makes it a more impressive accomplishment. The Democrats didn’t benefit from population growth For our previous story, Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless calculated that the U.S. working-age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents, also making the Democratic accomplishment more impressive. Presidents deserves less credit for the good times and less blame for the bad times It's a truism of politics that when things go well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things don't go well, the president usually gets too much blame. Shouldn't the Republican Congress of 1995-2001 get a share of the credit for Clinton's robust job growth? Shouldn't the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes. Since we published our previous story, we have changed our policy: We now factor into our ratings whether the politician or party deserves credit or blame for the statistical trend being analyzed. In this item, though, we will not factor in credit or blame, because both parties have had presidents serve during the time we looked at, meaning that both parties would have benefited and suffered in roughly equal proportions. It’s unclear how much this finding says about our political and economic systems Job creation for each president depended to a certain extent on timing, external factors and luck. And as Yale political scientist David Mayhew pointed out for our previous story, conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set -- in this case, just 12 postwar presidencies -- need to be taken with a grain of salt. Our ruling Clinton’s figures check out, and they also mirror the broader results we came up with two years ago. Partisans are free to interpret these findings as they wish, but on the numbers, Clinton’s right. We rate his claim True.

"['National', 'Housing', 'Kamala Harris']","
Kamala Harris says Romney favors letting foreclosures hit bottom
","
To demonstrate the contrast between President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney, California Attorney General Kamala Harris pointed to the housing crisis.

""We don't have to guess what Mitt Romney would have done if he were president. Because he told us,"" Harris said in a Sept. 5 speech at the Democratic National Convention. ""He said we should let foreclosures—and I quote—’hit the bottom’ so the market could—I quote—’run its course.’""

The Democratic National Committee made this claim in an ad last year, and PolitiFact checked it out. We found that a significant portion of Romney’s quote was omitted. Here’s a recap.

What he said

The quote about housing comes from an interview Romney gave to the Las Vegas Review-Journal’s editorial board last year.
   
The newspaper posted video of his comments online, noting that they were in answer to the question, ""How will you help with the housing and foreclosure problems in the U.S.?""
   
Here’s a transcript of Romney’s extended answer:
   
""As to what to do for the housing industry specifically, and are there things you can do to encourage housing? One is, don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom. Allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up, and let it turn around and come back up. The Obama administration has slow-walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang. Number two, the credit (that) was given to first-time homebuyers was insufficient and inadequate to turn around the housing market. I think it was an ineffective idea. It was a little bit like the cash-for-clunkers program, throwing government money at something which was not market oriented, did not staunch the decline in home values anymore than it encouraged the auto industry to take off. I think the idea of helping people refinance homes to stay in them is one that's worth further consideration. But I'm not signing on until I find out who's going to pay and who’s going to get bailed out, and that's not something which we know all the answers to.""

We also reviewed Romney's economic plan, ""Believe in America: Mitt Romney’s plan for Jobs and Economic Growth,"" but it has only passing mentions of the housing sector. It emphasizes low tax rates, reduced regulations for business, initiatives for the energy sector and measures that would reduce the influence of organized labor.
   
In the interview with the newspaper, Romney expressed some hesitation about too much government intervention in the housing market. But he did indicate he was open to the idea of helping homeowners refinance through some government action to encourage it.

Our ruling

Harris quoted Romney as saying the housing market should be allowed to ""hit the bottom"" so the crisis could ""run its course.""

He did say that, but he also said that when new investors come in and rehab homes, the market could then ""turn around and come back up."" Romney also suggested he’d be open to refinancing options that would help some homeowners stay in their homes.

That’s important context omitted from Harris’ speech. We rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA71EC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/kamala-harris/Kamala-Harris-Romney-favors-letting-foreclosures/
"['National', 'Jobs', 'Women', 'Diana DeGette']","
Diana DeGette says women earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man
","
Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., invoked a well-worn statistic to illustrate how women earn less than men during her speech at the Democratic National Convention.

""More and more in this economy, the women are the family breadwinners. We are managing our family budgets, struggling to pay healthcare bills and facing the challenge of saving for college,"" DeGette said during her Sept. 5, 2012, speech. ""We feel it in our paychecks when we receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.""

We’ve heard this statistic often, and not during just the convention. Lilly Ledbetter, the namesake of Obama’s first signed bill, used it in her speech the night before, and Obama used it -- inaccurately -- in a campaign ad this summer.

This statistic is factual when applied correctly. DeGette did a fine job of describing the figure, though 77 cents isn’t the definitive measure of the gender gap. (It happens to be the widest.)

Politicians get income data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages, found women who worked full-time, year-round in 2010 made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country. This comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses different measures to analyze the pay gap, including weekly wages. In 2010, women working full-time had median weekly earnings of $669, versus $824 for males, according to a BLS report  released in 2011. So women earned 81 cents of every dollar earned by men, which has been typical since 2004.

What’s the difference? Unlike the measure of annual wages by the Census Bureau, the weekly wage analysis does not account for people who are self-employed. It does include people left out of the year-round wage measure, such as some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers.

Another measure -- hourly rates -- shows a smaller degree of pay disparity. According to BLS data, women are paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men. This evaluation accounts for part-time (fewer than 35 hours) workers, which are more often women and are paid less than their salaried counterparts. Women paid by the hour made median hourly earnings of $11.83, compared to $13.76 for men.

We wondered which figure is best. Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, prefers the measure of annual wages, which do not exclude salaried workers as the hourly measure does.

""It’s the one that goes back the furthest in time,"" she said. ""It’s the one that is most traditional.""

But some researchers, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer working with hourly wages, arguing ""an incomplete picture"" is cast with weekly earnings because women work fewer hours than men, ""which would make a gap in weekly earnings between the two groups substantial even if their hourly wages are the same.""

Hartmann’s think tank analyzed pay parity for the top 20 occupations for women in 2011 using median weekly earnings. The center found the pay gap varies depending on the field, though women lag in nearly every category. Consider nurses (96 cents to every dollar),  cashiers (90 cents), accountants (77 cents) and financial advisers (66 cents).

So how much of a role does discrimination play? Hartmann attributed anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of the gap to direct discrimination by the employer. The U.S. Department of Labor put it around 40 percent in a blog post on this topic.

A woman’s ties to child care is also factored in, with studies saying this obligation restricts her career options and hours. Women also more often choose occupations with lower wages, obtain degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and take more time off from work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh.

Men and women historically enter certain fields more than others -- a phenomenon known as ""occupational segregation."" Women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.

Our ruling

DeGette claimed women ""receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."" The measure comes from a valid source, though other comparisons indicate the gap is tighter. Also, some occupations have smaller gaps than others.

We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBC7380>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/diana-degette/diana-degette-says-women-earn-77-cents-every-dolla/

Mitt Romney said he likes to fire people, said Delaware governor
","
Just because Republican Mitt Romney was successful in business doesn’t mean he deserves to be president, said Delaware Gov. Jack Markell at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.

""Because when you move from business to government, what matters are the lessons you learn and what those lessons say about your priorities,"" Markell said in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech. ""And Mitt Romney learned all the wrong lessons.""

Markell then told a story about a refinery closing in Delaware, noting his own efforts to help laid-off workers find jobs.

""Let me ask you: What do you think Mitt Romney would have done if that call came in? Well, Mitt Romney already told us what he would do. Mitt Romney says he likes to fire people. And Barack Obama? He likes to see people hired,"" Markell said.

Markell here is cherry-picking Romney’s words and putting them in a context Romney never intended.

Those words from Romney date back to Jan. 9, 2012, when Romney was speaking about health care -- not the economy or jobs -- at the Nashua, N.H., Chamber of Commerce.

Specifically, he was talking about what should happen if people aren’t happy with their health insurance provider.

""I want individuals to have their own insurance,"" Romney said. ""That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy. It also means if you don’t like what they do, you can fire them. I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. You know, if someone doesn’t give me a good service that I need, I want to say I’m going to go get someone else to provide that service to me.""
   
At the time, Romney knew he had made a gaffe that opponents would seize on: ""Things can always be taken out of context. And I understand that that's what the Obama people will do. But, as you know, I was speaking about insurance companies and the need to be able to make a choice. And my comments entirely reflected that discussion, which is we should be able to choose the insurance company of our choice.""

We should note that Romney has done the same thing to Obama, who flubbed the line ""you didn’t build that."" (At the Republican National Convention, speakers repeated variations of the line over and over.) We put the claim on the Truth-O-Meter when the Romney campaign said in a Web video, ""President Obama recently said: ‘If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.’ Clearly, this President doesn't understand how our economy works."" Actually, Obama was talking about the importance of government-provided infrastructure and education to the success of private businesses. We rated the Romney campaign’s statement False.

Still, two wrongs don’t make a right. Romney never said anything about liking to fire people when it came to laid-off workers.

Our ruling

Markell talked about helping laid-off workers find jobs, then said, ""What do you think Mitt Romney would have done if that call came in? Well, Mitt Romney already told us what he would do. Mitt Romney says he likes to fire people.""

He’s cherry-picking Romney’s words and putting them in an entirely different context. What Romney actually said was, ""I like being able to fire people who provide services to me,"" and he was talking specifically about switching health insurance companies if a provider isn’t giving good service.

We rate Markell’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD97500>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/jack-markell/mitt-romney-said-he-likes-fire-people-said-delawar/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Kathleen Sebelius']","
Kathleen Sebelius repeats claim that Romney-Ryan Medicare 'voucher' plan would cost seniors $6,400
","
Democrats pushed to reclaim ""Obamacare"" at their national convention in Charlotte, N.C., deploying the secretary of Health and Human Services to celebrate it as a ""badge of honor.""

But Kathleen Sebelius trotted out some problematic talking points in her Sept. 4, 2012, defense of the president’s health care law, saying, for example, that ""Republicans would give seniors a voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year.""

We’ve rated similar claims from Democrats about that extra cost, rating them Half Trueand Mostly Falsebecause they rely on an analysis of an outdated Republican plan. We’ve also rated whether Republicans ""want to turn Medicare into a voucher system,"" finding it Mostly True— their plan is somewhere between ""premium support"" and ""vouchers.""

Sebelius combined the two claims for a less-than-true statement. Let us explain.

 The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan

Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums.

This would have affected people who today are under 55 only, but critics said those who fell under the new rules would face an increasingly large gap between what the government paid for their benefits and what their health care services cost. It would limit ""what’s covered,"" as Sebelius put it, in that seniors would get a defined contribution to buy coverage rather than the defined benefits of traditional Medicare.

The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate, where Democrats called it radical and harmful to beneficiaries. Subsequently, Ryan offered updated versions of the plan, the first in conjunction with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and then as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. It still offers seniors a defined amount toward private insurance rather than paying providers directly. That’s why we’ve said it’s Mostly Trueto call it a voucher system.

But the new plan has two key differences from Ryan’s previous proposal. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice — they can use their payment to buy private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market — the price of the second-cheapest plan.

The most recent Ryan plan appears to be the closest to the Romney-Ryan campaign’s position. In an interviewwith a Green Bay, Wis., television station on Aug. 15, Romney said, ""Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical — it's probably close to identical.""

That makes Sebelius’ claim about cost an outdated one. Here’s how.

 The $6,400 question

Previous claims by Democrats of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs cite a reportby the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here’s what the group said:

""In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare,"" center president Bob Greenstein wrote. ""CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double — from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater.

The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400.

But here’s the problem: The CBO analysis, and other groups’ analyses built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan, while it caps overall growth in Medicare spending, is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange.

The earlier out-of-pocket estimate was based on the idea that seniors’ initial payments would be tied to how much the government had previously paid for their Medicare coverage, forcing seniors to pony up the difference for more expensive private plans. Traditional Medicare would not have been among their options. In the new proposal, Medicare is one of the options, and the payment’s size is based on the price of one of the available plans. So if Medicare were a cheaper option, seniors could use their premium support payment toward purchasing it and save money. If traditional Medicare were more expensive than the second-least expensive plan, it could cost seniors more out-of-pocket to keep it. An estimate of that expense, though, would differ from analysis for Ryan’s earlier plan.

But Ryan hasn’t yet asked for a rigorous analysis of his new proposal.

""CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed,"" CBO wrote earlier this year.

There is one clue that under the proposal, extra costs for seniors who wanted to keep traditional Medicare wouldn’t come close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan’s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare. That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month — which adds up to less than $800 a year.

Meanwhile, under the Ryan plan, seniors could also choose to buy the plan covered entirely by the premium support payment — for no extra out-of-pocket cost. And all plans offered under the proposal would have to provide at least the actuarial equivalent of traditional Medicare.

Of course, absent details from the Ryan camp and an updated CBO analysis, it’s still not clear what would happen over time if the new, market-based payments grew faster than the Ryan plan’s cap on Medicare spending. Would savings still come from beneficiaries? Or providers? Or somewhere else?

The absence of details and rigorous analysis of the new plan means that claims about its financial impact on seniors are speculative. It’s irresponsible of Sebelius to repeat a number about an old Republican plan just because she doesn’t have an updated analysis of the new — and different — plan.

Meanwhile, to say the new plan provides a voucher ""that limits what's covered,"" as Sebelius said, oversimplifies how it might work. Traditional Medicare limits coverage to specific areas such as doctor and hospital visits, which is why some seniors buy private ""gap"" insurance to add benefits such as vision, hearing and dental. Under the new Ryan plan, the voucher amount to buy a private policy or traditional Medicare would be limited to the cost of the second-least-expensive policy that provided at least the actuarial equivalent — or same value — of benefits under traditional Medicare. But what got covered might vary from policy to policy.

 Our ruling

Sebelius recycled an old number about an outdated Republican plan when she said, ""Republicans would give seniors a voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year.""

She’s right that a shift to paying a defined amount for seniors to buy their own insurance essentially offers them a voucher. But the Republicans’ Medicare exchange with market-based premium support payments would offer more protection than a pure voucher. And we simply don’t have enough details about that new plan to know how much extra money seniors might have to pay for traditional Medicare.

"['Federal Budget', 'Income', 'Retirement', 'Social Security', 'Wisconsin', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden says Romney and Ryan support ""massive cuts in Social Security for future generations.""
","
In a campaign stop in Green Bay, Vice President Joe Biden rolled out familiar Democratic criticisms of the Republican budget proposal approved by the U.S. House in early 2012, contending the party wants ""massive"" cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.

But Biden added another lightning-rod issue: Social  Security, which has received little discussion so far in the 2012 presidential campaign.

""Ladies and gentlemen, it’s just that simple. We are for Medicare, they are for voucher care. It’s basic,"" the veep said at a Sept. 2, 2012 rally. ""They are for massive cuts in Social Security for future generations.""

He added: ""These are the facts!""

But wait. That House GOP budget plan, authored by Mitt Romney’s running mate, Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, did not touch on the  Social Security reform ideas contained in Ryan’s earlier ""Roadmap for America’s Future.""

Is Biden right about ""massive"" cuts being on the GOP agenda?

When asked to back up the statement, Biden’s campaign sent us a memo -- authored by Harvard economist David Cutler and released March 22, 2012, by the Obama-Biden campaign -- that said Romney has proposed adjusting the benefit formula so that retirees above a certain income level would see major benefit cuts, and had proposed slowly increasing the Social Security retirement age.

Cutler, who was Obama’s senior health care adviser in the 2008 presidential campaign, termed the Romney-backed cuts ""deep"" and ""devastating.""

A look at the plan

Here’s what we know for sure, from Romney’s website and public statements about his views on strengthening the Social Security trust fund, which actuaries say will be depleted by 2033:

-- He opposes a Social Security payroll tax hike as part of a rescue plan, preferring to cut benefit costs.
-- His plans would not affect those already retired or 55 and over.
-- For future generations, he endorses slowly increasing the retirement age.
-- Also for future generations, benefits should rise at a lower rate for those with ""higher"" incomes.

Romney expanded briefly on this during the Fox New/Wall Street Journal debate on Jan. 16, 2012.

""I’d lower the rate of inflation growth in the benefits received by higher-income recipients and keep the rate as it is now -- pretty high -- for lower income recipients,"" Romney said. ""And I’d also add a year or two to the retirement age under Social Security. That balances Social Security.""

His campaign told us: ""Romney’s plan would strengthen and protect Social Security going forward. What’s the Obama plan to avert the cuts projected to start in 2033?""

 Growth in benefits

Romney’s inflation proposal echoes a concept in past cost-cutting proposals offered by Republicans -- including Ryan in 2008 and 2010 -- and by a commission appointed by George W. Bush early in that decade. Cutler points to another plan, by Republican senators Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul and Mike Lee from 2011, that pushed the concept.

It’s important to note that Obama-Biden is not claiming that Romney supported any of those earlier plans, which may differ from his own. But it is citing them for support on the impact of such a proposal.

The idea common to all the plans is known as ""progressive price indexing,"" and it changes the way recipients’ initial retirement benefit is calculated. Currently, the benefit formula is tied to the change in average American wages. The reform proposals would rely more on the consumer price index, a closely watched measure of the cost of consumer goods and services.

In Ryan’s view, expressed in his 2010 ""Roadmap for America’s Future,"" the current approach ""exceeds the amount of initial benefit growth needed to keep pace with economic conditions, and contributes to the unsustainable projected burden on Social Security."" (The ""Roadmap"" plan was Ryan’s own vision as Budget Committee chairman, and, unlike his subsequent budget plans, did not come to a vote in the House).

This formula change on how to keep pace with inflation can generate big savings over time in benefits paid out. That’s in part because prices historically have risen more slowly than wages, according to actuarial studies done by the Social Security Administration of various proposals.

It’s called ""progressive"" because the idea cushions the benefit cut for lower-income workers -- even to the point of actually increasing benefits for some in that group. But as the change phases in over decades, ""higher-income"" earners -- as Romney calls them -- would be getting a reduced initial benefit at retirement under the change.

How much of a cut?

The Graham-Paul-Lee bill would have held harmless workers in the lowest 40 percent of earners. But starting at a career average of $43,084 in earnings, that inflation-factor change would mean 4.5 percent drop in the initial Social Security check for those turning 65 in 2030 after working more than four decades, the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary reported in April 2011. (That hypothetical worker is 47 today).

For an earner hitting retirement age in 2080, the projected cut is larger, 14.5 percent. (That hypothetical worker will be born in 2015).

The reductions in that initial check get much larger as incomes increase: up to 28.4 percent by 2080 for those averaging $68,934; and up to 36.1 percent less for those averaging $106,800.

And that is only considering the effect of the Graham-Paul-Lee ""progressive price indexing plan."" The other change it proposed was a phased-in, higher retirement age and early retirement age.

Add in the lost benefits from having to wait longer for that first check, and the reduction by 2080 is 28.8 percent to 54.4 percent going from low to high incomes.

So we are talking real money. It’s far down the road, but Biden in his speech made clear he was talking about ""future generations.""

A key question is whether it’s reasonable for Obama-Biden to use the three senators’ plan as a benchmark for Romney’s views.

There are striking similarities on the surface. Both rely on benefit cuts not tax increases, and both have as their only planks the progressive price indexing change and a higher retirement age.

""I just looked up the closest plan to his,"" Cutler told us. ""And it’s been evaluated.""

Social Security experts from groups with differing points of view on reform told us the devil is in the details when trying to judge whether Romney’s plan would make ""massive"" cuts.

Webster Phillips, senior policy analyst at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said Romney has not offered specific details that would allow a judgment on the precise impact.

But Phillips said the Romney plan is in the mold of the Robert Pozen plan that drew attention to progressive price indexing under President George W. Bush, and has some things in common with an idea proposed in 2011 by the Obama-appointed, bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, popularly known as Bowles-Simpson.

""No matter how you parse it, it’s a substantial benefit reduction for individual workers,"" said Phillips. The organization is funded by membership dues and resists benefit cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

""If you just use cuts, they have to be substantial,"" Phillips said.

Phillips wouldn’t endorse, or denounce, Biden’s characterization of Romney-Ryan’s Social Security cuts as ""massive.""

David John is a veteran tracker of Social Security reform at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which advocates for a higher retirement age and targeting Social Security to those most in need.

He recalled that large benefit reductions were attributed to the Bush-Pozen ""progressive indexing plan.""

John acknowledged that the indexing change does alter benefits, but cautioned that ""you really can’t determine how it’s going to change benefits until you look precisely what they’re talking about. It needs details.""

""You can apply it in a dozen different ways,"" John said.

John said it’s fair to take into account that if nothing is done on Social Security’s finances, policy makers essentially are forcing a 25 percent benefit cut will take place in just over two decades -- much sooner than the inflation indexing-related increases.

Obama has acknowledged the need to consider ""all measures"" to rein in entitlement spending but wrote in 2011 that he resists approaches that ""slash"" benefits for future generations. He has not offered a plan as part of the 2012 campaign. We note that in 2011 private negotiations with GOP congressional leaders over debt reduction, there were hints that he was proposing some kind of change in how inflation is calculated in determining benefits, according to a Washington Post account.

John, of Heritage, said ""massive cuts"" overstates the case, because Romney could structure his indexing plan in a way to spread out the reductions, or concentrate them at the highest income group.

But critics on the left cite research and the government’s actuarial studies to argue that even retirees of modest incomes would feel the crunch under plan’s that are labeled ""progressive.""

Our rating

In a campaign speech, Biden hammered the Romney-Ryan ticket for supporting ""massive cuts in Social Security for future generations.""

He doesn’t cite a specific plan from Romney (or Ryan), but major benefit reductions well down the road based on a proposal that mirrors Romney’s Social Security reforms in some key respects.

It’s clear that Romney’s approach of raising the retirement age and re-jiggering inflation indexing without raising taxes will lead to benefit cuts over time. That’s the point.

The boost in retirement age cuts payments across the board; the indexing change asks more from higher earners but could also hit many middle-income people as well if his plan follows the form of past proposals.

It’s equally clear that it’s premature to judge exactly who will be affected, and how, because Romney has not laid out key details.

We think his claim lands at Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE55AC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/05/joe-biden/biden-says-romney-and-ryan-support-massive-cuts-so/
"['Israel', 'Florida', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz']","
Wasserman Schultz said she didn't make comments about Israel's ambassador, but she did
","Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz found herself on the defensive about comments she made to Jewish supporters on the eve of her party’s convention in Charlotte, N.C. The topic: comments she said were made by Israeli ambassador Michael Oren about Republicans and Israel.

The debate about what the South Florida congresswoman said began Monday, after Michael Barone at the conservative Washington Examiner wrote about her comments in front of a group of Jewish Democrats. Here is the exact quote from the Examiner, including a typo and an incomplete phrase in quotes at the end:

""National Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz spoke and was warmly received as she extolled Obamacare (Democrats are using the term) and said she has heard Israel’s Ambassador Michael Oren say, in her words, ‘what the Republicans is dangerous for Israel.’""

On Tuesday morning, the Examiner’s Philip Klein gave a more detailed explanation of her comments, which occurred at a training session for Jewish Democrats. ""As she was wrapping up her remarks, she claimed that, ‘We know, and I’ve heard no less than Ambassador Michael Oren say this, that what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel,’"" Klein wrote.

The Examiner also wrote that Wasserman Schultz said Republicans were ""undermining Israel’s security by suggesting that the United States and Israel don’t have anything other than a unique and close and special relationship. It undermines Israel’s security to its neighbors in the Arab world and to its enemies. And we need to make sure that the fact that there has never been and will never be daylight between the two parties or the support for Israel that we have in the United States, that that is conveyed to Jewish Americans across this country. That’s our responsibility. It’s the responsibility we’re asking all of you to take on.""

On Tuesday afternoon, the ambassador reacted to the Examiner report. ""I categorically deny that I ever characterized Republican policies as harmful to Israel,"" the statement from Oren read. ""Bipartisan support is a paramount national interest for Israel, and we have great friends on both sides of the aisle.""

Wasserman Schultz then went on Fox News Tuesday evening. Fox News repeated her quote about Oren and she responded:

""I didn’t say he said that,"" she said. ""And unfortunately, that comment was reported by a conservative newspaper. It’s not surprising that they would deliberately misquote me. What I always say is that unfortunately the Republicans have made Israel a political football, which is dangerous for Israel. And Ambassador Oren has said that we can’t ever suggest that there is any daylight between the two parties on Israel, because there isn’t. And that that’s harmful to Israel. That’s what I said, and that is accurate. We have to make sure that in America we don’t have people who put their love of party in front of their love of Israel. As the first Jewish woman to represent Florida in Congress, I take my love of Israel to work with me every single day, and I want to make sure that we re-elect President Obama.""

We wanted to explore exactly what Wasserman Schultz said at the training session. We can’t know for sure what Oren might have said to Wasserman Schultz. But we can research Wasserman Schultz’s remarks and whether she was misquoted.

Obama received a majority of the Jewish vote in 2008, but both parties are clamoring for the Jewish vote which could be key in any state with the potential for a close outcome, including Florida.

Audio clip of Wasserman Schultz

After Wasserman Schultz denied that she made the statement, the Examiner posted about a one-minute audio clip of her speaking at the event.

Here’s our transcript of her remarks:

""We want you to be armed with the facts. So we are going to give you those facts. We have a one-page document that succinctly describes President Obama’s stellar record on Israel. We have a six-page document as well, because we’re Jews and one page really isn’t enough,"" she said which drew laughter from her audience. ""And we have a myths versus facts document, which addresses a lot of the typical baloney that is spewed by Republicans. Let me just close by telling you this and sharing this with you. We know, and I’ve heard no less than Ambassador Michael Oren say this, that what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel. They are undermining Israel’s security by suggesting that the United States and Israel don’t have anything other than a unique and close and special relationship. It undermines Israel’s security to its neighbors in the Arab world and to its enemies. And we need to make sure that the fact that there has never been and will never be daylight between the two parties or the support for Israel that we have in the United States, that that is conveyed to Jewish Americans across this country, that’s our responsibility, and it’s the responsibility we’re asking all of you to take on....""

(The documents she was referring to are here, and here and here.)

Wasserman Schultz’s explanation

Miami Herald political reporter Marc Caputo asked Wasserman Schultz about her dispute with the Examiner, and Miami Herald reporter Erika Bolstad shared that audio with us:

""What they put in the paper is not a surprise because they are a conservative gotcha-type publication. They ripped one line out of what I said and left the rest so it appeared as though I was saying something that I wasn’t. In fact that line is the opposite of what I always say, which is, and I will say again: It is dangerous to turn Israel into a political football as the Republicans are trying to do. It's dangerous for Israel because to suggest that there is any separation on Israel between the two parties, any daylight harms Israel in the eyes of its neighbors, our neighbors and its enemies. That’s what I said and what I always say. We know that there is little we agree on in Washington but strong bipartisan support for Israel and President Obama’s stellar record, it’s important to make sure that that is clear and consistent message and not put love of party before the love of Israel.""

Caputo repeatedly asked Wasserman Schultz to explain what Oren actually said to her. She said that she spoke to Oren yesterday and said that the Examiner didn’t report her comments in the full context. She also said that she said what she always says.

We also received this statement from the DNC communications staff:

""The Examiner misrepresented the chairwoman’s remarks. What she said is what she has stated repeatedly before: what jeopardizes Israel's security is the suggestion, for partisan political gain, that the election of either political party would weaken the long-standing relationship of the United States and Israel. The Examiner’s piece should be seen for what it is, a blatant misrepresentation of the facts by a conservative outlet.""

Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton confirmed that the audio clip of Wasserman Schultz was accurate, but he added that Wasserman Schultz was not reading from prepared remarks and was not directly quoting Oren.

""What she is saying is that Ambassador Oren had told her on multiple occasions that using Israel as a political football is dangerous for Israel. ..."" Beeton said. ""She is not saying he said what Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel.""

For example, Romney’s comment that Obama has ""thrown Israel under the bus"" is an example of ""what Republicans are doing,"" Beeton said.

Beeton noted what Wasserman Schultz said later in her statement about making sure there ""will never be daylight between the two parties"" shows she was trying to convey that both parties should share support for Israel to help protect Israel.

Beeton gave us this analogy: ""It would kind of be like if you and I are walking into McDonald’s and you order a double Big Mac Happy Meal and I go, ‘Amy, what you are doing, and I’ve heard no less than the surgeon general of the U.S. say this, what you are doing right now is dangerous for your health. It doesn’t mean the Surgeon General said, ‘Amy Sherman’s eating habits are dangerous for her health.’ Instead, it would mean that the surgeon general said ‘that type of behavior is dangerous for your health.’""

Beeton also pointed us to Oren’s comments in 2010 in Haaretz, the English language newspaper in Israel, where he said, ‘‘Israel has become a partisan issue in the U.S., and this political ping-pong is bad for us.""

Finally, we should note another example of Wasserman Schultz talking about Oren’s comments. The Examiner linked to this August interview in Hadassah, a Jewish women’s magazine:

Hadassah: ""Why did you call on both parties to refrain from challenging each other over support for Israel?""

Wasserman Schultz: ""What the Republicans are doing is dangerous. They are using Israel as a political football.… Israel’s ambassador (to the United States), Michael Oren, has said this. If there is any perception of daylight between the parties on support for Israel, that strengthens Israel’s enemies. The president rejects what some Republican candidates have been saying, that America should review all its foreign aid commitments from zero, making each country justify the support it receives.""

Our ruling

The Examiner wrote that Wasserman Schultz said: ""We know, and I’ve heard no less than Ambassador Michael Oren say this, that what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel.""

The first Examiner report didn’t fully quote Wasserman Schultz. But the next day, the newspaper provided a more complete version -- including audio. She said she didn’t make the remark, but the audio clearly shows her making it.

In fairness to Wasserman Schultz, her main point in the extended audio clip is that Republicans have politicized the issue of Israel, and that is what’s dangerous, not that the party’s particular policy positions are dangerous.

Her comments about Oren gave the impression that he singled out Republicans for criticism, not that he was commenting on the dangers of politicizing the issue of Israel.

But she did make the remark she said she didn’t make, and we rate her claim Pants on Fire. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.

"['New Jersey', 'Pop Culture', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says his first Bruce Springsteen concert was at Seton Hall University in 1975
","
It was December 1975 when Bruce Springsteen took his ""Born to Run"" tour to Walsh gym at Seton Hall University, kicking off the set with ""Thunder Road"" and ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.""

And in the audience was the future governor of New Jersey, seeing the Boss for the first of what would ultimately reach 130 concerts.

Gov. Chris Christie pointed to that show as his first Springsteen concert during an interview Wednesday on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon."" The Republican governor would have been 13 years old at the time of the concert.

His first show was ""at Seton Hall University in South Orange at Walsh gym"" in 1975, Christie told Fallon, before the two performed part of ""Thunder Road"" together.

Taking a break from politics, PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that Christie knows his Springsteen concert history.

Springsteen performed at the Walsh gym at Seton Hall University on Dec. 11, 1975, according to various websites containing information on the set list as well as images of a concert ticket, an advertisement in a student newspaper; and CD covers.

The concert was scheduled to start at 8:30 p.m. on a Thursday night, with tickets costing $6.50 in advance and $7.50 at the door, according to the advertisement posted here.

Springsteen performed the following 21 songs that night, according to various websites:

1) Thunder Road
2) Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out
3) Spirit in the Night
4) Lost in the Flood
5) She's the One
6) Born to Run
7) Pretty Flamingo
8) Growin' Up
9) It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City
10) Backstreets
11) Kitty's Back
12) Jungleland
13) Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)
14) 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)
15) Santa Claus Is Coming to Town
16) Detroit Medley
17) For You
18) Party Lights
19) Quarter to Three
20) Wear My Ring Around Your Neck
21) Twist and Shout

A person who attended the concert posted a photo of Springsteen and the band here. 
Christie's spokespeople did not return a request for comment. 
Our ruling

Before performing part of ""Thunder Road"" with Fallon, Christie told the late-night host that his first Springsteen concert was ""at Seton Hall University in South Orange at Walsh gym"" in 1975.

The governor’s Springsteen concert history is correct. As part of Springsteen’s ""Born to Run"" tour, the Boss performed 21 songs on Dec. 11, 1975 at Walsh gym at Seton Hall University.

We rate the statement True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'History', 'Julián Castro']","
Julian Castro says seven presidents before Barack Obama sought universal health care
","
President Barack Obama’s health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didn’t run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. 
""Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans,"" Castro said. ""President Obama got it done."" 
We wondered whether Castro’s history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castro’s in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. 
Let’s start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castro’s definition of having ""tried to expand health care to all Americans."" 
• Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that ""the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility."" According to the Truman Library, ""the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan."" It called for ""the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program."" 
The American Medical Association attacked the plan, characterizing the bill as ""socialized medicine."" Truman ultimately abandoned the effort after the outbreak of the Korean War 
• Richard Nixon. In 1971 and 1974, Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all, or nearly all, Americans. Generally speaking, they involved employer mandates to provide health insurance, supplemented by subsidies for poorer Americans. 
""I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health-insurance protection to millions of Americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection against catastrophic illnesses,"" he said in 1974. 
The 1974 effort gained some traction in Congress but faltered as Nixon became consumed by scandal. 
""Had it not been for his destruction as a result of the Watergate affair, legislation might well have passed during his presidency,"" said Princeton University health care historian Paul Starr, the author of Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle over Health Care Reform. 
• Bill Clinton. In 1993 and 1994, Clinton -- in a process spearheaded by First Lady Hillary Clinton -- sought to pass a major overhaul of the health care system that would have aimed for universal coverage. Even though the Democrats controlled Congress at the time, the plan did not win enactment. 
So that’s an easy three. It isn’t much of a stretch to get a fourth: 
• Lyndon Johnson. Technically, Johnson never sought full universal health care. But it seems churlish to deny inclusion on this list to the man who signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. They aren’t universal care for everybody, but they are universal care for large subsets of the population. 
You can add a few more if you lower the bar a bit. 
• John F. Kennedy. Kennedy voiced strong support for legislation that would ultimately become Medicare. On May 20, 1962, he held a televised rally to push the proposal at a packed Madison Square Garden in New York City. (The American Journal of Public Health later noted that hours later, the AMA rented the empty hall to film a rebuttal by its president, without showing the empty seats.) But he died before the legislation could come to fruition.) 
• Gerald Ford. Ford endorsed Nixon’s second proposal, but it didn’t get far on his brief watch. 
• Jimmy Carter. Carter proposed ""a step-by-step plan to achieve universal coverage,"" Starr said. ""It came relatively late in his first term, and it was too weak to satisfy (Democratic Sen.) Ted Kennedy and many other Democrats."" Carter’s efforts were ""halfhearted,"" said Brown University political scientist James Morone, co-author of The Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office from Roosevelt to Bush. 
You can actually add a couple more if you bend Castro’s definition even further. 
• Theodore Roosevelt. He did endorse the idea of expanding health insurance to all, but only as as a presidential candidate for the Bull Moose Party in 1912, not during his earlier term in the White House. 
• Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his State of the Union address in 1943, Roosevelt called for a social insurance system that would extend ""from the cradle to the grave,"" and he was preparing a program and a speech on national health insurance at the time of his death. In the midst of World War II, Roosevelt never pursued it in earnest, but Truman took up the mantle instead 
• Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower reacted to Democratic proposals for single-payer health care by proposing an expansion of care within the model of private-sector medicine. Eisenhower’s approach was to make permanent the tax break for employer-sponsored health coverage (which remains today) in order to encourage as many Americans as possible to get covered through their workplace. For those who were not employed, Eisenhower proposed that the government ""reinsure"" private insurance companies to encourage them to add less profitable populations to their coverage rolls. 
While Morone calls the Eisenhower plan relatively ""timid,"" it nonetheless sparked the AMA’s opposition, which helped kill it in Congress. 
The remaining Republican presidents did act to expand health coverage in certain ways, but none of our experts thought they met Castro’s definition of pushing for universal health care. 
• Ronald Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals to serve patients in urgent need, and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA, which allows individuals to keep paying for coverage if they lose their insurance. In addition, with almost no support from his own cabinet, Reagan added catastrophic care to Medicare toward the end of his presidency, though the provision was later repealed. 
• George H.W. Bush, worried about the Democrats getting traction with health care in a 1991 Senate special election, sent a plan to congress. ""Bush didn't like the issue, but he had a really good health team that put together a pretty good republican proposal,"" Morone said. 
• George W. Bush pushed for and signed the expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage. 
Putting it all together, ""you could cut the number to five or raise it to eight depending on how strictly you want to interpret Castro’s words,"" Starr said. 
Our ruling 
Castro said that ""seven presidents before (Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans."" It’s a slam dunk getting to three or four presidents, and it’s possible to reach seven presidents, but to do that requires a looser interpretation of expanding coverage ""to all Americans."" On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8227C0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-seven-presidents-barack-obama-s/
"['New Hampshire', 'Debt', 'Kelly  Ayotte']","
Did Barack Obama accrue more debt in half the time as George Bush?
","
A few days before she hit the stage in front of a national audience at the Republican National Convention, U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte addressed a far smaller crowd in Merrimack, N.H.

Despite the difference in venue, the New Hampshire Republican offered a similar message.

During the town hall meeting, Ayotte, a Nashua native and freshman senator, took aim at President Obama and the growing debt under his administration. While she didn’t specifically blame the president for the debt, she used the speech to blast Obama for increased spending and stifling business.

""Under President Bush in eight years, we added $4.9 trillion to the debt,"" Ayotte told the crowd Thursday, August 23, 2012, at Merrimack High School. ""Under President Obama, we've added $5.3 trillion ... in the 3 1/2 years he's been in office.""

The numbers have been used before. Lastweek, PolitiFact gave a Mostly True ratingto a similar claim by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie that the debt has jumped $5 trillion during Obama’s time in office.

But, does that mean Ayotte’s numbers are on target? Let’s take a look.

The numbers aren’t hard to track.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury tracks the national debt figures on its website, TreasuryDirect.gov.

On the site, the treasury department divides the national debt into two main categories, debt held by the government and debt held by the public. But, in her statement, Ayotte is referring to the combined total, or total national debt, according to spokesman Jeff Grappone.

According to the federal count, the total debt currently sits around $16 trillion. But, as of August, 23, when Ayotte made the statement, it was closer to $15.98 trillion. That figure is about $5.35 trillion higher than the $10.63 trillion debt Obama inherited when he came into office January 19, 2009.

When Bush first came into office, the national debt was $5.73 trillion, and by the end of his eight years, it grew to $10.63 trillion -- an increase of exactly $4.9 trillion. So, Ayotte’s numbers look right on target.

Still, as is so often the case, the numbers don’t tell the whole story, according to analysts.

At PolitiFact, we consider not just the factual accuracy of a statement, but also whether credit and blame is fairly attributed.

Federal spending records show that both Democrats and Republican share the blame for the increased spending. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress during Obama’s first two years, but Republicans have held the House of Representatives since January 2011.

Further, as noted in the prior PolitiFact piece, much of the debt results from policies set under past presidents and lawmakers. So, the blame falls on both parties.

""It’s true. They both contributed,"" said Ron Haskins, co-director of the Brookings Institution’s Budgeting for National Priorities Project. ""I'm not too worked up about attributing 27 percent to this and 36 percent to that. But, the fact is that both presidents (Obama and George W. Bush) were irresponsible. We’re seeing the impact of that now.""

Our ruling:

Ayotte’s got her numbers right. According to the treasury department’s count, the debt has grown $5.3 trillion since Obama took office in 2009, compared to $4.9 trillion in Bush’s eight years.

Still, analysts say these figures don’t paint a full picture of the root causes of the debt.In her statement, Ayotte doesn’t attribute direct credit or blame, but she did use the speech to blast Obama and his policies.

We rate her claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE59600>],/factchecks/2012/sep/05/kelly-ayotte/did-barack-obama-accrue-more-debt-half-time-george/
"['Economy', 'Small Business', 'Texas', 'Julián Castro']","
Julián Castro says Mitt Romney advised Ohio students to start a business by borrowing from parents, if they have to
","
Making a case for President Barack Obama, Julián Castro said the Republican presidential nominee lacks a common touch.

""Mitt Romney, quite simply, doesn’t get it,"" the San Antonio mayor said in his Sept. 4, 2012, keynote at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. ""A  few months ago, he visited a university in Ohio and gave the students there a little entrepreneurial advice. ‘Start a business,’ he said. ""But how? ‘Borrow money if you have to from your parents.’

""Gee, why didn't I think of that?"" Castro said to delegates’ delight.

Castro continued: ""Some people are lucky enough to borrow money from their parents, but that shouldn't determine whether you can pursue your dreams. I don't think Gov. Romney meant any harm. I think he's a good guy. He just has no idea how good he's had it.""

Did Castro accurately recap Romney’s student advice?

According to news accounts, Romney visited Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio (northeast of Columbus) on April 27, 2012. And, as reported at the time by The Washington Post and other news organizations, the candidate told an auditorium full of students and faculty that Obama’s policies had amounted to an attack on success and on those who aspire to be successful.
                       
""This kind of divisiveness, this attack on success,"" Romney was reported as saying, ""is very different than what we’ve seen in our country’s history. We’ve always encouraged young people, take — take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents. Start a business.""

We checked his quoted comments against a video taken of his 35-minute speech by Marc Kovac, an Ohio reporter for Dix Newspapers. It shows his exhortation occurred toward the end of a presentation otherwise lacing Romney's criticism of Obama’s stewardship of the economy with vows to spur the economy and unite the country. 
But was Romney recommending borrowing money from parents to start a business or to pay for an education or both? His wording and delivery didn’t make it clear.

In fact, the National Journal’s report on the speech said that Romney reported that Romney ""offered a group of college students this advice: If you want to get an education or start a business, borrow money from your parents."" An aide to Romney clarified later that Romney said he was referring to business loans when he suggested students borrow money from their parents,"" and not, the wording indicates, borrowing to go to college. The National Journal amended its story.

In any event, Romney followed his remark at Otterbein U. by citing the example of sandwich chain Jimmy John’s, which owner Jimmy John Liautaud launched by borrowing $20,000 from his father (in return for 48 percent of the business) to start the shop, the Post and New York Daily News reported. The Post account says: ""Liautaud’s father had made the loan on the condition that if his son wasn’t able to return the money, with interest, within a year, he would have to join the Army.""

Romney told the audience that Liautaud’s ""sandwiches are doing pretty well. He’s got shops all over the country and thousands of people who work with him. This is kind of an American experience.""

Asked about Castro’s claim, Romney campaign spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that cherry-picking one statement from one speech, ""a national policy does not make."" Romney, Walker said, has laid out his desires to create more jobs and increase take-home pay. 
Separately, we searched the Nexis database of news coverage and did not unearth other instances of Romney lofting the borrow-from-your-parents' idea.

"['National', 'Taxes', ""Martin O'Malley""]","
Mitt Romney's plan would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class, says Martin O'Malley
","
Martin O’Malley, the Democratic governor of Maryland, made a hard-charging case for President Barack Obama and against Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

""And yet Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan now say they want to take America back. And we have to ask: Back to what? Back to the failed policies that drove us into this deep recession? Back to the days of record job losses? Back to the days when insurance companies called being a woman a ‘pre-existing condition,’ "" O’Malley said, speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.

""No, thank you. I don't want to go back. Do you? Instead of a balanced, achievable plan to create jobs and reduce the deficit, Mitt Romney says, puts forward a plan that would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class.""

We should note O’Malley’s remarks were modified from the advance transcript sent to reporters. In the advance version, O’Malley said more simply, ""Mitt Romney says he will cut taxes for millionaires and raise them for the middle class.""

The idea is clear enough, though: Romney wants to cut taxes for millionaires while raising taxes on the middle class.

So does he?

That’s not how he would explain his own plan. Romney would say he wants lower tax rates for everyone.

But it’s not quite that simple. Let us explain.

Romney’s tax plan

Generally speaking, Romney’s plan would lower tax rates for everyone while getting rid of exemptions, deductions and loopholes. That way, people would pay lower tax rates, but more income would be subject to taxes, so the changes wouldn’t blow a hole in the deficit.

Other ideas from his tax plan: eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax; and cutting the corporate rate to 25 percent.

Romney has said he wants to keep tax rates low on savings and investment, which tend to benefit the millionaires. But he’s also said that people at the high end ""will still pay the same share of the tax burden they’re paying now,"" which suggests he wants to maintain the current progressive system where people pay more taxes as a percentage of income if they make more.

The biggest sticking point -- especially for fact-checkers and independent analysts trying to analyze Romney’s plan -- is that Romney hasn’t specified what exemptions, deductions and loopholes he wants to get rid of. It’s impossible to tell if Romney’s math adds up.

The Tax Policy Center analysis

One group that’s tried to unpack his plan is the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax analysis group that has analyzed tax plans put forward by candidates and officials. The group's report, first published on Aug. 1, 2012, analyzed Romney’s plan by choosing common exemptions and deductions to scrub from the tax code.

The Tax Policy Center had to choose on its own what exemptions and deductions to get rid of, but the analysts tried to select the ones that most conformed to the principles Romney has outlined. (The Tax Policy Center refers to them as ""tax preferences."")

Still, the math didn’t work. If the tax plan is to generate the same amount of revenue and offer across-the-board tax cuts, some exemptions for the middle class would go away. ""As a result, a revenue-neutral reform within these constraints would cut taxes at the high-end while raising them in the middle and perhaps bottom,"" wrote Donald Marron, the center’s director, in a blog post about the study.

Meanwhile, the across-the-board rate reductions would benefit the wealthy, who overall would see lower tax burdens, according to the center’s analysis.

The Obama campaign has used the study as evidence for its claims that Romney’s plan means tax increases for the middle class. When the campaign puts those claims in the proper context, it’s a reasonable point. Romney’s tax plan is lacking in details, and the Tax Policy Center’s conclusions are compelling evidence. Depending on how the Obama team has phrased it, we’ve rated their claims anywhere from Half True to Mostly True.

In this case, O'Malley goes too far to declare Romney’s plan a tax increase on the middle class.

Marron of the Tax Policy Center says there is insufficient evidence for the harsh Democratic talking points that have evolved since the policy center released its report:  ""I don’t interpret (the report) as evidence that Gov. Romney wants to increase taxes on the middle class in order to cut taxes for the rich, as an Obama campaign ad claimed. Instead, I view it as showing that his plan can’t accomplish all his stated objectives. One can charitably view his plan as a combination of political signaling and the opening offer in what would, if he gets elected, become a negotiation.""

Supporters of Romney’s plan have said it’s not fair for the Tax Policy Center to select which tax preferences to get rid of, and that they’re assuming tax increases that aren’t part of Romney’s plan. We reviewed their study and found that it did make assumptions, but that those assumptions tried to give the Romney campaign the benefit of the doubt.

Our ruling

O’Malley said at the Democratic National Convention, ""Mitt Romney . . .  puts forward a plan that would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class."" Actually, Romney’s plan includes across-the-board tax cuts for everyone, including millionaires. It does not specifically include tax increases on the middle class.

But Romney’s tax plan is vague and doesn’t appear to be able to keep all its promises. Romney has said he wants to eliminate deductions while cutting tax rates for everyone; bring in the same amount of revenue for the government; keep a higher burden on the wealthy; and keep low rates on savings and investments. A credible, independent analysis shows these goals are in tension with each other and don’t add up. The Romney campaign has repeatedly declined to offer more specifics.

In the past, the Obama campaign has pointed to this report and framed its claims more carefully, and we’ve given them positive ratings when they’ve done so.

Here, O’Malley is blunter. He says that Romney plan ""would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class."" It might, but that’s not what Romney says his intentions are. Instead, he would like rate cuts for everyone. We rate O’Malley’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC050DC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/05/martin-omalley/mitt-romneys-plan-would-cut-taxes-millionaires-whi/
"['Ohio', 'Taxes', 'Ted Strickland']","
Ted Strickland claims Romney would cut millionaires' taxes by $250,000 but raise them for middle class
","
Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who serves as a national co-chairman of President Obama's re-election campaign, recently made a three-day bus tour of Ohio to deliver the message that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are ""wrong for the middle class.""

Criticizing the economic plans of the Republican ticket, Strickland told a crowd in Kent that Romney's tax plans would ""give an additional $250,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires"" while raising taxes on the middle class, according to an account in the Record-Courier of Portage County.

Obama made a similar claim in Columbus in May, asserting that Romney wanted ""a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country."" On the Truth-O-Meter, that claim rated True.

PolitiFact Ohio asked the Obama campaign how Strickland's wider claim is supported.

In an email, the campaign noted that Strickland also talked about the Ryan budget plan -- the House budget resolution for fiscal 2013 that Ryan proposed -- and said he ""was referencing the Romney-Ryan plan, not just Romney.""

It cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which suggests the plan likely would result in tax cuts for the wealthy, with modest or no benefits for low-income working households.

While some Democrats like to refer to Ryan’s plan as the ""Romney-Ryan plan,"" because Romney has endorsed parts of the Ryan budget, there is no hybrid.

Romney does have his own tax plan, ""and that's the budget plan that we're going to run on,"" he said on ""60 Minutes."" According to his campaign website, the plans include permanently extending the 2001-03 tax cuts, further cutting individual income tax rates by 20 percent, broadening the tax base by reducing tax preferences, eliminating taxation of investment income of most individual taxpayers, reducing the corporate income tax, eliminating the estate tax, and repealing the alternative minimum tax and the taxes enacted in 2010’s health reform legislation.

Romney’s campaign website states that lowering both individual and corporate tax rates will stimulate economic growth.

For an independent assessment of Romney’s plan, we also turned to the Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution, a think tank that, among other things, evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. While judging tax proposals is subject to some degree of interpretation, the Tax Policy Center has a significant degree of respect in tax circles.

The group ran two sets of numbers for Romney's plan. One version, known as ""current policy,"" assumes that the tax cuts initially enacted under President George W. Bush and the alternative minimum tax cuts will be extended, with or without Romney. This method only counts the taxpayer savings from the new proposals in Romney’s tax plan.

The Tax Policy Center found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535.

The other version, known as ""current law,"" essentially gives Romney credit for extending the Bush tax cuts and for an annual adjustment in the alternative minimum tax. Under this calculation, taxpayers’ savings from these two extensions are added to the total tax cuts from Romney’s tax proposal itself. By this method, the average tax cut for someone with cash income north of $1 million a year would be $390,876, according to the Tax Policy Center.

Even using the more restrictive of the Tax Policy Center’s two calculations, Strickland's statement about millionaires, like Obama's, is correct.

But taxes would not increase on the middle class under the plan, said Bob Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Taxes would decrease for most taxpayers, although they would increase on the bottom quintile, or the poorest 20 percent of the country.

Romney has promised that low- and middle-income households will pay no larger shares of federal taxes than they do now. He also said his plan would be revenue neutral, meaning the revenue loss caused by lowering tax rates would be recouped by stimulated economic growth and by reducing or eliminating certain tax deductions and write-offs.

But Romney has not specified what tax preferences he would cut to make up lost revenue.

The Tax Policy Center looked at some of the possibilities in a second study it published Aug. 1 that analyzed the tradeoffs among the goals stated in Romney's plan, including lowering marginal tax rates, maintaining tax revenues and maintaining progressivity.

One of its authors, William Gale, vice president of Brookings and director of its economic studies program, served on President George H.W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. Another, Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings who has a doctorate from Harvard University, served on Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2009 and 2010.

To try and keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs -- starting with the deductions for top earners first -- until they came up with enough revenue to offset the $360 billion in tax cuts that are part of Romney's plan. They also added in the effects of tax changes on economic growth. using a model developed by one of Romney's economic advisers, Harvard professor Greg Mankiw.

They determined that people who earn $1 million or more in taxable income would see an average net tax decrease of $87,117. They’d save $175,961 from Romney's tax cut, but lose $88,444 in deductions.

People who earn between $500,000 and $1 million would see a cut of about $17,000, and taxes for people with income between $200,000 and $500,000 would decrease by about $1,800, the study found.

But to make Romney's plan revenue neutral, deductions would also have to be removed for people with income below $200,000, and the effects of that would be significant, the study found. Eliminating the deductions would mean outright tax increases for everyone with income below $200,000. People with taxable income between $50,000 and $75,000, for example, would see an average net tax increase of $641. They’d save $984 from Romney's rate cut, but lose $2,672 in write-offs.

The authors specifically noted that taxpayers with children whose income is below $200,000 would see their taxes go up by an average of $2,041.

The reason for the increase is that the most popular tax breaks heavily benefit middle- and lower-income families -- the 95 percent of the population who earn less than $200,000 and, for example, carry mortgage debt and use employer-provided health insurance.

Though Romney has suggested he would focus on taking the deductions away from the wealthy, the study concluded that focusing on the top alone would not make up for the revenue sacrificed when rates are slashed.

Unlike John McCain and Obama, whose detailed tax plans were analyzed by the Tax Policy Center in 2008, Romney has presented a ""not well defined"" plan that is ""very explicit about some things and non-specific about others,"" Williams said. ""Given what he has said, it is difficult if not impossible to see a way it would not raise taxes on the middle class.""

Strickland’s claim was that Romney's plan would ""give an additional $250,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires"" while raising taxes to the middle class.

He is partially accurate. A study by the Tax Policy Center about Romney's stated plans found that millionaires would get a $250,000 tax cut. But it also found those plans would cut taxes for the middle class, too, though they would raise them on the lowest-income households.

A second Tax Policy Center study, which used what Romney has said about his tax plan and attempted to calculate outcomes for different groups of taxpayers, found that making the plan revenue neutral would result in smaller tax cuts for millionaires and families with income above $200,000, but would require raising taxes on other households, including the middle class.

As long as the details of the Romney plan remain unknown, the conclusions can't be definite.

But the part of Strickland's statement about millionaires represents tax cuts they would get without accounting for tax deductions and write-offs that could be reduced or eliminated. His statement about the middle class -- who stand to lose more from changes to those deductions than they'd gain by the tax cuts -- includes them.

Those are important details that put the claim in proper context.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Strickland’s claim rates Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC00F240>],/factchecks/2012/sep/05/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-claims-romney-would-cut-millionaire/
"['Afghanistan', 'Rhode Island', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Infrastructure', 'Military', 'David Cicilline']","
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says the United States will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year, on roads, bridges, training police officers and more
","
During last week’s televised clash between U.S. Rep. David Cicilline and Anthony Gemma, who is challenging Cicilline in the 1st Congressional District Democratic primary, the topic turned to possible ways of cutting the federal deficit.

Cicilline, in the WPRI-TV/Providence Journal debate,  urged a swift return of U.S. troops from Afghanistan as one suggestion, noting that  ""We will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year, fixing roads, building bridges, training police officers, and more [and] cutting the same things in our own country.""

His message was clear: it is time for the United States to start redirecting that money toward improving America’s own crumbling infrastructure -- a theme Cicilline has been sounding for months.

But we wondered if the United States was really spending $100 billion a year for Afghan infrastructure and other non-military aid. We called Cicilline campaign for its supporting evidence and while we waited for a response, did some research.

PolitiFact National examined the subject of non-military aid to Afghanistan in May 2012 when it looked at whether President Obama had kept a campaign promise to increase that aid by another $1 billion to $3 billion. (PolitiFact rated it Promise Kept.)

One source of information PolitiFact National cited was a May 2012 Congressional Research Service report,which found that during fiscal years 2001 through 2011-- a span of a decade -- ""the Afghan intervention has cost about $443 billion, including all costs.""

For fiscal year 2012, which ends Sept. 30, the report says, the United States was expected to spend ""about $90 billion"" for military operations and another ""$16 billion in aid,"" including training and equipment.

That’s far different from $100 billion going to just to infrastructure and non-military projects in one year, as Cicilline seemed to be implying.

According to a July quarterly report of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which keeps a running tab of the war’s costs for Congress, ""the President’s FY 2013 budget request includes nearly $9.7 billion to strengthen the Afghan security forces during this critical transition period and to fund programs to build governing capacity, promote economic development, and counter the drug trade.""

The special inspector general’s report also includes a graphicwhich shows that between 2002 and March of 2012, ""the United States had appropriated approximately $89.48 billion for relief and reconstruction in Afghanistan.""  

The money had been allocated into five major areas:
  

In an e-mail, Michael O’Hanlon, director of research and a senior fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said the U.S. would spend ""more than $100 billion"" in Afghanistan this year ""but it’s primarily for our own military forces and their military operations.""

Of that $100 billion about $15 billion ""can be viewed as directly supporting the Afghan economy and Afghan institutions and infrastructure,"" O’Hanlon said.

Ultimately the Cicilline camp responded.

In an e-mail, spokeswoman Nicole Kayner told us the congressman’s quote was accurate because of two barely audible words that viewers likely missed last week and the four judges here at PolitiFact had to have replayed a half dozen times to actually pick up:  ""and more.""

Cicilline, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and should be able to articulate well the difference between military and non-military aid, said the United States ""will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year fixing roads, building bridges, training police officers AND MORE [and] cutting the same things in our own country.""

Kayner said that statement is ""factually accurate"" because ""Our country is spending over a 100 billion dollars a year on roads, bridges, training police officers AND MORE in Afghanistan.""

Our ruling

The stress of debates can prompt a candidate to misspeak and mumble at times, especially when it becomes a slugfest of accusations like last week’s first televised Cicilline-Gemma get-together.

But we believe anyone who watched the debate last week would have had the impression that Cicilline wasn’t talking about the cost of tanks and soldiers and running a war when he raised the $100 billion figure.

He was talking specifically about redirecting money now spent on Afghanistan’s infrastructure and using it on things we’re cutting  ""in our own country"" -- our own crumbling roads and bridges. But we are spending about $15 billion this year for that kind of non-military aid, not $100 billion.

Therefore we rate his statement: False",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA85600>],/factchecks/2012/sep/05/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-united-states-will-spe/
