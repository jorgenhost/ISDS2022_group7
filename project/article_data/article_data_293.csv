No, there was not a man ‘dressed in Muslim garb’ walking in a Notre Dame tower during the fire
","When you combine an international event with the rapid dissemination of news on social media, too often you get loads of misinformation and, sometimes, completely fabricated conspiracy theories. Unfortunately, such is the case with the massive fire that nearly destroyed the historic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris on April 15. French authorities said they have not found evidence of arson and terrorism, and they are treating the fire as an accident that may be linked to an ongoing 6 million-euro renovation project on the church. That still didn’t stop some internet users from suggesting it was some kind of terrorist act – as did one low-quality video clip posted to Facebook by the page ""Equinox News Network."" The 18-second clip shows a man walking in one of the cathedral’s towers not long after the fire started. The video’s caption says: ""No workers present at the time that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire started......So who is this guy dressed in Muslim garb??"" The video post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The person in the picture isn’t dressed in ""Muslim garb"" — the person is a firefighter. The clip was plucked from CNBC’s three-hour livestream of the fire and can be seen around the 42-minute mark. Because the clip used in the Facebook post is blurry, pixelated and cropped, it’s difficult to make out the firefighter's uniform or see the wider angle of water hoses being employed to the right of the tower. When viewing the official, full-length video, the man’s yellow vest and helmet are clear and, moments later, several more firefighters show up in the same area.   The clip was also shared on Twitter, and European fact-checking outfits FactCheck EU and Check News both called out the bogus claim that a lone man was up to something sinister in the tower. ""No, there was no ‘lone man in a yellow vest’ in one of the Notre-Dame towers,"" FactCheck EU tweeted. ""A low quality video was the basis of the bogus claim that a mysterious man in a yellow vest was in a tower. This higher quality image shows that it's a fireman. Firefighters were already on the scene."" 6.

Heitz also said that Paris police had already mobilized nearly 50 investigators to look into the fire and that investigators have started to interview about 15 workers who were working at the cathedral as part of the 6 million-euro ($6.8 million) renovation. The Paris fire brigade has been quoted as saying the blaze may be ""potentially linked"" to the project. A video clip posted on social media showed a man walking alone in one of Notre Dame’s towers ""dressed in Muslim garb."" The clip is from an authentic media live stream of the Notre Dame fire, but displays a lower-quality and cropped version that doesn’t allow the viewer to clearly see it was a firefighter. The clip also doesn’t last long enough to show other firefighters who show up in the same area moments later, and is cropped to omit the water hoses being used to fight the fire. French authorities are conducting an investigation into the fire, but preliminary reports, so far, deem the cause as accidental, pointing to a possible link to the cathedral’s renovation project.

"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Dan Patrick']","
Texas Constitution requires lawmakers to stay under the spending limit
","A panel of Texas lawmakers soon will meet behind closed doors to iron out the state budget for the next two years, now that the $248 billion proposal has been amended by lawmakers in the House and Senate. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, celebrated the Senate approving the latest version of the proposal in a news release on April 9. ""Like every budget passed by the Senate since I have been lieutenant governor, Senate Bill 1 is within the spending limit set by the Texas Constitution,"" Patrick said. Patrick’s claim is accurate, but it doesn’t reveal much. Given that the spending limit is a constitutional requirement, lawmakers have only ever voted to exceed it once, to secure additional funds for public schools. Texas Constitution has four spending caps The Texas Constitution has four limitations on state spending, according to the Legislative Budget Board. In simplified terms, they are: Alejandro Garcia, a spokesman for Patrick, said the budget proposal approved by the Senate this month is ""significantly below both"" the pay-as-you-go limit and the spending limit. A summary of the appropriations bill from the Legislative Budget Board shows that the bill is $1.3 billion short of reaching the more than $119 billion pay-as-you-go limit for general revenue spending and is $7.9 billion short of the $100 billion spending limit. It is also within the debt and welfare limits. Budget experts said Patrick seemed to be emphasizing the spending limit outlined above, the only one of the above caps that lawmakers have exceeded in the past. This limit prevents lawmakers from allocating funding in certain categories at a higher rate than the anticipated growth rate of the state’s economy, a calculation determined by lawmakers who serve on the Legislative Budget Board before each session. The limit only applies to nondedicated revenue: state sales tax revenue that is not constitutionally required to go towards specific programs. Lawmakers are allowed to exceed the limit if they meet three requirements: if they find ""that an emergency exists,"" if both chambers approve the expense with a majority vote and if the proposed allocation does not cause the total budget to exceed the pay-as-you-go limit outlined above. Exceeding the spending limit is seen as politically risky and is incredibly rare. Lawmakers have only voted once to exceed the limit since this provision was added to the state Constitution in 1978. It happened in 2007, as lawmakers looked to pay for tax cuts they had promised a year earlier. In order to reduce local school property taxes, the state had to give more money to schools to cover the loss in tax revenue. Patrick’s claim is accurate, doesn’t say much This means Patrick’s claim is accurate. He took office as lieutenant governor in 2015 and, in the three sessions since then, the Senate has not approved legislation allowing the state to exceed the spending limit. But it’s also accurate to say that every budget passed by both the Senate and the House since 1978, when this limit was added to the Constitution, was under the spending limit, except for in 2007 when lawmakers voted to exceed the limit to fund public schools. Patrick, who was serving as a senator in 2007, voted against the resolution to exceed the spending limit. Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, said given that the limit is constitutionally mandated and lawmakers have only voted to exceed it once, Patrick’s claim doesn’t reveal much about his victories as a budget-writer. ""It's like me saying I woke up this morning and took a shower and came to work,"" she said. ""That's what I do every day."" Our rating Patrick said, ""Like every budget passed by the Senate since I have been lieutenant governor, Senate Bill 1 is within the spending limit set by the Texas Constitution."" He’s right. It’s also true that lawmakers have only ever opted to exceed this limit once since it was added to the Constitution.

Do all North Carolina teachers get a work-free lunch break?
","A North Carolina lawmaker has introduced a bill to give teachers a daily lunch break. ""Proud to enter a bill today HB 563 allowing for 1/2 hour duty free lunch break for all Teachers,"" said state Rep. John Torbett, a Republican from District 108, which includes Gaston County, in an April 3 tweet. ""Couldn’t believe they did not already have one."" We couldn’t believe it either, so we decided to check it out for ourselves. As it turns out, North Carolina’s teachers don’t actually get much of a break for lunch. They often spend the ""break"" working. First, a note about terminology: A lunch break is considered duty-free when the teacher is totally free from work-related obligations while he or she eats. Teachers are supposed to get this type of break through a provision in the North Carolina General Assembly’s School-Based Management and Accountability Program that says every school must develop a ""school improvement plan"" for approval by the local board of education. In 2006, the legislature passed House Bill 1151, which called for these school improvement plans to specifically include ""a plan to provide a duty-free lunch period for every teacher on a daily basis or as otherwise approved by the school improvement team."" But Mark Jewell, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, said the state requirement that schools create a plan to give teachers duty-free lunch ""has no teeth to it."" In practice, many teachers still work while they eat their sandwiches. Angie Scioli, a social studies teacher at Wake County’s Leesville Road High School and the founder of Red4EdNC, a group helping to organize the May 1 teacher march in Raleigh, said lunch breaks vary by school. At Leesville Road, 25 minutes of every one-hour lunch period is reserved for students to get extra help or make up missed assignments. But those assignments often bleed into the rest of the hour, forcing teachers to choose between helping students or getting a true lunch break, Scioli said. ""Students who are doing make-up work are almost never done in 25 minutes with a test, for example, that’s supposed to take 80 minutes,"" she said. ""I can tell the student to stop taking the test and wait a week to finish the test, or I can just give them my lunch period."" Regular lunch-breaks are even less typical for elementary school teachers, who do not work on a block schedule but instead manage one group of students all day, said Jewell. ""Educators are eating with their students during lunchtime, and if they happen to have any type of break during the day, it’s because of a rotation — art, music, physical education,"" he said. Torbett’s House Bill 563 — which is co-sponsored by 21 Democrats — would guarantee a work-free lunch break for teachers, if passed. First, it would simplify the language of House Bill 1151 to require that all school improvement plans include ""a plan to provide a minimum of 30 minutes for a duty-free lunch period on a daily basis for every teacher."" Second, it would also amend a separate law — which currently gives teachers duty-free instructional planning time under certain conditions — to require that they also receive ""at least 30 minutes of duty-free lunch time on a daily basis."" ""State law requires schools to have a plan for a duty-free lunch as part of their school improvement plan,"" said Drew Elliot, communications director for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. ""However, there is no provision in the law that actually requires schools to have duty-free lunches for teachers. This bill seems to correct that oversight."" It’s not entirely clear that this change would completely solve the problem, however. Scioli said duty-free lunch statutes may not be totally effective unless they are paired with sufficient funding and enough staff to supervise students. But at least in theory, Torbett’s bill promises teachers a guaranteed, work-free lunch break. (Torbett did not respond to several requests for comment.) Torbett said North Carolina teachers do not currently get a ""duty free lunch break."" He’s right. The current law doesn’t guarantee that all teachers actually enjoy a duty-free lunch. In reality, Scioli and Jewell said many teachers eat while supervising their students or working themselves. We rate this statement True.

Did states with campus-carry laws see enrollment drop?
","During their most recent legislative session, West Virginia lawmakers took up a bill that would require colleges in the state to allow students to carry guns on campus as long as they possess a concealed carry permit. The bill ultimately passed the House, largely on party lines, before falling in the Senate. During the House debate, one Democratic delegate, Andrew Byrd, argued that passing the bill could keep students from enrolling in the first place. ""The states that have passed (a campus carry law) have seen enrollment drop significantly,"" Byrd said, according to an account in WVNews.com. ""We need to encourage people to come to our state, not be afraid to come to our state."" Has there been a significant enrollment drop in states that have passed a campus carry bill? We took a closer look. When we contacted Byrd, he pointed to an article in the Houston Chronicle about international student enrollment declining in Texas, a state that has enacted a campus carry law. ""International applications to Texas' four-year public universities have plummeted over the past year by at least 10,000, a 12.5 percent decrease from last fall, according to a Houston Chronicle review of university data,"" the article said. The article cited possible explanations by experts, including Jeff Fuller, a former admissions director at the University of Houston. The most prominent explanations were ""a sluggish global economy,"" ""greater competition from other countries,"" and ""President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric,"" which Fuller said ""has made some international students uncomfortable."" A less prominent explanation in the article was Texas’ campus carry law, with Fuller saying it was ""a sticking point for some applicants."" However, this is not especially strong evidence to support Byrd’s assertion. Byrd said ""states,"" but Texas is just one state. He also didn’t specify international student enrollment, which the article did. It’s also not clear that campus carry was the primary factor driving Texas’ decline. So we decided to take a broader look at states that enacted campus carry. Pedro Ribeiro, a spokesman for the Association of American Universities, said his group had no systematic data on the issue. So we dug through the numbers ourselves, state by state. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states explicitly ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus, while in 23 others, the decision is left up to each college or university. For instance, Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., allows campus carry despite the absence of a state law. Tennessee, meanwhile, allows the right for faculty members but not students or the public. Here, we’ll focus on the remaining 10 states that have either legislation or court rulings that allow the carrying of concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses: Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. (Private schools are not included in the data because they are not required to follow the same guidelines.) When we looked at the data state by state, we found that public university enrollment trends in campus carry states have been, at best, inconsistent. Some states actually saw an increase after the law came into effect. We did not assess Arkansas, because we could not find data for the relevant period. Four states -- Colorado, Kansas, Oregon, and Wisconsin -- did see decreases after passage, though they were fairly small. The campus carry law in Colorado took effect in 2010. Between that year and 2015, the most recent year available, enrollment fell by 5.8 percent. In Kansas, the campus carry law has only been in effect for a little over a year. Between 2017 and 2018, the enrollment decrease was 1.1 percent. Oregon initially saw a 2.9 percent increase in enrollment in 2011, the year its campus carry bill came into effect. Since then, enrollment has fallen by 4.6 percent. Wisconsin’s campus carry law also came into effect in 2011. Through 2015, the most recent year available, enrollment declined by 8.8 percent. Two states saw no clear pattern in their enrollment figures. Mississippi’s campus carry law took effect in 2010. For the first year, the number rose. Enrollment dropped for the next three years, then increased again in 2015, the most recent year with available data. Utah saw an increase after its campus carry law took effect in 2004. Since then, there was a three-year decrease, followed by a four-year increase, another decrease in 2012, an increase in 2013, and another decrease in 2014, the last year for which data is available. The remaining three states actually saw increases in their enrollment. Texas passed its campus carry law in 2016 but data shows a 2.9 increase in enrollment between 2015 and 2017. Georgia’s campus carry law took effect in 2017. Enrollment has increased by 2.2 percent since before the law. Finally, Idaho’s enrollment rose by about 11 percent after its campus carry law took effect in 2014. The most recent data for Idaho runs through 2015. To sum up: Four of the nine states we looked at saw fairly consistent enrollment declines after a campus carry law took effect, while two showed no consistent pattern and three saw enrollment increases. In other words, there was a lot of variability, contrary to what Byrd said. But even in the cases of the states with modest declines, it’s not clear that gun laws were the driving force. Many other factors -- such as the size of a state’s college-age population, whether universities are expanding or contracting their offerings, and broader economic forces -- can affect enrollment numbers. For instance, improving economic conditions after the Great Recession may have led some students to take jobs rather than enroll in college. David Bills, a University of Iowa sociologist who studies education, said it’s not impossible that there could be some relationship between campus carry and enrollment declines, but he said he’s never seen research on this question. ""Establishing a causal relationship between a particular law and enrollment trends would demand a very rigorous research design,"" Bills said. ""The standard of evidence would have to be pretty high. … If that research exists now, I'm not aware of it."" Byrd said, ""The states that have passed (campus carry laws) have seen enrollment drop significantly."" His evidence for this assertion was one newspaper article that speculated that campus carry was a reason why international enrollment has declined in Texas. But that’s a far narrower finding than he indicated -- and other factors have as good a claim, if not a better one, for being the driver of that decline. When we looked at the numbers more broadly, there is no consistent pattern in states’ enrollment fluctuations following the enactment of campus carry laws. In fact, a slight majority of states either saw increases or a zig-zagging trend line. And even in the states where enrollment dropped, it is hard to say that campus carry was the reason.

How much debt does Missouri still owe on the formerly named Edward Jones Dome?
","When Stan Kroenke moved the St. Louis Rams to Los Angeles back in 2016, he left behind a jaded fanbase and significant debt payments on the 23-year-old Dome at America's Center (formerly known as the Edward Jones Dome), a stadium that no longer had a tenant. The stadium still sits empty today and is only scheduled to host three events for the remainder of the year.    State Sen. Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg, is sponsoring SB 44, a bill that proposes legalizing sports gambling in Missouri. The bill proposes taking 0.5% of all bets as an integrity fee and placing that revenue into a fund to pay for taxpayer-funded improvements to sports venues, including The Dome at America's Center. In a Columbia Daily Tribune article published on Jan. 31, Hoskins talked about the proposed bill and the debt payments on The Dome at America's Center. ""Missouri still owes $60 million on bonds issued to build the 23-year-old Edward Jones Dome, the former home of the St. Louis Rams,"" Hoskins noted. Do Missourians really still owe $60 million on a vacated stadium? We reached out to Hoskins to see where his numbers came from. His chief of staff Rachel Bauer clarified that the senator was ""a little high"" in his estimate and pointed to the state budget for the correct numbers. Back in 1991, before construction began on the stadium, the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority issued $132,910,000 of Convention and Sports Facility Project Bonds to pay for the project. The debt has been refinanced multiple times, most recently in 2013 when the principal remaining on the debt was $64.385 million. This is possibly where Sen. Hoskins got the $60 million figure. However, after examining the 2018 State Debt Report, the principal remaining on the debt was $35.45 million as of last July. This number is comprised of three roughly $10 million payments from 2019-2021, and a $5 million payment in 2022. Besides the principal on the debt, the state owes an additional $2 million per year for maintenance until 2024, per the original financing agreement. That all adds up to a total of $47.45 million still owed by the state of Missouri, a far cry from the $60 million that Hoskins cited. While that is the total contribution still required of the state, the 2018 State Debt Report spells out what St. Louis still owes on the bonds. ""In addition to the State’s contribution, St. Louis County and the City of St. Louis each pay $5 million for principal and interest and $1 million for maintenance each year. Payments began in fiscal year 1992 and conclude in fiscal year 2022."" Hoskins noted that Missouri still owes $60 million on bonds issued to build The Dome at America’s Center. However, Hoskins’ chief of staff noted that his estimate was high and the 2018 State Debt Report shows that Missouri only owes $47.45 million on those bonds as opposed to the $60 million Hoskins claimed. This is a simple numbers claim and Hoskins was high on his estimate. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/apr/16/denny-hoskins/how-much-debt-does-missouri-still-owe-formerly-nam/

Joe Biden cites study that found 25 percent of ankle sprain patients in ERs were prescribed opioids
","Former Vice President Joe Biden said that part of the opioid epidemic is fueled by doctors who over prescribe. Biden, a University of Pennsylvania presidential professor of practice expected to soon launch a bid for president, cited one research paper that pointed to a high number of prescriptions for a minor injury. ""People show up in the emergency room with a sprained ankle, 25 percent of them get an opioid prescription,"" Biden said during a panel discussion on the opioid epidemic at Penn on April 11. Pennsylvania is among the states with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths. Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids were five times higher in 2017 than in 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Biden was referring to a study by Penn doctors published in the journal Annals of Emergency Medicine in 2017. The study found that that about one in four ankle sprain patients who were treated in emergency rooms received an opioid prescription. But Biden left out the good news: The study found that prescribing rates in emergency departments were falling. The researchers and  identified all first-time adult patients with ankle sprains between 2011 and 2015, relying on claims data of privately insured U.S. patients. The study included 30,832 patients treated in the emergency department for an ankle sprain who had not filled a prescription for opioids in the previous six months. The researchers chose ankle sprains because they are common minor injuries that generally improve after a short amount of time with rest, ice, elevation and over the counter medication, such as ibuprofen. Nationally, they found the median prescription rate was 24.1 percent for those years. The rate declined during the study period, from 28.1 percent in 2011 to 20.4 percent in 2015. Although the prescriptions declined, the prescription rate and regional differences gave researchers reasons for concern. ""The prescribing rate was greater than 10 times higher in some states versus others,"" the study says. ""This is concerning because ankle sprains are a minor, self-limited condition for which there is likely to be little clinical benefit from opioids."" The researchers compared prescribing rates in the states with expected rates, factoring in demographics and socioeconomic factors and chronic medical conditions. They found varying rates in the states, ranging from 40 percent in Arkansas to 3 percent in North Dakota, in 2014 and 2015. Above-average rates were largely in the South. It’s hard to pinpoint why the rates vary by area. Factors could include differences in clinician culture and patient expectations and differences in state prescribing guidelines, said M. Kit Delgado, lead author of the study and Penn assistant professor of emergency medicine and epidemiology.   Other research from around the same time also indicates a high rate of opioid prescriptions. Scott Weiner, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Harvard, pointed to his study that examined emergency department patients treated during a single week across the country in 2012. Researchers found 17 percent of discharged patients were prescribed opioid pain relievers. The most common diagnoses associated with opioid pain reliever prescribing were back pain, abdominal pain, extremity fracture or sprain. However, much has changed since 2015, the end of the study period for the Penn study, Weiner told PolitiFact. ""There has been a total sea change in our approach to opioid prescribing since then,"" he said. Weiner and co-authors looked at the 2012 implementation of opioid prescribing guidelines in Ohio. They found that prescriptions were dropping precipitously before the emergency department guideline implementation, and even more so afterward. In the two emergency departments where Weiner works, he said opioid prescriptions issued at discharge have dropped from about 600 per month in July 2015 to 150 in February 2019. The CDC found that the overall national opioid prescribing rate declined from 2012 to 2017, and in 2017, the prescribing rate had fallen to the lowest it had been in more than 10 years. The American College of Emergency Physicians is working with emergency departments around the country to implement a program for opioid alternatives. ""There is now a recognition that opioids are harmful and that alternatives to opioids work just finem"" Weiner said. ""So now, ankle sprains get a splint, crutches (if needed), ice, elevation, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc., and patients do fine."" Biden said, ""People show up in the emergency room with a sprained ankle, 25 percent of them get an opioid prescription."" A national study found nearly one in four patients with ankle sprains were prescribed opioids in the emergency department from 2011 to 2015. But rates fell during that time period, to about 20 percent of patients treated for ankle sprains in 2015. More awareness about overprescribing and strengthened state guidelines appear to be driving the decline, experts said.

Warner omits VCU from Final Four hoops history
","At 64, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner still mixes it up on the basketball court, elbowing under the boards, talking trash, and chiding himself when he misses a shot. Warner was beaming on April 9, the day after the University of Virginia beat Texas Tech in overtime to win the NCAA men’s basketball championship. ""They brought glory to Virginia and they did it in a way the people will remember for a long, long time,"" Warner, D-Va., said during an interview with WHSV TV-3 of Harrisonburg. No college in Virginia had won the men’s tournament before, and Warner said it had been ages since one had even made the semifinals ""We’ve not had a Virginia team even in the Final Four in over a decade,"" he said. ""I think George Mason (University) was the last one, in on a kind of wild ride they took."" We ran Warner’s claim through the Truth-O-Meter. George Mason did make the Final Four in 2006, to great surprise. None of the players was taller than 6 feet 7, none went on to play in the NBA. Although the Patriots finished the regular seasons with a 22-6 record, their at-large selection to the NCAA tournament was criticized by CBS basketball announcer Billy Packer, who thought them undeserving. The Patriots beat Michigan State in the first round, then upset defending champion North Carolina after falling behind 16-2. Next, they topped Wichita State, then got to the Final Four by upsetting top-seeded Connecticut in overtime. The semifinals did not go well. GMU lost to Florida, the eventual champion, 73-58. Contrary to Warner, however, there was a another state team that made it to the Final Four before UVa this year. And it happened in the last decade. Warner forgot about Virginia Commonwealth University in 2011. The Rams were no sure bet to chosen to play in the tournament; they were 23-11 and had finished fourth in their conference standings. Sportscaster Dick Vitale called VCU’s  inclusion in the tourney ""an injustice, totally unfair...It would be like a beauty contest. Roseanne Barr walking in, versus Scarlett Johansson. No shot. None whatsoever."" But once play began, VCU went on a tear with their ""havoc"" defense under coach Shaka Smart. First came double-figure wins against Southern California, Georgetown and Purdue. Next, was a 72-71 overtime win over Florida State. To get to the Final Four, they upset top-seeded Kansas, 71-61. An estimated 1,000 VCU students spilled out on Broad Street that night in raucous celebration. The team returned to Richmond the next day and was greeted by 5,000 fans. VCU struggled to meet the demand for Final Four t-shirts in the school’s black and gold colors. Again, however, the dream ended in the semifinals. VCU lost to Butler, 70-62. Two days later, Connecticut beat Butler for the national championship. How could Warner forget the Rams? He suggests that upsets in the 2011 tourney - including those by VCU - caused him to crash in prediction pools. ""If your bracket got blown up as bad as mine did in 2011, you’d probably block out all memory of that tournament, too,"" he said in an email. ""I guess these are the problems you have when you come from a Commonwealth with so many great teams."" We should note we found another inaccuracy in Warner’s TV interview that also hints college basketball has taken has taken a back seat in the senator’s mind to stuff like U.S. intelligence operations, banking laws and technology. Warner inflated Virginia Tech’s performance in this year’s tournament, ""The Hokies came within one basket of also getting into the Final Four,"" he said. In fact, Tech lost by two points to Duke in the Sweet 16 round. The Hokies would have had to win that game and one more to get to the Final Four. Our ruling Warner said other than University of Virginia’s 2019 basketball team, ""We’ve not had a Virginia team even in the Final Four in over a decade. I think George Mason was the last one…"" We’re calling a foul. VCU made the Final Four in 2011 - less than a decade ago.

U.S. spends 1,000 times more on war than peace, presidential candidate Marianne Williamson says
","Self-help author and Oprah Winfrey confidante Marianne Williamson is one of the many Democrats running for president in 2020. She was asked recently on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" about defense issues. Co-host Willie Geist wanted to know about Williamson’s ability to be commander-in-chief and how she would change the direction of the two-decade U.S. war in Afghanistan. In responding, the 66-year-old Californian made a claim we want to fact-check. ""For every dollar we spend on actual peace creation,"" she said, ""we spend over $1,000 on ways to prepare for war."" Williamson has also made the claim on the campaign trail in New Hampshire and on Twitter. U.S. military spending, of course, is quantifiable  — although people can argue over how much of that is preparing for war, as Williamson put it. Maybe even more difficult: How do you count what the nation spends on ""peace creation""? ""My sense is that it is an absolutely true AND absolutely indefensible statement,"" said David Hooker, a professor at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame. ""The facts will be easy to assemble depending on what are the types of expenses we identify as specifically preparing for peace or preparing for war ... . Facts and truth, in this instance, are not the same category of material."" Other experts agree that the spending ratio can vary wildly, depending on what you consider to be part of peace or part of war. At the same time, it’s clear the nation spends much less on peace-building. What the Williamson campaign sent us to back up the candidate’s statement is essentially just another claim  — and it applies to world spending, not U.S. spending. That claim, made in 2011 by the Friends Committee on National Legislation, an anti-war lobby in Washington, D.C., is that the world spends $1 on conflict prevention for every $1,885 spent on military budgets. Theo Sitther, a staff member at the committee, told us he doesn’t know how the two figures were calculated. But he said Williamson’s overall point is ""sound,"" given studies that he said indicate that every $1 spent on conflict resolution saves the world $16 on the costs of conflict. We found several other different ways to look at the numbers. All have limitations. We'll start by acknowledging that U.S. spending on its military is, indeed, huge. In its latest annual report on global military spending, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said U.S. military spending was $610 billion in 2017. That was the same amount as in 2016  — but more than the next seven highest-spending countries combined. The institute does not track peace spending, however. Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, pointed out to us that the $610 billion is more than 2,000 times larger than the $299 million the United States spent in 2016 on ""civilian peacebuilding, conflict prevention and resolution,"" according to a 2018 report. That report was done by the European Centre for Development Policy Management, which describes itself as a ""think tank that wants to make policies in Europe and Africa work for inclusive and sustainable development."" But Kenny agreed the devil is in the details. ""Given the link between poverty and civil conflict, one might argue that any spending that encourages development is helping to build peace. Similarly, U.S. Defense Department expenditures on logistics capacity, in particular, is really important to supporting a bunch of peacekeeping operations,"" he said.   ""On the other hand, effective subsidy of munitions going to help Saudi Arabia bomb Yemen, and U.S. Air Force assistance in refueling Saudi bombers, are not so good for peace, and I wouldn’t call that spending ‘preparing for war’ as much as fueling war."" Caroline Hughes, chair of peace studies at Notre Dame, said another comparison is starting with U.S. military spending, which is pegged at $989 billion for the 2019-’20 fiscal year -- if you count the base budget of the Defense Department, contingency operations overseas to fight the Islamic State and other funding, including certain funds for the departments of State, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security. That amount is nearly 1,000 times more than the $1.8 billion in contributions the United States made to United Nations peacekeeping operations in 2017-’18. But Hughes  — who said ""you could debate endlessly the precise list of activities that you wanted to include on either list""  — acknowledged: ""You could, of course, challenge this as a fairly crude metric."" When Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, responded to our inquiry about Williamson’s claim, he found a much smaller ratio. Citing figures from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, Harrison said that in fsical 2019, the United States is spending $726 billion on national defense (including discretionary and mandatory spending) -- a little less than 10 times the $75 billion being spent on diplomacy and international relations. But he acknowledged that ""peace creation"" could be defined more narrowly, which would make for a larger ratio. Meanwhile, Taxpayers for Common Sense vice president Steve Ellis, a federal budget expert in Washington, told us there is simply too much vagueness in Williamson’s statement. ""What is ‘peace creation’ in the budget? Is it diplomacy? Foreign aid?"" he asked. ""Some would argue nuclear deterrence is ‘peace creation’ – and what is ‘prepare for war’ in the budget? Is that the entire Department of Defense budget?"" Ellis added: ""Much more is spent on the military than on diplomacy and aid,"" but ""I don’t see how you get to the $1,000."" Williamson said: ""For every dollar we spend on actual peace creation, we spend over $1,000 on ways to prepare for war."" Experts told us that  — depending on how you define the vague terms of peace creation and preparing for war  — it’s possible to show a ratio that large in federal spending. But other calculations put the ratio well below 1,000 to 1. Williamson’s comment suggests a precision that doesn’t exist.

Howard Schultz's flawed swipe at partisan combat over immigration
","Howard Schultz is the founder of Starbucks coffee and is now considering a third-party bid for the presidency. He’s premised his campaign on the idea that the two parties are incapable of governing and that an independent president would be better positioned to do so. ""We believe the two-party system is broken and no longer working well for most Americans,"" says the ""Get Involved"" page on his website. ""It's time for a fresh start — with more civility, cooperation, and creativity in Washington, D.C."" He repeated that theme during a Fox News town hall on April 4 after an audience member asked him about immigration policy: ""President Bush 43 and President Obama both, while they were president, submitted to Congress an immigration bill. In both cases, the opposition took that bill, rejected it, and would not pass it. ... So why didn’t it work? It did not work because the other party was unwilling to provide the president and his party a victory. And that is the problem that existed then, and that is the problem that existed now."" Schultz has a point about Republican opposition to Obama’s legislative effort in 2013. But he’s wrong that Democrats blocked Bush’s efforts in 2006 and 2007. In fact, Bush and Democrats were, for the most part, allies in trying to pass the immigration bill, while many Republicans were opposed. (Schultz’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 included provisions to strengthen border security with fencing, vehicle barriers, surveillance technology and more personnel; a new temporary worker visa category; and a path to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally if they met specific criteria. As we’ve noted, the measure passed in the Senate on May 25, 2006, on a 62-36 vote. Bush commended the Senate ""for passing bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform."" The Senate vote featured stronger support from Democrats than from the president’s own Republican Party. Democrats provided 38 yes votes, compared to just four Democratic votes against. The Republicans gave 23 votes in favor but 32 against. (One Independent voted for the bill.) In addition, the bill was never taken up by the Republican-controlled House, whose leaders disliked the path to legal status. Instead of voting on the Senate bill, House Republican leaders held a series of summer ""field hearings"" to get the public to weigh in on controversial provisions that Republicans labeled as ""amnesty."" ''Our No. 1 priority is to secure the border,'' then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, of Illinois, said in June 2006. ""And right now I haven't heard a lot of pressure to have a path to citizenship.'' In September 2006, after meeting with Republican leaders, Hastert said they agreed ""that we cannot support totally"" a lot of the provisions in the Senate bill, because it ""would not secure the border. Matter of fact, it erased the border."" So Schultz is wrong about the 2006 legislative effort. In 2007, Bush backed a similar bill, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. That bill never got a Senate vote because it didn’t muster the 60 votes necessary to cut off debate. The vote to cut off debate attracted 34 yes votes and 61 no votes. Of the yes votes, Democrats supplied all of them. All 47 Republicans voted to oppose cutting off debate, as did a minority of Democrats -- 14. Later that month, senators made another effort. This version got 46 votes in favor and 53 against. Among Democrats, 34 voted yes and 16 voted no, while among Republicans, 12 voted yes and 37 voted no. Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, generally agreed that Schultz was wrong about Democrats killing Bush’s immigration efforts. That said, he did point to the actions of a few Democrats who effectively threw sand in the gears, playing a role, at least on the margins, in the 2007 bill’s demise. Ironically enough, one of these was Obama, then a senator, who backed an amendment sponsored by then-Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. The Dorgan amendment ""gutted a portion of the bill and Republican support for the proposal along with it,"" Nowrasteh has written. ""The poison pill amendment passed 49 to 48 thanks to then-Senator Obama’s unexpected support."" Separately, some Democrats in the left wing of their party expressed concerns about the guest worker provisions in the bill, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in the Senate. Still, looking at the final numbers, Democrats were far more likely to join with Bush in favor of the bill than Republicans were, which undermines Schultz’s assertion. ""Bush was supported by the Democrats, but members of his own party would not get on board,"" said David Shirk, a political scientist at the University of San Diego. The 2013 legislative effort under Obama is the one where Schultz is more accurate. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, backed by Obama, directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. It also included provisions to allow immigrants in the country illegally to adjust their immigration status, if they met certain criteria. This measure passed the Senate on a 68-32 vote on June 27, 2013. All 54 Democrats voting cast a yes vote. Among Republicans, 14 voted for the bill and 32 voted against it. ""The bipartisan bill that passed today was a compromise … Today, the Senate did its job. It’s now up to the House to do the same,"" Obama said. But House Republicans once again opposed the Senate immigration proposal, arguing that border security needed to be addressed first before legalizing the status of millions of immigrants. ""I’ve made it clear and I’ll make it clear again, the House does not intend to take up the Senate bill,"" then-House Speaker John Boehner said July 2013. ""The House is going to do its own job in developing an immigration bill."" He reiterated his position in November 2013: ""The idea that we’re going to take up a 1,300-page bill that no one had ever read, which is what the Senate did, is not going to happen in the House,"" Boehner said. ""And frankly, I’ll make clear we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill."" The ""zero-sum"" logic that Schultz is thinking of ""does arise on other bills, but immigration is a different topic,"" Koger said. In this case, ""Schultz has picked the wrong issue"" to make his point."" Schultz said Bush and Obama each tried to get immigration bills passed, but ""it did not work because the other party was unwilling to provide the president and his party a victory."" Republicans did effectively derail Obama’s 2013 immigration efforts, but in both 2006 and 2007, it was Democrats who were much more likely to side with Bush and Republicans -- his own party -- that opposed him. The facts don’t support Schultz’s argument about partisanship, so we rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/apr/15/howard-schultz/howard-schultzs-flawed-swipe-partisan-combat-immig/
"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Mick Mulvaney']","
Mulvaney: Trump brought down drug prices for the first time in 50 years
","President Donald Trump announced last month that the GOP will become ""the party of health care"" and news reports suggest he intends to make it a top issue in his reelection campaign. So when Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, touted the administration’s work on prescription drug prices — a hot-button issue that has drawn scrutiny from across the political spectrum, and one that voters say should be a top priority — we were intrigued. On ""Fox News Sunday"" April 7, Mulvaney said: ""Drug prices in this country actually came down last year for the first time in 50 years. That’s because Donald Trump’s president."" This statement is particularly hard to prove affirmatively. Drug prices are measured through a host of metrics and affected by all sorts of political and economic forces. We reached out to the White House for more explanation. Its staff directed us to a report published last October by its Council of Economic Advisers, as well as to data suggesting the consumer price index for prescription drugs declined in January 2019 compared with January 2018. But experts who reviewed that data said it doesn’t necessarily support Mulvaney’s claim — and certainly not by the magnitude he suggests. A broad brush, and some missing data We interviewed five experts who all agreed that, no matter which metric was used, evidence is lacking to unequivocally say drug prices decreased last year. The most generous reading came from Matthew Fiedler, a health economist at the Brookings Institution: It’s ""within spitting distance of something that’s true."" But with more examination, the claim’s veracity became murkier. ""Drug prices"" can refer to many things: a list price, a net price (what is paid after rebates, or the discounts negotiated by insurers or other payers), the pharmacy’s price or total national spending on prescription drugs. Let’s start with the latter. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows total spending on prescription drug prices has climbed during the past several years. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) In 2018, total spending continued to grow, just at a slower pace. That’s a positive trend, experts noted, but it isn’t the same thing as spending going down. ""It doesn’t mean we’re spending less money on drugs than before,"" said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. We also examined the CPI data the White House provided. It could suggest that in the past year prescription drugs’ list prices have indeed dropped, and even by a meaningful amount. But the CPI data doesn’t account for whether manufacturers lowering their list prices have also changed the size of the rebates they provide. That’s essential information in understanding if the real price of a drug — what insurance pays and, ultimately, what consumers pay — has actually changed. These trend lines also vary depending on the 12-month period they cover, argued Walid Gellad, an associate health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh. January to January could show a list price decrease, but July to July could show an increase. Plus, the CPI data includes only drugs sold through retail, or about three-fourths of all prescriptions. That excludes many high-priced specialty meds sold only via mail order, argued Michael Rea, who heads Rx Savings Solutions, a consulting firm. It also paints with a broad brush — obscuring, many said, just how many list prices are continuing to climb. This year, the list price of more than 3,000 drugs went up, while the price of only 117 went down, according to data compiled by Rx Savings Solutions. Last year, an analysis by the Associated Press revealed that, from January to July, 4,412 branded drug prices went up, while 46 were cut. So, Mulvaney’s downward price claim didn’t come out of thin air. But interpreting the data to mean that drug prices are down ignores crucial parts of the prescription drug marketplace. The White House’s work Mulvaney also said Trump has played a key role in bringing down drug prices. When we asked the administration what he meant, a spokesman pointed to their efforts to bring more generic drugs to market — a boost the White House said has fueled competition and helped make lower-price alternatives available to consumers. But there’s no evidence yet to suggest that the boost in generic drug approvals has that effect. Experts said it takes time for these products to reach the marketplace, create competition and demonstrate a measurable impact on prices. Indeed, many of those generics, while approved, never went to market. This White House assertion also doesn’t account for high-priced, branded drugs that lack a generic counterpart. Yes, Trump’s tough talk — accusing pharma companies of ""getting away with murder"" — may have persuaded some drug manufacturers to hold off on increasing their prices — at least temporarily, or until after the government releases key stats on how many prices have gone up, Dusetzina said. But it’s hard to separate that phenomenon from the pressure also levied by Congress and state legislatures. For what it’s worth, the administration has proposed many new policies meant to curb drug prices, many noted, such as eliminating some kinds of rebates, or changing how Medicare Part B pays for drugs. But none of those have taken effect — so they haven’t brought prices down. Our Ruling Mulvaney said, ""Drug prices in this country actually came down last year for the first time in 50 years. That’s because Donald Trump’s president."" At first glance, CPI data could conceivably support the argument that the list prices for some prescription drugs dipped. But that data doesn’t include many high-priced specialty drugs that drive costs up, and the pattern it illustrates can change based on the time frame selected. The CPI data set obscures the individual drugs for which the list prices have increased — with far more going up than down. It also does not account for a drug’s true ""net price."" Mulvaney’s statement also does not reflect trends showing that, nationally, spending on drugs has continued to climb, even if that growth has slowed. There is also no evidence to support the argument that Trump himself is responsible for changes in drug pricing. This claim has an element of truth, but it ignores key facts and context that would give a very different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

No, the measles vaccine didn’t kill hundreds of infants last year
","As of April 4, 465 cases of measles had been confirmed in 19 states. That’s the second-highest number of cases reported in the United States since the contagious virus was eliminated from the country in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a Facebook post from that same day cast doubt on the seriousness of this measles outbreak compared with the risks of the vaccine that the CDC recommends be administered to all children to inoculate them against measles, mumps and rubella, commonly referred to as the MMR vaccine. ""Measles kills 11 people in 19 years (since 2000),"" the post says. ""MMR vaccine kills 445 infants in 1 year (since 2018). Why aren’t you afraid of vaccine?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post includes a link to a blog called ""The Mom Street Journal."" But the blog post — ""Doctors disagree with charges against Dr. Bob Sears, assert vaccine safety is a concern"" — is from 2016, two years before the earliest baseline date cited in the Facebook post. It also doesn’t mention measles. We asked Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute For Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, about the Facebook post. ""It’s not true,"" he said. First, let’s look at measles deaths. Since 2017, approximately 110,000 people worldwide died from measles, according to the World Health Organization. Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, widespread epidemics happened every two to three years or so, and an estimated 2.6 million people died annually. Because the Facebook post claims measles has killed 11 people since 2000, a fraction of the number of people who died from measles globally, we’ll focus our fact-check on the United States. Benjamin Haynes, a spokesman for the CDC’s infectious disease media team, said three people have died from measles since 2000. Two people died in 2003, Haynes said, and one more died in 2015. Next, let’s look at the Facebook post’s claim that the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine killed 445 infants in one year, ""since 2018."" Haynes said the CDC doesn’t have precise data on deaths caused by the MMR vaccination. ""CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitor reports of adverse events and deaths that occur after vaccination using several different systems including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),"" Haynes said. ""Since VAERS data cannot determine causality, we cannot use it to provide numbers of severe injuries or deaths caused by vaccination."" But, he added, ""a large body of evidence supports the safety of vaccines, and multiple studies and scientific reviews have found no association between vaccination and deaths except in rare cases."" As we noted in a 2015 fact-check of a website that misused data to wrongly claim the measles vaccine had killed 108 people in the last decade, anyone can file a report with VAERS, including doctors, patients, family members and friends. And they can file it regardless of whether they’re certain a death or another event was caused by the vaccine. Still, we wondered if 445 infants were reported dead in 2018 after they received the MMR vaccination.    We searched the VAERS database for the vaccine and deaths in 2018. The database returned three cases where the vaccine is MMR and the patient died on or after Jan. 1, 2018. The first case details the death of a 14-month-old boy. He was found dead in bed a week after vaccination, according to a write-up of the report. The cause of death was unknown. The second case details the death of a 1-year-old girl. The unknown reporter said the vaccine caused the girl to lose her speech and appetite and caused seizures. ""Upon internal review,"" the database says,"" seizure was determined to be medically significant."" The cause of death was unknown. The third case details the death of a 1-year-old boy. The cause of death was related to his seizure disorder. During a measles outbreak in 2014-15, unsubstantiated claims of deaths caused by the MMR vaccine started circulating online, according to a 2015 paper in the journal Vaccine titled, ""Deaths following vaccination: What does the evidence show?"" The authors summarized epidemiologic data on deaths after vaccination, including instances where reasonable scientific evidence existed to support that vaccination caused or contributed to deaths. Their conclusion? Millions of vaccinations are given to children and adults in the United States every year and serious adverse reactions from vaccines are uncommon. ""Deaths caused by vaccines are very rare,"" the paper says.   ""A review of VAERS data reveals that many of the death reports for MMR vaccine involved children with serious pre-existing medical conditions or were likely unrelated to vaccination,"" the paper continues. ""No concerning patterns have emerged that would suggest a causal relationship with the MMR vaccine and death."" We searched for news coverage of 445 infants dying from the MMR vaccine in a year. Such an event would draw media attention. But we couldn’t find any articles online, and when we searched the Nexis database for stories from Jan. 1, 2018 through April 11, 2019, about 445 deaths from measles vaccines, we couldn’t find anything to corroborate the Facebook post’s claim. We did find an undated blog post on the website of the National Vaccine Information Center, a nonprofit that describes itself as ""an independent clearinghouse for information on diseases and vaccine science""  but that has been criticized as an anti-vaccination group that promotes alternatives to vaccines, like handwashing. The blog post says that as of Nov. 30, 2018, there were 459 deaths related to measles vaccines reported to VAERS. That’s close to 445, so we recreated the search in the federal database. It’s true that 459 deaths were reported as of that date, but it includes deaths that were reported as early as 1989. Some more caveats: First, there weren’t 459 infant deaths reported. That number includes all ages. According to the database, 272 deaths were reported for children under the age of 3. Second, the search also includes deaths reported in connection with four other vaccines, not just MMR. And third, anyone can file a report with VAERS even if they’re not sure a death was caused by a vaccine. The information in the Facebook post is wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire! Correction: The measles vaccine was introduced in 1963. Previously, this story said it was introduced in 1993.",/factchecks/2019/apr/15/viral-image/no-measles-vaccine-didnt-kill-hundreds-infants-las/

Ilhan Omar misstates the facts about CAIR's founding

Omar is one of two Muslim women serving in Congress and a vocal proponent of Muslim rights. To describe the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Omar said, ""some people did something."" We went back to her original speech to find the offending phrase. Here’s what we found: ""For too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen, and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.

You have to say this person is looking at me strange, I am not comfortable with it, I am going to go talk to them and ask them why. Because that is a right you have. … You can't hate up close.

While people can disagree about the appropriateness of her description of 9/11, our attention was caught by her statement about CAIR, specifically that it was founded after 9/11. This is not accurate. Other reports have noted the inaccuracy as well. CAIR stands for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. It was founded in 1994, according to its website, ""to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America."" It annually issues reports on the status of American Muslim civil rights; reports on its website date back to 1996. CAIR’s first report came in response to the 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, after which some people initially blamed Muslims for the bombing. The actual bomber was a white native-born American, Timothy McVeigh. We asked Omar’s staff why she made such a clear mistake about an organization that she says she supports. Spokesperson Jeremy Slevin said that CAIR had doubled in size after the Sept. 11 attacks. ""It was a misstatement, and she now knows that it was founded earlier,"" he said.

Emanuel blows smoke about cigarette use among Chicago teens
","Speaking before Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed legislation barring the sale of nicotine products to those under 21, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel pointed to results from a similar rule already in effect in the city. ""There’s a lesson out of Chicago,"" he said. ""In the last eight years, we’ve seen a 50% reduction in teen smoking. Largest drop in the United States of America."" Reducing teen smoking is something to boast about, but this isn’t the first time we’ve heard Emanuel declare an accomplishment to be not just good but stupendous by pumping it with air — or, in this case, smoke. In the past he’s made exaggerated claims about the city’s economic growth and about its school system, for instance, both of which we’ve rated Mostly False. The best-in-the-nation teen smoking rate claim holds up no better. First, it’s important to note that Emanuel was referring only to changes in cigarette smoking over time and not electronic cigarette use, which federal research shows is driving an increase in the overall use of nicotine products among youth even as cigarette smoking falls. So Emanuel’s good news is tempered somewhat by national trends. That said, he is correct that in recent years Chicago has seen a decrease of roughly 50% in the share of teens who reported smoking cigarettes. The results of a biennial youth behavior survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that 12.5% of Chicago high school students reported in 2009 that they had smoked a cigarette on at least one day within the past month. By the 2017 survey, the CDC found the comparable number had dropped to 6%. That’s progress, but nowhere near nation-leading progress. The CDC survey found bigger drops in teen smoking rates in at least nine other large urban school districts or counties. Teen cigarette use in Chicago fell 52% between 2009 and 2017, the CDC found. But in Los Angeles, for example, the CDC recorded a 75% decline. For Boston, the drop was 70%. The teen smoking rate in Chicago for 2017 was well below the national average of 8.8%, but there, too, the CDC recorded even better numbers for several other big cities. In Los Angeles, less than 3% of high-schoolers said they smoked. In Boston the number was just slightly over 3% and in Philadelphia it was 3.5%. We asked the mayor’s office to explain his largest drop in the nation claim, but a spokesman for Emanuel responded with a statement that avoided a defense of his remarks. The more than 50% decrease in teen cigarette smoking ""makes Chicago a national leader in the pursuit to create a tobacco-free generation,"" spokesman Patrick Kelly wrote in an email. It’s also worth noting that the decline in teen smoking in Chicago tracks with a broader downward trend. The CDC's survey results show that nationally, the share of teens who currently smoke cigarettes dropped by 55% between 2009 and 2017. Emanuel said that Chicago’s reduction in teen smoking over the last eight years is the ""largest drop in the United States of America."" Federal data on cigarette usage among high schoolers tracks with the figure he cited for Chicago’s decline. That same dataset, however, shows that Chicago is far from the nation’s leader in reducing teen smoking. At least nine other major school districts or counties came out ahead. We rate Emanuel’s statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Carly Fiorina says Planned Parenthood gives 'millions' to candidates
","The bitter debate over Planned Parenthood is continuing -- on the presidential campaign trail, in the halls of Congress, and on cable news Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina has repeatedly criticized the group after getting wide attention for her comments during the second Republican debate, when she said that an undercover video about Planned Parenthood shows ""a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.' "" (We rated that Mostly False.) During the Sept. 30, 2015, edition of the Fox News show Hannity, Fiorina said that Planned Parenthood ""is an organization that funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates."" We wondered if Fiorina was right, so we turned to the campaign-finance data. It turns out she’s on solid ground. Here are the two major categories of Planned Parenthood spending from the 2014 campaign cycle: Source of spending Type of spending Amount spent, 2014 cycle Planned Parenthood Action Fund Inc. Federal PAC  Contributions to candidates and parties $528,762 Super PAC and 501(c)4 groups  Independent expenditures $6,058,338 Total $6,587,100 Let’s unpack these numbers a bit. The first line, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, refers to the amount spent by the group’s main political action committee. A political action committee is a group that bundles money donated voluntarily, including that from employees and their families, to be spent for political purposes. A PAC is legally distinct from the organization for which it advocates, and it must maintain separate bank accounts. PACs can give directly to candidates. The second line includes dollars spent by Planned Parenthood-related groups that are allowed to raise and spend money more freely, but which are not allowed to give money directly to or coordinate with candidates. These are primarily known as Super PACs and 501(c)4 organizations. So, combining these three categories of expenditures produces roughly $6.6 million in political spending just for the 2014 cycle. That number would go up if other recent election cycles were added in. So Fiorina has a point. It’s important to note that all of the reported expenditures on this list come from entities that are legally allowed to spend money in politics. While the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics, all the affiliates listed in the table are organized in such a way that they are allowed to make campaign donations or spend money in other ways on elections. Also, federal dollars flow only to the operational arms of Planned Parenthood, which by law are not allowed to spend money on politics. Despite the legal distinctions between these groups and what they can, and cannot, do in elections, it’s easy to see why there may be public confusion. That’s because officials with the group haven’t been afraid to use the ""Planned Parenthood"" brand when choosing names for affiliates that are allowed to engage in election activity. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, some of the group’s biggest affiliated spenders in 2014 were called Planned Parenthood Votes (a Super PAC that spent $4.2 million that cycle) and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (a 501(c)4 group that spent $930,290 that cycle). Another 19 affiliates with ""Planned Parenthood"" in their name, mostly regional affiliates, had PACs that spent money on political purposes in 2014 or had employees who gave from their own pockets that cycle. This has the effect of fuzzing the image of what counts as ""Planned Parenthood"" in the public mind, even if not in legal status. Another point worth mentioning: Not all of this money was spent on ""candidates,"" the word Fiorina used. Some of the money we totaled above went to candidates, but a lot went to party committees or was used for ""independent expenditures,"" such as ads that independently supported a candidate without going through the candidate’s own campaign treasury. In the 2014 campaign cycle, the Center for Responsive Politics found that groups and individuals related to Planned Parenthood spent $679,708 specifically on congressional candidates. And if you broaden that out to the entire 1990 to 2016 period, the number rises to about $3.9 million specifically on congressional candidates. In 2014, the group's biggest recipients among incumbent senators were Ed Markey, D-Mass., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Al Franken, D-Minn., and Mark Udall, D-Colo. The four senators -- each of whom received a 100 percent vote rating from NARAL-Pro-Choice America -- received between $14,000 and $23,000 each. If you include all recent years, Fiorina’s right that the amount spent specifically on candidates (indeed, just the congressional ones) did reach into the ""millions."" It’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood is hardly the only organization to split itself into separate entities that have different abilities to participate in politics. In addition to being legal, it’s common practice. Indeed, a political affiliate of the Susan B. Anthony List -- an anti-abortion group -- spent $745,756 on independent expenditures in campaigns during the 2014 cycle. And during her unsuccessful 2010 Senate candidacy in California, Fiorina herself benefited from $246,183 in independent expenditures by National Right to Life and $234,774 in independent expenditures from the Susan B. Anthony List. Our ruling Fiorina said Planned Parenthood ""is an organization that funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates."" Fiorina glossed over the difference between the operational arm of Planned Parenthood, which receives federal funding and cannot take part in electoral activities, and its affiliates, which can legally spend money on politics. Still, she is right that a variety of affiliates of Planned Parenthood -- usually with ""Planned Parenthood"" in their name -- have legally spent ""millions"" on politics in recent years, both for candidates specifically and on other electoral activities. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate Fiorina’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/05/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-planned-parenthood-gives-millio/

Dan Gecker says Glen Sturtevant is ""against smaller class sizes""
","The flier landing in mailboxes across the 10th Senate District -- courtesy of Democrat Dan Gecker -- has a photo of a girl sitting at a school desk, staring pensively. ""Glen Sturtevant Has the Wrong Priorities For Our Schools,"" the mailer says. Underneath, a red box with white capital letters provides the kicker: ""AGAINST SMALLER CLASS SIZES."" We investigated whether Sturtevant, a Republican, has opposed lowering class sizes since he was elected to the Richmond School Board in 2012. It’s a claim that Gecker, a Chesterfield County supervisor, repeatedly has made against Sturtevant in their race for the state Senate. They’re vying for a seat long held by Republican John Watkins, who’s not seeking re-election. During the past two weeks, we’ve come across two other Gecker mailers that make the same charge but with a little more detail. One says Sturtevant is ""the only school board member to vote against reducing class sizes."" The other says he was the only member to ""vote against a budget that reduces class sizes."" Footnotes on all the mailers refer to a May 28, 2015, article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch about the Richmond School Board’s 8-1 vote for a $271.5 million budget for the fiscal year that started July 1. The article cited several initiatives in the budget, including these two: $1.3 million for ""reducing class sizes for kindergarten through third grade."" This referred to a budget item providing money to hire an additional 17 permanent K-3 teachers. About $2.5 million to expand the teacher work year from 191 days to 194. The three extra days are professional development days -- time for teachers to attend seminars and workshops designed to help them improve their craft. Part of the expense is to pay the teachers for the three extra days they need to work. The article noted that Sturtevant was ""the lone vote of dissent on the budget"" and explained his rationale. It reported that Sturtevant favored giving teachers an outright 2 percent raise and opposed adding the professional development days to their year, because he thought Richmond’s professional development programs were subpar and first needed to be improved. Sturtevant, it was reported, said the unconditional 2 percent raise would help Richmond compete for teachers with surrounding suburban school systems. There was no mention in the article about Sturtevant’s view on lowering K-3 class sizes or of any debate on the topic. A video of the three-hour School Board meeting on May 26 confirms The Times-Dispatch’s account. Sturtevant didn’t mention class sizes in his critique of the budget. Sturtevant told us he supports lower K-3 class sizes in Richmond, noting that his wife is a first-grade teacher - in Chesterfield - and they have a son in kindergarten at Mary Munford Elementary School in Richmond. It turns out that all 17 of the new K-3 teachers hired for permanent status this school year were long-term substitute instructors who worked in Richmond last school year, according to an email we received from Ralph Westbay, the city’s assistant superintendent for financial services. A long-term substitute is someone who fills in for a teacher who is absent for an extended time and assumes more duties and must have more instructional training than short-term substitutes. Westbay said the school system has not yet computed the effect the 17 teachers have had on K-3 class sizes but said he does not expect student-to-teacher ratios to be ""appreciably changed."" Our ruling Gecker says that Sturtevant, his opponent in the 10th District Senate race, ""is against smaller class sizes.""  He bases the claim - almost a charge of apostasy against a School Board member -  on Sturtevant’s vote against the $271.5 million Richmond school budget for 2015-16. It contained $1.3 million to hire 17 new K-3 teachers. But a Times-Dispatch article Gecker cites to prove his claim provides no evidence Sturtevant opposes smaller classes, nor does a video of the meeting at which Sturtevant cast his vote. What they show is that Sturtevant opposed the budget because it did not contain a 2 percent raise for teachers. Sturtevant did not mention class sizes in laying out his objection to the spending plan. He tells us he supports smaller class sizes. The Richmond school budget is a 262-page document. Sturtevant’s vote against the budget does not entitle Gecker to determine which of its countless line items Sturtevant opposed. There’s a burden on Gecker to prove that Sturtevant ""is against smaller class sizes,"" and he comes up empty. We rate Gecker’s statement False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/05/dan-gecker/dan-gecker-says-glen-sturdevant-against-smaller-cl/

Fact-checking a comparison of gun deaths and terrorism deaths
","In the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, President Barack Obama tasked the media to put the number of gun violence-related deaths into perspective. ""Have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side by side on your news reports,"" he said in his address on the shooting. ""We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?""  Obama's underlying point was to highlight the lack of resources and legislative action taken on gun violence. Some have questioned the merit of such a comparison -- for example, critics have pointed out that cigarettes kill more people than guns. We're not weighing in on that debate. Rather, we're looking just at the data.  Multiple outlets obliged (though each came up with slightly different numbers). Several readers asked us to check out one specific comparison widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. It was created by NowThis, a New York-based news company that produces content specifically for social media. The image says that 24 Americans have been killed by terrorism in the last decade, while 280,024 Americans were killed by guns. While NowThis’ numbers aren’t perfect, the overarching point is accurate. There have been far more deaths from gun violence than from terrorist attacks. Walking through the math Let’s start with the tally for terrorist-related deaths. NowThis senior editorial producer Versha Sharma told PolitiFact that the 24 figure refers to the number of U.S. citizens killed by terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, and does not include deaths abroad. Sharma acknowledged that this could have been made clear in the graphic. But she maintained that it’s more apt to compare domestic gun deaths to domestic terrorism deaths. Counting terrorist attacks abroad, she said, would make it an apples to oranges comparison. The number comes from the nonpartisan think tank the New America Foundation’s count of lethal jihadist attacks on U.S. soil from 2005 to 2015. It includes for example the four people killed during the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the 13 deaths from the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. To get to 280,024 gun deaths, NowThis compiled data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Vital Statistics System and the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project that tallies deaths and injuries in mass shootings. According to the CDC, the number of violent gun deaths between 2005 and 2013 (the latest year on record) was 279,976. That includes suicides, homicides, and police-related shootings. Mass Shooting Tracker counts 389 mass shooting gun deaths in 2014 and 375 so far in 2015. There are, however, a few issues with these numbers. For starters, a spokesperson for New America told us it would have been more accurate to include lives lost to both jihadist and non-jihadist extreme violence (47 deaths from 2005 to 2015) for a total count of 71 deaths from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Secondly, Mass Shooting Tracker, as the name implies, only tracks deaths from mass shootings, defined by the group as when four more people are shot in an event. If we look at all gun-related deaths as the CDC does from the past two years, the numbers are much higher. According the nonprofit project the Gun Violence Archive, there were 12,562 gun deaths in 2014 and 9,959 in 2015 thus far. That’s a grand total of 301,797 firearm-related deaths in the past decade, compared to 71 deaths from domestic acts of terrorism.  If we factor in terrorist attacks overseas, the comparison is still stark. From 2004 to 2014, 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide, according to State Department reports. During that same time frame, 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence. Here’s a breakdown:    Our ruling A viral image says the number of Americans killed by terrorism in the last decade is 24, while the number of Americans killed by guns in the last decade is 280,024. NowThis, the creators of the image, told us they only counted lives lost to domestic jihadist attacks, though the image doesn’t specify that. If we look at deaths due to all extremist attacks on U.S. soil, the number goes up to 71. A more accurate count for gun deaths between 2005 and 2015 is 301,797. Though the image’s numbers are slightly off, that doesn’t undercut the point: guns have claimed many more lives than terrorist attacks. We rate the claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2015/oct/05/viral-image/fact-checking-comparison-gun-deaths-and-terrorism-/

MSNBC's Joe Scarborough: Tiny fraction of crimes committed with legal guns
","The public debate to the shooting in Oregon so far has followed a familiar script. Some observers focus on cracks in mental health services. Some highlight families who fail to keep weapons away from disturbed sons and fathers. Others talk about background checks and reining in the firepower available to private citizens. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, trained his sights on the underground market in guns. ""Isn't it true that only like 3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually purchase those guns?"" he asked a guest on his Oct. 2 show. ""Isn't this a big trafficking problem, too?"" Scarborough supports background checks, but his focus on black market guns caught our eye. We decided to dig into the stat that only a tiny fraction of violent crimes involve guns that were purchased on the up-and-up. From the data and experts we reached, we learned Scarborough might be correct, but the data don’t precisely confirm it. Before we review the data, we should note that Scarborough’s claim is a bit ambiguous. He might have meant that out of all violent crimes, 3 percent involve a legally purchased firearm. But it’s also possible that he was thinking that out of a smaller set of violent crimes -- those involving a firearm -- the firearm was purchased legally 3 percent of the time. (We reached out to Scarborough and did not hear back.) Philip Cook, a professor of economics and sociology at Duke University, has done some of the most recent and detailed research on where criminals get their guns. But note: His work begins with the criminals, not the crimes -- which was Scarborough’s approach. Cook knows of no study that takes the crime as the starting point. And for good reason. ""The problem is that only a very small fraction of gun crimes result in the recovery of the weapon or in any other way allow us to determine how the gun was acquired by the person who committed the crime,"" Cook told us. On the other hand, if Scarborough had said that 3 percent of criminals who use guns get them legally, he would have come closer to the truth. There are still big issues with that, but he would have found some support in Cook’s work. The Chicago Crime Lab study Cook and colleagues Susan Parker and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago interviewed 99 inmates of the Cook County Jail in Chicago. They were looking for criminals who were likely to have used a gun or had ready access to one. The authors described the group of participants as ""a convenience sample of gun-involved, criminally active men living in greater Chicago."" ""It is difficult to say how representative they are of the larger population with that description,"" they wrote. ""For that reason, we do not place much emphasis on the statistical results, as opposed to the qualitative patterns that emerged from these data."" That said, of the 70 inmates who had possessed a firearm, only 2, or 2.9 percent, had bought it at a gun store. The report found that percentage was in line with the findings of the Chicago Police Department when it traced weapons seized from suspected gang members. (For a glimpse into how guns move through a community, Cook's full article is good reading.) There are some important caveats however. First, Cook noted that it’s possible to buy a gun illegally from a gun store. You can use a fake ID or employ a straw purchaser (someone who can pass a background check who buys the weapon on your behalf). Furthermore, just because the rest of the people interviewed didn’t purchase a gun at a gun store doesn’t mean they acquired it illegally. ""It’s possible to make a legal acquisition from another source – a gift from a family member, a purchase from a private seller, etc.,"" Cook said. ""Whether transactions of that sort are legal depend on the details of the transaction and local regulations."" Cook also cautioned that the numbers from the Chicago study might not apply across the country. The national data In 2004, the government conducted its periodic Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities. It found that among inmates who had a gun when they committed their crime (16 percent of all prisoners), about 11 percent had bought the firearm at a retail store, a pawn shop, a flea market or a gun show. Another 37 percent had gotten it from a friend or family member. About 40 percent said they got it illegally on the black market, from a drug dealer or by stealing it. But the same caveats apply. A retail purchase might not have been legal and a gift from a family member might not be illegal. A 1994 study by researchers James Wright and Peter Rossi came up with a larger percentage of potentially legal purchases. They surveyed prisoners in 10 states. About 21 percent said they acquired their weapons from a gun or other ""customary retail outlets"" as the researchers put it. About one out of four came through gray or black market sources. However, gun laws were looser when that data was collected. The Brady Bill and its background check provisions passed the year the study was published. Ultimately, there are holes in the data. But Cook said while 3 percent or 10 percent might not be the exact number of legally purchased firearms used by criminals, the fraction is in that ballpark. ""I think it’s safe to say that a low percentage of criminal assaults and robberies are committed with guns that were acquired by legal purchase from a gun store,"" Cook said. Joseph Olson, a professor at Hamline University School of Law and former board member of the National Rifle Association, believes that the number of legally acquired firearms used by criminals is negligible. ""Criminals don’t go through background checks because they know they wouldn't pass them,"" Olson said. Olson said with homicides, there are two key exceptions. Legal firearms are often found when the killings occur duing domestic violence or mass shootings. Our ruling Scarborough said that about ""3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually (legally) purchase those guns."" Recent studies that look at prisoners who had a gun when they committed a crime found that between 3 and 11 percent purchased the weapon at a store or gun show.  But the studies only tell us where the guns came from, not whether they were acquired legally, and there are issues with using the data to reach the conclusion Scarborough did, experts told us. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/05/joe-scarborough/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-tiny-fraction-crimes-commit/

Michael McCaul says Iran to blame for more than 1,000 U.S. casualties in Iraq, plot to attack D.C.
","Iran, a Texas congressman says, warrants blame for American casualties in Iraq and plotting an attack in Washington, D.C. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, delivered the Republican Party’s Sept. 12, 2015, weekly address, speaking mostly about why he opposes the Iran nuclear agreement announced a couple months before. Fourteen years after the 9/11 attacks, McCaul said, ""the struggle continues. … We cannot forget that the radical Shi'a regime in Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of terrorism. Iran's leaders have called for our defeat and the destruction of our close ally, Israel. The regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war; they have plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital and launched destructive cyber attacks against American companies."" It’s not a surprise, perhaps, that unfriendly governments including Iran try cyberattacks, nor is it news that Iran has called for Israel’s fall. But we wondered if McCaul was right about Iran being responsible for the described casualties in Iraq and plotting an attack on our nation’s capital. By email, McCaul spokesman Walter Zaykowski answered our request for elaboration by saying the casualty count originated with the Pentagon. He said McCaul’s mention of Iran plotting an attack in Washington, D.C., reflected the May 2013 conviction of an Iranian-American resident of San Antonio for plotting to kill Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States. Let’s check casualties, then flashback to the described plot. Iran’s declared connection to casualties In his email, Zaykowski pointed out September 2015 news stories about more than 1,000 Iran-linked American casualties in Iraq published by Defense One, which focuses on ""topics and trends that will define the future of U.S. defense and national security."" A Sept. 8, 2015, Defense One story said that according to recently declassified Pentagon documents, 196 American soldiers were killed in Iraq from November 2005 to December 2011 by 1,526 ""explosively formed penetrators,"" which are particularly deadly roadside bombs, with another 861 American soldiers getting injured.  SOURCE: News story, ""How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?"" Defense One, Sept. 8, 2015 (illustration reprinted with permission). The Iran connection? The story said the Pentagon attributes the presence of the EFPs in Iraq ""to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani. Various EFP ‘factories’ were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom."" This sentence in the story included a web link to a  Feb. 27, 2007, New York Times news story, datelined Baghdad, describing bomb parts uncovered by U.S. forces in Iraq as possible evidence of factories making EFPs, ""which explode and hurl out a high-speed blob of copper designed to cut through tough American armor."" According to that story, though, an Iran connection wasn’t firmed up. The story said that while the find gave ""experts much more information on the makings of the E.F.P.’s, which the American military has repeatedly argued must originate in Iran, the cache also included items that appeared to cloud the issue. Among the confusing elements were cardboard boxes of the gray plastic PVC tubes used to make the canisters. The boxes appeared to contain shipments of tubes directly from factories in the Middle East, none of them in Iran. One box said in English that the tubes inside had been made in the United Arab Emirates and another said, in Arabic, ‘plastic made in Haditha,’ a restive Sunni town on the Euphrates River in Iran. The Defense One story went on to say ""the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute."" That sentence noted an April 10, 2007, story in the Columbia Journalism Review cautioning against news reporters accepting characterizations of the EFPs as coming from Iran. The Defense One story noted that Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9, 2015, Senate confirmation hearing: ""We weren’t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn’t necessarily have the forensics to support that."" At the hearing, the story said, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran ""has been recently quoted as about 500."" Through the Nexis database, we spotted the question that led to Dunford’s assessment. At the hearing, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., asked Dunford: ""When you served in Iraq and Afghanistan, do you know how many soldiers, Marines underneath your command were killed by Iranian activities?"" DUNFORD: ""Senator, I know the total number of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that were killed by Iranian activities, and the number has been recently quoted as about 500. We weren't always able to attribute the casualties that we had to -- to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that."" Defense One’s story said the U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, ""later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons."" The story quoted Maj. Genieve Davis, a CENTCOM spokeswoman saying in an email that it’s ""important to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF."" David further said data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, Defense One reported. To our inquiry, CENTCOM spokesman Max Blumenfeld emailed a similar statement saying 196 ""U.S. service member deaths resulted from Iranian Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) which are very deadly improvised explosive devices."" He said too that those deaths were a subset of ""all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during"" Operation Iraqi Freedom, the U.S.-led operations in Iraq from March 2003 through August 2010. ""For example,"" Blumenfeld wrote, ""there were rocket attacks and IRAM (improvised rocket-assisted munitions) among other tactics that also contributed to American soldier deaths."" Along similar lines, a Sept. 11, 2015, Defense One news story said many of the additional deaths likely were caused by improvised rocket assisted munitions, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as ""a rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister — such as a propane gas tank — filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets."" First seen in Iraq in 2007, the story said, the IRAM — ""essentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb — a flying IED"" is ""the signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,"" the story described the undated document saying. We asked Blumenfeld to specify casualties believed to have been caused by Iranian-connected explosives. He declined, emailing: ""We cannot provide more information than what has been already furnished."" The D.C. plot So, when did Iran plot a terrorist attack in the U.S. capital? On May 30, 2013, as reported by the Times that day, a U.S. district judge, John F. Keenan,  sentenced an Iranian-American living in Texas and accused of plotting to hire assassins to murder Saudi Arabia’s U.S. ambassador to 25 years in prison. The story said Mansour J. Arbabsiar, a naturalized American citizen living in Texas,had been arrested in September 2011 at New York’s Kennedy International Airport, ultimately pleading guilty to his role in a scheme in which he evidently thought he was lining up a Mexican drug cartel to plant a bomb in a Washington restaurant where, the described plot went, the ambassador would be dining. The story said Arbabsiar lived in Corpus Christi though an Oct. 28, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, citing court filings quoting Arbabsiar’s comments to a psychiatrist, said that in 2010, Arbabsiar had moved from Corpus Christi to Round Rock, near Austiin. When Arbabsiar was arrested, the Times story said, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the plot had been ""directed and approved by elements of the Iranian government and, specifically, senior members of the Quds force,"" which is part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Holder said in an Oct. 11, 2011, statement the ""deadly plot"" was ""directed by factions of the Iranian government."" Arbabsiar, he said, was being ""accused of working with members of an arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to devise an international murder-for-hire scheme targeting the"" ambassador. Holder said the complaint would say Arbabsiar allegedly orchestrated the plot with Gholam Shakuri, an Iranian-based member of the Qods Force. According to the complaint, Arbabsiar--with Shakuri’s approval--had facilitated the wiring of approximately $100,000 into a bank account in the United States as a down payment for the attempted assassination. Holder said the complaint also said that in the days since the defendant’s arrest, he had confessed to his participation in the alleged plot. The Times story on Arbabsiar’s sentencing said the assassination plan, according to unnamed government officials, involved Arbabsiar paying a member of the Los Zetas drug cartel $1.5 million to plant a bomb at a Washington restaurant while the Saudi ambassador, Adel al-Jubeir, dined. But Arbabsiar, drawn into the plot by a cousin in Iran who was a high-ranking member of the Quds Force, turned to a man in Mexico he believed was an associate of a drug cartel to hire a team of assassins. And that man turned out to be a confidential informer for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the story said. Keenan noted before imposing the sentence that when Arbabsiar was told that there would probably be 100 to 150 people in the restaurant when it was bombed, he replied, ""No problem,"" or ""No big deal,"" according to a recording of the conversation made secretly by the drug agency’s informer. The story said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, whose office had sought the maximum 25-year sentence, called Mr. Arbabsiar ""an enemy among us — the key conduit for, and facilitator of, a nefarious international plot concocted by members of the Iranian military to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States and as many innocent bystanders as necessary to get the job done."" Arbabsiar, addressing the judge before he was sentenced, said: ""Whatever I did wrong, I take responsibility for it. I can’t change what I did. I have a good heart. I never hurt anyone."" He added, ""My mind sometimes is not in a good place."" Arbabsiar’s lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, a federal public defender, had sought a 10-year term, arguing that her client’s crime had been the result of a longstanding, untreated bipolar disorder, the story said. Iran denies involvement The Times story also said the Iranian government had denied it had anything to do with the plot. An Oct. 12, 2011, CNN news account said an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, had told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency: ""Iran strongly denies the untrue and baseless allegations over a plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington."" The CNN story also quoted members of President Barack Obama’s administration saying the plot had involved Iran. The story said Vice President Joe Biden had told NBC News: ""Every nation in the world, when they learn the facts of this, will be outraged that (Iran) would violate such an international norm, in addition to obviously being a crime to assassinate anybody, and in the process probably have killed scores of Americans"" who may have been in the restaurant at the time of a detonation. Also, CNN reported, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., then the chair of the Senate Armed Intelligence Committee, said after getting briefed that there was no doubt that Iran’s Quds Force was involved in the reported plot, though she could not say if higher levels of Iran’s government were too. ""I could surmise that the Quds Force would not have done this without the highest levels of approval from the Revolutionary Guard and, most likely, from some higher elements of the government,"" Feinstein said. But, she added, she could not specify who might have known. She also added that the alleged plot may have been just one in a series of such schemes. ""It's hard for me to believe that there is just one plot involving the United States,"" she said. Our ruling McCaul said Iran’s ""regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war"" and ""has plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital."" McCaul has backing for this statement, although it needs clarification.

Connolly says IRS lacks resources to collect $350 billion a year
","U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents legions on federal workers living in Northern Virginia, scoffs at conservative efforts to pare the Internal Revenue Service. Congress has cut about $1.2 billion from the IRS budget during the past five years. The actions impair the nation’s ability to collect revenue needed to reduce deficits, Connolly, D-11th, said during a Sept. 9 interview on Federal News Radio. ""It’s estimated we leave somewhere north of $350 billion a year - that’s billion - a year on the table uncollected, because IRS doesn’t have the resources,"" he said. Connolly added that if the IRS had more resources, it could collect so much in unpaid taxes that the government could get rid of the so-called sequestration budget cuts - projected to slice about $1 trillion during the next decade - and have enough left over to make a sizable down payment on the national debt. We examined Connolly’s claim that the U.S. loses about $350 billion in tax revenue each year because the IRS lacks the means to collect it. George Burke, the congressman’s spokesman, said Connolly’s statement was based on IRS reports on the country’s ""tax gap"" - the amount of underreported income, unpaid tax bills and taxes that never were collected because returns weren’t filed. ""On several occasions, IRS officials have testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the amount of uncollected taxes and the agency's lack of resources,"" Burke wrote in an email. ""The potential return on investment is mind-boggling."" The $350 billion The IRS periodically provides an estimate of how much revenue Uncle Sam is owed but doesn’t collect because of tax evasion. Mark Hanson, an IRS spokesman, told us in an email that it takes years for the agency to compile its tax-gap estimate, because it requires complicated research. The latest figures available are for 2006. The IRS says there were nearly $2.7 trillion in total tax liabilities in 2006. Of that amount, about $450 billion wasn’t paid on time. The main cause of  missed payments was taxpayers underreporting their income, the IRS said. Some late payments eventually trickled in, and the IRS took enforcement actions against some tax scofflaws. Those actions recovered about $65 billion, according to the agency’s tallies, leaving about $385 billion in liabilities the IRS says it was owed but didn’t collect. So Connolly’s claim that there’s ""somewhere north"" of $350 billion in taxes left on the table has validity. Is all that tax collectible? To complete our fact check, we also need to look at the second part of Connolly’s statement - that the IRS doesn’t collect the $350 billion-plus each year because it lacks ""resources."" Two analysts told us that extra resources could help the IRS narrow the gap, but it wouldn’t completely erase tax evasion. ""Some of it is uncollectible, people don’t have the money,"" said Eric Toder, co-director of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center who has written about the tax gap. Moreover, Toder said that certain unpaid tax liabilities are just inherently difficult to discover, such as cash transactions by small businesses that can occur without any record. More auditors would capture some unpaid taxes, Toder said, but they would provide only a few stitches in mending the tax gap. In 2007, Toder authored a paper that said Congress and President George W. Bush’s administration could take added steps to patch the tax gap, such as providing the IRS more resources for enforcement and requiring taxpayers to report more income information. But he said policymakers had to be realistic about the return they would see on such initiatives. ""Although estimates of how much additional resources and better enforcement tools would raise are incomplete and highly uncertain, it is extremely unlikely that they could raise more than $20-30 billion per year,"" Toder wrote. In an interview, Toder told us there is a danger the tax gap could grow if the IRS is cut back too much and there becomes a sense that enforcement is lax due to strained resources. We also spoke to Robert Goulder, tax policy counsel at Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based non-profit that examines tax regulations. He told us filling the gap would require unrealistic scenarios, such as an IRS agent being assigned to watch the cash register at every ""mom and pop"" small business. Added enforcement also would run counter to an American culture that chafes at inquiries from the IRS, Goulder said. Even with an unlimited budget, Goulder said, ""they still couldn’t get the tax gap down to zero."" A 2012 Government Accountability Office report, which looked at various strategies to cut down the tax gap, said ""closing the entire gap may not be feasible, since it could entail more intrusive recordkeeping or reporting than the public is willing to accept or more resources than the IRS is able to commit."" It cited a 1997 GAO report which said ""it would be unrealistic to assume that our tax system, or any tax system, can achieve 100-percent compliance and thus eliminate the tax gap."" Our ruling Connolly said Uncle Sam forgoes $350 billion a year because the Internal Revenue Service lacks the resources to find and collect that amount. His figure is solid, based on the latest data available from the IRS -- from 2006. But his contention that the gap is caused by lack of IRS resources is an overstatement. Although analysts say more manpower could help the agency narrow the gap, it wouldn’t come close to filling it. Some unpaid taxes are extremely difficult to sniff out, and some people simply can’t pay, they said. So on the whole, we rate Connolly’s statement Half True. Editor's note: A previous version of this story had the wrong figure for the amount of cuts to the IRS budget in the last five years.",/factchecks/2015/oct/05/gerry-connolly/connolly-says-irs-lacks-resources-collet-350-billi/

Donald Trump: Syrian refugees potentially headed to U.S. are mostly men
","Donald Trump is now against bringing any Syrian refugees to the United States, saying he has concerns about how many able-bodied men seem to be fleeing the war-torn nation. This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump on Oct. 4, 2015, why he told a New Hampshire crowd he would send refugees back to Syria should he win the presidency. Trump had previously said he would accept some Syrian refugees for humanitarian reasons. ""The migration was strange to me because it seems like so many men,"" Trump answered. ""There aren't that many women, there aren't that many children. It looked like mostly men and they looked like strong men. These looked like physically strong people. And I'm saying, ‘Where are all the women? Where are all the children?’ "" Stephanopoulos told Trump that half the refugees are children, which led the billionaire to shift gears and question why the United States was planning to take in so many refugees. Trump’s description of Syrian refugees as not being many children and women didn’t sound quite right to us, so we decided to check out it out. It appears Trump was confusing his talking point over a couple of different issues. Registered refugees vs. sea arrivals   In the interview, Trump started talking about how he heard America was accepting 3,000 refugees, then 10,000, and ""now I hear we want to take in 200,000."" Trump said, ""We don't know where they're coming from, we don't know who they are. They could be ISIS. It could be the great Trojan Horse. I mean this could be one of the great Trojan Horses ever since the original."" His campaign did not get back to us to clarify his remarks, but to us and experts we consulted, his answer sounds like he had a different refugee population in mind altogether. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps spread over several nations, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to numbers we accessed on Oct. 4, the total comes to more than 4 million. Of those 4 million, 50.3 percent are female, and 51.1 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger. In all, only 23.5 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the U.N. were men older than 18. So that settles that argument, right? Not really. Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, says Trump’s anecdote may have been referring to Europe’s mass influx of refugees and migrants, not the U.N.-registered refugees in camps that Stephanopoulos was asking about. ""This is a complicated issue, and Trump is right to my mind on a few points, but he’s messing up situations, confusing them terribly so his overall point is way off base,"" Mock said. Trump likely meant so-called ""sea arrivals,"" refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The U.N. counts almost 534,000 people who have crossed into Europe this year, with almost 3,000 dying during the journey. To Trump’s point, 69 percent of sea arrivals are men, and these are the people dominating headlines about the humanitarian crisis in Europe. Of those 534,000, about 55 percent of them are from Syria. The rest are from across Asia and Africa, from places like Eritrea, Afghanistan and Sudan. These people are not the same as Syrians in registered refugee camps. But as Trump warned, some do claim to be from Syria and are not, and many are indeed undocumented, experts told PolitiFact. But the problem with Trump’s statement is that none of the majority-male refugees and migrants in Europe are coming to the United States. Refugee resettlement We can’t confirm where Trump got his 200,000-refugee number, but it may refer to Secretary of State John Kerry’s announcement in September that the U.S. would accept 85,000 worldwide refugees in 2016, up from 70,000. In 2017, that number would expand to 100,000, for a total of 185,000 refugees over two years. To add another wrinkle to Trump’s already confusing claims, those won’t all be Syrian refugees, but rather refugees from all over the world. Kerry did say some of the expansion was to accommodate Syrians, but there was no indication how many. The U.N. has said 10 percent, or about 400,000, of the Syrian refugees in camps need to be resettled. President Barack Obama announced that in fiscal year 2016 (through Sept. 30), the United States would accept at least 10,000 refugees from Syria. Those 10,000 aren’t necessarily the type of people who would be ISIS operatives as Trump fears, according to Mock. ""The priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and teens on their own, and women and children at risk,"" Mock said. The people selected undergo screening by state agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. The process can take years. That doesn’t make for an efficient method of terrorizing the United States, Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow Daveed Gartenstein-Ross said. While it’s a legitimate concern that there are ways of beating the screening process, he said, there would be more efficient ways for ISIS cells to reach America than what Trump is fearing. ""Instead of sitting around hoping you win the refugee lottery and then wait years, then pass the screening to get to America, it would be much easier for a terrorist group to send a person through Europe or put them onto an airplane to the United States,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""If they could otherwise pass the refugee screening process, they could certainly get on an airplane."" Moreover, the scenario Trump paints doesn’t hold up to scrutiny once you take into account that it misrepresents the parties involved. ""When Trump raises concerns about photos of young men among the refugees who have made it to Europe, this has absolutely nothing to do with the Obama-announced resettlement program that will draw upon the population identified by the U.N. as being the most vulnerable among the 4 million Syrians in their refugee camps, all of whom are identified and registered,"" Mock said. Our ruling Trump said ""there aren't that many women, there aren't that many children"" among Syrian refugees. It appears Trump is conflating two different sets of refugees: Those 534,000 reaching Europe by sea, who are mostly men, and the 4 million Syrians in U.N. refugee camps, most of whom are women and children. Only about 10,000 refugees in the camps are slated for resettlement in the United States over the next year. Those making the perilous trip to Europe are not.  The priority refugees from this group would be torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, unaccompanied children and teens, and women and children at risk. Those factors, coupled with background screenings, suggest they would likely not be ISIS operatives waiting to terrorize the United States. Trump's assessment of the refugee situation is badly mangled. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-syrian-refugees-are-mostly-men/

Out-of-date gun background check statistic gets new life after Oregon shooting
","As the country grapples with Thursday’s mass shooting at an Oregon community college, a retired astronaut whose wife survived a killing spree four years ago is leading the charge for stricter gun control. Mark Kelly is married to former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was severely injured in a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson that left 10 others dead. Following the assassination attempt, Kelly and Giffords created Americans for Responsible Solutions, a super PAC that supports gun control.   ""One thing is really clear. We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check,"" Kelly said during CNN’s State of the Union on Oct. 4. ""That means felons, people who are dangerously mentally ill have easy access to guns."" The 40 percent figure was often invoked by gun control advocates who wanted stricter background check laws after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school mass shooting. We and other fact-checkers have pointed out that it’s based on outdated research. We wanted to know if there had been any updates that would give this statistic more weight. The 21-year-old statistic, recently reproduced in an unpublished survey, is still the best figure available, experts told us, thanks to a two-decade ban on federal funding of gun violence research. Virtually all iterations of the 40 percent claim can be traced to a 1994 survey by Duke University’s Philip Cook and the University of Chicago’s Jens Ludwig. Kelly’s source is a 2013 white paper that cites Cook and Ludwig’s survey as its source, according to a spokesperson for Americans for Responsible Solutions. The survey was based on a small sample (251 people) and counted background checks on firearm purchases before the 1996 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required federal background checks on firearm purchases, was enacted. There’s debate among researchers on whether the 40 percent figure still holds true today, and Cook and Ludwig have both said that no one knows the current percentage of guns sold without a background check. Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control, noted that the background check statistic is ""notoriously slippery,"" because gun sales that don’t go through a federally licensed seller are, as you would expect, not subject to formal record keeping. ""How would a researcher identify a sufficiently large and representative sample of non-background check gun purchases/exchanges, given the absence of a paper trail?"" Spitzer said. ""My general sense is that 40 percent might be on the high side but is certainly possible."" Nevertheless, it’s the best estimate we have, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, adding, ""There's no good reason to believe that the number has changed substantially — though we can't know for sure."" Ludwig told PolitiFact that he can see why people use the 1994 survey as the benchmark, ""even though everyone recognizes the estimate is now old."" So why is the most recent statistic on gun purchases without background checks about two decades old? There’s very little funding for research on gun violence. Problems with methodology also play a role, but the 1996 appropriations bill, experts said, is mainly to blame for the lack of research dollars. Strong-armed by the powerful gun lobby, Congress wrote in a provision that effectively banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from researching the roots of gun violence. ""None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control,"" the bill reads. ""It basically was a shot across the bow by Congress on the part of the NRA,"" Mark Rosenberg, former director of the CDC’s National Center for Injury Control and Prevention, told the Washington Post. ""All federally funded research was shut down."" As a result of the attack on CDC funding, all government funding for the issue was stifled, agreed David Hemenway, director of Harvard University’s Injury Control Research Center. Private foundations, too, were wary of putting dollars toward a controversial and politically divisive topic, he said. (There are fewer than five foundations providing the funding today, said Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program, to Slate.) Just a few years ago, it looked like things were about to change for gun violence research. In the wake of the Newtown shooting in 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation directing the CDC and other federal agencies to look into the causes of gun violence. In spite of the presidential pressure, the 20-year moratorium on gun violence research wasn’t really lifted, and researchers haven’t exactly heeded Obama’s call. Six days after the Charleston, S.C., church shooting on June 17, 2015, House Republicans blocked an amendment that would have funded CDC gun violence research in the next fiscal year. Instead, the appropriations bill ""continues the general provision to prevent any funds provided from being spent on gun research."" Advocates of the funding ban say the research is inherently biased to support stricter gun control and is irrelevant to the mission of the CDC. In the words of outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, ""a gun is not a disease."" Hemenway has managed to get around the lack of federal and private funding for gun research with a recent project financed by the Fund for a Safer Future, a program aimed at reducing gun violence. He told PolitiFact that the Harvard Injury Control Research Center conducted a 2015 national survey with a sample size over 3,000 that confirmed the 40 percent of sales without a background check figure. However, this study has not been published, and we could not read it for ourselves, so we cannot factor it into this fact-check. Our ruling Kelly said, ""We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check."" The figure he’s citing comes from a 21-year-old survey with a small sample size before a key gun law took effect. Even its authors say they’re not sure if it holds true today. Still, there are few credible alternative statistics because of a two-decade dearth of gun violence research funding.  We rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/04/mark-kelly/out-date-gun-background-check-statistic-gets-new-l/

DePetro is dead wrong about unions and the 195 land
","The demise of the Pawsox’s Providence stadium proposal is a glaring case of union-friendly government policy stifling development, according to John DePetro. The ""Red Sox baseball people"" — who wanted to build a stadium on 195 land — were ""no match for the ‘Allens Avenue’ gang"" and they ""underestimated the greed of the locals,"" the WPRO talk show host wrote in his Sept. 20 blog posted on DePetro.com. ""Remember that developers are forced to use the `195 land union’ contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project."" Are developers actually required to employ union workers for construction on property created by the relocation of Route 195? And does it cost an ""extra $10 million"" for ""any construction project""? Yes, DePetro said when we reached him, ""100 percent true."" He told us that a ""PLA,"" a project labor agreement for the development of the 195 land, requires the use of union labor for construction. Just check with the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission, said DePetro, who also said that he would try to provide a copy of the PLA. ""I know that it’s in existence."" Dyana Koelsch, spokeswoman for the commission, told us the commission is not aware of any requirement that obligates developers to use union labor. At DePetro’s suggestion, we contacted Robert J. Boisselle, president of the Rhode Island chapter of Associated Builders & Contractors, a nationwide association. The association represents 22,000 ""open shop"" construction companies that function without union labor. And like DePetro, Boisselle’s organization believes that union contractors unnecessarily add to the cost of a construction project, by 12 percent to 18  percent. Boisselle also cited a 2011 research paper produced by the law firm Venable LLP, which looked at projects across the country, including the Big Dig in Boston. But is union labor really required on the former Route 195 property?   DePetro is sure of it. Boisselle isn’t sure: ""I have not seen a document or a piece of paper that has said any projects down on the 195 land will have a PLA, but I have heard that from many sources."" Our next stop was Greg Mancini, executive director of BuildRI, which promotes unionized construction labor. Mancini, who is a lawyer, told us there is ""no special legal requirement at the federal, state or local level that mandates"" the use of union labor on the former Route 195 land. ""There’s absolutely nothing,"" he said, adding that it would be illegal for either the state or the commission to impose a requirement on developers’ privately owned construction sites. Further, when asked to respond to Boisselle’s comments on union labor costs, Mancini said he would not make a broad statement about the comparative cost of union labor. He said many developers have told his organization that unionized workers completed the job safely, on time and on budget. We also talked to Michael Sabitoni, president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, about DePetro’s statement. ""He couldn’t be more misinformed,"" Sabitoni said. Finally, we doubled back to DePetro, to let him know that the commission says there is nothing that forces developers to hire union labor on the former Route 195 land. DePetro dismissed the information from Koelsch, the commission spokeswoman, pointing to the way the  hotel workers’ union has mustered opposition to a new hotel in the Fogarty Building, downtown. ""Why? No labor agreement with hotel workers, so no hotel. In theory, one should be able to build a hotel in Providence, but in reality they cannot,"" he wrote. ""I deal in real Rhode Island,"" he said in an email. ""You are buying the Chamber of Commerce BS."" Our ruling On his blog, DePetro wrote:  ""Remember that developers are forced to use the ‘195 land union’ contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project."" DePetro was in Pants on Fire territory. But the state has entered into PLAs in the past. Construction unions are influential and the state can decide to only hire union-labor contractors for work on state land. The I-I95 commission, however, has no such requirement. Because of that, the business about $10 million in extra costs for ""any construction project,"" is irrelevant, in addition to being unsubstantiated in the original version of the blog. So ""100 percent true""? Not even close.   We rate this ruling False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/04/john-depetro/depetro-dead-wrong-about-unions-and-195-land/

Fact-checking the NRSC's 'Pandering Panda' attack on Jason Kander
","The NRSC is sponsoring an ad campaign featuring ""The Pandering Panda,"" a portrayal of Jason Kander, U.S. Senate candidate and current Missouri secretary of state, as doing anything to win over lobbyists and big money in Washington.The ad campaign features a Twitter page, YouTube video, Snapchat series and website. The YouTube ad, released Aug. 19, features a person dressed in a panda suit in various locations throughout Washington, including the White House and the Capitol. The panda character alternates between holding a burlap sack full of money and a hand-drawn sign that reads, ""I love Obama."" The ad also features clips of real pandas and high pitched voices making claims about Kander ""pandering"" for money in Washington. To date, the video has less than 12,000 views on YouTube after nearly a month online. Kander, a Democrat, is hoping to unseat Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who has held the office since 2011. Among the charges in the NRSC ad is the claim that Kander is ""attending fancy dinners all over the country."" We decided sink our claws into this claim. The NRSC provided us with a list of five fundraisers they say Kander attended between March 1 and May 31, 2015. Kander fundraiser Date Washington: Porterfield, Lowenthal, Fettig & Sears (lobbying firm) March 4, 2015 Washington: Hosted by Sen. Chris Murphy and various lobbyists May 20, 2015 Las Vegas: hosted by Harry Reid May 2015 Martha’s Vineyard Date unknown Philadelphia Date unknown We could only independently verify fundraisers in Washington and Las Vegas based on public reports. Kander's campaign manager Abe Rakov would not provide additional information about the fundraisers. So we can't tell you whether these fundraisers meet the definition of a ""fancy dinner."" The NRSC provided no specific evidence to support that part of the attack. That aside, three or five out-of-state fundraisers didn't seem like a lot to us, so we wanted to check with political scientists who are experts on the American political system. They didn't see much out of the ordinary in Kander's trips or actions based on the information provided by the NRSC. Greg Vonnahme, an associate professor of political science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, said that most congressional candidates raise most of their money from out of district and even candidates for state office will seek out-of-state sources for funding. He also notes the NRSC itself hosts fundraisers for candidates. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, raised more than half of his campaign funding from out of state in the 2014 election. ""Whether Kander attending three or five fundraisers during the period from March to May is excessive depends on one's feelings about the nature of campaign finance,"" Vonnahme said. ""But is it unusual among Democrats, Republicans, House or Senate candidates? No."" Peverill Squire, a professor of political science at MU, said this scenario of the NRSC attacking Kander for out-of-state fundraising is not uncommon. ""Given the large sums of money now required to run for the U.S. Senate, it is common for candidates, particularly from smaller, less wealthy states, to attend out-of-state fundraisers,"" Squire said. ""It is also common for the opposing party to attempt to make an issue of it. Challengers running against Senate incumbents face an uphill battle and need all the campaign money they can raise. Kander will raise as much as he can, and Blunt will likely respond by raising even larger sums."" As of the release of second-quarter campaign finances, Blunt raised $1.4 million in the second quarter as compared to Kander's $734,000. The Blunt campaign announced it has $3.8 million in cash on hand; the Kander campaign $1.1 million. Blunt's money, as of July 30, is 49.8 percent PAC donations, totaling $1.2 million compared to Kander's $176,650, totaling 11.6 percent. In total itemized contributions, Blunt has 516 Missouri donors (after refunds) resulting in $581,647, compared to Kander's 835 Missouri donors for $679,816. Blunt's campaign would not release any information regarding Blunt's travel or specific fundraisers. Our ruling The NRSC ad campaign ""Kander Pander"" involves a claim that Kander is ""attending fancy dinners all over the country."" The NRSC provided a list of five fundraisers that it says constitute fancy dinners. That evidence is fairly thin. It's also worth noting that Kander, who is currently Missouri's secretary of state, has raised plenty of money from Missourians — more than his opponent. The NRSC claim has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/02/national-republican-senatorial-committee/fact-checking-nrscs-pandering-panda-attack-jason-k/

Ora Houston incorrectly says HIV/AIDS skyrocketing among Austin women
","Public health’s focus on HIV/AIDS typically tilts toward men. That’s because men who have sex with men still face the greatest risk of getting the disease and represent most new cases. But out of the spotlight, how are women faring? ""HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin,"" Austin City Council Member Ora Houston told council colleagues Sept. 8, 2015, ""and we need to do some specific targeting for that."" Houston, who represents District 1, sought an additional  $150,000 in spending in the 2015-16 budget year for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department’s HIV/AIDS initiatives. Houston’s ask was made in the context of bolstering efforts aimed at improving the quality of life of African-Americans in Austin, an initiative the city launched several years ago. The proposal didn’t win council approval, although the department drew a 16-percent surge in its overall budget. Also, it turns out, Houston wasn’t right about HIV and AIDS among Austin women ""skyrocketing."" Yet for decades and across the nation, African-Americans have been the racial group hardest hit--with black women the most disproportionately affected. It’s a wide gap that similarly persists in Travis County. Houston says she misspoke Houston, asked how she reached her ""skyrocketing"" declaration, told us by phone she misspoke. ""The larger issue is what do we do to save the women in my community infected with HIV/AIDS,"" she said. Some background: In Travis County, fewer than one in 10 residents is black, but more than one in five of the 4,401 residents living with HIV at the end of 2014 was black, according to health department data.  Also that year, nearly 711 in every 100,000 black females living in the county, or 318 individuals, had the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. That was double the number of Hispanic females (156) and nearly triple the number of white females (109) living with HIV. From another vantage point, the rate of black females living with HIV in Travis County was over 17 times higher than the rate for white females and nearly nine times higher than the rate for Hispanic females. There were still many more men, of all races, with HIV. The rate of black males living in the county with HIV was 1,589.4 per 100,000 in 2014, reflecting 670 individuals. The rates were 634.9 for white males (1,743 people) and 617.8 for Hispanic males (1,235 individuals). Put another way, the rate of black males living with HIV/AIDS in Travis County was 2.5 times higher than the rate for white or Hispanic males. A national pattern The disparity in rates of African American women getting infected with HIV or diagnosed with AIDS, which has deepened since the epidemic began, is rooted in a variety of factors, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health. A key factor is poverty, which is more widespread in the African-American community and can result in less access to care and, often, a failure to know one’s HIV status. Also, the office says, because African-Americans tend to have sex with partners of the same race, and because the disease is higher in that population, their risk of getting HIV is greater. ""Stigma, fear, discrimination, homophobia and negative perceptions about HIV testing can also place too many African-American women at higher risk,"" the Office on Women’s Health says. ""Many at risk for infection fear stigma more than infection. They may choose instead to hide their high-risk behavior rather than get counseling and testing."" No skyrocket among Travis County women In Travis County, annual diagnoses of HIV and AIDS for women mostly declined from 2005 through 2014, health department figures show. Most recently, 4 in 100,000 female residents in the county were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2014 compared to an average 6.1 incidence rate from 2005 through 2013. The AIDS incidence rate for all women in the county was 1.9 per 100,000 women in 2014 compared to an average 4.3 rate from 2005 through 2013. Women of all races represented a small number of Travis County residents diagnosed with HIV in 2014: just 23 of the 244 cases. Also in 2014, 98 Travis County residents, including 11 females, were diagnosed with full-blown AIDS. We did not learn how many black females fell into these categories. Health department staff epidemiologist Jeff Taylor advised us by phone that because very few women are diagnosed with HIV/AIDS each year, the department doesn't publicly release raw numbers based on by race and ethnicity.  ""Some of those numbers may be one, two, three or four, and people get concerned about confidentiality,"" Taylor said. We were, however, able to compare rates among racial and ethnic groups for a decade. Each year, from 2005 through 2014, the rates of HIV and AIDS among African-American males and females in Travis County was higher than the rates among Hispanics and whites. The far higher rates in black females, when compared to Hispanic and white females, are ""startling,"" Shannon Jones III, director of the city/county health department, said at a recent conference on health disparities. Then again, the data show a 27 percent drop in new HIV diagnoses for black females between 2013 and 2014, though there was an increase in AIDS diagnoses; the incidence of 16 black females per 100,000 black women was up from 12.3 in 2013. Between 2013 and 2014, HIV rates also fell for white females but ticked up among Hispanic females from 3.2 per 100,000 in 2013 to 3.7 per 100,000 in 2014. New diagnoses of HIV are the best barometer of how the disease is trending in a community, Taylor said. Between 2005 and 2014, the rate of new HIV infections for black females in the county ranged from a high of 42.9 per 100,000 black women in 2006 to a low of 19.4 in 2011. Our ruling Houston said HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin. That’s not so. While black women have persistently been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS at higher rates than other women, HIV/AIDS incidence rates for Travis County women declined for most of the past decade.

Did Scott Walker say he wouldn't touch Wisconsin's civil service protections for state workers?
","Anyone who thought Gov. Scott Walker would ease back into his day job might have been surprised when, three days after dropping his bid for the presidency, he threw his support behind yet another reform aimed at public employees: An overhaul of Wisconsin’s civil service system, which was created more than a century ago to eliminate patronage and cronyism in most state government positions. The Republican governor's announcement drew quick denunciations from state employee unions and Democratic lawmakers such as state Sen. Jon Erpenbach of suburban Madison. ""He said he wouldn't touch the system, and now he's blowing it up,"" Erpenbach said in a Sept. 25, 2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. Leaving aside the ""blowing it up"" characterization, both Erpenbach and Walker would agree that the measure the governor supports would make significant changes to the civil service system. The question is: Did Walker at some point say, as Erpenbach claims, that he wouldn’t make any changes to the system? Civil service origins, proposed changes The state’s first civil service law was passed in 1885, establishing a merit system for Milwaukee's police and fire departments, according to a legal article on the state’s court system website. Ten years later, the Legislature passed a law forbidding bribery and other corrupt practices in state and local government. Then in 1905, under Gov. Robert M. La Follette, a law creating the civil service system was adopted, with the original slogan of: ""The best shall serve the state."" The law created merit-based hiring as well as just-cause termination for virtually all state government jobs. More specifically: Recruitment ""must be an active, continuous process that is conducted in a manner that ensures a diverse, highly qualified group of applicants."" Hiring and promotions ""must be made only according to merit and fitness, which is generally ascertained by competitive examination."" And procedures are in place for employees to file grievances and to have those complaints heard. As for the scope of the new proposal, there is fierce debate about whether it would change the core principles of the system. Erpenbach has described the proposal as ""throwing away a merit based system and moving back to the days of political patronage appointments,"" while Walker has said ""the civil service protections that are at the heart of the principle"" would remain intact, with ""no change to merit-based hiring."" The proposal would, among other things: Drop the exams that job candidates for state government are often required to take in favor of a résumé system. Define ""just cause"" for firing employees to make it clear that the state could immediately dismiss employees for showing up to work drunk, being physically violent, engaging in sexual harassment, stealing taxpayer goods or not showing up to work for three days in a year with no notification. Shorten the appeals process by more than half for employees being disciplined or fired. Put in place a single employee discipline system across nearly all state agencies ""Wouldn’t touch"" What Walker has said about his intentions for state employees has been an issue going back to before Act 10, the 2011 law that repealed most collective bargaining for most public employees. In February 2011, as daily protests drew thousands to the State Capitol, Walker claimed he had campaigned on the provisions of Act 10. We rated that statement False. He did not go public with even the bare-bones of his multi-faceted plans to sharply curb collective bargaining rights. But other statements Walker made led some to believe the governor was saying he wouldn’t touch the civil service system -- even if his statements never made such a promise. On a number of occasions in February 2011, as if to reassure state workers outraged by Act 10, Walker said union contracts weren't needed because the civil service law would protect public employees from political favoritism or retribution. And he made a point to say that Act 10 would not change civil service protections. Two examples: On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Walker said: ""There is no state that has a better civil service system in terms of protections. That does not change in this. Worker rights will be maintained even after our bill passes."" In a televised address that has become known as his ""fireside chat,"" the governor said: ""It’s important to remember that many of the rights we’re talking about don’t come directly from collective bargaining. They come from the civil service system here in Wisconsin. That law was passed in 1905, long before collective bargaining, and it will continue long after our plan is approved."" But saying that Act 10 would not change the civil service system is not the same as pledging not to make any changes to the system. And Erpenbach did not cite any such statements from Walker to us. Indeed, there have been signs that changes would be made. In June 2014, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that in recent months, Walker administration officials had said multiple times they weren't looking to change the civil service system. For instance, then-Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch insisted they were not considering any changes to the core principles of civil service. And a spokeswoman for Walker's Department of Administration said at the time that Walker had no interest in changing civil servants’ protections. But the Journal Sentinel also reported that records it had obtained showed there had been early-stage discussions about removing red tape that slows hiring for state jobs. And the next month, Walker didn’t directly respond to a request from the Journal Sentinel when asked if he favored changing current civil service protections. Our rating Erpenbach said Walker ""said he wouldn't touch"" the state civil service system but now supports overhauling it. In arguing for Act 10, which repealed most collective bargaining rights for most public employees, Walker repeatedly cited the strength of employee protections in Wisconsin’s civil service system, and said his 2011 law wouldn’t change the protections. That led some to believe Walker wouldn’t try to change the civil service system. But we found no evidence that Walker made such a pledge, and there have been indications in the past year that he might seek changes. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

Clinton campaign: Benghazi probe is Congress' longest investigation ever
","Critics of the House of Representatives’ Benghazi investigation have recently begun to make a strong claim -- that it is officially the longest congressional investigation in history. The Select Committee on Benghazi came into existence in May 2014, charged with investigating the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in the Libyan city that left four Americans dead. Costing $4.5 million so far, with no final report in sight, critics see the committee as a waste of taxpayer dollars and a partisan witch hunt aimed at Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton is slated to testify before the committee later in October. In recent days, the claim that this is the longest-running investigation ever has gone somewhat viral. We saw it in The Hill, Salon, The New York Times, Esquire, MSNBC, ABC News and, notably, a Twitter account belonging to Clinton’s campaign. The Briefing -- an arm of the Clinton campaign that aims to counter what it considers misinformation in the public sphere -- tweeted on Sept. 30 from its account: ""It's the longest-running congressional investigation ever. It's cost taxpayers $4 million. And what's it about?"" Most outlets reporting this factoid have measured the length of the Benghazi investigation by how long the select committee has been in existence -- 72 weeks, or roughly 17 months. They note in particular that this is now longer than the Watergate investigation in the 1970s -- that committee existed for about 16 months -- and also longer than probes into Pearl Harbor and Hurricane Katrina. When we contacted the Clinton campaign, they pointed to some of those news reports as evidence. However, we found numerous examples of congressional committee investigations that have lasted much longer than the Benghazi panel's 17 months. Here are some examples, covering the period from when the investigation was launched to when a final report was issued: • House Select Committee on Assassinations, 30 months: In September 1976, the House established this committee to investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., as well as the government's response. The committee issued its report January 1979. • Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor-Management Relations, 38 months: This committee looked into racketeering in the labor industry from January 1957 to March 1960. • Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, 40 months: This committee had a broad charge to investigate the conduct of the Civil War, starting December 1861 and producing a final report May 1865. • Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, 90 months: This committee examined questions about the awarding of defense contracts during World War II, running from 1941 to 1948. This panel brought national attention to a previously obscure Democratic senator, Harry Truman. These four investigations were -- like the one on Benghazi -- conducted by a special committee dedicated solely to that investigation.  We found other investigations that also lasted longer than Benghazi but were conducted by permanent committees rather than special panels. For example: The Senate’s permanent government affairs committee spent nearly 30 months investigating the 2007-08 financial crisis. The House ethics committee spent about two years -- from 2008 to 2010 -- looking into allegations of misconduct by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. And a former permanent Senate panel, the Committee on Public Lands, spent more than two years, from 1922-24, investigating the infamous Teapot Dome scandal. The difference between select (or special) committees and permanent committees is important, because the latter have a variety of responsibilities that can affect how long it takes them to finish a single investigation, said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute and an expert in congressional procedure. There’s also some room for disagreement over when an investigation actually starts and ends, said Douglas Kriner, a Boston University political science professor writing a book on congressional oversight. For example, the 1940s National Defense Program committee investigation could have several possible end dates, including the committee’s official closing in 1948 or the date that its first chair, Truman, was elevated to vice president in 1944. It’s also worth noting that before the Benghazi committee started the official probe, Congress held a variety of hearings on the attacks. But this is the case for many of these investigations -- and even if you take the questionable step of starting the clock with some of the earlier congressional Benghazi investigations, several probes through history still lasted longer than the ones on Benghazi. ""On most metrics, reasonable people can agree that other investigations have been longer than (Benghazi),"" Kriner said.   Our ruling Clinton’s campaign said the Benghazi probe is ""the longest-running congressional investigation ever."" The clearest way to measure this is to look at when a special congressional committee dedicated to a specific investigation officially began and ended. By this measure, this claim is wrong. While the Benghazi investigation has lasted about 17 months, we found other investigations that lasted 30, 40 and even 90 months. And the number of longer investigations only goes up once probes by permanent committees are included.

"['Energy', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush claims U.S. has enjoyed fastest crude oil production increase in history
","Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said in his recently released energy plan that the United States should take advantage of its resurgent status as ""a global energy superpower."" Thanks to new means of extracting oil such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, there’s been an unprecedented spike in domestic oil production, the former Florida governor said. ""Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history,"" his plan read. Has oil production really seen the fastest increase in the nation’s history, topping 80 percent or higher since 2008? It sure has, reversing a decline that began back in 1986. We went to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which keeps monthly and annual statistics for crude oil production. They said that in 2008, the United States produced 5 million barrels per day, a figure that has jumped to more than 9 million per day in 2015. A Bush spokeswoman confirmed to us that was the same data they were using when drawing up the energy plan. As you can see, that’s a pretty steep spike in production over a seven-year period:  The change is largely because of the reasons Bush gave, according to EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan. Better technology like fracking and horizontal drilling, which makes extraction from geological formations like layers of shale easier, has led to an overall increase in output. Relatively high oil prices (about $140 per barrel in 2008, as opposed to less than $50 recently) also helped lead to the ramp-up in production. You may recall that gas prices reached a single-day high in 2008, with a gallon costing $4.11 that July. The highest-ever nationwide annual average of $3.60 per gallon was in 2012. Mark Perry, a University of Michigan-Flint economics professor working with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that Bush’s take is accurate. He said based on EIA numbers through July, U.S. crude production has gone up 83 percent since 2008. That bumps up to 88 percent if you measure the current 2015 average of almost 9.4 million barrels per day. (We will note that 2008 includes a storm-related drop in September, when hurricanes Ike and Gustav churned through the Gulf of Mexico and production dropped to less than 4 million barrels per day.) ""It’s pretty clear that the production increase from 2008-15 ... has been the largest production increase ever in U.S. history in such a short period of time,"" he said via email. From 2009 to 2014, the increase in oil production didn’t bring the price drop economists expected, Perry said. Now that oil prices have dropped so much recently, we’re just starting to see production back off. The latest EIA data showed production has dropped 144,000 barrels per day since July, with estimates saying it’s going to continue to decrease. ""It took a while for the price to finally catch up to the increased U.S. production, and now we’re in an adjustment period,"" Perry said. He said the slowdown was temporary and ""will likely be followed by another period of increased production in a year or two when oil prices go back up above $50 and stay there."" Our ruling Bush said, ""Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history."" That’s accurate, as high prices and new extraction methods have led to a significant increase in the amount of crude oil the country produces. Depending on how you calculate it, production has gone up 83 percent through July, or 88 percent if you use the current 2015 average. Production is currently dipping downward, but it’s easily the fastest increase in a seven-year span in U.S. history.

Scott Walker: Israel says its wall led to 90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks
","With Gov. Scott Walker out of the GOP presidential race, there’s likely to be little talk about the idea of a wall with Canada. But some of the remaining candidates are calling for a wall with Mexico aimed at securing that border from illegal immigrants. And several of them have cited an example from Israel to bolster their stance -- including Walker, when he was a candidate. He pointed to one statistic we wanted to check. During an Aug. 17, 2015 appearance on Glenn Beck’s radio show, Walker recalled his trip to the Middle East where he saw the barrier that had been constructed between Israel and the West Bank. ""They’ve seen something like over a 90 percent reduction in terrorist acts in that country that they attribute to having an effective fence,"" Walker said. ""If Israel can do it effectively, there’s no reason why America can’t."" That’s a significant decrease. Is it accurate? A little background Israelis and Palestinians have a long history of conflict over rights to land in the Middle East. Our quick history will start in 1947, when the United Nations set out to create a Jewish and an Arab state, but only the Jewish state came into being. The state of Israel was founded on May 14, 1948. Almost immediately, Arab armies invaded the new Jewish state. The conflict ended with armistice agreements made between Israel and its neighboring Arab states, after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the region. Those who stayed became Israeli citizens. The rest became refugees and remain stateless. Periodic bouts of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continued, with arguments centered on control of land and borders. Violence and terrorist attacks ebbed and flowed along with the political tensions in the region. A major Palestinian uprising against Israel started in 2000 after failed peace talks and became known as the Second Intifada. The first Intifada took place in the late 1980s and early 90s. In 2003, Israel began construction on a barrier to separate Israelis and Palestinians and prevent terrorists from entering Israel. Behind the numbers When asked for backup, Walker’s team sent a report compiled by the Jewish Virtual Library and last updated in April 2015. It says, ""since construction of the fence began, the number of attacks has declined by more than 90%."" The Jewish Virtual Library is a project of the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, a nonprofit group with the goal of strengthening U.S. relations with Israel. Mitchell Bard, author of the report and executive director of the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, said the numbers for the report came from the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Here’s how the numbers shake out: Year Number of attacks 2002 135 2003 67 2004 45 2005 28 2006 48 2007 10 2008 30 2009 14 2010 7 2011 11 2012 9 The report used 2002, a year before construction began, as a baseline for comparison. But 2002 was at the height of a streak of violence in the region, the Second Intifada, so that helps shade the picture from the beginning. The data shows a wave of terrorist attacks in the region between 2001 and 2006. In 2001, there were 118 attacks, while in 2000 just 29 occurred, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. ""The year itself is an anomaly,"" said James Gelvin, professor at University of California-Los Angeles and author of ""Israel Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War."" ""It was an extraordinarily bloody affair and that was when the wall was under construction,"" Gelvin said. ""Of course, after it ended attacks would go down anyway."" There is another issue: The data is outdated, only going through 2012. The following year, 2013, there were 11 incidents. Bard noted that when data from 2013 is added it still amounts to a 90 percent drop. But in 2014 the number of attacks jumped to 62. By that measure, it is more like a 50 percent drop. So, the use of outdated numbers skews the end result. In addition, the wall was not built in isolation. Even Bard, the author of the Jewish Virtual Library analysis, said ""the main thing"" contributing to the decrease was not the wall itself, but the activity of Israeli security forces along the barrier. He said the dramatic decrease in attacks was ""in part because of the fence,"" but also cited checkpoints and cooperation between military and security forces as important factors. In short, attributing this short-term downward trend in attacks to the barrier is taking a very narrow approach to a more complicated issue. Finally, the way Walker constructed the statement gives it an extra twist. He noted Israeli leaders attribute the drop in terrorist attacks to the wall. By implication, he seems to agree with them. We found many references to the success of the ""anti-terrorist fence"" on Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Most notably on a Frequently Asked Questions page about the conflict, the ministry says, ""data reveals a clear correlation between the construction of the fence and a drop in the number of terrorist attacks."" Our rating Walker said Israel has seen a ""90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks"" that it attributes to building a 500-mile fence. A report from the Jewish Virtual Library showed a 90 percent reduction in terrorism, and the Israeli government does cite the fence as the reason for the drop. But the data used is outdated and once more recent years are added, the drop since 2002 is more like 50 percent. What’s more experts say the barrier is but one reason for the decline. Walker’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/02/scott-walker/scott-walker-israel-says-its-wall-led-90-percent-r/

Glenn Hegar says 650 people giddyap to Texas every day
","No mistake, Glenn Hegar is bullish on the Texas economy. The Republican state comptroller has launched a 27-city ""Good for Texas"" tour of the state that got our attention after he told Georgetown residents Texas remains a magnet for people otherwise stuck elsewhere. ""We have 650 people who move to Texas every day who want to come here for that economic opportunity,"" Hegar said Sept. 10, 2015, according to Community Impact News. ""That’s about half a million people who are moving to Texas every single year, and there is no better place to see that than in Central Texas and this region. The population increase has been phenomenal."" We suspect Hegar's ""about half a million"" referred to the state's total annual population growth. But was he right about 650 people a day moving to the state? We’ve spotted flaws in Gone-To-Texas claims before. In June 2014, for instance, we pointed out that while 1,000 people a day may have moved to the state from July 2012 through June 2013, net migration — taking into account people who (unfathomably) left Texas — broke out to about 487 people a day, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. To our inquiry about Hegar’s figure, Lauren Willis, a spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, told us by email that he relied on figures provided by IHS Inc., a Colorado-based consulting and information-services company. She also sent along a chart stating that according to IHS and the Census Bureau, Texas grew by 1,230 residents a day in 2014 with net migration, from other states and abroad, accounting for 666 of that average daily increase; Texas births outpacing deaths explained the rest of the growth. We sought elaboration from an IHS economist, Karl Kuykendall, who said the company reached its net migration figures for 2014 by starting from the bureau’s Current Population Survey estimates for net migration into Texas from July 2013 through June 2014, drawing on state population estimates released in December 2014, then reaching a calendar-year 2014 estimation of migration by assuming the state would grow at the same pace through December 2014. Kuykendall also guided us to the bureau’s population estimates of annual net migration to Texas, domestic and international, covering July-through-June periods from 2010-11 through 2013-14. From that, we confirmed the bureau’s latest estimates indicated Texas enjoyed a July 2013-July 2014 net gain of 84,637 residents through international migration and a net gain of 154,467 residents thanks to domestic migration. All told, that breaks out to total net migration to Texas of 655 people a day, very close to the 666 net migration estimated by IHS for all of 2014. Separately, an expert with the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center, directed by Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, told us it previously calculated the same net migration of 655 people a day. By email, Rafael Emmanuel González said the center reached the figure by pairing data from the bureau’s 2014 Population Estimates of the Components of Population Change and information from the bureau’s 2013 State-to-State Migration Flows. So the best available numbers at the time Hegar spoke support what he said. González noted, though, that the bureau subsequently posted fresh figures based on its one-year American Community Survey perhaps indicating even greater net migration to Texas. The  information wouldn’t have been available to Hegar when he spoke. Still, it’s worth mentioning that according to these ACS results, an estimated 538,572 Texas residents reported living in another state the year before and 217,392 had been living abroad. Subtract the 435,107 people estimated to have left Texas for another state in the meantime, and net migration to Texas amounts to 320,857 people--or 879 net new residents a day. That’s probably an overstatement to a degree; the bureau does not try to estimate the number of people who have left any state for another country, Bernstein said. We asked Potter about why migration estimates bounce around. He emailed: ""From year to year, migration numbers do fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. Our economy was doing very well in 2013-14, bolstered by oil extraction, but was doing well even without. Next year, I’m anticipating migration will still be high, but we may see some muffling starting to show up with the reductions in extraction. Migration is usually and mostly driven by economic opportunity, thus, as our economy goes, we can expect migration to go."" Our ruling Hegar said: ""We have 650 people who move to Texas every day."" Different government estimates suggest the state has lately been netting 655 or even around 880 new residents a day, depending on the estimate. It’s also worth noting Hegar could float a much bigger number by tallying solely people GTT, but that number would fail to account for people leaving the state. We rate this claim True.

Viral image claims Clintons stole $200k in furniture, china and artwork from White House
","An old complaint about Hillary Clinton, stemming from her days as first lady, is making a comeback during her run for the presidency. When the Clintons left Washington in 2001 at the end of President Bill Clinton’s second term, they took a lot of things with them. The problem was, they took some things they should have left behind. A conservative website called Radix News posted this graphic on its Facebook page: ""After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House china, furniture and artwork that she had stolen.""  There is a grain of truth to this claim, but we found multiple problems -- the amount is off, and ""stolen"" is an inaccurate word to describe Clinton’s actions. Also, despite the graphic's use of the word ""force,"" it’s important to note that law enforcement did not come into play in this episode. When Bill and Hillary left town Federal rules strictly limit gifts for nearly every member of the executive branch, but the exceptions include the president and vice president. They may accept gifts, due to the needs of protocol and etiquette. There are some limits, but for the most part, if you want to show your appreciation for the occupant of the White House, you can. This courtesy extends to the entire first family -- and, importantly for this fact-check, if they want to keep those gifts when they leave, they can. The president must report gifts over a certain value; during most of the Clinton years, the amount was $250, though today it is $350. When Bill Clinton completed his term, he submitted a final disclosure form that listed roughly $190,000 in gifts. Clinton’s itemized list caught the eye of the Washington Post and provided plenty of fodder for the curious. People gave the president a notable quantity of golf clubs. Movie star Sylvester Stallone gave him a pair of boxing gloves. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg sent him china. And one Steve Mittman from New York gave him two sofas, an easy chair and ottoman worth $19,900. The problem was, Mittman and a few others included on the list said they never intended their gifts to go to the Clintons. They thought they were donating to the White House itself as part a major remodeling project in 1993. This is where the questions of provenance get muddy. Some gifts are intended for the government, and must stay in the government’s hands, while some are intended for the person living in the White House. But it’s not always as simple as ""this is mine"" and ""that is Uncle Sam’s."" Within about two weeks of the publication of the Post article, public criticism escalated, and the Clintons announced that they would pay the government nearly $86,000 for items that were actually government property. A few days after that, they also returned about $48,000 worth of furniture (including the sofas, chair and ottoman from Mittman). Add that up and the government got back $134,000 out of the $190,000 the Clinton’s had declared as gifts. But as an indication of how hard it is to determine ownership, the National Park Service, which oversees the White House property, later returned a chair and an ottoman to the Clintons. The House investigates The House Committee on Government Reform looked into the fracas over the Clintons’ gifts. While its report never accused the former first family of criminal wrongdoing, it noted shortcomings in how gifts were processed, saying there was no independent assessment of gifts and that some had likely been undervalued. For example, lawmakers were skeptical of the estimated value of $240 for a John Quincy Adams-signed original land grant from 1826. There was also a large Coach leather travel bag, which the White House estimated at $200 but which investigators found priced at $498 to $698, and a Tiffany necklace valued at $150 but that Tiffany's valued at $450 to $1,000. There were instances of a twisted paper trail in which the National Park Service thanked donors for certain items but never formally added them to the permanent White House collection, which meant the Clintons could take them for themselves or for the Clinton Library. The committee found that giving things to the White House and its occupants was governed by several laws and six federal offices and agencies. Its overall conclusion was that the system was too complicated and left the government vulnerable. ""Since the current system is subject to abuse and political interference, there is a need for centralized accountability in one agency staffed by career employees,"" it said. Among the aspects of the case that lawmakers found troubling was the apparent violation of the ban on soliciting gifts. It’s fine under the law to accept someone’s generosity, but you can’t tell them what you want. This came up in regards to a portion of the goods the Clintons kept --  about $38,000 worth of goods given to Hillary Clinton in December 2000. That was after she won her Senate race in New York, but before she took office, at which point accepting such gifts would have violated Senate rules. Clinton had created a gift registry at Borsheim’s Fine Jewelry and Gifts. This yielded 16 rimmed soup bowls worth $2,352 and a soup tureen worth $1,365, among other items. Even before the registry episode, the White House had retained an interior decorator who, according to the report, coordinated 43 of the 45 furniture gifts received over the Clintons’ eight years. Kathleen Clark focuses on government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis. For her, that interior decorator raised a flag. ""I don’t know how you coordinate gifts without soliciting them,"" Clark said. Ultimately, the first family retained 227 of 14,770 gifts given over the eight years. The accusation of theft The viral image accuses the Clintons of theft. However, their public declaration of all the things they were taking makes it harder to call what they did ""stealing."" ""Calling the Clintons’ actions ‘stealing’ or ‘theft’ is hyperbolic,"" Clark said. ""It’s hard to take that language seriously in this context."" Richard Painter served as the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. He now teaches at the University of Minnesota Law School. Painter said the paper trail is ""strange."" ""Perhaps it was stuff that was given to them and they turned it over to the government and then changed their mind and treated it as a gift to them and put it on the 278 (disclosure form) and took it with them,"" Painter said. ""That is more debatable, depending on the intent of the donor."" The congressional report notes that there were some instances in which donor wishes were disregarded, but it also describes confusion in defining ownership and disposing of the gifts. To the extent that the Clintons were forced to pay for or return certain items, that was not under penalty of law. It would be more accurate to say that they quickly bowed to public pressure. The Reagans had issues too As an aside, we’ll note that the problem of gifts to the first family was not a new one. For instance, the IRS investigated President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan in 1989. At issue were gowns worth as much as $25,000 and diamond jewelry that had been loaned to Nancy Reagan. A year before, the White House Ethics Office found that the president could accept a $2.5 million home in Bel Air, Calif., purchased on his behalf by undisclosed friends. However, the Reagans ultimately repaid the donors. Our ruling A viral graphic said that Hillary Clinton was forced to return about $200,000 worth of furniture, artwork and china that she had stolen from the White House. The statement contains several inaccuracies. The Clintons returned about $48,000 in furniture, and they paid the government about $86,000 for other items. Any way you count it, the $200,000 figure is too high. According to top ethics lawyers, it’s at least debatable -- and at worst hyperbolic -- to say the Clintons ""stole"" the items. A congressional investigation found poor tracking of ownership and final disposition of gifts, which makes it hard to speak definitively of wrongdoing. In fact, two items the Clintons returned were ultimately sent back to them. Finally, it’s worth making clear that the ""force"" they responded to was political pressure, not legal jeopardy. Accusations of stealing are serious and require a high threshold of evidence, unmet by the charges in this over-the-top graphic. We rate the claim Mostly False.
