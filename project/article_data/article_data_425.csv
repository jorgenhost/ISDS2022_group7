Mark Warner says U.S. would gain revenue by cutting income tax rates and exemptions
","
U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says Americans must be willing to sacrifice popular income tax exemptions if they are serious about cutting the national debt.

The Virginia Democrat has long argued that the only realistic cure for the debt, now at $15.1 trillion, is a regimen of spending cuts and revenue increases. Warner has urged Congress to consider all options, including narrowing deductions for home mortgage interest and phasing in personal income taxes on health care benefits provided by employers.

In an Oct. 31 interview on MSNBC, Warner promoted broad tax reform that would close loopholes -- called ""tax expenditures"" in congressional parlance -- and compensate filers for some of their loss by lowering personal income tax rates.  He offered no specifics.

""You can cut everybody’s (income) taxes in half and actually raise more revenues if you’re willing to get rid of all the tax expenditures, tax breaks,"" Warner told host Joe Scarborough. ""We’re not suggesting you do all that, but there’s a lot of headroom there to be able to generate revenues and reduce rates.""

Personal incomes taxes are the federal government’s largest revenue source, providing 45 percent of its tax receipts. We were curious if the U.S. government could make money by slicing rates in half and clamping personal deductions. So we looked into it.

Warner prefaced his claim to Scarborough with a familiar assertion: The U.S. gives up more in tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes. We examined that claim by him early this year and rated it True. During fiscal years 2009 and 2010, individuals received a total of about $1.98 trillion in breaks for the $1.85 trillion in income tax they paid, according to data from the Office of Management and Budget.

We pored through the OMB spreadsheets again to get to the bottom of Warner’s latest claim. They detail 136 exemptions for personal income taxes and the estimated cost of each one. We rounded off the figures and added them up.

For fiscal 2012 -- the federal budget year that began Oct. 1 -- the total estimated value of personal exemptions comes to $1.145 trillion. Uncle Sam expects to collect $1.140 trillion in personal income taxes.

If the U.S. eliminated all the personal income tax loopholes and cut rates in half, that would result in about $574.2 billion in additional revenues for 2012. So Warner is correct. In fiscal 2011, Washington would have received about an extra $594 billion had personal income tax rates been halved and exemptions ended.

We ran our computations by Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Commons Sense. ""The numbers are all correct,"" he told us. ""It makes sense.""

Warner has sought unsuccessfully this year to fashion a bipartisan debt reduction plan that would cut spending, raise revenues and simplify the tax code. ""He’s not calling for instantly eliminating the most popular tax expenditures,"" said Kevin Hall, the senator’s spokesman. ""There are a lot of different ideas that are out there for reform.""

The largest break to individuals is not having to pay income taxes on their employers’ contributions to their personal health care and health insurance premiums. That’s worth about $132 billion a year in taxes. A presidential commission, whose work Warner admired, last year recommended phasing it out by 2038.

Second biggest break is the net exclusion of pension contributions and earnings, worth about $119 billion a year in annual taxes.

The popular mortgage-interest deduction is worth $97 billion a year. Hall said Warner has spoken about restricting the deduction to principal residences and capping eligible mortgages for complete interest deduction at $750,000 mortgage, instead of the current $1 million.

Our conclusion:

Warner says the U.S. could raise money by cutting personal income rates in half and ending deductions.

We ran the numbers and found, under the senator’s scenario, the U.S. would collect about $574.2 billion in additional revenues during the current fiscal year. Uncle Sam would have gained about $594 billion during fiscal 2011.

We rate Warner’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEABD40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/25/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-us-would-gain-revenue-cutting-inc/
"['Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Unions', 'Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Mike Tate']","
Top Democrat says GOP Wisconsin Gov. Walker ""slashed"" public employee benefits
","
On the day the campaign to remove Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker from office was launched, talk show host Al Sharpton asked Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate to tell MSNBC viewers ""why it is so important that Walker be recalled.""

Sharpton wanted Tate to explain the budget-repair bill that Walker proposed a month after taking office in January 2011 -- the one that, because it curtailed collective bargaining for most state and local government employees, spurred weeks of public protests and national media attention.

In the Nov. 15, 2011 interview, Tate replied that Act 10, ""effectively eliminated collective bargaining rights for all of our public employees, our schoolteachers and our public service workers.

""And beyond that,"" Tate continued, the Republican governor ""slashed their pension and benefits.""

It is well established that Walker’s initiative, approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, limited collective bargaining for all but a few groups of public employees.

And it’s well known the law forces them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance -- giving the state and local governments flexibility, Walker argued, to balance their books.

But did Walker also reduce -- or ""slash,"" to use Tate’s word --  the pensions and benefits themselves?

Walker’s treatment of public employees could be a key issue in a recall election, which would be held sometime in 2012 if the Democratic Party and other groups leading the recall campaign can gather enough signatures.

So let’s evaluate Tate’s statement, in two parts.

Pensions

Before the budget-repair law -- which exempts police, state troopers and  firefighters -- public employees contributed less than 1 percent of their pay toward their pensions; some made no contribution at all. For 2011, most workers covered by the law pay 5.8 percent and some pay 6.65 percent, according to the Office of State Employment Relations.

Tate argued that employees ""are effectively being asked to take a pay cut by contributing more of their own wages towards their defined benefit package.""

Indeed, many employees might view the higher pension contributions they have to make as a reduction in their pension benefit: In terms of their total compensation, their take-home pay is being reduced in order to fund the same pension benefit they’re already getting.

No pension payments to workers at retirement are actually being reduced. But going forward, a relatively small number of public workers will earn a smaller pension benefit.

The reduction affects about 1,500 public employees, primarily elected officials in local government, said Shawn Smith, spokeswoman for the state Department of Employee Trust Funds. The department administers retirement and other benefit programs for state and local government employees and retirees.

That’s less than 1 percent of the more than 266,000 public employees who participate in the state retirement system, Smith said.

For the 1,500, the ""multiplier"" used to calculate their pension was reduced from 2 percent to 1.6 percent for years of service logged after the budget-repair bill was enacted. Going forward, those employees will earn a somewhat lower pension, given that the multiplier is used along with average salary and years of service to determine the pension amount.

So, for all public employees affected by the budget-repair law, the pension benefit, in a general sense, is reduced because they are paying more for it. But the pension benefit that ultimately will be earned by current employees will be lower only for a small number of them.  

Benefits

Regarding the benefits part of Tate’s statement, Walker’s budget-repair law requires state employees, as well as local government workers who get their health insurance from a state plan, to pay at least 12 percent of the premiums.

In arguing that the benefits themselves were cut, Tate cited a September 2011 memo from the state Department of Employee Trust Funds. It notes that the budget-repair law mandated a 5 percent reduction in the cost to the state of health plans.

That was achieved, said Smith, by requiring the nearly 184,000 public employees and their dependents who are covered by a state plan to pay 10 percent co-insurance for certain medical services, up to $1,000 per year per family. That means the state now pays 90 percent, rather than 100 percent, for care that stems from an illness or injury, as opposed to preventative care.

(Co-insurance, which requires the employee to pay a percentage of the cost of certain services, is different from a co-payment, which is a fixed amount that employees pay for certain services. Both are common in the private sector.)

So, this is a double-hit to all state employees covered by Walker’s budget-repair law. They are paying more for their health insurance and getting less, given that the state is paying only 90 percent of the cost of many services rather than 100 percent.

Our conclusion

Tate said Walker ""slashed"" the pensions and benefits of state and local government employees.

While the two benefits themselves are not being ""slashed,"" the reductions along with the higher amounts the employees must pay for their benefits are significant.

The PolitiFact definition for Half True is ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""

That’s what we rate Tate’s statement.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6DD180>],/factchecks/2011/nov/25/mike-tate/top-democrat-says-gop-wisconsin-gov-walker-slashed/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Government Regulation', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Regulation', '60 Plus Association']","
60 Plus Association, with spokesman Pat Boone, says the IPAB is like ""a Medicare IRS""
","
Clean-cut 1950s songster Pat Boone, who grew famous by recording cover versions of tunes like """"Tutti Frutti,"" ""Long Tall Sally,"" and ""Ain’t That a Shame,"" has been recycling old material again on television in Ohio.

On Nov. 9, the conservative senior citizens’ group 60 Plus announced it was launching a $750,000 television ad campaign featuring Boone to target Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.

The ad, broadcast statewide, made a series of claims about last year’s health care law, including one that takes aim at the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which the law created to suggest ways to limit Medicare’s spending growth.

The IPAB, it says, is ""a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare to pay for new government programs.""

The group behind the ad is so taken with the Medicare-IRS analogy that it has established a website devoted to that theme which claims IPAB is  ""in effect, a kind of Medicare IRS that will cut payment rates to doctors and nursing homes.""

PolitiFact has already ruled on some other claims in the ad. We thought this one was worth a look, too.

For starters, it’s useful to touch on some of those earlier claims.

PolitiFact has repeatedly examined the claim that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will cut $500 billion from Medicare and rated it Mostly False. A review of the claim from an earlier 60 Plus ad noted, ""the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, it attempts to slow the program’s future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase - the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.""

PolitiFact has repeatedly rated past claims that IPAB has the power to ration care or deny specific treatments to patients False. A PolitiFact examination of a claim by presidential candidate Michele Bachmann noted IPAB is forbidden from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care,"" as Section 3403 of the health care law states.

That’s significant given the claim in the new 60 Plus ad that the IPAD has ""the power to cut Medicare.""

If growth in Medicare spending is projected to exceed certain targets, IPAB must come up with plans to slow that increase, but it can only suggest changes to Medicare.  If Congress does not act on its recommendations within a set time frame, those recommendations are automatically implemented. But the decision is in the hands of Congress. The law permits Congress to come up with equal cost reductions of its own, or vote to disregard the recommendations outright by a three-fifths majority.

""The IPAB is specifically forbidden from making any recommendations that would ration care, reduce benefits, raise premiums or cost-sharing or alter eligibility for Medicare,"" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the House Energy and Commerce Committee this July. ""And all final decisions remain in the hands of Congress. If Medicare costs are rising at an unsustainable rate, it’s Congress’s choice whether to accept those recommendations or come up with recommendations of its own to put Medicare spending on a stable, sustainable path.""

PolitFact Ohio was puzzled by the ad’s comparison of IPAB to the Internal Revenue Service. IPAB is a 15-member board that’s supposed to suggest ways to reduce growth in Medicare spending. IRS is a mammoth government agency that collects taxes, enforces the tax laws set by Congress, and helps taxpayers understand and comply with those laws. So we asked 60 Plus spokesman Gerry Scimeca to explain the similarities.

Scimeca said that both groups are intimidating bureaucracies that operate in secret and make decisions that dramatically affect the lives of average Americans.

""IPAB will unilaterally render a sentence affecting all seniors on Medicare, impacting what remedies are available to seniors in need of health care, and giving bureaucrats immense power over available remedies and their costs,"" Scimeca said in an email. ""Like the IRS, IPAB will operate in secret, will have vast powers to reach into our lives, and will have the final, irrefutable say on Medicare policy.""

But that description simply is not accurate.

The IPAB appointments will be done in public. Members will be chosen by the president, with confirmation from the Senate. It would not have the power to issue edicts. Rather, it can only make recommendations. That those findings can be overruled by Congress hardly makes its rulings ""unilateral"" or ""final,"" as Scimeca says.

The functions of IRS and IPAB are entirely unrelated. Some taxpayers may consider the IRS to be scary and 60 Plus may be scared by IPAB. But that does not make IPAB board a ""Medicare IRS.""

In the late 1950s, Elvis Presley, whose repertoire included the hit ""Burning Love,"" eclipsed Boone in popularity. Boone’s website proudly notes that Presley once opened at one of Boone’s concerts.

""Thank God I had a couple of hit records then and I was the star that night. I never followed Elvis again!"" Boone says on the website.

If he were the speaker here, rather than just the spokesman, he’d be following Elvis’ ""Burning Love"" with his own fiery song, ""Burning Pants.""

The claim by 60 Plus Association is not only inaccurate, it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE503C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/25/60-plus-association/60-plus-association-spokesman-pat-boone-says-ipab/

Steve Rothman says it costs more to make a penny and nickel than the coins are worth
","
Penny-pinching holiday shoppers may be more thrifty than you think.

The U.S. Mint spends more to make coins stamped with portraits of Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson than the currency is worth, according to U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman.  

""Currently it costs more than a penny for the U.S. Mint to make a one cent coin and more than a nickel to make the five cent piece,"" Rothman (D-9th Dist.) said in a statement submitted to the Congressional Record on Nov. 2. Rothman’s statement called attention to an opinion article in the New York Times written by a Bergen County freeholder that suggested alternate materials  for penny production.

PolitiFact New Jersey found the congressman is right on the money.

The total cost to produce and distribute a penny in 2010 was 1.79 cents, according to the U.S. Mint’s most recent annual report.

A nickel cost the government 9.22 cents.

Overall, the U.S. Mint lost  $42.6 million on the more than 3.48 billion pennies and 359 million nickels produced and distributed in fiscal year 2010.

The government has been losing money on producing these smaller denomination coins since 2006, when a rise in the price of the metals used to make the coins increased the overall production costs, according to annual reports.

The Mint’s most recent annual report said that ""changing the composition of coins to less expensive alternative materials could generate significant cost savings."" The composition of the penny and nickel is set by statute.

""In 1982, the penny composition changed from copper alloy (95% copper, 5% zinc) to copper plated zinc (total content 97.5% zinc, 2.5% copper),"" Gordon Hume, a spokesman for the U.S. Mint told us in an email. ""The nickel has remained unchanged since 1866 at 75% copper, 25% nickel. The only exception was from 1942 to 1945 when the nickel was 56% copper, 35% silver, 9% manganese.""

This summer the Mint contracted Concurrent Technologies Corporation, a Johnstown, Pa.-based company, to research and recommend less expensive metallic materials for coin production.

It’s worth noting that while the U.S. Mint is losing money on pennies and nickels, it’s still turning a profit on higher denomination coins.

In 2010, dimes cost 5.69 cents to produce and distribute, quarters cost 12.78 cents and dollar coins went for 31.57 cents.

Our ruling

Rothman claimed it costs more for the U.S. Mint to produce a penny and nickel than the face value of the coins.

It costs 1.79 cents to produce and distribute every penny the Mint makes. And every nickel costs 9.22 cents.

So, you can bank on those numbers. We rate the congressman’s statement True.

Mitt Romney says Hezbollah in Latin America poses an imminent threat to the United States
","Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, asked during a Republican presidential debate in Washington to suggest an important national security issue that isn't getting enough attention, said Islamic terror group Hezbollah is ""working throughout Latin America,"" including Mexico, ""which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America.""

He wasn't the only one raising concern about the radical Shiite Muslim group's activity in Latin America at the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN debate.

Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum talked about ""radical Islamists"" joining with ""militant socialists"" in Central and South America. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said, ""We know that Hamas and Hezbollah are working in Mexico, as well as Iran, with their ploy to come into the United States.""

We wondered: Was Romney right? Is the Lebanon-based group linked to the bombing of U.S. Marine barracks in 1983 networking just south of our border?

The issue came up with a question from a visiting fellow from the American Enterprise Institute, one of the sponsors of the debate. ""My question has to do with the unexpected,"" he said. ""During the 2000 presidential debates, Gov. George W. Bush was never asked about the threat from al-Qaida, yet the battle with al-Qaida dominated his presidency. What national security issue do you worry about that nobody is asking about, either here or in any of the debates so far?""

When it was Romney's turn to answer, he said:

""Rick (Santorum), in my view, is right with regards to long-term security interests, and that's -- and that's China, although that's very much on our agenda.

""Immediately, the most significant threat is, of course, Iran becoming nuclear.

""But I happen to think Sen. Santorum is right with regards to the issue that doesn't get enough attention. That's the one that may come up that we haven't thought about, which is Latin America. Because, in fact, congressman, we have been attacked. We were attacked on 9/11. There have been dozens of attacks that have been thwarted by our -- by our security forces. And we have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America."" Romney and Perry's campaigns each gave us the same source for their comments: An eight-page American Enterprise Institute paper from October 2011, ""The Mounting Hezbollah Threat in Latin America.""

It begins: ""Over the last several years Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran have greatly expanded their operations in Latin America to the detriment of inter-American security and U.S. strategic interests. Today, Hezbollah is using the Western Hemisphere as a staging ground, fundraising center, and operational base to wage asymmetric warfare against the United States. Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and other anti-American governments in the region have facilitated this expansion by rolling out the welcome mats for Hezbollah and Iran.""

But we spent a day digging into the claim and found the support was pretty flimsy. The paper actually provides little evidence that operational cells for Hezbollah are truly active in Mexico and Latin America. It says Hezbollah uses the region to raise money that is channeled back to Lebanon.

The strongest evidence for Hezbollah fundraising, money-laundering and other ""terrorist-related"" activities in Latin America dates from the mid 1980s, when the group began using as a haven the tri-border area beween Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. A March 2010 Congressional Research Service report has also noted Hezbollah's presence there — where it reportedly profited from music piracy operations — along with groups such as Hamas, the Chinese Triads and Korean and Taiwanese syndicates.

But the report, ""International Terrorism and Transnational Crime: Security Threats, U.S. Policy, and Considerations for Congress,"" focuses primarily on the group's fundraising in the Western hemisphere — not operational support for the group. While millions of dollars are channeled back to Lebanon every year by criminal enterprises, those operations aren't typically owned or operated by Hezbollah members, the report says. Instead, the criminals are donors who support the group for religious, ideological or personal reasons.

But activity that ""poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America,"" as Romney said?

On that point, the report is significantly more measured: ""It is important to note that while these criminal sympathizers do not directly participate in or provide operational support for Hezbollah’s terrorist activity, that potential exists, security experts believe. If the organization decided to attack U.S. or Israeli interests in West Africa or South America, it is possible that these sympathizers could play a concrete role.""

Romney wasn't just talking about Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. In fact, he singled out Venezuela and Mexico. On Venezuela, the AEI paper sounds a stronger alarm -- even though it offers relatively little solid evidence to justify the strong language. Discussing the ""mounting Hezbollah threat,"" it says that Hezbollah acts as a proxy for Iran, and thus a developing alliance between Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez has meant a new safe haven for the Islamic group. Research by the paper's authors, Roger Noriega and Jose Cardenas, identify ""at least two parallel yet collaborative terrorist networks"" growing in Latin America, primarily in Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina and Chile. They cite ""open sources, subject-matter experts, and sensitive sources within various governments,"" but don't footnote this section of the paper.

One is ""operated by Hezbollah and aided by its collaborators"" and the other ""is managed by the Qods Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps."" One pair of Lebanese brothers, the Nessereddines, reportedly launders money and has business dealings with Hezbollah and operates a paramilitary training camp on Margarita Island. A parallel recruiting network is overseen by Hojjat al-Eslam Mohsen Rabban, ""the Terrorist Professor,"" described as the mastermind behind two attacks on Jewish targets in Buenos Aires in the early '90s that killed 144 people.

""Despite being the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, Rabbani reportedly still operates in the region, traveling under false papers and connecting with his former disciples,"" the paper says.

Then there's Mexico.

""The immediate U.S. national security concern related to Hezbollah activity in Latin America is Mexico, where the terrorist group has ready access to the U.S. border,"" the paper says. ""Principal Hezbollah activities there include human smuggling and narcotics trafficking. ... While there certainly have been no reported cases of Hezbollah smuggling operatives across the border to carry out terrorist attacks in the United States, it is neither 'sensationalist' nor 'alarmist' to be concerned about it and respond with appropriate policy measures.""

We reached out to Roger Noriega, one of the paper's authors and a former assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs under the Bush administration. Did Romney accurate characterize his work?

""I think he and Rick Santorum had it right,"" he said.

But he acknowledged the Mexico evidence was thin.

""You will see that we focus on South America, not on Mexico, so references that others made to 'Hezbollah in Mexico' are more speculative and not yet confirmed,"" he said.

Indeed, evidence in the Mexico section of the paper includes Hezbollah supporters picked up in the United States after traveling through Mexico and a Washington Times article from March 2009 that relied largely on unnamed sources. Then it ventures into the realm of a Tuscon (Arizona) Police Department memo ""leaked by an Internet hacker group,"" that itself relies on secondary sources including the Examiner and Wikipedia.

We looked for additional support for the idea of a ""significant and imminent threat"" to the United States posed by Hezbollah in Latin America.

In 2008 speeches, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff mentioned Hezbollah's ""presence"" and ""tentacles"" that ""reach across the globe,"" including in South America.

""It also has a presence elsewhere in the world, including in South America, our own western hemisphere, where you'll remember some time back they actually carried out an operation against a Jewish facility in South America,"" he told the National Press Club. But his language wasn't as pointed as Romney's.

A more recent report from the State Department report on the subject, ""Country Reports on Terrorism 2010,"" published in August 2011, doesn't support Romney's claim. It says Islamic terror groups' Latin American involvement focuses on fundraising, not carrying out terrorist plots.

""There were no known operational cells of either al-Qaida- or Hezbollah-related groups in the hemisphere,"" the report says, ""although ideological sympathizers in South America and the Caribbean continued to provide financial and moral support to these and other terrorist groups in the Middle East and South Asia.""

We found other experts who have studied terrorism in the region who say the talk of Hezbollah in Latin America is overblown.

Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution, who testified in 2009 for the House subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs on illicit economies, organized crime, and their impact on U.S. and global security, said, ""Allegations of al-Qaida, Hamas, and Hezbollah contacts with the FARC or these groups' penetration of the Latin American drug trade have not proven robust."" Another Brookings scholar, senior fellow on foreign policy Kevin Casas-Zamora, told PolitiFact, ""Hezbollah roaming free in Latin America — that's a gross exaggeration.""

""Hugo Chavez does have close links to Iran, but I doubt it that they present a danger for U.S. national security,"" said Casas-Zamora, the former vice president of Costa Rica. ""If Venezuela was indeed harboring a serious Hezbollah operation we would surely know it by now. The U.S. has had for years an official policy of toning down the confrontation with Chavez, but a serious terrorist threat is the one thing that the U.S. would not countenance.""

""My impression is that the Republican candidates are trying to crank up the volume of the confrontation with Chavez by accusing him of promoting terrorism as part of a more 'muscular' foreign policy. And they are also trying to blend the threat of drug trafficking with terrorism to justify continuation of an assistance program in Mexico, the results of which are rather debatable. Mixing up the issues of drug trafficking, Chavez and terrorism makes for good soundbites but it is both dangerous and sloppy from the policy standpoint."" Our ruling

Romney warned during the Republican presidential debate in Washington that ""We have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America.""

While there's some evidence of Hezbollah sympathizers and fundraisers working in the tri-border area between Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay and perhaps even recruiters and trainers in Chavez-led Venezuela, there's little evidence for the group ""working"" in Mexico. Even less publicly supported is the idea of that presence amounting to a ""very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America."" The State Department confirms there are no known terror cells of al-Qaida or Hezbollah groups in our hemisphere.

Romney was asked to recite a national security issue he worries ""nobody is asking about."" In this case, there might be a good reason. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE39380>],/factchecks/2011/nov/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-hezbollah-latin-america-poses-imm/

Michele Bachmann says Iran has threatened to launch nuclear attack against Israel, United States
","
Responding to a hypothetical question about whether the United States should support an attack against Iran by Middle East-ally Israel, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann noted that Iran already has announced plans to strike Israel.

""They've stated, as recently as August just before President (Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad came ... to the U.N. General Assembly. He said that he wanted to eradicate Israel from the face of the Earth,"" Bachmann said during the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN debate.

""He has said that if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. He will use it against the United States of America.""

The claim from Bachmann isn’t new -- she said something similar during an Iowa campaign event in October.

But is it correct?

The genesis appears to be an hourlong August interview Ahmadinejad gave to Al-Manar TV, a network based in Lebanon. This is a link to the interview. Ahmadinejad’s comments appear to be translated from Persian into Arabic.

We could not find a copy of the entire interview that had been translated in English, but there are a few English-language news reports that translate selected comments from the Iranian leader. We reached out to Bachmann’s campaign but did not hear back.

The website Haaretz.com, an online edition of an Israeli newspaper, quoted Ahmadinejad as saying Iran was determined to eradicate Israel.

The website wrote:
  
""Iran believes that whoever is for humanity should also be for eradicating the Zionist regime (Israel) as symbol of suppression and discrimination,"" Ahmadinejad said in an interview with a Lebanese television network, carried by ISNA. 
""Iran follows this issue (the eradication of Israel) with determination and decisiveness and will never ever withdraw from this standpoint and policy,"" the Iranian president added in the interview with the Al-Manar network. 

In both quotes Israel is included in parentheses, which means Ahmadinejad never said the word. The ""ISNA"" the report refers to is likely the Iranian Student's News Agency.

We should also note that there has been some concern over how Ahmadinejad’s statements have been translated into English. In 2005, several sources reported Ahmadinejad as saying Israel should ""be wiped off the map.""

However, several experts believed Ahmadinejad’s actual comments to be inflated.

""Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to wipe Israel off the map because no such idiom exists in Persian,"" Juan Cole, a Middle East specialist at the University of Michigan told the New York Times. ""He did say he hoped its regime, i.e., a Jewish-Zionist state occupying Jerusalem, would collapse.""

For this fact-check, we’re not saying these most recent comments are translated accurately, or inaccurately. We’re simply saying you should read them with a note of caution.

However, where Bachmann misstepped was by accusing Ahmadinejad of saying he planned to use a nuclear weapon against Israel or the United States.

Iran and Ahmadinejad have maintained that they are not pursuing nuclear weapons, and that they are only pursuing nuclear energy.

Here’s how Ahmadinejad put it during an October interview with CNN.

""We have already expressed our views about nuclear bombs. We said those who are seeking to build nuclear bombs or those who stockpile, they are politically and mentally retarded. We think they are stupid because the era of nuclear bombs is over,"" he said.

""Iran, for example, should continue its efforts and tolerate all international treasures only to build a nuclear bomb or a few nuclear bombs that are useless? They can never be used? And is not capable of confronting with the U.S. nuclear arsenals? The overall budget of our national atomic energy agency is $250 million, and the whole budget is aimed at peaceful activities.

""But the government of the United States only allocated $80 million for rebuilding the nuclear bombs. I think Iranians are clever enough to see that with this limited amount of money, $250 million, we are not able to be at war with the other side.""

Many westerners, and most Republicans, think Ahmadinejad is lying.

Ahmadinejad has said that he believes the U.S. government orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to ""reverse the declining American economy and its grips on the Middle East in order also to save the Zionist regime."" He also has criticized the United States abducting Africans and turning them into slaves, has said some European countries are still using the Holocaust to ""pay ransom"" to Jews living in Israel and said the United States economy relies on waging wars and selling weapons.

But we’re focusing on Bachmann’s actual statement during the Nov. 22 debate. She paraphrased Ahmadinejad as saying, ""He has said that if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. He will use it against the United States of America."" 
Ahmadinejad has said some tough things about the United States and Israel, but we find no evidence that he has said he would use a nuclear weapon against either country. In fact, he has maintained Iran has no interest in building one. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8F7280>],/factchecks/2011/nov/23/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-iran-has-threatended-launch-/

George LeMieux says Connie Mack repeatedly voted to raise his own paycheck
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, the new apparent frontrunner in the GOP race for the U.S. Senate, is facing a barrage of criticism from one of his Republican rivals over congressional pay raises.

George LeMieux's campaign has claimed at least three different times -- in a press release, an online ad and in a comment from its spokeswoman -- that Mack, a four-term congressman from Southwest Florida, ""voted to raise his own pay several times.""

We found that examining the claim isn't so clear cut, largely because Congress probably wanted it that way.

In 1989, Congress passed an ethics reform law that included an annual cost of living adjustment. The automatic pay raise was created in exchange for not getting paid for private speeches. The pay raise, based on a formula, is automatic unless Congress took a vote to stop it. The law -- even if it had the best of intentions -- created a system where members of Congress receive raises without having to be on-record voting for them.

Members of Congress certainly have seen their pay increase over time. Members initially received $6 a day in 1789; today they receive $174,000 annually.

Here are the salaries for the years that Mack has served:

Year        Annual salary
2005        $162,100
2006        $165,200
2007        $165,200
2008        $169,300
2009        $174,000
2010        $174,000
2011        $174,000

So how did the LeMieux campaign back up its attack? Not with votes to raise congressional salaries -- as had been claimed -- but instead votes to prevent Congress from taking a vote to cancel the automatic pay adjustment.

We'll slow that down. Since the raises are essentially automatic, the only thing Congress can do is stop the raises. In some cases, Congress -- and Mack -- voted not to vote on a measure to stop the raises.

2005: On June 28, 2005, Congress voted 263-152 with Mack in the majority on ""ordering the previous question"" to essentially block U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, from introducing a measure to block the pay raise. The vote was on House Resolution 342, which related to H.R. 3058, an appropriations bill for transportation and other areas. The practical effect of the vote: Members of Congress would receive a $3,100 pay raise, bringing their salary to $165,000.

Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's spokesperson, explained the procedural move.

""Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question,"" she told PolitiFact in an e-mail. ""Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered his amendment to deny the annual Congressional pay raise. The process is designed to be obscure -- which is Matheson’s primary concern -- that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries.""

2006: On June 13, 2006, Congress took a similar vote -- this time 249-167 with Mack in the majority -- on ""ordering the previous question"" which again halted Matheson's attempt for an up-or-down vote. The vote was on House Resolution 865, which related to H.R. 5576, an appropriations bill. The result: Members received a $3,300 pay raise increasing their salaries to $168,500.

And then campaign season kicked in. Democrats vowed not to accept the pay raise until Congress approved an increase to the minimum wage.

On. Dec. 8, 2006, the House voted 370-20 with Mack in the majority for a stopgap funding measure H.J. 102 until mid February 2007 -- delaying the pay raises. Democrats had planned to offer an amendment to delay the congressional pay raise, so ""House GOP leaders decided to include language deferring the pay raise in the bill, taking away the Democrats' ability to make it an issue,"" Congressional Quarterly Today wrote in an article we found in Nexis.

2007: On Jan. 31, 2007, the House voted 286-140 H.J. Res. 20 for continuing appropriations. The summary of the law stated: ""(Sec. 115) Prohibits the percentage salary adjustment scheduled to take effect for 2007 for Members of Congress from taking effect."" Mack voted no, meaning he voted against the proposal canceling the 2007 raise.

Then on June 27, 2007, the House voted 244-181 with Mack in the majority on an amendment related to appropriations bill H.R. 2829. The vote, like those in 2005 and 2006, prevented an up-or-down vote on a pay raise, the Associated Press reported.

2008: In 2008, a few lawmakers introduced measures that would have blocked pay raises for 2009 but the measures didn't get very far, allowing the automatic pay raises to kick in for the following year, Fox News reported.

2009: On Feb. 25, 2009, the House took some votes related to an omnibus appropriations act. This time Mack and a large majority of the House voted ""yes"" on House Resolution 184, which canceled the annual pay raise. The resolution passed 398-24.

Later in the day, the House voted 245-178 with Mack voting no on the overall bill. 
2010: By 2010, members were eagerly proposing bills to reject pay raises. On April 27, 2010, the House voted 402-15 with Mack in favor on House Resolution 5146 -- which plainly spelled out in the title that it would mean Congress would not receive a cost of living adjustment in fiscal year 2011. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It's worth noting here that LeMieux, appointed to the U.S. Senate in the summer of 2009 and serving throughout 2010, had joined the Senate by the time the tide among lawmakers had swung away from pay raises amid a troubled economy.  
The is an interesting case because Congress essentially created a system in 1989 that -- whether by design or not -- gives members like Mack some cover. LeMieux is wrong to say Mack voted to raise his pay, because he never did.

Instead, Mack cast procedural votes that effectively allowed automatic pay raises to stand in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

The practical effect of those votes meant Mack saw raises.

On the flip side, LeMieux omitted that in 2009 and 2010 Mack took some votes against pay raises.

To us, that's two caveats that bring our rating to Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB85F00>],/factchecks/2011/nov/23/george-lemieux/lemieux-says-mack-repeatedly-voted-raise-his-own-p/
"['Oregon', 'Elections', 'Our Oregon']","
Could we really be losing one voter every 13 minutes?
","
The next general election for president is almost a year away. But given that the Republican presidential hopefuls are already meeting for weekly debates, we probably shouldn’t be surprised that Our Oregon, a progressive political organization, is already laying the way for its get-out-the-vote effort.

Our Oregon’s website makes a call to arms: ""The need for voter registration is constant, especially in Oregon. With our vote-by-mail system, the people least likely to be registered to vote (young people, low-income people) are the ones most likely to get knocked off the rolls each year.""

Then they put that need in perspective. According to Our Oregon, overall voter registration is down by more than 119,000 voters from the peak in November 2008.

""That’s like losing a voter every 13 minutes,"" the site concludes.

That statistic caught our eye. Could Oregon, which traditionally has high voter participation, really be hemorrhaging one voter every 13 minutes?

We gave Our Oregon a call and they told us they’d simply compared the number of voters registered in November 2008 to the most recent registration figures. These can all be found on the Oregon Secretary of State’s website. We followed suit.

According to monthly statistics, there were 2,154,288 voters on our rolls back in November 2008. (It’s important to note here that this number represents active voters. If a ballot gets kicked back to the county with an incorrect address, the voter is deemed inactive. That doesn’t mean those voters aren’t registered, just that they need to update their info with the state before their next vote.)

Anyhow, back to our analysis: The most recent voter statistics come from September, showing 2,034,589 registered voters. (Again, of the active variety.)

Take the latter from the former, and about 119,000 voters have slipped off the registers.

There were about 1,060 days separating Election Day 2008 and the end of September 2011. If you put that into the number of missing voters, you get about 113 fewer registered voters each day. Take the number of minutes in a day -- 1440 -- and divide it by 113 and you do, in fact, get 13 minutes.

Now, the figures seem to hold up. But one of the things we love to do with PolitiFact is offer up some context.

When we thought about the dip in the number of registered voters, it occurred to us that registration a year before a presidential election is probably always a little anemic. (Observant, right?)

So we pulled the figures and compared November 2007 to November 2008. We found that registers grew by more than 210,000 over that year. Same for November 2003 and 2004. During that period, registration actually grew by more than 260,000.

Just to make sure we got the whole picture, we also checked the percent of eligible voters who were actually registered. During the 2010 election, an estimated 72 percent of eligible voters were registered, according to our secretary of state. That was down 5 percent from the 2008 presidential election.

But even that dip seems fairly standard. In November 2006, the registration was down to 73 percent. But in November 2004 it had been 82 percent.

This is all to say that during presidential election years, registration surges. We’re not saying Our Oregon got its math wrong. We are saying that the current drop isn’t anything special.

For the last word on all of this we talked to Barry Pack, Oregon’s deputy secretary of state. He said that the figures Our Oregon cited were all accurate, but that it’s important to remember that there are many reasons why the number of registered voters might decline.

According to a state analysis comparing registration in November 2008 and 2010, about 70 percent of the 250,000-voter decline is attributable to voter inactivity for two federal elections. The other loss came from voter death, ineligibility, moving and other reasons.

Many of the folks in that 30 percent, Pack said, ""are not an indication of lack of civic engagement.""

We circled back with Our Oregon and talked with spokesman Scott Moore, who said he didn’t think our research negated the point that the organization was trying to make, which is that registration needs to get ramped up -- as always.

That brings us to our ruling. Our Oregon said we’ve lost about 119,000 since November 2008 -- one every 13 minutes -- and official figures back them up. The thing is, without the context that this is a pretty cyclical happening, that statistic sounds pretty dire. We think it needs context, so under PolitiFact rules, we’ll give it a Mostly True.

Armond Budish says Dem-controlled Ohio House passed a bipartisan resolution to reform redistricting process
","
Redistricting – the once-a-decade responsibility of redrawing Ohio’s congressional districts – has lived up to its reputation as a partisan battle that tends to serve the interests of the party in power.

Republican lawmakers, with majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, were in control of drawing the new map this year. The map, approved in September, has 12 solid Republican districts and four Democratic-leaning districts.

Unable to vote it down, Democrats have fought back with a referendum effort that threatens to block the new map from taking effect. The potential chaos brought on by the referendum effort opened up negotiations to draft a revised map that would please both parties.

But House Republicans did not support a revised congressional map that Democrats proposed earlier this month. In a news conference Nov. 3, 2011, to discuss the negotiations over the congressional district boundaries,  House Democratic Leader Armond Budish acknowledged the process is flawed, and told reporters that House Democrats had tried to fix it when they still were in the majority last year.

""We passed a resolution out of the House on a bipartisan basis to change the process, to create objective criteria, to modify the Constitution so that going forward we would take politics out of the efforts to draw legislative boundaries,"" Budish told reporters.

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Did Democrats really try to fix the process for drawing district boundaries?

Budish was referring to House Joint Resolution 15, a proposed constitutional amendment to establish a less partisan way that boundaries are drawn.

But there’s a catch.  

That resolution addressed the process for Ohio’s legislative districts – not the state’s congressional districts.

The processes for drawing the two maps are similar – neither requires bipartisanship for adoption – yet they have very little to do with one another.

Lawmakers are responsible for passing a congressional map. But the state’s Apportionment Board decides the boundaries for the 99 districts of the House of Representatives and 33 Senate districts. The Apportionment Board is made up of the governor, auditor, secretary of state and two legislative leaders of opposing parties.

In early October, the five-member board finalized the new legislative districts, which favor Republicans.

HJR 15 serves as no proof that House Democrats tried to fix the process last year when they controlled the House. The joint resolution only would have changed the apportionment process. It would not have altered the congressional mapping process, which is the source of the current controversy.

In fact, a plan to revise both apportionment and congressional redistricting passed the Senate in 2009 and sat idle in the House. Budish was House speaker and Democrats held the majority that year, also.

Secretary of State Jon Husted, then a member of the GOP-controlled Senate, was the primary sponsor of the plan, which altered the makeup of the Apportionment Board and required boundaries to be drawn so that both state legislative and congressional districts are competitive and compact.

Rather than take up Husted’s plan, House Democrats crafted their own, HJR 15.

After the House passed HJR 15, there were talks about merging it with Husted’s plan. But Husted, a Republican, said House Democrats did not want to change the congressional redistricting process.

""They never did anything on the congressional map; it was a nonstarter,"" Husted said.

Keary McCarthy, Budish’s chief of staff, said House Democrats, in fact, did consider the inclusion of congressional redistricting in the merger with Husted’s plan. McCarthy provided a draft of legislation showing that Democrats were willing to include congressional redistricting while they were in discussions with Husted to reach a compromise.

Ultimately though, noplan was able to pass in both chambers.

So where does that leave us?

Budish’s specified that House Democrats worked to fix the system for redrawing legislative districts. And the news conference at which he spoke was clearly called to address congressional redistricting.

Yet Democrats specifically left out congressional redistricting from the proposal that cleared the House. Even if their plan, HJR 15, had won Senate passage and was approved by voters as an amendment to the Ohio Constitution, it would have had no impact on the congressional redistricting process that currently is mired in chaos.

""The issue of controversy now is the congressional map,"" Husted said.

And Budish clearly knows the difference between redistricting and apportionment. He was the lone Democrat on the Apportionment Board.

Budish’s statement is not accurate. The legislation he cites would not have addressed congressional redistricting.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC762180>],/factchecks/2011/nov/23/armond-budish/armond-budish-says-dem-controlled-ohio-house-passe/

Michele Bachmann says Steve Jobs told Obama he moved factories to China for engineers
","
At the Republican presidential debate in Washington, the conversation turned to immigration and the need to attract highly skilled immigrants to the United States. 
To emphasize the need for more engineers, Rep. Michele Bachmann cited a comment that she said Apple CEO Steve Jobs made in a meeting with President Obama. She said Jobs ""said to President Barack Obama that he had to move a great deal of his operation over to China because he couldn't find 30,000 engineers to be able to do the work that needed to be done. That's what we want to do."" 
Jobs' two meetings with Obama in 2010 and 2011 are detailed in the new biography of the Apple leader by author Walter Isaacson. 
The book recounts the first meeting occurred at a hotel at the San Francisco airport in the fall of 2010. Isaacson, relying on accounts from White House aides and Jobs himself, wrote that Jobs told Obama bluntly, ""You're headed for a one-term presidency"" and urged the Democratic president to be more business-friendly. Jobs told Obama how easy it was to build a factory in China, in contrast to the difficulties caused by regulations and extra costs in the United States. 
Isaacson's book says Jobs offered to put together a group of CEOs for another meeting, which was held early this year. 
Jobs, who died Oct. 5, 2011, was looking thin and frail because of his cancer but still managed to be passionate about the need for more engineers. 
""When Jobs' turn came,"" Isaacson wrote, ""he stressed the need for more trained engineers and suggested that any foreign students who earned an engineering degree in the United States should be given a visa to stay in the country."" 
The book says that  ""Jobs went on to urge that a way be found to train more American engineers. Apple had 700,000 factory workers employed in China, he said, and that was because it needed 30,000 engineers on-site to support those workers. 'You can't find that many in America to hire,' he said. These factory engineers did not have to be PhDs or geniuses; they simply needed to have basic engineering skills for manufacturing. Tech schools, community colleges, or trade schools could train them. 
""'If you could educate these engineers,' he said, 'we could move more manufacturing plants here.'"" 
Isaacson wrote that the argument ""made a strong impression on the president. Two or three times over the next month he told his aides, 'We've got to find ways to train those 30,000 manufacturing engineers that Jobs told us about.'"" 
So Bachmann has accurately recounted the conversation. We rate her claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAC9DA00>],/factchecks/2011/nov/23/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-steve-jobs-told-obama-he-mov/
"['Economy', 'Foreign Policy', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says if the United States sanctions Iran's central bank, that will shut down Iran's economy
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry suggested in a debate with fellow Republican presidential hopefuls that sanctioning Iran's central bank would be a ""powerful way"" to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

At the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN debate in Washington, D.C., Perry said, ""When you sanction the Iranian central bank, that will shut down that economy.""

We wondered if his claim holds. Since we were already checking a similar claim he made at the Nov. 12, 2011, Commander-in-Chief Republican presidential debate, we had a head start.

As described by congressional advocates and others, sanctions against the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran -- which describes itself as responsible for maintaining the value of the nation’s national currency, keeping equilibrium in its balance of payments, facilitating trade-related transactions and helping the country grow -- would bar financial institutions involved with the bank from doing business with U.S. institutions.

A Perry campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said by e-mail after the Nov. 12 debate that a U.S. Treasury ban on transactions with Iran’s central bank ""would have devastating consequences for the Iranian economy because any third party that did business with Iran's central bank would be cut off from the American financial system.

""Among other things, this would make it extremely difficult for Iran to continue to sell crude oil, by and large the government's top source of revenue,"" Frazier said. ""More broadly, it would present Iran's trade partners with a stark decision: Continue to do business with Iran, or continue to do business with America.""

Advocates say U.S.-imposed restrictions could hammer Iran’s economy such that its government stops developing the technologies needed to produce nuclear weapons, activities reported this month by a United Nations agency.

The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on Iran off and on since the Tehran hostage crisis when President Jimmy Carter imposed an embargo on oil imports from Iran and froze $12 billion in Iranian bank deposits, as noted in a July 2009 paper by John Tirman of MIT’s Center for International Studies.

Tirman wrote that all exports, except food and medicine, were also banned, though those restrictions were lifted in 1982.

In 1995, Reuters has reported, President Bill Clinton issued executive orders preventing U.S. companies from investing in Iranian oil and gas and trading with Iran. The same year, Congress required the U.S. government to impose sanctions on foreign firms investing more than $20 million a year in Iran's energy sector.

A dozen years later, Reuters reported, Washington imposed sanctions on three Iranian banks and branded Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. The Treasury later added numerous other Iranian banks to its blacklist and identified about 20 petroleum and petrochemical companies as being under Iranian government control, an action that put them off-limits to U.S. businesses under the trade embargo, Reuters said.

Last year, Congress approved tough unilateral sanctions aimed at squeezing Iran's energy and banking sectors, which could also hurt companies from other countries doing business with Tehran, Reuters said. The 2010 law imposed penalties on firms that supply Iran with refined petroleum products worth more than $5 million over 12 months and effectively deprived foreign banks of access to the U.S. financial system if they also were doing business with Iranian banks or the Revolutionary Guards, Reuters said.

In May 2011, the United States blacklisted a 21st Iranian state bank, the Bank of Industry and Mine, for handling transactions on behalf of two previously sanctioned institutions, Bank Mellat and Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank, Reuters said. A month later, the government announced sanctions applicable to the Guard Corps, the Basij Resistance Force and Iran's Law Enforcement Forces. Those sanctions froze any of the targets' assets under U.S. jurisdiction and barred U.S. persons and institutions from dealing with them, Reuters said.

Separately, the United Nations has agreed to global sanctions against Iran, including a ban on the export from Iran of arms and related materiel and the supply to Iran of conventional weapons and materiel, according to a UN summary page.

Such steps have squeezed Iran, according to David Cohen, the U.S. Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who told the Senate Banking Committee in October 2011: ""Iran is now facing unprecedented levels of financial and commercial isolation. The number and quality of foreign banks willing to transact with designated Iranian financial institutions has dropped precipitously over the last year. Iran’s shrinking access to financial services and trade finance has made it extremely difficult for Iran to pay for imports and receive payment for exports. Iran’s Central Bank has been unable to halt the steady erosion in the value of its currency.

""And,"" Cohen testified, ""Iran has been increasingly unable to attract foreign investment, especially in its oil fields, leading to a projected loss of $14 billion a year in oil revenues through 2016. We are making progress, but there is still much to be done to prevent Iran from evading sanctions already in place and to apply sufficient additional pressure on Iran. In this regard, we continue to focus on the"" central bank, he said. After noting that U.S. financial institutions are ""already generally prohibited from doing business with any bank in Iran,"" including the central bank, Cohen said all options to increase financial pressure remain — including more sanctions on the central bank.

This month, a U.S. House committee approved and a senator proposed similar amendments requiring Obama to take steps that could lead to sanctions against the bank. U.S. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., described his amendment as sanctioning the bank ""if it is found to be engaged in facilitating (weapons of mass destruction) development, terrorism, or any type of support"" for the Revolutionary Guards Corps.

Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., proposes similar administration review before action, potentially resulting in ""any foreign financial institution involved with the Central Bank of Iran also being blocked from the U.S. economy.""

Per Perry’s claim, experts are skeptical the United States could unilaterally succeed in sanctioning the central bank.

Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said it’s unlikely that countries dependent on Iranian oil, including China and India, would bow to the sanctions. ""They might well continue to do business with the"" bank, Hufbauer told us. ""To be blunt, they don't agree with U.S. sanctions against Iran. What could the U.S. do to interrupt these financial flows?""

U.N. involvement might be needed to make the sanctions work, Hufbauer said, meaning cooperation from Russia and China, which do not yet agree with such a course of action. Besides, he said, sanctions affecting Iran’s ability to sell oil for dollars would be difficult to enforce.

""If somehow the sanctions were imposed,"" Hufbauer said, disruptions to Iran would be severe. ""It would be a devil to transact sales of oil if you didn’t have banking facilities."" While Iran’s elites and its military would take care of their own economic needs, he speculated, the rest of the country would grind down, while the price of oil on the international market could burst past $150 a barrel.

Michael Malloy, a University of the Pacific expert in banking law and economic sanctions, said the bank could be sanctioned but the U.S. move would not shut down Iran’s economy.

""First, international economies are too complex and too varied for there to be a direct cause and effect of the kind (Perry’s) talking about. It would never be like flipping a switch,"" Malloy said. ""Most troubling, the U.S. probably does not have sufficient connection to the Iranian economy to have that happen. It just would not happen that way.""

Besides, Malloy said, U.S. influence would extend only to entities using facilities over which the United States held sway: ""If a Jamaican wanted to buy Iranian pistachios financed by an Iranian bank, and they were going to be delivered in a Dutch cruiser, we basically have no control over that transaction,"" he said.

Speculating on the effect of sanctions on the flow of dollars spent to buy Iranian oil, Malloy said that presumably, those dollars would at some point flow through the U.S. banking system and if the U.S. government figured out which dollars were related to Iran’s oil sales, then that flow might be blocked. Even then, he said, that would only have an effect on a particular oil refiner somewhere in the chain of distribution. ""Once it happens, I guess it causes a stir,"" Malloy said, ""but finding that transaction in the first place, (and) properly identifying it as related to the Iranian sale, is very hard to do.""

Summing up, Malloy said sanctioning the bank would increase economic pressure on Iran, but it’s a ""silly"" stretch to say it would shut down the economy

Similarly, economist Hadi Salehi Esfahani of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said it’s not realistic to suggest the United States could by itself sanction the bank. Even if somehow such sanctions were achieved, he said, and the economy were stalled, the price of oil might reach $200 a barrel.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently announced the government was designating Iran’s financial sector, including the central bank, as a ""money-laundering"" concern.

As recapped in a Nov. 21, 2011, Christian Science Monitor news article, this designation stopped short of sanctioning the bank but was expected to hinder the bank’s operations. ""Similar steps taken in the past against North Korean and Lebanese banks caused other countries and international businesses to sever ties,"" the Monitor reported.

Writing on the Atlantic’s website Nov. 22, 2011, Yochi J. Dreazen, a national security correspondent for the National Journal, said sanctioning the bank ""could spark chaos in the world oil market and push prices higher, threatening the fragile economic recoveries underway in the U.S. and many European countries. ... Other U.S. officials and Middle East experts also fear that Tehran would view the measures as an act of war and retaliate by directly or indirectly striking Israel or other U.S. allies throughout the Middle East.""

Our ruling

It’s clear that the United States could unilaterally sanction the bank -- or try. Yet the move would have uncertain effects; other countries might not join in. It’s not proven that Iran’s economy would shut down. We rate Perry’s statement Half True.

Taxpayers group says Obama plans to impose 23 percent tax on Medicare prescription benefit for low-income beneficiaries
","
President Barack Obama plans to ""impose a tax of at least 23 percent on Medicare’s prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries,"" a group says.

The National Taxpayers Union, which generally advocates lower taxes, featured the Obama claim in a half-page advertisement in the Nov. 13, 2011, Dallas Morning News brought to our attention by a reader.

We’re all familiar with Obama’s 23 percent Medicare tax.

Oh, wait. We’re not.

Pete Sepp, the taxpayers’ union spokesman, told us in an interview that the ""tax"" in the ad  refers to what the Obama administration has pitched as a money-saving mandate that pharmaceutical drug makers rebate money to the government for prescription drugs sold to low-income Medicare beneficiaries employing the fairly new federal prescription-drug benefit. That benefit also is known as Medicare Part D, which was ushered into place when George W. Bush was president to help elderly Americans afford prescription drugs.

Sepp said Obama’s proposal amounts to a ""mandatory extraction that functions like a tax.""

As noted in an October 2011 article in the journal Health Affairs, Obama in September proposed a $3 trillion package of savings including $320 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings. The bulk of the suggested savings involved reduced payments to hospitals and other providers, the article says, but an element ties to requiring Medicare to receive rebates from drug companies for drugs purchased by low-income beneficiaries much like Medicaid has for years.

An October 2011 critique of Obama’s proposal, whose authors include Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, points out that since 1991, drug manufacturers have been required to enter into agreements with the federal government to pay rebates to the Medicaid program as a condition of their drugs being covered by Medicaid. The rebate rates are tied to a share of the average manufacturers price for each drug or the difference between that price and the ""best price"" offered to any payer. Since 2010, the minimum rebate amounts have been set at 23.1 percent of the average manufacturers price for most brand-name drugs, the critique says.

So now we know where the 23 percent figure originated.

Back to Medicare: The Health Affairs article says that while the federal government has been forbidden by law from negotiating drug prices in Part D, ""Democrats and a few Republicans have long looked for other ways to enable the program to capture drug discounts. The Obama plan proposes that manufacturers pay Medicare the same ‘rebates’ for brand-name and generic drugs that they already pay Medicaid for beneficiaries who receive the Medicare low-income subsidy. This option is estimated to save $135 billion over ten years.""

The Obama proposal states the administration wants to ""align"" Medicare drug pricing with Medicaid practices. Currently, the proposal says, Medicare Part D insurance plan sponsors negotiate their own rebates and prices for drugs. The resulting rebates reached for brand-name drugs are less than what the government achieves for those drugs under Medicaid, the proposal says, resulting in higher prices in the end.

Sepp warned against such rebate proposals in a July 2011 letter to members of Congress, saying they amount to ""federally-forced price controls on prescription drugs to certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries (who would see no financial gain even as Washington’s coffers got fatter)."" His letter says health care providers under Medicare Part D had already ""negotiated deep voluntary discounts of 20 to 30 percent from drug makers and pharmacies, saving both enrollees and taxpayers considerable sums.""

Sepp told us by email that the ""money collected from the ‘rebates’ don't wind up in the actual consumers' pockets or the various Part D plans; instead they go to a fund that will defray certain government Medicare program costs. A ‘rebate’ as is commonly understood is something that the consumer of product receives after purchase. This ‘rebate’ is nothing of the kind, and represents deceptive terminology."" Also, Sepp said, the sought rebate is based on a percentage of price per unit, ""a lot like the way some excise taxes on products such as some tobacco items work.""

We failed to draw a response from the government on this topic, but outside experts said they’d never heard the Medicaid rebates -- or proposed Medicare rebates -- referred to as taxes.

Judith Lave, a University of Pittsburgh professor of health economics and former director of the Pennsylvania Medicaid Policy Center, said the Medicaid rebates help government lower drug prices; the same would be so, she said, if such practices were permitted for Medicare. ""To view it as a tax is a bit of a stretch,"" Lave said. ""That is an inappropriate use of the word ‘tax.’ I would say the government plans to use its market power to get lower prices from the pharmaceutical companies.""

Kenneth Lawson, who heads the University of Texas School of Pharmacy’s Division of Health Outcomes and Pharmacy Practice, said that to the degree drug manufacturers want their products to be available to Medicaid and, potentially, Medicare beneficiaries, rebates could seem like taxes; they have to pay to play.

Lawson said, though, that the ad statement misleads by suggesting low-income beneficiaries would bear rebate costs most likely to be spread out in different ways by paying companies.

Rebates can cut drug manufacturer profits, he said, and/or the makers could raise drug prices to partly or completely cover the rebates, ultimately shifting the costs to consumers, hospitals, prescription drug plans (including taxpayers who support Medicaid), and other purchasers of medications. So it’s possible, he said, that Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries could be contributing towards the cost of rebates indirectly through the taxes they pay that support Medicare and Medicaid. ""Of course,"" he said, ""these rebate costs are spread across a relatively large number of people.""

The taxpayer union’s Sepp nudged us to a June 2011 paper criticizing Medicare rebate plans by Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute and Guy King, former chief actuary for Medicaid and Medicare. The paper says: ""Like a tax, the requirement that pharmaceutical manufacturers pay a minimum rebate has its initial impact on the manufacturers but the final incidence would be borne primarily by patients, who are the end-users of the prescription drugs.""

Sepp said by email: ""Supporters call this a rebate so they can raise revenues for the federal government without branding their scheme a tax and having to answer a lot of inconvenient questions about it. Just because they don't want to call it a tax doesn't mean it won't function like one.""

Our ruling

We see how the Obama proposal could be judged a nearly mandatory give-back in that drug companies that decline to give rebates would do so at risk to their bottom lines. It also makes sense that drug companies wouldn’t swallow the costs of the rebates; they’re not free.

Then again, contrary to the ad's statement, there’s no evidence low-income Medicare beneficiaries would pay a 23 percent ""tax."" And all told, Obama's urged rebate remains that--money paid in return for a purchase or action/opportunity. One would have to connect more dots to make it a tax. We rate the group’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC782440>],/factchecks/2011/nov/22/national-taxpayers-union/taxpayers-group-says-obama-plans-impose-23-percent/

Tucker Carlson’s false claim downplaying role of white supremacists at Capitol riot
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson downplayed the involvement of racially motivated extremist groups in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, falsely suggesting that the mob of pro-Trump rioters who violently stormed the building did not include white supremacists. ""There's no evidence that white supremacists were responsible for what happened on Jan. 6. That's a lie,"" Carlson said Feb. 22 on his TV show. ""And contrary to what you've been hearing, there's also no evidence this was a, quote, 'armed insurrection.'"" During the segment, Carlson, whose primetime show is among the most-watched cable news programs, interviewed the author of a blog post that argued the riot did not amount to an armed insurrection. PolitiFact previously rated that claim Pants on Fire.  For this fact-check, we’ll focus on Carlson’s claim about white supremacists. Carlson was responding to attorney general nominee Merrick Garland’s pledge at his confirmation hearing to supervise the prosecution of ""white supremacists and others"" involved in the riot. Experts on extremism have described white supremacists as a top domestic terrorist threat, and so has FBI director Christopher Wray. In 2019, Carlson called white supremacy a hoax. Many participants at the Capitol riot were not known white supremacists, and with investigations ongoing, it’s difficult to say how responsible any one person or group was for what happened.  But court documents, public records and documentary evidence have shown that several people with known ties to white supremacist groups were involved in the attack, and that many symbols of white supremacy were displayed. ""White supremacists and rebranded alt-right rioters were assuredly there, but there was also a wide variety of other insurrectionists present who share a set of unifying grievances with hardened bigots, who do not necessarily buy into full-blown white supremacy,"" said Brian Levin director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. On Feb. 23, in a Senate hearing on the Capitol’s security failures, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., asked the acting D.C. police chief, the former Capitol Police chief and the former House and Senate sergeants-at-arms if the attack ""involved white supremacist and extremist groups.""   All the officials replied: ""Yes."" Fox News did not respond to a request for comment. Carlson’s claim came hours after Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn described being repeatedly called a racial slur while defending the complex.  Substantial evidence shows extremist groups, including people who have publicly expressed support for white supremacist ideals, were among those in the crowd. The New York Times reported Feb. 21 that while most of the rioters were supporters of former President Donald Trump, members of right-wing extremist groups played an outsize role in the riot and were charged with some of the most serious crimes, including conspiracy charges, which indicate a level of planning and coordination. Of the more than 230 people charged so far, 31 were known to have ties to a militant extremist group, the Times found. That tracks with what Oren Segal, the vice president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told PolitiFact. ""The emerging snapshot of the insurrectionists shows a range of right-wing extremists united by their fury with the perceived large-scale betrayal by ‘unprincipled’ legislators,"" Segal said. Extremist figures at the Capitol included members of the Proud Boys, a far-right organization that celebrates Western culture and male superiority. The group gained notoriety after Trump said in a debate that the group should ""stand back and stand by."" The group has rejected claims that it promotes white supremacy. But Michael Jensen, a senior researcher with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said some members have known ties to other white supremacist groups or have publicly expressed white supremacist views.  A Wall Street Journal video investigation found that Proud Boys members were ""at the forefront"" of many of the key moments during the Jan. 6 seige.  Ethan Nordean, with a bullhorn, leads members of the far-right group Proud Boys in marching before the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Nordean, 30, has described himself as a leader of the Seattle chapter of the Proud Boys. (AP) Other figures at the riot had explicit white supremacist ties. Some were associated, for example, with the Groypers, a white supremacist group defined by a loose network of people who support the far-right activist and podcaster Nick Fuentes, or the Nationalist Socialist Club, a neo-Nazi group, Segal said. Others, such as far-right media personality Tim Gionet, or Baked Alaska, have expressed white supremacist views but are unaffiliated with any specific group. The ADL identified 212 of what it believes were about 800 people who breached the Capitol, Segal said. Among those identified, Segal said the ADL has counted 17 Proud Boys, six people associated with an anti-government militant group known as the Oath Keepers, and 10 people with ties to the Groypers or other white supremacist groups. ""They were certainly present at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and several participated in storming the building,"" Jensen said, pointing to people like Gionet and Bryan Betancur, a self-professed white supremacist who was seen wearing a Proud Boys shirt and posing with a Confederate flag. The presence of white supremacists was also marked by prominently displayed symbols, including some that are ""overtly racist"" and others that are coded or co-opted but resonate among followers of far-right extremist groups, said Levin. One man, Robert Packer, was seen in a ""Camp Auschwitz"" T-shirt, a reference to a complex of concentration camps used during the Holocaust. Others waved Confederate flags, flashed ""white power"" symbols, showcased ""Pepe the frog"" imagery and more, Levin said.   Supporters listen as President Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. (AP) Rioters also erected a hanging gallows, which Levin said is a symbol for white supremacists and other alt-right figures signaling a day when ""government leaders and minorities are hanged."" The Washington Post combed through footage from the riot and identified many such symbols showing support for white supremacy and other far-right causes and groups. Carlson said, ""There's no evidence that white supremacists were responsible for what happened on Jan. 6. That's a lie."" Not all of the rioters at the Capitol were extremists or white supremacists. But several people with known ties to white supremacist groups were involved, including some people now facing conspiracy charges. Symbols of white supremacy were also prominently on display. Law enforcement officials said the the attack involved extremist and white supremacist groups.  We rate Carlson’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8DE200>],/factchecks/2021/feb/23/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlsons-false-claim-downplaying-role-white/

No, Biden executive order did not allow China access to U.S. power grid
","During a devastating winter blackout in Texas, a conservative group linked the outage to President Joe Biden, claiming that one of his executive orders gave the Chinese Communist Party access to the U.S. power grid.  ""Joe Biden is handing our power grid to the Chinese Communist Party,"" tweeted the conservative activist group Students for Trump on Feb. 16.  The post also includes a quote by the group’s CEO, Charlie Kirk, which reads: ""While thousands of Americans are without power because of a faulty energy infrastructure, this is your daily reminder that Joe Biden rescinded a Trump executive order banning Chinese involvement in our power grid."" Other social media users were even more explicit about attributing the Texas outage to Biden’s order.  ""Anyone else concerned that 3 weeks ago Joe Biden signed an Executive Order giving China access to the US power grid for 90 days & now Texas and Minneapolis have no power or heat?"" reads a tweet.  These tweets refer to the executive order on climate change policy that Biden signed on Jan. 20, 2021.  Is it accurate to say that the order granted China access to the U.S. power grid? No.  Biden’s executive order suspended a directive issued by former President Donald Trump that aimed to limit the use of electrical equipment manufactured by foreign adversaries, like China. However, under Biden’s executive order, the prohibitions against installing foreign utilities in the U.S. power grid remain in place. We reached out to Kirk through his organization Turning Point USA, but we didn’t receive a response.  To secure the U.S. power grid from the threat of a cyberattack, Trump issued an executive order on May 1, 2020, called ""Securing the United States Bulk-Power System."" The order prohibited the use of electrical equipment ""designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of"" foreign entities such as China.  Under that order, Trump’s energy secretary, Dan Brouillette, issued a prohibition against U.S. utilities using Chinese electrical equipment.  After taking office in January 2021, Biden signed a flurry of executive orders rescinding Trump policies. One of them, dealing with climate change policy, suspended Trump’s May 1 order for 90 days.  During the 90-day suspension, the energy secretary and White House budget director are directed to take stock of Trump’s executive order and recommend whether to issue a replacement. (Biden’s nominee for budget director has not been confirmed.) However, according to the Energy Department, the prohibitions on Chinese electrical equipment remain in place while the Trump order is reviewed.  ""During this 90-day review period, Responsible Utilities will refrain from installation of bulk-power system electric equipment or programmable components… subject to foreign adversaries’ ownership, control, or influence,"" the agency wrote on an FAQ page on its website.  There is no evidence that Chinese interference shut down the Texas power grid, which is separate from the Eastern and Western grids that power every other state in the continental U.S. Energy experts told us that many factors drove the outage, including a failure to winterize Texas’ energy infrastructure, despite years of warnings.  As a blast of Arctic air and wind battered the state, power plants not built to withstand the cold began to go offline just as freezing temperatures boosted demand for heating, said Sam Newell, an electricity expert at the Brattle Group, which has run detailed analyses of the Texas power grid.  As energy output dropped, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the Texas power grid, imposed rolling blackouts, causing power outages for millions of Texans.  Students for Trump claimed, ""Joe Biden is handing our power grid to the Chinese Communist Party."" Biden suspended part of a Trump order forbidding the use of Chinese electrical equipment in the U.S. power grid. However, the prohibitions remain in place.  There is no evidence that Chinese interference caused the Texas power outage.  We rate this False. ​",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAAE480>],/factchecks/2021/feb/23/students-trump/no-biden-executive-order-did-not-allow-china-acces/

Child care costs are high, but Godlewski’s stat lacks nuance
","Access to affordable child care is one of many societal shortfalls exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. For low-income parents in particular, quality center-based care can be financially out of reach, leading them to cobble together arrangements with family, friends and home-based options that may not guarantee needed safety and consistency. Even before COVID-19 further limited available options, a 2019 study found center-based child care is unaffordable for 63% of full-time working families. Wisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski — a Democrat and potential 2022 U.S. Senate candidate — sought to highlight this crisis in a recent tweet. ""On average, 17% of a family’s income goes towards child care in Wisconsin,"" Godlewski wrote on Feb. 6, 2021. ""That's ridiculous! Washington must provide financial relief to help struggling families with these ever-rising costs."" Her tweet included a chart showing Wisconsin ranked eighth-worst in the country by that metric according to an analysis by Lending Tree. Godlewski is right that a crisis exists, but she’s a bit off in how she presents the numbers. Let’s take a closer look. Godlewski cites Lending Tree as her source, which is somewhat less than an authority on the subject. The website is an online loan marketplace that like many other online vendors uses geography-based breakdowns like this to attract website visitors. The group isn’t far off in their analysis, though. Child Care Aware — a national advocacy organization pushing for quality, affordable child care — found the average monthly cost of full-time child care at a child care center is $996 per child in Wisconsin, which is equivalent to 18% of median household income for a family with children under 6. Lending Tree cited a 17% figure for center-based care as a percentage of income using average income. Statisticians typically use median income rather than average to determine rates like this, so outliers such the highest income earners don’t skew the calculation. But there are several key caveats in the Child Care Aware stat (and the similar Lending Tree one) that Godlewski’s wording disregards. The cost is per child, not per family. The cost refers to full-time, center-based care. Many families use home-based care options or friends and family, or use a combination of those options and center-based care. The percentage comparing child care cost and income is an equivalency, rather than an average as Godlewski frames it. The third point takes a bit more explanation. Imagine two families who each had one child. If one used relatives for child care and had no cost, and the other used full-time, center-based care and paid 34% of their income for that, the two families would average a cost of 17%. That’s the picture painted by Godlewski’s phrasing, that the average cost among families with children is 17%. But that’s incorrect. That figure is only accurate when referring to the group of families that have exactly one child under 6 in child care, with that child attending full-time in a center-based setting. And that’s not a typical child care situation. Only about 24% of children under 6 were in center-based child care full time in 2019, said Sarah Grady, study director of the National Household Education Survey, a federal program administered by the National Center for Education Statistics. In actuality, that stat (18%, according to Child Care Aware) is simply an equivalence. It is stating that the cost of putting one child in a full-time, center-based care is equivalent to 18% of the typical income for a family with children in that age range. We should also note that the cost relative to income predictably changes drastically based on the number of parents and children involved. For example, Child Care Aware says the full-time center-based care option would be equal to 37% of median household income for a single-parent family with one child under 6. Godlewski’s core point is about families paying for child care, so here’s what we know on that point. You can look at this statistic in terms of children or in terms of families. On a per-child basis, about 40% of children 5 and under were in at least one out-of-home child care arrangement that parents paid for nationwide, according to the latest data from the National Household Education Survey. That includes those that pay for just a portion of a week and use any type of paid child care, not just licensed centers. In terms of working families, the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization, estimates 55% of working families pay for some portion of child care. Again, that includes those that pay for just a portion of a week. Predictably, higher-income families are more likely to use licensed child care centers, the Center for American Progress found, again limiting the usefulness of the average family metric Godlewski invoked. Among the 20% of families with the highest income, 66% used licensed child care; but only 33% of families whose income was in the bottom 20%. Criticizing the high cost of child care in Wisconsin, Godlewski claimed, ""On average, 17% of a family’s income goes towards child care in Wisconsin."" She’s right that child care costs can be a financially impossible burden for many families. But her stat misses on several points. That figure isn’t an average, it simply compares the price of full-time, center-based child care to the typical family income, expressing that ratio as a percentage. This number only holds true for a family with one child who has that child in full-time center-based care, which is far from a typical situation. Many families use a combination of options, or pay for home-based care.  And this phrasing actually drastically understates the cost for a single-parent family or a family with multiple children using center-based care. We define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE61940>],/factchecks/2021/feb/23/sarah-godlewski/child-care-costs-are-high-godlewskis-stat-lacks-nu/

Looking at why a coal-powered closed in Texas
","Power outages in Texas left many residents without heat and electricity during recent ice and snow storms. Some conservative politicians blamed the outages on frozen wind turbines when, in reality, energy officials said the primary cause appeared to be failures across the state’s natural gas operations.  An image spreading on social media during the storms suggested that renewable energy deprived half a million homes of power by causing the shutdown of a coal-powered plant.  ""Monticello power plant just outside of Pittsburg TX has been closed since 2018 because of renewable energy,"" the post says. ""She alone can produce enough reliable power for over 500,000 homes. How is that green energy working out for y’all?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Monticello plant near Pittsburg, Texas — about two hours east of Dallas — once had an operating capacity of 1,880 megawatts, which is enough to power as many as about 940,000 homes depending on conditions. But it has been offline since January 2018. Luminant, the state’s largest electricity generator, announced in October 2017 that it was retiring the plant. In a statement, the president of Luminant’s parent company, Vistra, said ""the market’s unprecedented low power price environment has profoundly impacted its operating revenues and no longer supports continued investment."" Before the plant could go offline, the state’s main grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, had to ensure that it wasn’t needed to supply reliable power to consumers. Monticello was one of the state’s largest coal-powered plants, and the Houston Chronicle described it at the time as one in ""a string of coal plant closures nationwide as a glut of cheap natural gas and continued advances in solar and wind energy technology continue to depress wholesale power prices."" We reached out to Vistra about the post. Meranda Cohn, a spokesperson for the company, told PolitiFact that when it announced the retirement of Monticello and two other plants, Vistra said it was because the plants were ""economically challenged"" in a competitive market.  ""Sustained low wholesale power prices, an oversupplied renewable generation market, and low natural gas prices, along with other factors, have contributed to the decision,"" she said. Back in 2017, another Vistra spokesperson told the Dallas Morning News that the decision was ""purely economic … this is a coal plant operating in a market that’s flooded with cheap natural gas.""   Kenneth Medlock, Center for Energy Studies senior director at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, confirmed that renewables have put pressure on coal, but he said ""they are definitely not the sole driver of coal closures.""  ""Coal is largely being displaced by low-cost natural gas,"" Medlock said in an email. ""This is just a matter of data, where one can tangibly see the effect of very cheap natural gas on power generation across the U.S., not just in Texas."" The price of power in the wholesale market in Texas is set by the price of natural gas, said Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. Cheap natural gas plus the rapid growth of wind energy in Texas ""essentially made coal uneconomic.""  Our ruling  The image that’s being shared on social media claims that the Monticello power plant closed because of renewable energy.  Renewable energy contributed to the plant’s demise but so did other factors.

Ron DeSantis advances questionable link between lockdowns and despair
","For months, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has boasted about his state’s ""open for business"" strategy in dealing with COVID-19 and how it’s working better than so-called lockdown states. Unlike in some other states, all Florida public schools are open for in-person learning, restaurants and bars have few restrictions, and the state has barred local governments from penalizing individuals for not wearing a mask in public. In a recent rant against social network companies such as Facebook and Twitter, DeSantis suggested that states that had instituted heavy restrictions on residents experienced severe repercussions for residents without reducing the number of COVID-19 deaths. ""Lockdowns at the time of the pandemic were favored by the, quote, ‘narrative’ and so, in the name of, quote, ‘science,’ articles and posts warning against lockdowns were taken down and censored,"" said DeSantis. ""The result has been the destruction of millions of lives across America, as well as increased deaths from suicide, substance abuse and despair, without any corresponding benefit in COVID mortality."" We wondered whether that was true. Have state restrictions done such significant harm without providing any boost in the fight against COVID-19 deaths? So we dug in. To reduce the spread of the coronavirus, states have enacted — and then sometimes relaxed or lifted — various restrictions, including mask mandates, limits on restaurant capacity, stay-at-home orders and bans on large gatherings. DeSantis, a Republican, has bristled at such statewide orders, even resisting pleas from local officials in Florida and criticizing other jurisdictions for implementing them. He has consistently questioned their effectiveness. Late last year, for instance, he claimed that states with lockdowns had COVID-19 transmission rates twice as high as Florida’s. We rated that Half True. We asked DeSantis’ office for any evidence supporting his more recent claim. The response reveals a mixed bag of information. To support the governor’s claim that other states have seen higher numbers of deaths from suicide, substance abuse and despair than Florida has during the pandemic, DeSantis’ office sent information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing ""all cause"" mortality rates increased slower in Florida in 2020 — coinciding with the pandemic’s first months through June 3 — over 2019 rates than in California and New York — two states that have opted for more regulations on public gatherings and mask-wearing. DeSantis’ analysis showed Florida’s rate rose 15% compared with 16% in California and 29% in New York. But the ""all causes"" category goes far beyond deaths associated with suicide and drug abuse. It includes deaths from cancer, heart disease, lung disease and dementia, for example. DeSantis’ office did not provide any data showing how rates of suicide and drug abuse in Florida compared with those in so-called lockdown states. It sent us a Miami Herald article that said in Florida, according to preliminary medical examiners’ statistics, 2,975 people died by suicide in 2020, down 13% from the previous year. But the article did not have nationwide data or figures from California or New York. Concerning overdose deaths, DeSantis’ office did not provide specific information. However, health experts said the pandemic likely did increase opioid overdoses. But the latest, provisional CDC data on drug overdose deaths shows Florida’s numbers rising faster than the national average. Comparing the 12-month period ending in June 2020, the period of time for which data is available, to the prior 12 months, Florida had a 34% increase in the rate of overdose deaths compared with a 20% national average among states. California had a 23% increase and New York had an 18% increase. Meanwhile, federal suicide data reflecting the months in which the pandemic has transpired will not likely be available until 2022. Experts say that anecdotal evidence suggests a possible uptick in suicide rates during the pandemic. In addition, an online tool offered by the nonprofit Mental Health America to help screen for mental health issues showed a slight increase last year in people having suicidal thoughts. Nonetheless, Paul Gionfriddo, the group’s CEO, said he knows of no studies showing that so-called lockdown states have higher rates of suicide than those with fewer restrictions. Gionfriddo said DeSantis may think he is mitigating the harmful effects of loneliness by not limiting public gatherings. But loneliness is not the only reason people cite in considering suicide, he said. Grief, financial insecurity and other factors also play a role, he said. John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit think tank, said it’s difficult to pinpoint the psychological impact of restrictions to reduce infection because rules vary by state and within states, and such regulations have been imposed and lifted at different times. Auerbach said he knows of no evidence that links states’ COVID-19 restrictions to suicides or drug overdose deaths. ""There are many contributing factors to suicide and drug overdoses,"" he said. The pandemic itself is having the biggest effect on heightening people’s risk of dying from suicide and drug abuse — not the states’ different approaches to prevent the transmission of infection, he added. ""It is the underlying pandemic that is at the root of increased risks,"" Auerbach said. DeSantis also argued that statewide restrictions did not bring any corresponding benefit in limiting COVID-19 mortality. We asked his office for evidence. They again pointed to the CDC increase in ""all cause"" mortality data that showed California’s rate was slightly higher than Florida’s. But those statistics cover all causes of death, and people are still dying of diseases and conditions besides COVID-19. We then consulted three epidemiologists to get their take. They all said the governor was playing loose with the facts. They stressed varying factors that affect states’ mortality rates — from the weather to socioeconomic indicators to access to health services. The epidemiologists pointed to the latest CDC data, which indicated that Florida’s COVID-19 mortality rate is higher than California’s and seemed to undercut DeSantis’ position that lockdowns have only hurt states. As of Feb. 22, Florida ranked 28th in COVID-19 death rates while California ranked 33rd, according to the latest CDC data, as compiled by Statista. ""That would bolster the argument that restrictions are one factor involved in lowering death rates,"" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor of public health at Claremont Graduate University in California. Numerous others also have an effect, Gatto said, so it is impossible to compare states using current data based on their strategies. ""I do think it is an oversimplification to make the assertion that the governor did without further study of the numerous variables involved, characteristics of the population, timing of interventions and the limitations of the data,"" she said. DeSantis said lockdown states have seen ""increased deaths from suicide, substance abuse and despair without any corresponding benefit in COVID mortality."" The pandemic certainly has caused anxiety and distress across the country and state and local restrictions designed to tamp down on the coronavirus’s spread have also affected people’s financial and emotional wellbeing. But currently, no clear data supports DeSantis’ strongly worded claim. Researchers agreed that more research is necessary before such broad conclusions could be drawn. In addition, experts said that COVID-19 death rates vary by state and numerous factors beyond state strategies to combat the virus affect this metric. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF2C280>],/factchecks/2021/feb/23/ron-desantis/desantis-advances-questionable-link-between-lockdo/

Vaccines are up and infections are down under Biden, but it’s not all his doing
","The coronavirus pandemic isn’t yet approaching its end, but Democrats are expressing widespread relief that the Biden administration — and not the Trump administration — will be tackling the virus from here on out. One post that attracted some 28,000 reactions reflected this sentiment. Over a picture of a smiling Biden flashing the thumbs-up sign, the Feb. 19 post said, ""Boom! COVID-19 infections down 61% from Trump’s last day. COVID-19 vaccinations up 85% from Trump’s last day. Competence matters!!!""   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here is a chart showing the seven-day rolling average for new coronavirus cases between Jan. 1 and Feb. 21. The first 20 days of that period were under President Donald Trump and are shown in red, while the rest were under Biden and are shown in blue.   Cases fell by 65%, which is close to the 61% cited in the post. However, it’s worth noting that the number of cases started falling about 10 days before Biden took office, and that decline did not appreciably accelerate after he took office. As for vaccinations, they also increased steadily on Biden’s watch, but not at a significantly faster rate than they did in Trump’s final days.   The number of vaccinations on Feb. 19 was 88% higher than the number on Jan. 20, which is close to the 85% cited in the post. (The data show a decline in recent days that is due to a combination of slow reporting of data and delays caused by the winter storm that affected a broad cross-section of the country.) In contrast to Trump, who was criticized for a lack of focus on the pandemic and for a reluctance to stand firmly behind policies urged by public health experts such as wearing masks, Biden made fighting the pandemic a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and promised a more science-based approach and a stronger federal hand in the vaccine rollout. Still, experts cautioned against assuming that Biden deserves full credit for these statistical gains. ""I do not think it’s fair to say that Biden singlehandedly slashed coronavirus infections or caused vaccination to skyrocket, but he certainly didn’t seem to hurt the effort,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.  It’s also too early to say that Biden’s initiatives are having an on-the-ground impact that can be easily identified in the data, said Natalie Dean, a University of Florida biostatistician. ""Although there have been some strong new initiatives put into place at the start of his term, these will take time to have an impact, particularly those related to vaccine rollout, such as ramping up manufacturing,"" Dean said. ""Operation Warp Speed deserves a lot of credit for the availability of safe and efficacious vaccines, and this initiative was started under Trump."" John Sellers, the executive director and co-founder of the Other98, told PolitiFact that the group agrees that ""there are many factors playing a role on the trajectory of COVID vaccinations and infections."" He added that the post does not explicitly state ""that all these changes are due Biden."" A viral image that features Biden giving a thumbs up says ""COVID-19 infections down 61% from Trump’s last day. COVID-19 vaccinations up 85% from Trump’s last day. Competence Matters."" These specific figures are basically accurate, and both the number of new infections and the pace of vaccinations have shown steady improvement during Biden’s tenure. However, it’s important to note that the decline in cases began more than a week before Biden took office, and the pace of new cases and vaccinations did not change direction dramatically once Biden took office. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

No, Utah isn’t recalling Romney
","After Sen. Mitt Romney voted to impeach former President Donald Trump, those unhappy with the Republican’s vote began sharing news of backlash in Romney’s home state.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s wrong. While there is a petition circulating to collect enough signatures to put an initiative on an upcoming ballot that would give voters the ability to recall their senators, the state of Utah has not started a recall of Romney, as this post claims.  Another hurdle is that there isn’t a formal way to recall U.S. senators. The U.S. Constitution ""does not provide for nor authorize the recall of United States officers such as senators, representatives, or the president or vice president,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. ""No member of Congress has ever been recalled in the history of the United States.""  Though this hasn’t been tested at the Supreme Court, other judicial decisions support that the right to remove a senator lies in Congress, which can impeach and expel its members, according to the Congressional Research Service.  Since 1789, the Senate has expelled 15 members. In 1797, for example, Sen. William Blount of Tennessee was impeached by the House on charges of conspiring to help Great Britain seize Spanish-controlled territories in what is now Florida and Louisiana, but the Senate expelled him before his trial. In 2020, after Romney voted to convicted Trump during his first impeachment trial, a state representative in Utah filed a bill to allow voters to recall their U.S. senators. But state House and Senate leaders worried about the bill’s constitutionality, and the House Speaker decided not to consider the legislation for a vote. While a petition is now circulating in Utah that seeks to collect enough signatures to put a similar initiative on an upcoming ballot, this Facebook post gets it wrong: the state has not — and does not have the ability to — recall its junior senator.

"['National', 'Coronavirus', 'Steve Scalise']","
Has $1 trillion in COVID-19 relief gone unspent?
","House Democrats are forging ahead with a vote on a $1.9 trillion package to address the coronavirus and fix the economic damage that cost about 10 million people their jobs. Rep. Steve Scalise, second in command of the House Republicans, said that he and his colleagues support spending more to overcome the pandemic, but that the Democratic plan is chock full of unneeded giveaways. ""There's over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous relief bills that were bipartisan,"" Scalise, R-La., said Feb. 21 on ABC’s This Week. ""The money's still sitting in a bank account and we're going to pass $1.9 trillion of additional spending to bail out failed states, to raise the minimum wage? What does that have to do with COVID?"" The claim that there is $1 trillion left over from earlier efforts is a top Republican talking point. Scalise led with the same argument in a Feb. 19 op-ed. His source is the COVID Money Tracker, a project of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group focused on reducing federal deficits. The tracker’s latest number shows that out of $4.1 trillion approved by Congress, about $3 trillion has been committed or disbursed. But in a Jan. 27 blog post, the budget group warned that figuring out how much money remains is complicated. It’s not, they wrote, as though the money is ""sitting in budget accounts waiting to be allocated.""  ""Much of it is already allocated or scheduled to be spent, and a small portion will never be spent,"" they wrote. A large fraction of the nominally unspent money comes from the Response and Relief Act, passed in late December.  ""These funds will take some time to disburse and even more time to appear in the data,"" they said.  About a fifth of the money that Scalise counted will be spent over several years, primarily in the form of Medicaid dollars and a lending program called Economic Injury and Disaster Loans. Part of the uncertainty, the committee’s analysts wrote, is that some of the money allocated in earlier bills might never be spent. For example, the CARES Act that passed in March extended unemployment benefits at an estimated cost of $250 billion. But as of right now, that seems to overshoot the need, they said. The amount of the excess would make Scalise’s $1 trillion number a bit lower. Setting aside the December relief package, about 80% of previously allocated funds have been spent, they said. The federal government has its own COVID-19 relief spending tracker. It counts dollars differently than the one Scalise used, and it hasn’t been updated since the end of December. By its accounting, out of a total of $2.4 trillion that Congress approved, about $500 billion remains unspent and unobligated.  If federal dollars go unspent, that might suggest that certain programs need to be redesigned. Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at Brookings, a Washington research group, said it could be that the way Congress set up a program made it too hard for the money to get to the people and businesses that needed help. That, however, is a separate question from the size of the relief bill. ""Ultimately, it may be the case that unspent funds mean that the next package should be smaller, but I don’t think that’s the first conclusion one should necessarily draw from any existence of unspent funds,"" Reynolds said. Even money that Washington has disbursed can be held up at the state level. Massachusetts has spent about half of the $2.7 billion it got through the CARES Act, the Boston Globe reported. Missouri officials left about $13 million for small farms and businesses unused. Scalise said, ""There's over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous relief bills ... still sitting in a bank account."" Scalise’s point-in-time figure is in line with one running tally, but he oversimplified the status of the funds. A large share of the total is already allocated or scheduled to be spent. A key factor is that Washington is getting up to speed in disbursing funds approved in late December. The money is not sitting in budget accounts, but neither has it reached its final destination..

Biden administration did not block Texas from increasing power before winter storm
","As millions of Texans regained power after a severe winter storm brought snow, ice and freezing temperatures, some conspiracy theorists tried to pin the widespread outage on the Biden administration. On Feb. 20, InfoWars, a conspiracy website run by Alex Jones, published an article with the headline: ""Joe Biden’s Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm."" ""An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex,"" the story says. The article, interspersed with ads for InfoWars-brand sleep aid supplements, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Facebook has banned InfoWars and associated accounts from its platform since 2019, citing concerns about hate speech and content promoting violence. Still, this article had been shared thousands of times on Facebook, so we wanted to take a closer look. (Screenshot from InfoWars) The story is wrong — the Energy Department did not ""block"" Texas from increasing power production before the winter storm hit. The ""major smoking gun"" cited by InfoWars is actually an emergency order that temporarily suspended federal emissions caps in the state so that some power plants could operate at maximum capacity.  We reached out to InfoWars for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. ERCOT stands for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It was created in 1970 to oversee the state’s power grid beyond the reach of federal regulators. As freezing temperatures descended on large areas of the central and southern Plains, ERCOT asked its customers to conserve energy amid ""record-breaking electric demand."" On Feb. 15, ERCOT reported that about 34 gigawatts of power were offline, mainly due to frozen instruments at natural gas and coal plants.   Before that outage, ERCOT sent a letter to acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga requesting emergency assistance. Specifically, the corporation asked the government to allow Texas power plants to exceed federal emissions requirements until Feb. 19 so that they could operate at maximum capacity. ""In ERCOT’s judgment, the loss of power to homes and local businesses in the areas affected by curtailments presents a far greater risk to public health and safety than the temporary exceedances of those permit limits that would be allowed under the requested order,"" ERCOT President and CEO Bill Magness wrote. ""This request is narrowly tailored to allow only the exceedances that are necessary to ensure reliability over the next few days."" The emissions ERCOT mentioned in its letter were sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide. The corporation also anticipated an influx of wastewater as a result of the increased demand for electricity. On Feb. 14, the same day ERCOT sent its letter, the Energy Department issued an emergency order granting ERCOT’s request. ""Given the emergency nature of the expected load stress … I have determined that additional dispatch of the Specified Resources is necessary to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest,"" Huizenga wrote. ""Because the additional generation may result in a conflict with environmental standards and requirements, I am authorizing only the necessary additional generation, with reporting requirements as described below."" RELATED: How Fox News, far-right TV blamed green energy for Texas’ power outages The emergency order applied predominantly to coal and natural gas plants. The Energy Department stipulated that ERCOT should ""exhaust all reasonably and practically available resources"" to ""minimize an increase in emissions."" Many Facebook posts center on stipulations of the emergency order that permitted ERCOT to exceed emissions standards only under specific emergency levels. Those stipulations did not prevent Texas from ramping up its power production. In an emailed statement, the Energy Department told PolitiFact that its order ""allowed specified power plants to generate up to their maximum capacity in order to manage the expected increase in electricity demand.""  We reached out to the White House and ERCOT for comments, but we haven’t heard back. InfoWars wrote that the Energy Department ""Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm."" That’s wrong — the Energy Department did the opposite. On the same day that ERCOT asked the government to allow power plants to exceed federal emissions caps, the Energy Department granted the request.

Sen. Cory Booker is right about legacy of USDA bias against Black farmers
","Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is pushing for a new bill that would provide Black farmers debt relief and access to a land grant program, arguing they have historically endured discrimination from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ""Overtly discriminatory and unjust federal policy has robbed Black families in the United States of the ability to build and pass on intergenerational wealth,"" Booker said in a Feb. 9 statement. ""When it comes to farming and agriculture, we know that there is a direct connection between discriminatory policies within the USDA and the enormous land loss we have seen among Black farmers over the past century."" There’s been a sharp decline in the number of Black farmers in that period. In 1920, there were about 925,700 Black farmers; in 2017, there were slightly more than 45,500, a roughly 95% drop. Black-operated farms accounted for 4.7 million acres of farmland in 2017, or 0.5% of the U.S. total, said a USDA census conducted every five years. The number of white farmers has declined since 1920, but not nearly as much: about 5.5 million white farm operators in 1920, compared with 3.2 million in 2017. Is Booker correct about discriminatory USDA policies leading to land loss among Black farmers? Yes, he is, according to an expert we interviewed, along with U.S. government reports, legal settlements, statements from the agriculture secretary and scholarly research over the years. (Booker’s office provided several documents supporting his claim.) The discriminatory policies go back decades, including with the way New Deal farm programs were administered in the Jim Crow-era South, said Ronald Rainey, an economics professor at the University of Arkansas. ""Black farmers faced discrimination in terms of getting equitable benefits and treatment from the USDA offices and the county committees who controlled and disbursed funds,"" Rainey said. For white farmers, the government programs that began in the 1930s subsidized the evolution of agriculture, creating larger farms, increased mechanization and more efficient labor with fewer workers, Rainey said. But Black farmers were ""systematically hindered"" from growing and modernizing their farms, he said. ""The result of institutional racism and lack of protections from authorities caused a higher percentage of Black farmers to lose their farms or be forced out,"" Rainey said. A 1965 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that Black farmers received inferior treatment from USDA agencies compared with white farmers. In the South, where most Black farmers operated, federally assisted state extension services were ""administered through a separate structure and generally on a discriminatory basis,"" the report said. It said that a large percentage of white farmers in the South, aided by federal loans and technical advice, diversified their crops and applied modern farming practices. That helped them raise their incomes, expand their farms, improve their housing and advance their education. But about a quarter of a million Black farmers ""stand as a glaring exception to this picture of progress."" Among the issues raised in the report: Black farmers got smaller loans and far less guidance than white farmers in the same economic class. White borrowers got most of their loans for capital investments, such as farm improvements or enlargement, while Black farmers’ loans were primarily for living expenses and annual operating costs. A 1997 report from the USDA inspector general said that the discrimination complaint process at the Farm Service Agency lacked ""integrity, direction, and accountability."" A civil rights task force in 1997 also recommended 92 changes to address racial bias at the USDA. A 2002 USDA report also said that for many years, USDA services ""were not equally available to assist Black farmers with credit programs for purchasing land from neighboring Black farmers or from estate sales."" ""Consequently, many Black farmers have struggled to stay in business without equal opportunity to increase the scale of their farming operations,"" the report said. Black farmers brought a class action lawsuit against the USDA in 1997, Pigford v. Glickman, alleging racial discrimination and failure to address complaints filed since 1983. Farmers also said they lost their land due to a pattern of discrimination at the USDA. In 1999, a federal judge approved a settlement providing relief to farmers who could demonstrate discrimination. The settlement cost the federal government about $1.06 billion in cash relief, estimated tax payments and debt relief to prevailing claimants, said a Congressional Research Service report. In approving the settlement, U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman said that for decades, the USDA and county commissioners responsible for handling loans had discriminated against Black farmers. ""Historical discrimination cannot be undone. But the consent decree represents a significant first step,"" the judge wrote. A 2008 farm law included a provision allowing farmers who were left out of the Pigford settlement to file a new suit. In 2010, a second settlement, known as Pigford II, allowed up to $1.25 billion to Black farmers who demonstrated they had experienced racial discrimination in USDA farm loan programs. ""We have worked hard to address USDA’s checkered past so we can get to the business of helping farmers succeed,"" then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a February 2010 statement. (Vilsack has been nominated by President Joe Biden to return as agriculture secretary.) In a statement to PolitiFact, the USDA said the department was committed to making sure its programs are ""conducted in a nondiscriminatory manner."" ""There is a lot more that needs to be done and accomplished at USDA to make programming equitable and to root out decades of systemic discrimination that disproportionately affects Black, Hispanic, Indigenous and other farmers of color,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the Biden administration would appoint more diverse leadership and create an equity commission ""to take action to remedy policies and practices that contribute to discrimination."" More recent Black farm land loss is linked to heirs’ property issues, Rainey said. He said this happens when a farmer dies without a will and the farm is spling among multiple heirs, resulting in fractional ownership. A distrust of the legal system has contributed to farms being transferred from one generation to the other without a will, said a post from the Heirs’ Property Retention Coalition, formed in 2006 to help low-income African Americans deal with issues related to heirs’ property. Booker said, ""there is a direct connection between discriminatory policies within the USDA and the enormous land loss we have seen among Black farmers over the past century."" Booker’s claim is supported by findings in USDA reports, legal settlements between the department and Black farmers and expert opinion. Booker’s claim is accurate.

Do a majority of Republicans support Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan?
","President Joe Biden made a forceful pitch to Republicans in Congress to ""listen to their constituents"" and pass his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to help Americans recover from the pandemic. ""According to the polls, there is overwhelming bipartisan support,"" Biden said Feb. 19 at a Pfizer plant in Michigan that produces vaccines. ""The vast majority of the American people — more than 70% of the American people, with all the polls you all conduct, including a majority of Republicans — want us to act, and act big and quickly and support the plan."" The House is expected to vote on the American Rescue Plan before the end of February, while the Senate is expected to take it up by mid-March. The legislation includes a $1,400 cash payment, aid to help K-12 schools open and money for vaccinations and unemployment assistance. Republican lawmakers have criticized Biden’s plan, with some GOP senators proposing a smaller package. Polls in late January and February found that most Americans do support Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan. But when we fact-checked his claim that a majority of Republicans support it, we found those who identify as Republican were generally less favorable to the aid package, even if they supported some elements of it. The White House cited one poll to back up Biden’s statement about Republican support. A CBS poll conducted by YouGov asked respondents: ""Would you approve or disapprove of Congress passing an additional economic relief package that would provide funds to people and businesses impacted by the coronavirus outbreak?"" In response, 70% of Republicans said they approved, while 95% of Democrats approved. The question did not include the $1.9 trillion price tag, or mention Biden’s name. A subsequent question asked respondents if they think the economic relief package is ""too much,"" ""not enough"" or ""about the right amount."" Among Republicans, 38% said the package is too much, while 27% said not enough and 34% said about the right amount. Two other polls showed less support among Republicans. In those polls, the questions mentioned the $1.9 trillion cost and Biden’s name. Quinnipiac asked adults: ""You may know, the Biden administration has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus relief bill in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Do you support or oppose this bill?"" The poll showed 68% support his $1.9 trillion plan overall, but 47% of Republicans said they were opposed, with 16% offering no opinion. In a subsequent question, a majority of Republicans indicated they support a $1,400 stimulus payment. SurveyMonkey/New York Times asked respondents ""Do you approve or disapprove of President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which would provide federal support to individuals and businesses impacted by the coronavirus?"" The poll found that 72% overall approved, but among Republicans, 56% disapproved. Asked about certain components of the package, the majority of Republicans identified the $1,400 checks, COVID-19 vaccine distribution and money for state and local governments and schools as important elements. Polls can find different answers to questions on the same topic depending upon the precise wording of the question and whether they include partisan cues. John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, pointed to the wording in the CBS/YouGov poll, which asked about ""economic relief"" and not ""stimulus."" ""Republicans may favor ‘economic relief’ more than ‘stimulus relief,’"" or package, said Geer, who co-directs the Vanderbilt Poll. ""Stimulus is governmental activism, which GOPers tend not to support."" Another likely factor is that the CBS question asked about Congress, while the other polls mentioned Biden. ""Mentioning Biden activates partisanship,"" Geer said. ""Even though Congress is controlled by the (Democrats), the wording is not as likely to activate that."" Barry C. Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said surveys conducted over the years have shown that mentioning the president’s name in a question creates more resistance from members of the opposite party. ""Compared with other surveys, the CBS/YouGov poll finds more support among Republicans for two reasons: It does not mention the price tag and it does not mention President Biden,"" Burden said. Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said including the cost of the bill in the question probably gave many Republicans pause. ""Including both the cost and a Democratic president’s name could also have inclined many Republicans to oppose it,"" Bowman said. Including the cost of the legislation ""highlights a downside of the bill without necessarily drawing attention to its benefits,"" said Burden. Andrew E. Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said the wording of the questions is critical, because most people probably don’t know the details about what is in the American Rescue Plan. ""I would be surprised that more than 2% of the public could actually tell you what is in the proposal, so they are simply relying on the wording of the question — who favors it, who opposes it, what the question says it will do etc.,"" Smith said. Biden said, ""The vast majority of the American people"" support Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue plan, ""including a majority of Republicans."" The White House cited a poll by CBS that found 70% of Republicans approve of Congress passing an additional economic relief package to provide funds to people and businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. But two other polls that included more details in their questions — Quinnipiac and SurveyMonkey/New York Times — found less than majority support among Republicans for the American Rescue Plan. All three polls showed strong overall support for the plan. We rate this statement Half True.

Conservative talk show host falsely claims ‘science’ supports a return to normal now
","A popular Facebook and blog post by conservative radio host Buck Sexton claims scientific research indicates life should return to normal now despite the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Here’s what the science tells anyone who is being honest about it: open the schools, stop wearing masks outside, and everyone at low risk should start living normal lives. Not next fall, or next year — now,"" reads the blog post, posted to Facebook on Feb. 8. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) KHN-PolitiFact messaged Sexton via his Facebook page to ask if he could provide evidence to back up the statement but got no response. So we reviewed the scientific evidence and talked to public health experts about Sexton’s argument. Overall, they disagreed, noting the ways in which it runs counter to current public health strategies.  Let’s take it point by point. In March, when government and public health leaders realized the novel coronavirus was spreading throughout the U.S., many public institutions — including schools — were ordered to shut down to prevent further spread. Many students finished the 2020 spring semester remotely. Some jurisdictions did choose to reopen schools in fall 2020 and spring 2021, though others have remained remote. Throughout the pandemic, researchers have studied whether in-person learning at schools contributes significantly to the spread of COVID-19. The findings have shown that if K-12 schools adhere to mitigation measures — masking, physical distancing and frequent hand-washing — then there is a relatively low risk of transmission. And getting kids back into the classroom is a high priority for the Biden administration. In a Feb. 3 White House press briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said data suggests ""schools can safely reopen."" The CDC on Feb. 12 released guidance on how schools should approach reopening. It recommends the standard risk-mitigation measures, as well as universal masking, contact tracing, creating student learning cohorts or pods, conducting testing and monitoring community transmission of the virus. Susan Hassig, associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane University, said science shows that schools can open safely if ""mitigation measures are implemented and maintained in the school space."" Here’s some of the latest research that tracks with these positions: Of course, there are some limitations to these studies, which often rely on contact tracing, a process that can’t always pinpoint where cases originate. Some of the studies also rely on self-reporting of mask-wearing by individuals, which could be inaccurate. Additionally, Hassig pointed out that not all school districts have the resources, such as physical space, personnel or high-quality masks, to open safely. Sexton’s assertion that schools can reopen leaves out a key piece of information: that safe reopening is highly dependent upon use of mitigation measures that have been shown to tamp down virus spread. Because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is relatively new, the research on outdoor mask use is limited. But so far science has shown that masks prevent virus transmission.A CDC study published Feb. 10 reported that a medical procedure mask (commonly known as a surgical mask) blocked 56.1% of simulated cough particles. A cloth mask blocked 51.4% of cough particles. And the effectiveness went up to 85.4% if a cloth mask was worn over a surgical mask. Another experiment from the study showed that a person in a mask emits fewer aerosol particles that can be passed on to an unmasked person. And if both are masked, then aerosol exposure to both is reduced by more than 95%. A multitude of reports also show more generally that mask-wearing is effective at reducing the risk of spreading or catching other respiratory diseases. Sexton’s post, however, advised that people should stop wearing masks outside. To be sure, public health experts agree the risk of transmitting COVID-19 is lower outdoors than indoors. But the experts also said that doesn’t mean people should stop wearing masks. ""The wind might help you a bit outside, but you are still at risk of breathing in this virus from people around you,"" said Dr. Rachel Vreeman, director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Being outside is ""not a guarantee of safety,"" reiterated Stephen Morse, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University Medical Center. ""Especially when those people without masks are close together."" The CDC addressed the issue of whether masks are needed outside in the agency’s mask guidelines: ""Masks may not be necessary when you are outside by yourself away from others, or with other people who live in your household. However, some areas may have mask mandates while out in public, so please check for the rules in your local area."" Overall, the prevailing scientific opinion is that, while it may be OK to go maskless outside if you are physically distant from others, mask-wearing is still recommended if you are around others. ‘Everyone at low risk should start living normal lives’All the public health experts we consulted agreed this part of the claim is absolutely false. It flies in the face of what scientists recommend should be done to get through the pandemic. While it’s unclear what exactly the post means by ""low-risk"" people, let’s assume it’s referring to younger people or those without health conditions that make them more vulnerable to COVID-19. And that ""living normal lives"" refers to no longer wearing masks, physical distancing or washing hands with increased frequency. News reports and scientific evidence show that bars, parties and other large gatherings can quickly become spreader events. Moreover, even young people and those without preexisting health conditions have gotten severely ill with COVID-19 or died of it. Even if a low-risk person doesn’t get severely sick, they could still infect others in higher-risk groups. The sentiment of this post is similar to calls early in the pandemic to let life return to normal in an attempt to achieve herd immunity. But, on the way to achieving that goal, many would die, said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at KFF. ""Everyone going back to ‘normal’ right now, especially in the presence of more transmissible and more deadly variants, would be a recipe for further public health disasters on top of what we’ve already experienced,"" he added. Already, almost half a million Americans have died of COVID-19. The push to ""return to normal"" is precisely what let the new variants form and multiply, said Vreeman. ""If we can ramp up getting people vaccinated and keep wearing masks in the meantime, only then will we have a chance at getting back to ‘normal.’"" Indeed, because of the new variants circulating in the U.S., Walensky and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have urged Americans not to relax their efforts to control the virus’s spread. A blog post by conservative talk show host Buck Sexton claims scientific evidence shows that right now we should ""open the schools, stop wearing masks outside, and everyone at low risk should start living normal lives."" Scientific research shows that in order for schools to reopen safely, risk mitigation measures must be put in place, such as requiring masks, rigorous hand-washing and limiting the number of students in classrooms. These changes, though, would not represent a return to normal, but a new normal for students and teachers.  The remainder of Sexton’s statement strays further from current science. Research indicates that you’re safer outdoors than indoors, but public health experts still recommend wearing masks in public, even outside. Science does not support the idea that the time is right for some people to resume life as normal. That would allow the virus to continue to spread and have a large human cost in hospitalizations and deaths, said the experts. Sexton’s post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDCF8100>],/factchecks/2021/feb/19/buck-sexton/conservative-talk-show-host-falsely-claims-science/

No, Joe Biden wasn’t silent or inactive on Texas crisis
","After a rare Arctic blast pummeled Texas and forced millions to bear single-digit temperatures without heat or power, many have taken to social media to criticize President Joe Biden.  Why? Because, they say, he’s done nothing to help.  One Facebook post says, ""4 million without power and not a peep from Joe. Anyone surprised?""  ""Why hasn’t Joe sent the National Guard to Texas with Food and Water and Temporary Shelter?"" another questions.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The posts are wrong.  Biden declared an emergency on Feb. 14, unlocking federal assistance to Texas. He also approved disaster declarations for Oklahoma and Louisiana after speaking with the governors.  And the Texas National Guard, which is commanded by the governor, has already been mobilized. In the Feb. 14 emergency declaration for Texas, Biden authorized FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts, and to ""provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures."" It covers all 254 Texas counties. Arrangements for mass care and sheltering will be provided with 75% federal funding, the declaration says.  Homeland security adviser and Deputy National Security Adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall told reporters in a Feb. 18 White House briefing that FEMA had supplied 60 generators to support critical sites like hospitals and water facilities, and moved in 729,000 liters of water, more than 10,000 wool blankets, 50,000 cotton blankets and 225,000 meals. Officials are also preparing for additional requests by figuring out how to get more diesel fuel, if necessary, to Texas power facilities. The emergency declaration came early in the week as the brunt of the storm and outages hit Texas. Biden discussed the administration response in tweets and public remarks later in the week. ""Jill and I are keeping Texas, Oklahoma, and other impacted states in our prayers,"" Biden wrote on Twitter on Feb. 18. ""I’ve declared states of emergency, authorized FEMA to provide generators and supplies, and am ready to fulfill additional requests. Please heed the instructions of local officials and stay safe."" Jill and I are keeping Texas, Oklahoma, and other impacted states in our prayers. I’ve declared states of emergency, authorized FEMA to provide generators and supplies, and am ready to fulfill additional requests. Please heed the instructions of local officials and stay safe. In a later tweet, Biden said that he called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to discuss the situation and identify ways the federal government can support the state’s recovery efforts. Tonight, I called Governor Greg Abbott to discuss the ongoing situation in Texas and identify ways we can support the state’s recovery from this storm. I made clear to the Governor that I’ll work relentlessly to get his state what they need. pic.twitter.com/UBwH8DMep2 Biden spoke about it again Feb. 19, saying he spoke with Abbott a second time and asked whether he needed more help. ""And we talked — I talked with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA — the administrator. This afternoon, I’m going to ask him to accelerate our response and request for — it’s a different declaration — a ‘major disaster declaration’ so that we can get everything done that we need that’s possible to get done with federal government help."" He added: ""FEMA is already there and providing support — generators, diesel fuel, water, blankets, and other supplies. But I’ve directed Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense to identify other resources that can provide and address the growing needs of the folks in Texas."" The claims about Biden and the National Guard omit key facts about how the guard is deployed. Governors can activate their state’s forces as they see fit, and Abbott has done that in Texas in response to the freeze. ""We have more than 400 service members now mobilized to support winter response operations,"" Texas National Guard spokesperson Maj. Martha Nigrelle said in a Feb. 17 statement.  ""Approximately 100 out on the roads transporting people to safety, assisting stranded motorists, helping clearing roadways and assisting with recoveries where needed,"" the statement said. ""These service members have assisted more than 650 Texans in need, several pets and helped with about a dozen recoveries. The other 300 will be manning warming shelters in our major metropolitan areas."" The president can mobilize National Guard units to help the country’s armed forces, or in other times of emergency, but FEMA is usually the first to be called when it comes to natural disasters. FEMA has regional offices all over the country, and emergency declarations open up funding so resources can be allocated quickly. FEMA can also request National Guard help if needed, National Guard spokesperson Maj. Matt Murphy told PolitiFact. Facebook posts claim that Biden has said nothing about the emergency in Texas and question why he hasn’t sent in the National Guard to help.  This isn’t accurate. Biden has made multiple comments about the emergency and issued an emergency declaration for the state. This allows FEMA to allocate needed resources quickly and to call on the National Guard for added help. We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC77DC80>],/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/no-joe-biden-wasnt-silent-or-inactive-texas-freeze/
