Mostly False: Ted Cruz 'same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys'
","Among darts tossed at Sen. Ted Cruz after his Twitter account ""liked"" a sexual video clip is an allegation that Cruz has backed a ban on sex toys. The New York Post, among news outlets tracking the moment, tweeted: ""This is the same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys."" We’re unaware of Sen. Cruz, elected in 2012 and seeking re-election in 2018, calling for a ban on sex toys. So, what was the Post talking about? The Post’s tweet linked to the newspaper’s Sept. 12, 2017, news story, which said, without added detail: ""Cruz, a Republican from Texas, is known for his strong religious convictions and family values stance — and once even supported a ban on sex toys."" Cruz calls claim ‘totally false’ Cruz did not respond to our inquiry for this fact-check. But he objected on Sept. 13, 2017, when CNN’s Dana Bash asked: ""Do you appreciate the irony that you once defended a Texas law banning sales of sex toys?"" ""No,"" Cruz said. ""That’s a good example, Dana, where the media runs with things that are just totally false."" He elaborated that at one time, his duties as solicitor general for the Texas attorney general’s office included defending state laws. ""One of those laws was a law restricting the sale of sex toys. It’s a stupid law,"" Cruz said, adding that he believes consenting adults should do what they please in the privacy of their bedrooms. To get our own fix on Cruz’s actions, we turned to news accounts, a legal brief, an appeals court ruling and an extensive April 2016 Mother Jones story about Cruz’s role in a decade-old case that didn’t rise to the Supreme Court. Law upheld, then found unconstitutional At issue: The State of Texas defending section 43.23 of the state’s penal code, which states: ""A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device."" After a U.S. district judge dismissed a challenge to the law, businesses selling sex toys appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel, by 2-1, agreed with the business-plaintiffs and found the law in violation of the 14th Amendment right to privacy. The state didn’t appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. February 2008 news accounts from the Associated Press and Austin American-Statesman said the ruling overturned the state’s ban on sex toys. Under the spurned law, the American-Statesman story said, it had been illegal to sell, advertise, give or lend obscene devices, defined as a device used primarily for sexual stimulation. ""Anyone in possession of six or more sexual devices is considered to be promoting them,"" the story said, adding that the law dated to the 1970s and had seldom been enforced. Cruz’s role And what was Cruz’s role? Cruz, who had been solicitor general since 2003, didn’t present the state’s oral argument before the appellate panel, according to two attorneys involved in the dispute, Louis Sirkin, who represented businesses challenging the law, and James C. Todd, a since-retired assistant attorney general who defended the law in district court. Todd and Sirkin each told us the oral argument was given by another state lawyer, Bill L. Davis. In ruling against the state, the appellate judges cited Lawrence and Garner v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 opinion striking down bans on consensual sex between gay couples. ""Just as in Lawrence,"" the judges wrote, ""the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence."" Appeals brief Earlier, the state framed its arguments for upholding the law in a January 2007 brief listing the names of the then-attorney general, Greg Abbott, and five state attorneys working for the agency helmed by Abbott -- including Cruz, Todd and Davis, whose signature alone appears on the brief and, again alone, on the state’s unsuccessful post-ruling motion for rehearing. Our request to interview Davis didn’t draw a reply from Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office. The state’s brief notes that no state law bars the private use of sexual devices nor is there a limit on advertising such products to meet medical needs. It’s the government’s legitimate interest to guard against the commercial sale of sex and ""discouraging prurient interests in sexual gratification"" and ""protecting minors,"" the brief says. Further, the brief says, the First Amendment doesn’t protect commercial speech related to unlawful activity. The brief also says, in bold: ""There is no substantive-due-process right to stimulate one’s genitals for non-medical reasons unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship."" This section of the brief goes on to say the Supreme Court hasn’t identified such a right. Lawyers comment To our inquiries, Todd and Gary Krupkin, a Dallas First Amendment lawyer who represents businesses selling such products, each commented by phone that Cruz supported restricting sex toys but that defending state laws also was his duty. ""Obviously,"" Todd said, ""the solicitor general doesn’t write every brief. There’s no doubt in my mind that Cruz would have reviewed it in some way,"" he said. So, Todd said, Cruz ""defended it. A lawyer’s name on the brief means something. He was on it near the top, right under Greg Abbott’s. He was responsible for assigning the case. He would have been responsible for supervising the"" respective ""lawyer."" It ultimately was Cruz’s duty to defend the law, each lawyer said. And that’s ""regardless of his beliefs,"" Todd said. ""Our job in the attorney general’s office was to make whatever case there is to be made about the law."" Krupkin said: ""Cruz in his official capacity as solicitor general supported a ban. It gets too close to the line when you say Ted Cruz"" personally ""did this. Ted Cruz did that in his official position. I myself see a difference between the two,"" he said. Our ruling The Post’s tweet called Cruz ""the same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys."" This statement incorrectly suggests that Cruz called for a ban on sex toys while serving in the Senate or otherwise personally held that belief. We find no evidence to support that contention. In his position as a state lawyer, still, Cruz helped unsuccessfully defend a Texas law barring commercial promotion of sex toys--an action giving this claim an element of truth. We rate the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Ex-Democrat and GOP Senate hopeful Kevin Nicholson: Ronald Reagan was a Democrat until his mid-50s
","  President Ronald W. Reagan is regarded by many as the founder of the modern conservative movement, and experts cite his continuing influence on generations of Republicans. ""Without a doubt, he is the most influential American conservative of the 20th and yes, even into the 21st century,"" said Craig Shirley, a historian and author of four books on Reagan and the first Reagan Scholar at Eureka College (Reagan’s alma mater), where he taught a course titled ""Reagan 101."" Reagan was elected in 1980 and left office in January of 1989. That means about 38% of the people in the United States were born after Reagan’s time in office ended, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. They and others may not know the finer points in the history of ""The Gipper,"" who was a movie star, president of the Screen Actors Guild and governor of California before ascending to the White House. That led us to take a look at a claim made by U.S. Senate hopeful Kevin Nicholson. Nicholson, a Delafield businessman and U.S. Marine veteran, was the first announced Republican challenger to Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the 2018 election. On Sept. 7, 2017, state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield also entered the GOP race. Nicholson was once president of the College Democrats of America and spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. He referenced his own political conversion -- and that of Reagan -- in an Aug. 6, 2017, interview on ""UpFront with Mike Gousha,"" the WISN-TV public affairs program.

""Ronald Reagan was a verified Democrat until his mid-50s, I think, potentially his late 50s,"" Nicholson told Gousha. ""It was the experiences that he saw, the things that he lived, things that he did that ended up making him the most influential conservative voice of modern America because he had seen the other side."" Let’s take a look at Nicholson’s claim about when Reagan switched parties. The Reagan library Reagan’s career in the public eye began in 1932, when he graduated from Eureka College and worked as a sports announcer for regional radio. He moved to Hollywood in 1937, where he starred in several films, including ""Knute Rockne, All American,"" ""Kings Row"" and ""Bedtime for Bonzo."" He had a long career with the Screen Actors Guild, the labor union for actors, serving as a board member and president in the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, he was an active Democrat, as evidenced by a 1948 radio broadcast of Reagan supporting Democrat Harry Truman for president and Hubert Humphrey for Minnesota senator posted on YouTube. Reagan was born Feb. 6, 1911, making him about 37 years old at the time of the broadcast. An Encyclopedia Britannica biography of Reagan mentions the 1948 radio broadcast on behalf of Democrats, but notes that his politics were gradually growing more conservative. After initially supporting Democratic senatorial candidate Helen Douglas in 1950, he switched his allegiance to Republican Richard Nixon midway through the campaign. Reagan supported Republican Dwight Eisenhower in the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956, and in 1960 he delivered 200 speeches in support of Nixon’s campaign for president against Democrat John F. Kennedy. He officially changed his party registration to Republican in 1962. He would have been 51 at the time. ""Reagan became a conservative, though, before he re-registered as a Republican,"" said Shirley. The foreword of Shirley's book ""Reagan Rising, The Decisive Years, 1976-1980"" notes the Reagan movement quickly spread, championed by emerging conservative leaders and influential think tanks. It’s worth noting that Nicholson is not the only Democrat-turned-Republican who has cited Reagan’s switch as a basis for his own. In August 2015, Donald Trump discussed Reagan's political history in a TV interview. ""It’s sort of easy to explain — now one of the things I always start with -- Ronald Reagan was a Democrat, and he was sort of liberal,"" Trump said in an interview that aired on Fox News’ ""Hannity"" program. ""And I knew him. I didn’t know him then, quite, but I knew him. And I knew him well. He liked me, I liked him. He was like this great guy. ""And he was a Democrat with a liberal bent, and he became a great conservative, in my opinion,"" he said. ""And a great president and a great leader. He had something very special. But if you think of it, he was a little less conservative, actually, than people think."" Our rating Nicholson said ""Reagan was a verified Democrat until his mid-50s."" The 40th president’s past an entertainer, labor union leader and politician is known to historians as well as many Americans of the baby boomer generation. His transition from Democrat to Republican is also well documented, with the formal party switch coming at age 51. (Though experts note he was becoming conservative before that point.)

John Thomaides, San Marcos mayor, says Austin region will outgrow all others to 2046
","San Marcos Mayor John Thomaides floated big numbers in a tweet suggesting the Austin area is on pace to outgrow all other places nationally in coming decades. ""Metro population will grow by 67 million people over the next 30 years,"" Thomaides wrote in June 2017. ""Austin metro will lead with population growth over 50%."" Watch out San Antonio and parts between, Austin's about to bulge worse than the perilous interstate that splits Texas. But hold on: We can’t fact-check whether predictions will come true. In this instance instead, we focused on whether Thomaides, who was elected mayor in 2016, had a solid factual basis for his claim about the Austin metropolitan area’s likely population. Mayor cites economist For starters, Thomaides told us by email that he jotted the information in his tweet while attending a panel discussion including economist Jim Diffley during the 2017 United States Conference of Mayors in Miami Beach. Diffley, who works for IHS Markit, a consulting firm that says it gives clients including governments and banks ""next-generation information, analytics and solutions,"" later confirmed that he’d delivered the numbers--including the firm’s expectation that from 2016 to 2046, metro regions nationally will gain 66 million added residents. Diffley emailed us a May 2017 IHS Markit report presenting the firm’s population-growth forecasts for metro areas coast to coast--including a chart in the report’s appendix stating that from 2016 to 2046, the five-county Austin-Round Rock area’s population will grow 87 percent--surging from 2,059,500 to 3,858,800. The five counties are Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell. That 87-percent forecast shouldn’t seem a shock. In 2014, we rated True a claim that the population of Austin alone had basically doubled every 25 years since its founding. Notably too, the report projects the greater Austin area will grow considerably more than what Thomaides said. As the report headed to print, Diffley told us by email, the firm acted on fresh U.S Census Bureau figures by reaching a new, slightly lower projected 2046 population for the Austin region of 3,780,000 residents, which it lately predicts would be up 83 percent from a new estimate of the region’s 2016 population, 2,064,000. Austin-Round Rock predicted to grow faster than every region? We kept our sights on the report behind Thomaides's claim. That report, we noticed, indicates the Austin area's population increasing far faster than other regions nationally--though not all other regions. Among big Texas metro areas, the report chart suggests the San Antonio area will grow 53 percent, from 2,431,700 residents to 3,727,100 people. Other big Texas metros and their projected 30-year growth rates: Dallas-Fort Worth, 57 percent; Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, 56 percent; McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, 59.8 percent; and El Paso, 30 percent. Nationally, the chart indicates, only three less-populous Florida metros will grow at a greater clip than the Austin area. Per the chart, The Villages will see 96.5 percent population growth, reaching 245,400 residents; Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island will see 88 percent population growth, reaching 694,300 residents; and Cape Coral-Fort Myers will experience 84 percent growth, becoming home to 1,339,000 people. We further inquired how the firm reached its regional projections. By phone, Karl Kuykendall, an IHS Markit regional economist, said that the company maintains econometric models for states and metro area that take into account historical growth including births, deaths and domestic migration--also factoring in economic determinants such as jobs and income changes. Kuykendall, noting the Austin region’s population about doubled from 1990 to 2010 in going from 856,000 to more than 1.7 million, said: ""Austin has been one of the fastest-growing areas over the last two to three decades."" And, he said, as long as key drivers drawing people to the region ""don’t fundamentally change, you can have a lot of confidence"" in its 2046 projections. He cited as factors the region’s ""highly educated"" workforce, attractive cultural amenities and its reputation as a hotbed for technology start-ups and expansions. Geographically too, Kuykendall said, ""there’s still a lot of room for growth."" Alternate growth scenarios We queried a pair of Austin experts on growth for takes on the IHS Markit projections. By email, Beverly Kerr of the Austin Chamber of Commerce called IHS Markit a solid source. ""I don’t think the projection that Austin will be at 3,858,800 by 2046 is too out there,"" Kerr said. Kerr otherwise noted that Ryan Robinson, the City of Austin demographer, has separately projected the Austin-Round Rock area having a 2045 population of more than 4.3 million, more than doubling an estimated 2 million residents in 2016, a forecast Robinson reaffirmed to our emailed inquiry. Kerr wrote that Robinson assumes the region’s rate of growth decreasing over time, which she said offers ""a reasonable middle ground between the aggressive and conservative versions of the state projections."" Kerr otherwise pointed out that the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, has said that assuming migration continues at the pace set in 2000-2010, the Austin-Round Rock metro area would be home to 4,651,780 people in 2046--for more than a doubling in residents. If that’s too aggressive an assumption, Kerr noted, the Potter-led Texas Demographic Center also provides a forecast of 3,081,305 residents in 2046, assuming a migration rate half the 2000-2010 rate. That would still be a 60 percent bump from this more conservative scenario’s estimate of 1,930,408 people living in the region in 2016. We also asked the census bureau about forecasts of regional population changes. By email, spokeswoman Virginia Hyer said the agency doesn’t produce metro-level population projections. Our ruling Thomaides said the Austin metro region ""will lead"" the nation ""with population growth over 50%"" over the next 30 years. That ""over 50%"" is actually an understatement, based on what experts including the Texas state demographer predict. And while the report behind the mayor’s claim showed Austin No. 1 in projected growth among similar-sized metro areas, less populous metro areas in Florida were projected to grow at even faster clips. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Bill Cassidy offers misleading defense in face-off with Jimmy Kimmel
","Following a sharp rebuke by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., hit the airwaves on Sept. 20 to defend his bill that would undo much of the Affordable Care Act. The bill, which Cassidy proposed with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was approaching Senate floor consideration when Kimmel took aim at the bill’s impact on some Americans’ ability to secure health insurance. Under the Graham-Cassidy bill, Cassidy said, ""More people will have coverage, and we protect those with pre-existing conditions. (In) states like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri, there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by by Obamacare."" We decided to take a closer look at the way Cassidy described the potential impact of his bill. We found that, according to the best available analysis, Cassidy is not fully accurate about the funding increase. The bill would establish a new ""block grant"" program for states, taking the place of funding currently provided under the Affordable Care Act. The current funding under the ACA is primarily in the form of subsidies for people who purchase plans on the ACA’s online marketplace, as well as an expansion of access to Medicaid. The bill’s approach holds the potential for state-level cuts in two ways. First, a block grant is a fixed amount of money, rather than a formula-based entitlement that continues paying even as the number of qualifying beneficiaries rises. So states might have to do more with less. Second, the bill does not authorize funding for the block grant beyond 2026. While Congress could choose to continue the funding at that point, there is no guarantee that it will. So that leaves a so-called fiscal ""cliff"" after which funding falls to zero, at least temporarily. Because the bill would enshrine complex formulas to determine the size of each state’s block grant, individual states would see differently sized block grants. Generally speaking, the formula is more generous to states that chose not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (most of which are Republican-leaning). By contrast, the states that did expand Medicaid (many of them Democratic-leaning) would tend to do less well under Graham-Cassidy, based on various analyses. And if nothing is done to extend funding beyond 2026, all states would feel the pinch. We would ordinarily turn to the independent Congressional Budget Office to assess this part of Cassidy’s statement like this, but the CBO has said that, given the Republican leadership’s rush to get the Graham-Cassidy bill to the floor, it will be unable to do a full analysis of the bill before the planned vote. (Senate Republicans’ ability to pass the measure with just 51 votes expires at the end of September, which is widely considered the reason for the rush.) However, on Sept. 20, an outside consulting group, Avalere Health, released an analysis it had conducted of the bill’s potential impact on the 50 states. Overall, the report concluded that the Graham-Cassidy bill ""would significantly reduce funding to states over the long term, particularly for states that have already expanded Medicaid,"" Caroline Pearson, Avalere’s senior vice president, wrote. It did find that in 16 states, funding would increase, at least as long as the block grants were funded. (The Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted that 15 of these 16 states with an increase voted for Donald Trump.) As it happens, the four states Cassidy mentioned don’t fare that well in Avalere’s analysis, even though all four decided against accepting the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, which should have been an indicator of a relatively benign funding outcome under the law. (In Florida's case, signups on the law's online marketplace have been widespread even as efforts to accept the Medicaid expansion have foundered.) The following chart summarizes Avalere’s projections for the states Cassidy mentioned, over three different time periods. The figures shaded red denote a decline. The figures shaded green denote an increase. As the chart shows, Florida and Maine would both suffer declines in the billions of dollars during all three periods studied. Virginia and Missouri, for their part, would either gain or hold steady through 2027, but would then see roughly 20 percent declines through 2036. If these projections are to be believed -- and it’s worth emphasizing that they are only projections by one policy group -- then the four states Cassidy cited would not necessarily see ""billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage"" under the Graham-Cassidy bill over the long term. And Florida and Maine in particular would see only decreases. Some viewers will take this comment by Cassidy as simply explaining the reality that Obamacare isn't reaching enough people in these states. Others will note that this reality has more to do with Republican opposition in the states than with the law itself. The Affordable Care Act did in fact provide insurance marketplaces to residents of all 50 states through its federal website -- almost 2.5 million people in Cassidy’s four states alone. In addition, the Affordable Care Act as passed would have expanded Medicaid in every state. When the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the expansion, many states, most of them with a Republican governor or legislature, decided to opt out of the expansion. The four states Cassidy cited were among those to reject an expansion. So, if Cassidy is trying to say that Obamacare is at fault for having ""passed by"" these states, he has it backwards. The Affordable Care Act sought to expand Medicaid in every state. In those states where it didn’t occur, it was because the state affirmatively chose not to accept the offer. ""Those states were not passed by"" by the law itself, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. Cassidy said that under his bill, in ""states like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri, there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by by Obamacare."" Two of those four states will see a temporary bump in funding before settling in for a longer-term decline, according to the Avalere study. But the other two states won’t ever see a funding increase under the bill, according to Avalere. Cassidy also glosses over the fact that these states chose to ignore the law’s offerings on their own. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/sep/20/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-offers-misleading-defense-face-jimmy-/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Comparing administrative costs for private insurance and Medicare
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said that switching to a single-payer ""Medicare for all"" health system would save billions of dollars in administrative costs. ""Private insurance companies in this country spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs,"" Sanders said on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sept. 17. ""The cost of administering the Medicare program, a very popular program that works well for our seniors, is 2 percent. We can save approximately $500 billion a year just in administration costs."" Administrative costs are the expenses incurred by medical insurers that are not strictly medical, such as marketing, customer service, billing, claims review, quality assurance, information technology and profits. Is the gap between private and public health insurance providers’ administrative costs really that high? Most experts agreed the numbers looked about right. But because of key differences between Medicare and private insurance, the trade-off isn’t as simple as Sanders suggests. First, we’ll break down the numbers. To measure the administrative costs for Medicare, we turned to the 2017 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds -- the document prepared by Medicare’s fiscal overseers. The trustees’ summary listed total Medicare expenditures of $678.7 billion for 2016, of which $9.2 billion was characterized as ""administrative expenses."" That works out to 1.4 percent, which is even lower than what Sanders stated. That covers salaries and expenses, patient outreach, and fraud and abuse control by the Health and Human Services, Justice Department and FBI, among other things. But because much of Medicare piggybacks off Social Security, other administrative costs such as enrollment, payment and keeping track of patients are left to the Social Security system. That’s one of multiple reasons using the current administrative costs for Medicare wouldn’t translate as cleanly if the entire population were to be covered. (Medicare serves those over age 65 currently; Sanders would like to see all Americans covered by a similar program.) Experts told us we could safely assume private insurance costs, on the other hand, are much higher, though actual spending estimates vary. Average insurers’ overhead costs are about 12.4 percent, according to an April 2017 Annals of Internal Medicine article by Steffie Woolhandler and David U. Himmelstein. A February report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research totaled overhead costs for private individual and employer based plans at 12.3 percent in 2015. And America’s Health Insurance Plans found that 17.8 cents of every premium dollar goes to operating costs. But those are averages looking across health care markets. When the Congressional Budget Office broke those costs down, they put administrative costs in the nongroup market at 20 percent, small-group market at 16 percent and the large-group market at 11 percent. Federal caps on administrative costs reflect this range. Group market insurers have a 15 percent cap and individual market insurers have a 20 percent cap. If exceeded, insurers have to pay a rebate to policyholders under the Affordable Care Act. The difference is still pretty substantial, though. Historically, administrative expenses were much higher in the commercial market because insurers did a lot of underwriting, or using the health status of individuals or groups to determine their premiums. The Affordable Care Act was designed to curb that spending. On top of that, experts explained that unlike Medicare, private insurers take on more responsibility than simply paying claims or occasionally going after fraud. Before a claim is even filed, they check its appropriateness, assess whether it is medically necessary, and whether it can be done in a cheaper way (outpatient versus inpatient care, for example). ""Medicare has been trying in fits and starts to look a little more closely at how it pays claims but generally speaking, it is passive in processing claims,"" Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. In addition, private insurers create provider networks, which is where they determine which doctors will offer which services under each plan and negotiate reimbursement rates. They also review which drugs will be most effective and affordable. ""Not all carriers are doing this effectively, well or thoughtfully, but when they do, it lowers the overall system costs,"" Corlette said. But a lot of administrative costs go to marketing, because private health insurers have to compete for clients. That’s something Medicare doesn’t have to deal with, and which wouldn’t be a problem with a similar universal health plan. That also explains why there’s more leeway in the individual market costs, as it’s more expensive to target a new individual customer than groups. Sanders cited Woolhandler and Himmelstein’s article estimating $504 billion in savings from converting to a single-payer system. But the article’s authors admitted that ""any such estimate is imprecise"" and cited other research placing the number closer to $383 billion. Experts say a single-payer system would save a substantial amount of administrative costs, but the right kind of administrative expenses may actually lead to cost savings and improved outcomes. Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, said using administrative costs as a share of spending, rarely done in other industries, isn’t a very useful measure of efficiency. Glied pointed out that private Medicare Advantage plans are ""pretty competitive with traditional Medicare,"" but also tend to operate at higher administrative costs. ""They bring costs down in other ways but they have to use administrative spending to do that,"" Glied said. Robert Book, a health economist at the right-leaning American Action Forum, also argued that expressing administrative costs as a percentage of overall spending on health care is misleading in the case of Medicare, as the overall health care costs will be inherently larger when dealing with the disabled and over-65 population, artificially deflating the amount spent on administering that care. Sanders said, ""Private insurance companies in this country spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs. The cost of administering the Medicare program, a very popular program that works well for our seniors, is 2 percent. We can save approximately $500 billion a year just in administration costs."" Government and independent researchers corroborate the percentage figures Sanders cited, but the researchers who came up with the $500 billion savings admitted that ""any such estimate is imprecise."" Also, the administrative costs of private insurance and Medicare cover different types of costs. Experts told us that a single-payer system for the United States would have lower administrative costs than today’s private insurance, but it likely wouldn’t be able to achieve administrative costs as low as the existing Medicare program. Finally, the figures are misleading because lowering administrative costs wouldn’t necessarily lower overall costs. In fact, administrative costs sometimes help make the delivery of health care more efficient.

NC Democrat says state's rivers are among the top 5 'most polluted'
","It’s one thing to say a couple of North Carolina’s rivers — the Neuse and the Cape Fear — are in danger of becoming very polluted. A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too.  It’s another thing to say what state Rep. William ""Billy"" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. ""There are 250,000 rivers in this country,"" Richardson said. ""Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina."" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America’s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this ""most polluted rivers"" list he alludes to? We’ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular.  This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river — and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill’s effects. But they’re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ’s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ’s leader says the department doesn’t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five ""most polluted"" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization’s annual ""America’s most endangered rivers"" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might’ve misspoke but that he ""cares deeply"" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks.  Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument – but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. ""My intention was not to mislead anyone,"" Richardson said. ""Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it’s clear we’ve got a huge issue that we’re not dealing with."" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their ""most endangered"" list shouldn’t be viewed as a ""most polluted"" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: ""This report is not a list of the nation’s 'worst' or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future."" ""The big difference between ’most polluted’ and ‘most endangered’ is that when we list a river as ‘most endangered’ it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,"" said Peter Raabe, the group’s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group’s ""most endangered"" report doesn’t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins ""have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,"" the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically ""partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers."" The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there’d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it’s difficult to determine which rivers are the ""most polluted"" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. ""There are so many things that ‘pollute’ our rivers — GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.,"" Raabe said. ""The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity."" Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. ""The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for,"" Raabe said.  Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn’t have a ""most polluted"" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted.  Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) ""does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers,"" spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Experts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with – including the Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA – echoed Raabe in saying it’s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted. Every two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports. ""Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends,"" Marraccini wrote in an email. Through Google searches, PolitiFact couldn’t find a comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that describes a North Carolina river as one of the ""top five most polluted."" Our ruling Richardson said that N.C. is home to two of the ""top five"" most-polluted rivers in the state. His assistant acknowledged that he might've misquoted the American Rivers ""most endangered"" list – but PolitiFact looked around to see if other data might support his claim. There’s evidence that the Neuse River and Cape Fear River, in particular, are threatened not only by waste from local farms but by a chemical that state regulators want to investigate. However, PolitiFact found no basis for Richardson’s claim that North Carolina rivers rank among the top five most polluted in the United States. We rate this claim false.  ",/factchecks/2017/sep/20/billy-richardson/nc-democrat-says-states-rivers-are-among-top-5-mos/

How strong has job growth been on Donald Trump's watch?
","While presidential speeches to the United Nations usually focus on foreign policy, President Donald Trump began his by touting domestic accomplishments on his watch. ""Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last Nov. 8,"" he said while addressing the General Assembly on Sept. 19, 2017. ""The stock market is at an all-time high, a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time."" We decided to check his assertion that ""companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time."" We found that Trump exaggerated the job growth (it's not unprecedented), but there is some truth to his point about companies moving back to the country. The most obvious way to look at this claim is to look at recent job growth rates. So we looked up month-to-month increases in jobs since 2011 -- the point at which the national economy started gaining jobs consistently after the Great Recession. The monthly gains in red -- those since Trump became president -- don’t look much different from the types of gains seen under President Barack Obama starting in 2011. The highest monthly job gain under Trump -- 232,000 -- was exceeded in 28 separate months on Obama’s watch. Next, we looked at the specific job gains under Trump from February 2017 to August 2017. We compared that period to the February-to-August job gains under Obama between 2011 and 2016. Here’s what we found: This chart shows that the job gains under Trump were actually lower than each of the last six years of February-to-August job gains for Obama, except for one year -- 2012. This shouldn’t suggest that the pace of job creation this year is a disappointment. While one would expect big job gains in the immediate aftermath of a major recession as the economy catches up, seeing substantial gains this many years after the recession officially ended is far from guaranteed. In reality, August 2017 represented the 83rd successive month of month-to-month job gains -- easily a record. The longest previous spell of positive increases in monthly payroll employment was 48, in the period ending in June 1990, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""It is surprising how long (strong job growth) has continued,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. At the same time, she added, ""it's also disappointing that the gain in jobs hasn't also been accompanied by strong wages and productivity growth."" Another way of looking a Trump’s statement is not in terms of record overall job growth, but specifically about jobs created by companies moving their operations to the United States. Here, he has a stronger point. A group called the Reshoring Initiative has been collecting data since 2010 on ""reshoring"" -- a combination of U.S. firms bringing jobs back to the U.S., and foreign companies deciding to locate jobs here. Publicly, the group released data in May 2017 showing that ""for the first time in decades, more manufacturing jobs are returning to the United States than are going offshore."" Specifically, the group found a record-high 77,000 reshored jobs in 2016, bringing the total since 2010 to 338,000. Those gains, of course, took place under Barack Obama. But while the group hasn’t officially published data covering the period since Trump took office, we asked the group for their latest data, covering Trump’s time in office. According to the group, reshoring started going up substantially beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and has accelerated in 2017. Between 2013 and 2015, the average number of reshored jobs announced per quarter was about 17,000, Harry C. Moser, the Kildeer, Ill., group’s founder and president, told PolitiFact. Then, during the first three quarters of 2016, that number fell to an average of 12,000. Then it picked up. In the fourth quarter of 2016, it almost doubled to 22,000. In the first quarter of 2017, it almost doubled again to 40,000. And the preliminary number for the second quarter of 2017 is even higher, at 50,000. When we asked Moser if he had an explanation for such increases, he offered two, based on his discussions with company executives. One is a more favorable exchange rate for the U.S. dollar. The other is the expectation among businesses that Trump would cut taxes and regulation, and that he might erect tariffs or otherwise punish goods produced overseas. ""You can never be sure, but in my professional opinion, a significant portion of the increase comes from the expectation of good things (from Trump) and a fear of bad things (from him),"" Moser said. The corollary, he added, is that if Trump fails to deliver on these promises, those reshored jobs could evaporate. As we noted, these numbers haven’t been publicly released. So did Trump just happen to guess correctly in this case? Maybe not. Moser said he’d sent this data to the White House ""through different channels, such as congressmen and semi-confidants, about eight times."" So the reshoring data could have been what Trump was referring to. But the White House didn’t confirm to us that this is the interpretation he’d intended. A final point. When checking statements like this, we usually note that presidential actions do not necessarily have much of an impact on job numbers, which are often driven by broader factors, such as international economic conditions and technological change. However, in this case, an independent source has indicated that Trump’s promises -- rather than actual policies he delivered -- are what drove the companies to locate jobs in the United States. So for the purposes of judging this claim, it’s not unreasonable to say that Trump deserves some credit. Trump said, ""Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time."" Overall, job growth is strong, particularly this long after the recession, but the gains are not much different (and maybe a little worse) than they were during the last six years of Obama’s tenure. However, there is evidence that the number of jobs specifically caused by ""companies moving back"" has increased under Trump, and one reason for this may be Trump’s promises, both of the carrot and stick variety. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2017/sep/20/donald-trump/how-strong-job-growth-been-trumps-watch/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Rauner's right: Illinois budget balancing act an ongoing production
","Illinois’ record budget standoff ended July 6 with legislative Democrats, joined by a handful of Republicans, approving a $36 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that began July 1, which is underpinned by a 32 percent hike in the state income tax rate. Enactment came July 6 over the objections of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who two days earlier had vetoed the budget. ""Even with the (House Speaker Michael) Madigan permanent 32% income tax increase, this budget remains $2 billion out of balance for fiscal year 2018,"" Rauner wrote in his July 4 veto statement. More than two months later -- after a summer in which tension over school funding made the budget debate seem a faint and distant memory -- Rauner has revived his claim that the Legislature has placed the state on a path to fiscal doom. ""Even with a permanent income tax increase costing the average Illinois household more than $1,000 a year, the budget is more than $1 billion out of balance…,"" Rauner said in a Sept. 7 press release. However, his office cautions not to read too much into the downward revision of the unbalanced budget claim from $2 billion in July to $1 billion now. The difference, the administration says, is due to technical reasons and doesn’t mean the budget is in better shape than the governor originally asserted. The not-so-subtle subtext of Rauner’s claims in both his July veto message and his renewed criticism is that Democrats significantly jacked up taxes to impose a woefully deficient budget. Unpacking the governor’s argument requires a trip into the weeds of budget minutia, not to mention a detour into political hypocrisy. When it comes to budgeting, Rauner has been clearly guilty of some of the same sins he is now complaining about. But being inconsistent and being wrong aren’t necessarily the same thing. Is Rauner correct that the General Assembly has produced a budget deeply in the red? We took a look at the numbers. The Illinois Constitution defines a budget as balanced when spending doesn’t exceed ""funds estimated to be available for the fiscal year."" But ""estimated"" has given politicians license to stretch or shrink their definition of ""balanced"" to suit their needs. The Civic Federation, a Chicago-based government fiscal watchdog, noted in a Sept. 7 analysis that the budget as passed on July 6 -- which contained a $360 million operating surplus -- met the textbook definition of ""balanced."" ""On paper, the budget enacted by the General Assembly on July 7 — in an override of another gubernatorial veto — has a modest surplus,"" noted the federation’s Institute for Illinois’ Fiscal Sustainability. But the budget is ""built on assumptions"" and making it work will depend on whether Rauner and the General Assembly can ""make those assumptions hold up,"" said Civic Federation President Laurence Msall. Governor and ILGA should work together to create credibility of State’s FY2018 surplus for borrowing plan to proceed https://t.co/thNHqFGLBK Two of those assumptions form the bulk of Rauner’s claim that the budget is in the red by more than $1 billion. The first involves a Rauner-driven change in state pension options that Democrats came to embrace. Referred to as ""Tier 3,"" it gives state workers a choice to divert some of their traditional benefits into a 401(k) style savings plan. The budget enacted over Rauner’s veto projects Tier 3 will save $500 million this fiscal year. But Rauner spokesman Jason Schaumburg said savings from this plan won’t happen during this budget year. And Illinois Teachers Retirement System Executive Director Dick Ingram told the Better Government Association that TRS anticipates an effective date of July 1, 2019, for the new plan. That means savings won’t show up until FY 2020. This validates a significant part of Rauner’s ""out of balance"" claim, but the irony here can’t go unmentioned. The $500 million savings figure in the current budget came from an estimate originally presented in Rauner’s ill-fated budget proposal from last February. That budget also contained $4.6 billion in phantom money identified only as ""Working together on ‘grand bargain.’"" And it was hardly the only time Rauner has pushed a budget full of the same sort of holes he now condemns. The first budget Rauner proposed in 2015 anticipated $2.2 billion in savings from a sweeping overhaul of pensions that at the time was of questionable constitutionality and was soon rendered invalid by the Illinois Supreme Court. The Sept. 7 press release in which Rauner made his claim about the budget imbalance also announced that the state would issue $6 billion in bonds to pay down part of the $16 billion bill backlog that accrued during the budget impasse of 2015-2017. The Illinois Comptroller’s Office said at the end of FY 2017 that the state was paying late payment penalties of 9 and 12 percent on $5.5 billion contained in the backlog. This costs the state about $2 million a day, according to the comptroller. By borrowing, the state can lower that rate by up to half while also getting payment quickly to creditors. Thus, the budget enacted in July contained a provision empowering the governor’s office to borrow up to $6 billion for this purpose. But as the Civic Federation noted, ""the small projected budget surplus was estimated to support only $3 billion in borrowing capacity."" Rauner was more pointed in his press release: ""(A) $6 billion issuance would require 12 annual principal payments of $500 million, plus interest payments depending on the interest rate. The legislature-passed budget did not account for the increase in debt service costs to cover the bill backlog bond issuance."" Schaumburg put the total figure at $600 million annually, which roughly squares with the Civic Federation’s statement. ""The governor's office is identifying several hundred million dollars in possible spending reductions to address this budgetary shortfall,"" Rauner’s press release said. ""The governor also would like the General Assembly to return to Springfield this fall to work with him to balance the budget and enact structural reforms that could save much more."" But one of the budget’s chief architects, Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago, said Rauner is trying to make a crisis from what should be a source of fiscal relief. Though the budget gives the governor’s budget office the authority to borrow up to $6 billion, Rauner need not do it all at once. If the administration borrows $3 billion and uses it to pay down outstanding Medicaid bills, it will get $3 billion in matching funds from the federal government that can go toward paying down the backlog, Harris said. ""A huge portion of the bills are Medicaid,"" Harris said. ""That’s money that’s just sitting there."" Medicaid bills make up $4.1 billion of the $16 billion backlog, according to the Illinois Comptroller’s Office. But an even bigger chunk of the backlog comes from bills owed to providers in the State Employee Group Insurance Program. In its May monthly report, the General Assembly’s Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability said the state owed $4.65 billion in group health insurance payments plus $462 million in late fees. The comptroller’s office now estimates group health insurance costs make up $5.1 billion of the total backlog. The Civic Federation report also emphasizes that the $360 million surplus claimed in the budget (and disputed by Rauner) is fragile at best. It is built in large part on proceeds of $240 million from the sale of the James R. Thompson Center in Chicago. The sale of the 17-story behemoth in the heart of Chicago’s Loop has been stymied by political fighting ever since Rauner first proposed it in October 2015. ""The (budget) surplus could be reduced if it takes longer than expected to find a buyer or if the structure is sold for less than the projected price,"" the report says. Rauner’s office also complains that new revenue projections provided in August by the Illinois Department of Revenue to the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget show more trouble ahead. ""The General Assembly’s budget was based on an earlier revenue projection from April, but FY17 revenues continued to underperform for the remainder of FY17,"" Schaumburg said. ""As a result, the GOMB estimate is $500 million lower than the General Assembly’s FY18 revenue estimate."" This argument, however, ignores the budget-making calendar in the Illinois Constitution, which puts a May 31 deadline on passing a budget with a simple majority in the Legislature. The tone of Rauner’s news release makes clear that there will be tension in Springfield in the months to come as lawmakers work to, as Msall puts it, make the budget’s assumptions hold up. This is not an unfamiliar position for Rauner and the Legislature, even though for the entirety of Rauner’s term they have yet to agree on a full budget. In March 2015, state government faced the prospect of running out of money unless the governor and lawmakers closed a gap of $1.6 billion. Working together, Rauner and the Legislature hammered out a solution that appeared, briefly, to signal good things for future bipartisan cooperation. Then as now, the effort involved salvaging an existing budget. That’s a departure from the two fiscal years in between, when government operating without any budget controls ran up the $16 billion bill backlog. Gov. Bruce Rauner said Illinois’ current operating budget is ""is more than $1 billion out of balance…"" The head of the Illinois Teachers Retirement System confirms Rauner’s claim that the new pension plan expected to generate $500 million in anticipated savings won’t be enacted during the current fiscal year (or even the next one). The Civic Federation reports that the small surplus in the budget will finance only $3 billion of the $6 billion Rauner plans to borrow. But putting $3 billion toward past-due Medicaid bills would generate $3 billion in federal matching funds -- something Rauner has not discussed. Failure to sell or get the expected price for the Thompson Center are possible scenarios that could further imperil the budget. Some of the assumptions identified as sources of the trouble originated in Rauner’s own budget, a fact that Rauner does not acknowledge and that needs to be considered here. Whether or not the imbalance reaches more than $1 billion is debatable, but Rauner is correct that there remains much work to do. We rate his statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2017/sep/20/bruce-rauner/rauners-right-illinois-budget-balancing-act-ongoin/

Vermont single-payer was scrapped because it was going bankrupt? No, it was never implemented
","Perturbed by technical difficulties during his Facebook Live town hall on Sept. 14, 2017, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy blamed ""bad government wi-fi."" But for the most part the video stream allowed the Wisconsin Republican to answer viewers’ questions. One asked his opinion of a national single-payer health care plan introduced the previous day by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. The proposal is prominently supported by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. Duffy panned it, saying: The single-payer program was tried in Vermont, where Bernie Sanders is from. They had to scrap it, it was way too much money, they were going bankrupt. It turns out Vermont was the first state to adopt single-payer legislation. But the program wasn’t going bankrupt when it was abandoned. It couldn’t. It had never been implemented at all. What single-payer is, what is its appeal Generally speaking under single-payer, everyone, or at least most people, would get health coverage from the federal government (the single payer) and it would pay all the bills. Details can vary, of course. For example, Sanders’ national proposal would eliminate nearly all private insurance. Single-payer hasn’t necessarily enjoyed widespread support. In 2014, during an interview on Milwaukee radio, four-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader said most Americans ""since Harry Truman days"" have supported single-payer health insurance. Our rating was False. There were individual poll results dating back to 1945 indicating majority support, but overall the results were mixed, at best. One issue is cost. As PolitiFact National reported, Sanders has pegged the cost of his national single-payer plan -- ""no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies"" -- at $1.38 trillion per year. Other estimates are as much as double that amount. But all of that involves single-payer at the national level. Getting back to Duffy, what happened in Sanders’ home state? The Vermont experience Vermont adopted single-payer legislation in 2011. It required then-Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, to submit a detailed financial plan by 2013. But the plan was abandoned in 2014 without ever being implemented, or even funded. Even the two news articles Duffy’s office cited to back up his statement make that clear. 1. The introduction to a National Public Radio piece that aired the day before Duffy’s statement explains it was about ""why Vermont was unable to establish a single-payer health care system."" Linda Blumberg, an Urban Institute health insurance and health reform expert, told NPR that leaders in Vermont determined the taxes needed ""would not be politically palatable."" 2. A December 2014 Politico article said that when Shumlin, who was first elected in 2010 after running on single-payer, pulled the plug he ""admitted what critics had said all along: He couldn’t pay for it."" We found similar reports. The Daily Beast said Shumlin dropped single-payer after an estimate said it would cost $4.3 billion a year, almost the size of the state’s entire $4.9 billion budget. The Washington Post reported that Shumlin said he could not ""responsibly support"" an 11.5 percent payroll tax hike on all Vermont businesses and an income tax hike of up to 9.5 percent that his administration said would be required. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, Harvard University practice of public health professor John McDonough pointed out that the decision to drop single-payer was as much about politics as finances. While studies showed the taxes would have been high, they also showed that the plan was economically viable (as the Cornell Policy Review also noted). But when Shumlin barely was re-elected in 2014, as McDonough put it, ""a clear public mandate for his health care agenda was nowhere in evidence."" So, it’s clear that cost was cited as the reason Vermont did not implement single-payer, even though it was predicted that the tax revenue would have made the program viable. That’s not the same as single-payer being in place and then dumped because it was heading for bankruptcy. In fact, no one knows how single-payer in Vermont would have performed had it been put in place. Our rating Duffy said Vermont had to ""scrap"" its single-payer health insurance program because it was ""going bankrupt."" Vermont adopted legislation for single-payer in 2011. But by 2014, Vermont’s governor abandoned the plan, saying the tax increases it needed would have been too high. In short, single-payer in Vermont didn’t go bankrupt; it was never even funded or implemented.

Do three-quarters of Americans support the DREAM Act? Nancy Pelosi says so
","Though she’s in the minority in the Republican-controlled Congress, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gained newfound clout last week in shaping the nation’s immigration policy. She and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced they’d reached a deal with President Trump on protecting the Dreamers. The Dreamers are the 800,000 young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children and temporarily shielded from deportation under the Obama-era DACA program. About one quarter live in California. This week, Pelosi claimed three-quarters of Americans support what she described as the legislative solution for safeguarding Dreamers from deportation: the DREAM Act. First introduced in 2001, the DREAM Act is a bipartisan bill that would offer protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children as long as they meet certain requirements. It would also include a path to citizenship for those who graduate from U.S. high schools and attend college, enter the workforce, or enlist in a military program. Pelosi made her claim during a speech Sept. 18, 2017 at Sacramento State University: ""Seventy-six percent of the American people support us passing the DREAM Act … with citizenship and legalization as part of it all. … More than 60 percent of Republicans support that."" We interpreted the second portion of her statement, about citizenship and legalization, to mean Americans are comfortable with one or the other option, particularly for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Given the heated debate around immigration, we wanted to know whether such a large share of Americans really support the DREAM Act, or at least the key provisions of the bill. We set out on a fact check. Our research As evidence for the claim, Pelosi’s spokesman pointed to a Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted Aug. 31 through Sept. 3, 2017. The poll includes responses from nearly 2,000 registered voters. The questions didn’t mention the DREAM Act specifically, but instead asked about the main thrust of the legislation. Here’s the question that got the closest: ""As you may know, Dreamers are young people who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children, often with their parents. Which of the following do you think is the best way to handle Dreamers?"" • 58 percent said Dreamers ""should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they meet certain requirements."" • 18 percent said Dreamers ""should be allowed to stay and become legal residents, but NOT citizens, if they meet certain requirements."" Combined, this totals the 76 percent Pelosi cited. Backing up her point about Republican support, the poll found 69 percent of Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats surveyed favored one of these two options. Other polling The late August poll backs up Pelosi’s claim. But we wanted to know whether other polls had asked similar questions and whether they told a different story. Kathleen Frankovic, a leading expert on public opinion polling, told us there haven’t been many recent surveys specifically on the DREAM Act. The new version of the bill was only introduced in July 2017. She said in an email that other polling has shown ""general support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants."" She cited a September 2017 poll by The Economist/YouGov in which 69 percent favored either a path to citizenship or legal status when asked ""Which comes closest to your view about illegal immigrants who are living in the U.S.?"" The question did not specifically ask about Dreamers. Frankovic cautioned: ""Since wording can affect answers on this subject, politicians can pick and choose the numbers they want to cite, the ones that make the strongest case for their position."" A question in a CNN/ORC poll from March 2017 offers a more detailed description of the type of immigrant that should be considered for legal status. It results in a higher favorability rating. Respondents were asked: ""Now, thinking about how the U.S. government should treat illegal immigrants who have been in this country for a number of years, hold a job, speak English and are willing to pay any back taxes that they owe. Would you favor or oppose a bill that allowed those immigrants to stay in this country rather than being deported and eventually allow them to apply for U.S. citizenship? Ninety percent said they favored such a bill. Gallup polls Three Gallup polls in recent years show increasing support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. • A December 2010 Gallup poll found 54 percent of Americans, at that time, supported allowing ""illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to gain legal resident status if they join the military or go to college."" It found 66 percent of Democrats favored it, while only 34 percent of Republicans backed the idea. • A July 2015 Gallup poll found 65 percent of U.S. adults favored a plan to allow immigrants who were living illegally in the U.S. to remain in the country and become citizens if they met certain requirements over time. • One year later, a July 2016 Gallup poll, found 84 percent of U.S. adults favored that idea. Looking at the parties, 91 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Republicans supported it. • A previous Politico/Morning Consult poll from April 2017, found 78 percent of respondents backed the idea of a path to citizenship or legal status under certain requirements. • Explaining his desire to find a legislative solution, President Trump claimed in September 2017 that 92 percent of Americans ""agree on DACA,"" the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. PolitiFact national examined support for the temporary protection program and found high favorability ratings, but not as high as 92 percent. It rated Trump’s claim Half True. Our rating Rep. Nancy Pelosi recently said 76 percent of ""the American people support us passing the DREAM Act … with citizenship and legalization as part of it all. … More than 60 percent of Republicans support that."" We interpreted the second part of her claim to mean three-quarters of Americans support either a path to citizenship or legal status, particularly for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. A September 2017 poll by Politico/Morning Consult backs up these figures, as does an April 2017 poll by the same group. Gallup polls from recent years show increasing support for the key points of the DREAM Act, ranging from 54 percent in 2010 to 65 percent in 2015 to 84 percent in 2016. Additional surveys show about two-thirds to three-quarters of respondents have backed a path to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally, under certain conditions. Pelosi’s claim is backed up by the polling. We rate it True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Rick Santorum says Social Security cost-of-living adjustments should be based on consumer prices, not wages
","
During an interview on the June 12, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum proposed a reform of Social Security.

The host, David Gregory, asked Santorum, ""On Social Security, would you raise the retirement age?""

Santorum -- a former two-term U.S. senator from Pennsylvania -- responded, ""I proposed that back in 1994. I think that's an option that has to be on the table. I think the one thing that we should do is to deal with the cost of living increase. The cost -- I asked a senior everywhere I go, Iowa, New Hampshire, I say, ‘Should we -- what should the cost of living increase be tied to?’ And the answer is always, ‘Well, it should be tied to the prices that we pay for goods and services.’ Well, it's not. The cost of living increase in Social Security is tied to wage inflation. Why is this? Why, why, what does that have to do with cost of living for seniors?

Answering his own question, Santorum said, ""It doesn't. And so what we need to do is change it from a wage inflation index to a price inflation index. If we do that, you solve anywhere from half to three-quarters of the [shortage] in Social Security over time. So that's one thing we can do. We can do it now. We'll have minimal, minimal effect on anybody at or near retirement, but long-term it creates sustainability for young people who are sitting out there who don't believe Social Security is going to be there for them.""

A reader asked us to check Santorum’s claim, so we did.

The short answer is that Santorum is wrong that ""the cost of living increase in Social Security is tied to wage inflation."" The long answer is a little more complicated.

Since 1975, Social Security has provided automatic annual cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, to its beneficiaries. These COLAs are determined by a federal statistic called the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. (If there is no inflation, or falling prices, there’s also no COLA, as is the case this year.)

CPI-W is a subset of the more familiar inflation statistic known as CPI-U. But both measures are similar, in that they represent ""the buying habits of the residents of urban or metropolitan areas in the United States"" through calculating the changes in prices for a fixed ""basket"" of goods. The consumer products used to calculate the two statistics are the same, with the difference coming only from the weighting used to average together the raw data.

It’s important to note that despite the inclusion of ""wage"" in the statistic’s name, it is not a measurement of wages. It is a measurement of how fast prices are rising for a collection of consumer goods.

""‘Cost-of-living increase’ has a precise meaning, and the increase is definitely not tied to wages, so his answer is clearly false,"" said Paul Van de Water, an economist with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

But even if his description on Meet the Press was inaccurate, Santorum didn’t get the wage inflation-vs.-consumer product inflation idea from nowhere. The experts we spoke to believed that Santorum had essentially garbled his message.

Unlike annual COLAs once you’re in the Social Security system, the initial benefit you receive is indeed determined by an index of wage inflation.

Santorum ""was probably intending to talk about proposals for slowing the growth of initial Social Security benefits,"" Van de Water said. ""At present, benefits for one year’s cohort of new retirees compared to the previous year’s cohort grows roughly in line with average wages, and proposals have been made to slow the growth of initial benefits by tying it to prices instead of wages.""

The program could trim costs this way because wages tend to grow at a rate roughly one percentage point faster than prices, said Michael Tanner, a retirement-security specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute.

""Such a change would hold future Social Security benefits constant in real terms but would eliminate the benefit escalation that is built into the current formula,"" Tanner said. ""Estimates suggest that making this change alone would result in a 35 percent reduction in Social Security’s currently scheduled level of benefits, bringing the system into balance by 2050. Variations on this approach would apply the formula change only to higher income seniors, preserving the current wage-indexed formula for low-income seniors."" Still, it is different from proposals to change COLAs -- the idea that Santorum seemed to be suggesting on Meet the Press.

There’s another wrinkle to mention as well. When Santorum reports hearing seniors complaining about COLAs not being tied to ""the prices that we pay for goods and services,"" it echoes a different ongoing debate.

Some have suggested that a statisticians could create a more appropriate COLA measure by measuring inflation using a basket of consumer products more like those that elderly people purchase on a regular basis, said David John, a Social Security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

In fact, in 1987, Congress ordered the Bureau of Labor Statistics to create an experimental measurement called the CPI-E (the ""E"" is for elderly) to see whether it might be a better tool for adjusting payouts under Social Security. CPI-E differs from the other inflation measures by giving certain items more or less weight, based on their importance to the typical senior citizen's budget. For instance it gives more weight to medical costs. John said he expects that using CPI-E might be more accurate. But it would also add to the program’s cost, potentially shortening the actuarial health of the program by five years, according to a paper published by the New York Federal Reserve Board.

Henry Aaron, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said internal details about how Social Security works ""is complicated stuff, and almost no one other than a small cadre of Social Security buffs understands it. Santorum clearly does not.""

When we contacted Santorum’s camp, they sent us a statement that sought to ""clarify"" what he had said.

""He was not referring to the COLA that we typically think of for Social Security,"" the statement said. ""Under current law -- ‘wage indexing’ -- benefits rise so that the ratio of benefits to pre-retirement earnings -- the ‘replacement rate’ -- stays constant. Sen. Santorum would argue that we need to move to ‘price indexing,’ where the benefit stays constant in real terms but the replacement rate falls. There are several proposals already on the table to do just this, and they would solve between 30 percent and 100 percent of the solvency issues facing Social Security.""

Santorum’s statement to PolitiFact explains what he was trying to say, but we make our ruling based on the initial statement, since that’s what viewers saw.

In this case, Santorum’s original statement -- that ""the cost of living increase in Social Security is tied to wage inflation"" -- is flat wrong. It’s not, because COLAs for existing beneficiaries are based on price increases for consumer goods. So despite Santorum’s subsequent clarification, we rate his comment False.",/factchecks/2011/jun/15/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-social-security-cost-living-adj/

Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce says protesters “attacked” their headquarters with “graffiti on the sidewalk” and more
","
With the Legislature poised to approve the state’s budget, protests are flaring up once again in Madison.

Protesters have set up a tent city dubbed ""Walkerville"" near the Capitol, and the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the statewide teachers union, has urged its members to return to Madison to rally against Gov. Scott Walker's two-year budget proposal. Administration Secretary Michael Huebsch said security has been tightened at the Capitol in preparation for the crowds.

It is a reprise of sorts.

In February and March of 2011, tens of thousands of protesters rallied around the Capitol to fight Republican efforts to curtail collective bargaining by public employees.

As the week opened, the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, issued a news release on Monday, June 13, 2011, saying its headquarters had been vandalized. The building was the site of an already announced protest at noon that day.

The release stated: ""State budget protesters attacked the headquarters of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce over the weekend with pro-tax-hike graffiti on the sidewalk, and stenciled images of fists and Governor Scott Walker smeared on the building and statue.""

That came under a headline of ""Pro-Tax budget Protesters Vandalize WMC HQ."" The subhead:  ""Graffiti strewn on Building, Sidewalk, Statue.""

The group filed a report with Madison Police and posted pictures on its website.

This is not the first claim related to the nature of the protests, or even related to damage to property. In fact, some of them have left us feeling like insurance adjusters.

There was the claim by Huebsch, and Department of Administration officials, that protesters caused $7.5 million damage to the Capitol. We rated it Pants on Fire. (The estimates were quickly revised to be much, much less.)

Likewise the claim from state Democrats that officials bolted the windows of the building shut in order to rein in protesters. (The windows were re-secured after sustaining damage.)

And the one from Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse) that protesters damaged the windshield of his car. (Madison police said it was likely due to a highway pebble.)

So what about the latest claim, of the WMC headquarters being attacked by vandals?

Let’s start with some definitions of ""vandalized"": 
Similarly, the definitions of the word ""attacked"" all include an element of violence.

After looking into the incident, the Madison police concluded it was no big deal.

The message written on the walkways around the building were in chalk, and ""mud stenciling"" was used for the fists and Walker pictures.

""There’s no permanent damage,"" said department spokesman Howard Payne.

The officer who investigated noted that the chalk and stencil material ""was flaking off when she touched it,"" Payne said.

If the stenciling had used spray paint or permanent markers, a report would have been filed with the city agency handling graffiti-removal. No report was filed.

We asked WMC about their claim.

""It’s vandalism,"" said Jim Pugh, the group’s public relations director. ""You can’t come onto private property and paint the building.""

Pugh, however, acknowledged there was no permanent damage and said a crew was out cleaning the messages off the building and sidewalk that very afternoon.

Additionally, the WMC press release was changed on the group’s website after our inquiry. Removed: The subhead about ""Graffiti strewn on Building, Sidewalk, Statue.""
So where does this leave us?

With the budget vote coming up and protesters back in Madison, concern about their conduct has returned. When the headquarters of the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce got hit with sidewalk chalk and easily removed stencils, the group labeled it a vandalism attack on its headquarters. That’s over the top and over-heated. And it leaves a distorted impression of what happened.

"['Ohio', 'Public Safety', 'Unions', 'Steve Loomis']","
Union President Steve Loomis says Ohio's new labor law effectively eliminates collective bargaining for police unions
","
Organized labor groups and Democrats started a campaign to repeal Ohio Senate Bill 5 as soon as Republican Gov. John Kasich signed it on March 31. They hope to have the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot.

SB 5 is designed to give public employers more control over labor contracts to deal with declining revenue. 

Sharply reducing collective bargaining for public workers, the new law gives management a strong hand at the bargaining table because it eliminates binding arbitration in favor of a system that is weighted toward local governments.

The replacement of binding arbitration has been a cornerstone issue for Republicans. Kasich made it a priority of his administration, arguing that public unions are too powerful at the bargaining table and that taxpayers had no say in costly labor contracts.

Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association President Steve Loomis and other labor leaders rallying for repeal said the new law effectively eliminates the ability of unions to negotiate at all.

In fact, SB 5 explicitly gives police and fire unions the right to collectively bargain for wages and safety equipment. PolitiFact Ohio asked Loomis to explain.

""He (Kasich) is not taking away our right to sit at the table,"" he said. ""He is taking away the right to collectively bargain.

""As it stands right now, both sides negotiate to an end or to a neutrally agreed upon position. If we come to an impasse, we solicit a professional arbitrator, usually American (Arbitration Association).""

The neutral, third-party arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement, Loomis said, and is empowered to impose a contract settlement.

Under SB 5, if a union and governmental body cannot agree on a contract, a fact-finder from the State Employment Relations Board must be appointed to make recommendations. If the union and management reject the recommendations, the legislative body that oversees the workers, such as a city council, must vote to choose between the ""last, best"" offers of the workers and management.

If the council does not act, the management offer becomes the new contract. And if council approves the higher-cost offer, there is a procedure by which both offers can be placed on the ballot to let voters choose.

""There's no more neutrality,"" Loomis said. ""One party gets to decide the outcome. The city council -- the people that we are negotiating with -- gets to decide whether the fact-finder's report is acceptable or not. If they decide it's acceptable, then we're done. If they decide it's unacceptable, then we go to arbitration. Who are the arbitrators? City council. So there is no collective bargaining here.

""When you listen to the governor and he talks about 'I've given them the tools to control their costs,' that's exactly what he's talking about. He means 'I've given them the ability to create their own contracts by unfair arbitration.' ""

The new process is, in fact, heavily weighted by design for local officials and government bodies -- and for taxpayers, say SB 5 supporters such as Rep. Louis Blessing, a Cincinnati Republican.

Under binding arbitration, ""an unelected arbitrator can force a spending decision on local officials and the people they represent,"" he said. ""There is no consent of the governed.""

Safety forces were given binding arbitration as part of Ohio's 1983 collective-bargaining law for public employees. In what was considered a trade-off, that law banned strikes by police and firefighters.

In an interview, Senate President Tom Niehaus was asked what leverage or recourse would be left for safety forces without binding arbitration.

""They're still going to have civil-service protections,"" he told The Columbus Dispatch.

Sen. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, one of six Republicans who voted against SB 5, said it imposes a ""fundamentally rigged process"" giving managers an unfair advantage over safety workers.

""There is no collective bargaining process (with Senate Bill 5),"" said another of the six, Sen. Tim Grendell of Chesterland. ""Senate Bill 5 replaces public worker collective bargaining with public worker collective begging ... Under Senate Bill 5, we lose the ability to bargain.""

So there is accuracy in Loomis statement. Even some top Republican legislators would agree with him. SB 5 does greatly reduce safety force workers’ collective bargaining abilities and gives management the last word on which offer is chosen.

But that last word kicks in if the two sides can’t agree on a contract. Safety forces do still have the ability to try to negotiate terms on wages and safety equipment. That’s a point of clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Loomis' statement rates as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/15/steve-loomis/union-president-steve-loomis-says-ohios-new-labor-/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Chris Christie']","
Gov. Chris Christie says graduation rate is 29 percent for new high schoolers in Newark
","
Gov. Chris Christie recently cited Newark as an example of the problem with New Jersey’s public school system, slapping a bulls-eye on the city’s high school graduation rate.

""So let’s talk about Newark for a second, our largest city, little over 275,000 citizens, a school district of about 70 schools, where we spend on average $24,500 per pupil per year. And for a young man or woman who is entering the ninth grade in Newark this year, they have a 29 percent graduation rate. Twenty-nine percent graduation rate,"" Christie said in a speech at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

Christie also used that number at a town hall meeting on April 19 in Jackson while discussing school funding for poor districts.

PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check if Newark’s graduation rate is as low as the governor claims.

First, let’s put the debate over graduation rates in context. The rates can vary wildly because of differences in calculation.

""This is one of the most controversial and confusing areas in education … there is a great need to quiet the debate and have uniform measure,"" said Jack Jennings, president of the nonpartisan Center on Education Policy in Washington, D.C. ""Otherwise, people cherry-pick their numbers.""

The graduation rate for New Jersey’s Class of 2011 will be based on a new federal standard called the ""adjusted cohort graduation rate."" The federal measurement closely resembles a common definition of graduation rates that 45 states, including New Jersey, agreed to in 2005. The rate will be calculated by determining the percentage of a ninth grade class that graduates in four years with a standard diploma, accounting for transfers and dropouts.

But the number Christie cited at Harvard relied on a different approach. In fact, there are at least two other ways of measuring the graduation rate: 
At Harvard, Christie was referencing a study released in February by Global Education Advisors, a private consulting company incorporated by Christopher Cerf before he became New Jersey’s acting state Education Commissioner.

A presentation based on the study’s findings said that 22 percent of children who enter ninth grade in Newark graduate with a ""HSPA degree in four years.""

Newark Public Schools said its graduation rate is 55 percent, which it calculates by including all students who graduate in four years, accounting for transfers and dropouts.

Using raw data provided by Newark Public Schools, PolitiFact New Jersey calculated the four-year graduation rate for students who pass the HSPA. We got a rate of 25.8 percent. Newark also had a rate of 19.8 percent for students passing the alternate exam, now called the Alternate High School Assessment and special education students exempt from taking the HSPA accounted for another 9.4 percent, according to the district’s data.

The HSPA number is higher than the 22 percent figure from the presentation based on  the Global Education Advisors study, which appears to be calculated from two different years of data. And it’s lower than Newark’s 55 percent.

Both the state Education Department and Newark Public Schools said they didn’t produce the presentation, so they couldn’t comment on it. Two emails and a phone call to Sangari Global Education, a company with ties to Global Education Advisors, were not returned.

Still, Christie’s statistic isn’t totally out of the ballpark -- but only when specifically referring to students who graduate in four years after passing the HSPA.

We spoke to three academics and a policy expert to gauge whether one method of calculating the graduation rate is more credible than the other. They said graduation rates should reflect students who graduate within four years prepared for a career or college.

""I think we get in this number game way too much,"" said Alexander Urbiel, assistant dean of teacher education at Ramapo College. ""What we really should be looking at is outcomes.""

One of the academics also said anyone citing a graduation rate statistic needs to be clear on who the number includes.

""We need to account for them when we say the school’s graduation rate,"" said Donna Jorgensen, an associate professor of education at Rowan University, about students who graduate by passing the alternate exam. ""If we don’t, it’s like saying they weren’t in school at all.""

We also talked to Alan Sadovnik, a professor of education, sociology and public affairs at Rutgers University who co-authored a recent report that studied the use of alternate exams in Newark.

From 2003 to 2008 the study tracked 9,725 students, 60 percent of whom graduated from high school by passing the alternate exam, which was then called the Special Review Assessment. Forty percent of those students enrolled in college, compared with 68 percent of the students who graduated by passing the HSPA.

The study also found that female, low-income and minority students were more likely to graduate by taking the alternate exam.

Sadovnik said the governor’s choice of statistic is part of the larger, ongoing debate over eliminating alternate exams and requiring a single-high stakes test for graduation.

Let’s review.

The governor said the graduation rate in Newark is 29 percent.

There are several ways to calculate graduation rates and there is no solid consensus on whether one method is more credible than any other. New Jersey is moving to a federal standard of calculating graduation rates, but hasn’t done so yet.

Christie’s number is actually a bit higher than the statistic that measures the four-year graduation rate for students who passed the HSPA. But it’s lower than the calculation that the school system uses.   

There are different ways to calculate graduation rates and it’s important to be precise in describing them. In this case, the governor glossed over the details and omitted a whole group of students recognized by the state as having graduated, many of whom continued their education beyond high school.

For these reasons, we rate Christie’s statement False.

Bachmann said Obama voted against the debt limit when he was a senator
","
Michele Bachmann said she would not support increasing the debt ceiling if it didn't include major reductions in government spending.  
""I've already voted no on raising the debt ceiling in the past. And unless there are serious cuts, I can't,"" she said at debate June 13, 2011, in New Hampshire. Bachmann is seeking the 2012 Republican nomination for president. 
""But I want to speak to someone that's far more eloquent than I,"" she continued. ""Someone who said just dealing with the issue of raising the debt ceiling is a failure of leadership. That person was then Senator Barack Obama. He refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership.""
We decided to fact-check Bachmann's to see if she was right.   
We should point out that a vote to increase the debt limit doesn't increase spending directly. The spending was already authorized by other legislation, and now the U.S. Treasury Department needs a formal signoff to keep issuing debt. Some analysts have compared it to writing the check to cover a credit card bill for things you already charged.  
The limit now stands at a mind-boggling $14.3 trillion, but said it needs to be raised by August for the government to keep up with its obligations.  
Experts have warned that failure to raise the limit could ultimately lead to chaos in the financial markets, but Republicans have vowed to oppose the increase unless it's accompanied by spending cuts. Closed-door negotiations, led by Vice President Joe Biden, have been ongoing.  
The votes to raise the debt ceiling -- there have been 10 since 2001 -- are famous for political posturing. Our research showed that President Obama is no exception. Back in 2006, he joined with other Senate Democrats to vote against raising the debt limit, a measure supported by President George W. Bush. 
""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills,"" Obama said. 
""Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people claimed, the fiscal policies of this administration and its allies in Congress will add more than $600 million in debt for each of the next five years,"" he said, adding,""Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better."" 
The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed. 
Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support. 
We asked the Obama re-election campaign for comment on this but we didn't hear back. Obama was asked directly about his vote on April 15, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. Here's their exchange: 
""You've got to extend the debt limit,"" Stephanopolous said. ""And your job is a lot tougher because of your vote in the Senate against extending the debt limit. When did you realize that vote was a mistake?"" 
""I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president,"" Obama replied. ""When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it."" 
Bachmann said Obama refused to approve an increase in the debt limit when he was a senator, and that he blamed President Bush for failed leadership, as well as Bush's supporters in Congress. She's right on both counts, and we rate her statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/14/michele-bachmann/bachmann-said-obama-voted-against-debt-limit-when-/

Wisconsin Humane Society says state budget amendment exempts scientific researchers from state criminal law on animal cruelty
","
When key state legislators approved a multifaceted amendment to cut the budget and make other high-profile changes to the University of Wisconsin System on June 3, 2011, little attention was paid to item number 27.

Labeled ""Liability Protections for Scientific Researchers,"" the amendment dealt with changes in the state statute regarding ""crimes against animals.""

About a week later, the Wisconsin Humane Society urged its supporters to protest the move, which university researchers said was necessary to protect vital research from the chilling effect of possible lawsuits or criminal prosecutions urged by animal-rights activists.

In a news release on June 13, 2011, the Humane Society said the state legislation would ""exempt scientific researchers from all state animal cruelty laws.""

""Wisconsin law already exempts bona fide scientific researchers from the statutes prohibiting animal mistreatment … and poisoning,"" the group’s  executive director Anne Reed wrote. ""The budget bill amendment is broader and would exempt researchers from the entirety of Chapter 951, the criminal laws relating to animal cruelty.""

That’s a provocative claim about an apparently major change in state law --  and one that was inserted without public hearing or discussion into a lengthy budget bill. That’s right up our alley.

First, a bit of background about the legislation.

It grew, in part, out of university concerns about legal liability for researchers in the wake of criminal investigations into the use of sheep and mice in experiments, said Eric Sandgren, director of the UW Research Animal Resources Center.

For three decades, UW-Madison used sheep in U.S. Navy-funded experiments related to decompression sickness in divers, Sandgren said. The sheep are euthanized at the end of the experiments.

In 2009, Dane County District Attorney Brian Blanchard found that UW-Madison researchers violated the crimes against animals law. He  declined to prosecute, saying it was not intentional or negligent.

In 2010, the Alliance for Animals and the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) went to court seeking criminal charges against UW officials in connection with 26 sheep that died as a result of decompression experiments, the Madison Capital Times reported.

In that case, a Madison special prosecutor appointed by a judge in May 2011 determined university employees broke no laws, but he ""scolded university officials for not having a better system in place for keeping track of state and federal laws,"" the Capital Times reported.

All right, let’s examine the proposed changes.

To back up her claim that the budget amendment would exempt researchers from the whole criminal statute, Reed pointed to the proposed amendment approved on June 3 by the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee. The committee did the preliminary work on the budget, which then went to the Assembly and Senate.

The bill markup document creates a new section in Chapter 951, the criminal statute that deals with dognapping, decompression, instigation of fights between animals, nutrition for confined animals and other acts.

Under the amendment, the statute would read: ""This chapter does not apply to an animal that is being used for research or experimentation at an educational or research institution or to an animal that is being used for research or experimentation that is regulated under (federal laws).""

The change, as proposed, affects state criminal prohibitions on animal cruelty written into the statutes decades ago.

That sounds sweeping, and, indeed, it is accurate to say that the amendment would exempt university researchers from the state statute providing criminal penalties for animal cruelty, Sandgren said.

Sandgren defends the proposal and says it will not lead to more abuse.

He points to a federal law, the Animal Welfare Act, that is enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture. That law, another federal law, and UW’s own ethical standards, are enough to keep research within legal standards, Sandgren and other supporters of the change contend.

One co-sponsor of the multifaceted budget amendment for the university system, Rep. Patricia Strachota (R-West Bend), said a coalition of bioscience researchers sought the liability protection. A Medical College of Wisconsin spokesman said the members of the statewide coalition addressing the issue are: BioForward, Covance, the Medical College of Wisconsin, UW Health, UW Madison, UW System, Wisconsin Alumni Association, and Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

The proposed change ""removes the cloud of criminal prosecutions"" for bona fide researchers, said Medical College spokesman Richard Katschke.

Reed says that is one cause for concern, among several.

She said the federal law was not as meaningful, because local district attorneys would be more inclined to listen to complaints than federal authorities. ""That’s why we have state statutes,"" Reed said.

Reed also pointed out a potential loophole in the amendment language.

While the intent of the budget amendment appeared to be to exempt only bona fide research at educational/research institutions, we found the actual language in the bill markup does not make that distinction.

Strachota said legislators were planning to clean up the language to make it clear that only public educational institutions would be exempt.

One more issue before we take stock.

Sandgren took issue with the wording of a Humane Society e-mail alert to its supporters that said the proposed change means researchers ""can do anything without worrying about any legal protections for animals at all.""

That e-mail alert did not make it explicitly clear, Reed acknowledged, that the society was talking about state legal protections. But the news release published by the group, as well as its website, covered that point.

How does it all stack up?

The Wisconsin Humane Society says a proposed state statute change will exempt researchers from all the state’s criminal prohibitions against animal cruelty. There’s disagreement about the real-world impact of the change, but the exemption itself is clear. The disagreement is related to federal laws and ethical standards, which would not be affected -- and were not mentioned by the group.

Newt Gingrich touts scale of 'Reagan recovery' in New Hampshire debate
","
During Monday’s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., moderator John King drilled former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. on one of the most divisive issues on Capitol Hill: taxes on the wealthy.

""Mr. Speaker, if you look at a poll in the Boston Globe just the other day, 54 percent of Republican voters in this state say they're willing to have higher taxes on the wealthy to help bring down the deficit. Are they wrong?"" the CNN anchor asked.

Gingrich responded that the real issue is whether raising taxes on higher-income Americans would create jobs. He then responded with striking claim about the recovery that followed the 1981-1982 recession, for which Gingrich and others credit the president at the time, Ronald Reagan.

""The Reagan recovery, which I participated in passing, in seven years created for this current economy the equivalent of 25 million new jobs, raised federal revenue by $800 billion a year in terms of the current economy, and clearly it worked,"" Gingrich said. ""It's a historic fact.""

Reagan’s signature policy was a cut of the top individual income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 34 percent. It took effect in phases until fully in place in 1988.

The recovery under Reagan was especially strong, but politicians and economists debate whether Reagan’s tax breaks, which were passed by a Democratic-controlled Congress,  were the cause.

Gingrich is hardly alone among Republicans who have used Reagan’s record to bolster their argument that tax cuts can improve the economy. We checked similar claims by U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, one of several new House members elected with tea party support.

We called a Gingrich spokesman for more information on how the candidate came up with his numbers. He did not give an immediate response.

First off, we’ll note that Gingrich was elected to Congress in 1978, so it’s fair to say that he ""participated in passing"" the Reagan legislative agenda. (King was slightly off about the Boston Globe poll -- it showed 56 percent support for a tax increase, not 54.)

We'll address Gingrich's claim in two parts, with the one about jobs first.

Job creation statistics come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency. To get the net number of jobs created during a given period of time, you subtract the number of jobs held nationally at the starting point from the number of jobs held at the ending point.

So the first question is, what are the starting and ending points? Since Gingrich was talking about a ""recovery,"" we figured it would be fair to start the clock at the low point of the jobs picture. We’ve chosen January 1983 as what we think is a reasonable start date, and then picked January 1989 as the closing date, since that’s when Reagan left office. That leaves us with a nice, clean six-year period.

Careful readers will note that this is not the seven years that Gingrich suggested. However, we think it’s the best way to measure Gingrich’s underlying point, and as it turns out, it doesn’t alter the outcome much.

Using the BLS data, we found that the number of employed Americans grew from almost 89 million in January 1983, the start of the ""Reagan recovery,""  to more than 107 million in January 1989, an increase of 18.2 million or about 20 percent..

But we still need to adjust this figure to fit Gingrich’s description -- that is, the equivalent number of jobs the Reagan-era recovery would have produced for America today.  We adjusted the 18.2 million increase in jobs to account for the fact that today's labor force is 31 percent bigger and came up with 24 million jobs -- quite close to the 25 million Gingrich cited in the debate.

So score one for Gingrich. What about the money figure?

For this, we looked at the historical tables for federal revenue produced by the Office of Management and Budget. We also used the period of 1983 to 1989, though the figures in the OMB table refer to fiscal years rather than calendar years, so the timing is not exact.

Between fiscal year 1983 and fiscal year 1989, federal revenue climbed from about $600.6 billion to $991.1 billion. That’s an increase of $390.5 billion over the period.

As we did with the jobs number, we’ll adjust this increase to fit the current size of federal receipts. We found that revenue has increased by 2.73 times since the mid-1980s. Adjusting for the increase in revenues since the mid-1980s, it works out to slightly less than $1.1 trillion. 
But there’s one more step -- Gingrich had said that federal revenues had increased by today’s equivalent of $800 billion per year. So if you divide the $1.1 trillion number by the six years it covered, you get roughly $178 billion per year -- well below the $800 billion figure Gingrich cited.

So on tax revenues, the actual amount is far lower than what Gingrich claimed.

Where does this leave us? Gingrich got very close on the jobs number, but he was way off on the revenue figure. We’ll call it Half True. 
UPDATE: After we published our article, Gingrich's camp got back to us. R.C. Hammond, a spokesman, said that ""Newt meant over $800 billion over the recovery, not annually."" Because misstatements do not protect speakers from a low rating on the Truth-O-Meter, our rating stands.",/factchecks/2011/jun/14/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-touts-scale-reagan-recovery-new-hamp/
"['China', 'Federal Budget', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
Rep. Allen West says China holds 29% of U.S. debt
","China's economic muscle and the U.S. debt are common worries in Congress these days. Republican Congressman Allen West, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, weighed in during an interview about China on Fox News June 2.

Anchor Jenna Lee asked: ""How would you deal with China, especially with our economic ties right now? I mean, what's the way forward?""

West replied: ""Well, I think that that is one of the key things that we need to be talking about, when we look at the debt that we have and China owns about 29 percent of that debt."" West linked to the interview on his website.

Is West's figure right -- does China own about 29 percent of the U.S. debt?

We asked spokeswoman Angela Sachitano for an explanation. She sent us back a link to a March 25, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service titled ""Foreign Holdings of Federal Debt."" Note the word ""foreign."" Table 2 shows the top 10 ""foreign holders"" of federal debt, and Mainland China is at the top, with about $1.16 trillion or 26.1 percent (Japan is No. 2). This means China holds about 26 percent of ""foreign investment in U.S. privately held federal debt,"" the report states.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia weighed in on a similar claim by Herman Cain, a Republican presidential candidate, who spoke about China's share of the U.S. debt at a tea party event in Iowa on April 16. We rated Cain's claim False.

""If we don't begin to grow with the potential that we have in this country, we will have another national security crisis, and that national security crisis is that China will be as big as we are,"" Cain said. ""They'll start to develop a military as big and as good as ours, and they've got a billion more people and they're holding 26 percent of our debt. And you think we're going to be able to sing Kumbaya with them?""

After examining a U.S. Treasury Department report of foreign holders of treasury securities as of March, PolitiFact concluded:

""According to the report, as of February of this year, China held $1.15 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury securities. Together, all foreign holders came to $4.47 trillion. So China's share of that comes to about 26 percent. China, incidentally, tops the list of foreign holders of U.S. debt, followed by Japan and then, with a much smaller share, countries such as the United Kingdom and Brazil.

""But that's just the foreign holders of Treasury securities. More than two-thirds of the debt is held by U.S. residents and institutions. When you look at everyone who holds U.S. Treasury securities, China's share drops to 8.1 percent ($1.15 trillion out of $14 trillion).""

(For the West fact-check, we contacted the U.S. Treasury to ask whether that report had been updated since March and were told that it was the most recent data available.)

PolitiFact National continued:

""Of course, there are lots of ways to slice debt statistics. For example, instead of gross federal debt (the figure cited above), some people prefer to use a figure for 'debt held by the public.' That's the gross federal debt minus the share of the debt held by the U.S. government itself. That was $9.4 trillion at the end of 2010. Which would put the portion held by China at about 12.3 percent. There are also Chinese holdings of debt outside of Treasuries, said Derek Scissors of the conservative Heritage Foundation. But that doesn't get Cain anywhere near his 26 percent figure.

""Even stretching, you can't get past 15.6 percent of our debt as held by China and I would not use that number,"" Scissors said.

The number cited by Cain is ""misleadingly large,"" Scissors said. ""He's not talking about our debt, he's talking about the foreign share of our debt. If you are going to use that number, you really have to explain it.""

We told Sachitano that West's figure was close to China's share of the foreign-held U.S. debt. She replied by e-mail: ""No misrepresentation."" She also referred us to slides on West's website, which he uses at town-hall meetings. On his slide show, however, West's pie charts correctly show China's share of the U.S. debt held by foreigners, a distinction he didn't make on Fox News. The 29 percent figure that West mentioned on Fox is even higher than what Cain had cited, and we've already labeled that too high. The number West used is also wrong. Although on TV he left out only a couple words, those words matter because they make a big difference here. He could have explained that he was referring to foreign holders of U.S. debt -- but he didn't. So his statement makes it appear that China owns a much larger chunk of the federal debt than it does. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2011/jun/14/allen-west/rep-allen-west-says-china-holds-29-percent-us-debt/

Tim Pawlenty said Medicare is only half paid for by premiums and taxes

Michele Bachmann says Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs
","
Michele Bachmann announced that she filed paperwork to run for the presidency at a debate in New Hampshire on Tuesday. She also used the stage to continue her long-standing attacks on President Barack Obama's health care law.  
""As president of the United States, I will not rest until I repeal Obamacare. It's a promise. Take it to the bank, cash the check. I'll make sure that that happens,"" Bachmann said. ""The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office has said that Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs. What could the president be thinking by passing a bill like this, knowing full well it will kill 800,000 jobs?""

We got many requests from our readers to check that 800,000 number. It's something we've looked at before.  
The health care law will cost some employers money, particularly large ones. Employers aren't required to offer insurance, but if they don't and their workers make low wages and qualify for new tax credits to buy insurance, then the employers will have to pay a fine. (This part of the legislation does not go into effect until 2014.) But even so, the CBO says that fines imposed on large employers will affect low-wage workers the most.  
  
Still, the CBO also says the effect will be somewhat limited.

""To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced,"" the CBO said in its report. ""It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives."" 
Still, that's not where the 800,000 jobs number comes from. It primarily comes from workers who choose not to work because they no longer have to work at jobs just for the health insurance. Here's how the CBO puts it:

""The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount—roughly half a percent—primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law.""

Basically, the CBO is saying here that some people right now are working mostly to keep their health insurance. Once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The CBO describes this as a ""small segment"" of the population, about half a percent of the labor force.

The CBO doesn't use the 800,000 jobs number in its report; critics of the law have extrapolated that number by calculating what half a percent of the workforce equals. But CBO director Douglas Elmendorf confirmed that number in testimony before Congress back in February.

But Elmendorf also explained that number was an extrapolation, and that the number might not be precise. ""That means that if the reduction in the labor used was workers working the average number of hours in the economy and earning the average wage, that there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers.

""In fact, as we mentioned in the -- in our announcements last summer, the legislation also creates incentives that might affect the number of hours people work, might affect the tendency to work with lower and higher income people. We haven't tried to quantify those things. But the impact is that these 800,000 (jobs) might not be exactly the number ...""

The CBO report also noted that the health care law could actually help economic productivity.

"['Health Care', 'Jobs', 'Florida', 'Adam Hasner']","
Adam Hasner cites CBO, says health care law cuts 800,000 jobs
","
The Congressional Budget Office is an authoritative, nonpartisan source of information, so Florida U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner must have been eager to source it in attacking the 2010 federal health care law.

In a lead-up to court arguments over the law's constitutionality, Hasner issued a press statement that referenced the CBO to describe how the health care law -- if upheld -- would kill jobs.

""Implementation of Obamacare has played a major role in prolonging our country's economic challenges,"" he said June 8, 2011. ""Earlier this year, the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that implementation of Obamacare would cost 800,000 jobs. Here in Florida, nearly 1 million Floridians are already out of work and the myriad regulations, taxes, and rules contained in Obamacare have only caused more worry and hesitation among the small-business men and women and job creators I've met with during the past three months.""

At PolitiFact, we've tackled a broad statement made by House Republican leader Eric Cantor that the health care law is ""job killing"" and rated it False. But we wondered about Hasner's more specific claim about the CBO and 800,000 jobs. (Interestingly, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachman made the same claim during June 13th's New Hampshire Republican presidential debate).

We found a source for the claim easy enough.

On Feb. 10, CBO Director Doug Elmendorf testified before the House Budget Committee and was asked how the federal health care law would affect the job market. The Weekly Standard, a magazine for conservatives, said in a headline that Elmendorf said ""Obamacare Would Reduce Employment by 800,000 Workers."" Hasner campaign spokesman Rick Wilson also provided links to stories in POLITICO -- CBO: Health law to shrink workforce by 800,000, and a clip of Elmendorf's testimony on YouTube.

The Weekly Standard article includes two exchanges from the hearing.
  
We checked the transcript provided by The Weekly Standard against the one kept by Congressional Quarterly and wanted to make one correction to the record. The first question was from Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., not Ryan.

We also thought it appropriate to continue Elmendorf's second answer for additional context. After saying that ""half a percent of that is 800,000,"" Elmendorf continued: ""That means that if the reduction in the labor used was workers working the average number of hours in the economy and earning the average wage, that there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers. 
""In fact, as we mentioned in the -- in our announcements last summer, the legislation also creates incentives that might affect the number of hours people work, might affect the tendency to work with lower and higher income people. We haven't tried to quantify those things. But the impact is that these 800,000 (jobs) might not be exactly the number ..."" 
So Elmendorf did say there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers -- while noting that the number could change slightly. 
That might sound the same as Hasner's claim that the health care law will ""cost 800,000 jobs,"" but it's not. 
The specific CBO analysis explains why. In a budget and economic outlook update from August 2010, the CBO included some analysis on the federal health care law and its effects on the labor market. 
The CBO wrote: ""The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount — roughly half a percent — primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law."" 
Basically, the CBO says that some people right now are working mostly to keep their health insurance. Once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The analysis also finds that ""some older workers will choose to retire earlier than they otherwise would.""
 
Conversely, the CBO concluded that the health care law removes an existing disincentive to work for many low-income individuals by raising Medicaid income eligibility limits.

As far as trying to address Hasner's claim that the health care law will cost jobs (meaning businesses will hire less workers or lay off existing employees) the CBO is more vague.

""Employers' decisions to hire workers will also be affected in some cases by the health care legislation,"" the CBO said. ""Employers with 50 or more employees will be required to pay a penalty if they do not offer insurance or if the insurance they offer does not meet certain criteria and at least one of their workers receives a subsidy from an exchange. Those penalties, whose amounts are based on the number of full-time workers in the firm, will, over time, generally be passed on to workers through reductions in wages or other forms of compensation.

""However, firms generally cannot reduce workers’ wages below the minimum wage, which will probably cause some employers to respond by hiring fewer low-wage workers. Alternatively, because firms are penalized only if their full-time employees receive subsidies from exchanges, some firms may instead hire more part-time or seasonal employees.""

The CBO also found that because it could be easier for workers to find health insurance, they may be more likely to take jobs that better match their skills. And an improved health system could result in a more productive economy.

In an e-mail, Hasner spokesman Rick Wilson responded: ""If Obamacare creates structural macroeconomic conditions that reduce the net number of working people, it's still a net cost to GDP (gross domestic product).""

Hasner cited the CBO director in making the claim that the health care law would ""cost 800,000 jobs,"" and provided the context that nearly 1 million Floridians already are out of work. But that's not really what the CBO has said, something our colleagues at Factcheck.org have pointed out as well.

There could be the equivalent of 800,000 fewer workers thanks to the federal health care law, according to the CBO, but not because employers wouldn't hire them. It's because workers wouldn't have to work because the new law expands health care coverage. That means people working primarily for health care would either reduce their hours or leave the job market altogether. Hasner's statement is out of context and misleading. We rate it Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/14/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-cites-cbo-says-health-care-law-cuts-80/

Wisconsin GOP Rep. Michelle Litjens says taxpayers pay for 45 percent of births in state, 60 percent in Milwaukee
","
Some of the biggest bashers of government entitlement programs are tea party folks, many of whom are newly elected officials.

Among them is Wisconsin state Rep. Michelle Litjens, R-Oshkosh. While campaigning ahead of the November 2010 elections, she organized the tea party rally where another Oshkosh Republican, Ron Johnson, gave his first political speech. Johnson went on to defeat Democrat Russ Feingold for the U.S. Senate.

Like Johnson, during her campaign, Litjens railed against government spending and taxes as being too high.

And on June 2, 2011, Litjens, a 38-year-old married mother of two, let loose on the Internet with this anti-entitlement tweet:

""Unreal! Taxpayers pay for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin! And 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee!!! No wonder we’re broke.""

A misinformed right-wing rant? Or evidence of the pervasiveness of public assistance, which many conservatives blame for high taxes and government deficits? We wanted to know.

We’ll go to the Truth-O-Meter only for the statistical claims in Litjens' statement. But to add perspective, we’ll also address her ""we’re broke"" comment.

When we asked Litjens’ legislative aide for evidence to back her statement, he provided Wisconsin birth statistics from the state Department of Health Services for 2008. We confirmed that they are the most recent available in terms of taxpayer funding.

The figures show that 71,977 babies were born in Wisconsin in 2008 -- and that Medicaid, the state-federal program that pays medical bills for low-income individuals and families, paid for the care provided in 32,792 of the births. That’s 45.6 percent, which confirms Litjens’ first claim.

The 45.6 percent figure -- it was 44 percent in ‘07, 43 percent in ‘06 and 42 percent in ‘05 -- put Wisconsin on the higher end of Medicaid-financed births nationally in 2008. That’s according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy.

The rate ranged from 8 percent in New Jersey to 70 percent in Louisiana, although figures were not available for 15 states.

As for Litjens’ second claim, that taxpayers paid for 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee, she didn’t specify whether she meant Milwaukee County or the City of Milwaukee. But either way, her claim is accurate.

State figures show there were 15,353 births in the county in 2008, and that Medicaid paid for the care of 9,170 of them, or 59.7 percent. In the city, Medicaid paid for 72.5 percent of the 11,311 births.

Here’s a little more on the state statistics for 2008 births:

Over 85 percent of the 130 births in Menominee County were paid for by Medicaid, the highest percentage in Wisconsin.

In Ozaukee County, Medicaid paid for 19 percent of the 822 births, the lowest rate.

In Litjens’ home county, Winnebago, Medicaid paid for nearly 39 percent of the 1,955 births.

Medicaid, by the way, pays for more than just labor and delivery. It also finances prenatal visits and postpartum care.

We asked Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a Madison-based advocacy organization, about Litjens’ statement. He didn’t disagree with the statistics, but took issue with her suggestion that Medicaid-financed births are one reason ""we’re broke.""

Peacock said prenatal care provided through Medicaid saves tax dollars by reducing the number of low-birth-weight babies. He cited a November 2010 state health department report about births in five Wisconsin counties in 2005. The average Medicaid hospital charges for a low-birth-weigh baby during the first year of life was $164,257, compared with $3,514 for a normal-birth-weight birth.

Peacock also said that the elderly and people with disabilities account for at least 70 percent of Medicaid expenditures, far more than babies.

But critics of entitlement programs can also cite statistics about the size of the government safety net.

An October 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which reported that Medicaid paid for 45 percent of all baby deliveries in Wisconsin in 2008, also reported that at that time:

More than 1.1 million people in Wisconsin depended on Medicaid health programs.

Medicaid provided health care for one in five Wisconsin residents.

Medicaid health programs had expanded faster in Wisconsin over the previous nine years than in any state except Arizona.

But let’s return to what brought us here.

GOP state Rep. Michelle Litjens claimed that taxpayers paid for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin, including 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee. Her staff said she was referring to state figures for 2008, which we confirmed are the most recent available in terms of how many of the births were financed by Medicaid.

State statistics confirm both of Litjens’ claims. We rate her statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/14/michelle-litjens/wisconsin-gop-rep-michelle-litjens-says-taxpayers-/
"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Gary Black']","
Some farm workers do earn high wages, but not all do
","
Recent talk about a shortage of workers in Georgia’s fields left your PolitiFact team wondering whether we should consider a career in cucumbers.

The work may be hard, but if you believe Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, the industry pays solid wages.

""Understand that these are $12, $13, $14, $16, $18 an hour jobs,"" Black told 90.1 WABE-FM’s Denis O'Hayer in an interview. ""Talked to a gentleman yesterday, they had a crew of people, they were going to make $130 a day picking cucumbers. That’s 130 buckets of cucumbers, $1 per bucket.""

Up to $18 an hour? That’s more lucrative than flipping burgers or greeting customers at Walmart. Suddenly, picking cucumbers seemed like a viable Plan B.

If Black is right, farm labor could be a neat answer to Georgia’s joblessness problems. Unemployment remains high at 9.9 percent. GA DOL  Farmers complain their immigrant labor force is leaving the state to avoid racial and ethnic profiling, harassment, or deportation they think will result from House Bill 87, Georgia’s Arizona-style immigration crackdown.

HB 87 requires that certain employers check their new workers’ immigration status and gives law enforcement officers more leeway to check a suspect’s immigration status. Gov. Nathan Deal signed the bill May 13, but it’s being challenged in federal court.

Farmers report they’ve already lost thousands of dollars because they can’t find enough laborers.

Black and others told us that field worker wages are often based on production. The more you harvest, the more money you get.

""They range from minimum wage to as high as $18,"" Black told PolitiFact Georgia. He cited instances where farmers told him solid workers could make even more.

But can job seekers reasonably expect to make $12 to $18 an hour?

First, a note about harvesting jobs. A lot of them are temporary, and hours vary depending on Mother Nature. Laborers may have to work for 12 hours or more to pick a crop before it rots.

Reporters for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution interviewed workers and farmers who said pickers earned about $100 a day. One worker said she expected to work about 12 hours for that amount.

The most recent Georgia Department of Labor data date from the summer of 2010. The state tallied wage and employee numbers from farms with 10 or more employees who are covered by regular unemployment insurance. Such employers are required to report their numbers to the state.

For 13 weeks during July, August and September, 10,600 or so workers in Georgia were involved in ""crop production,"" or worked in farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses and nurseries that grow crops or plants. This group can include supervisors.

They made an average of $367 per week, the data show.

Pay varied depending on the crop. For instance, some 3,100 vegetable and melon workers made an average of $311 a week; about 1,000 blueberry and other non-strawberry crop workers made about $268; soybean crop workers (there were only 17) made about $666.

The state Department of Labor did not determine an average hourly wage, so we did our own rough calculation. Although field workers often work 12-hour days, we based our figures on a 40-hour workweek to be conservative.

We found that crop workers make about $9.18 an hour. Vegetable and melon workers were near $7.78.  Blueberry workers made about $6.70 an hour. The soybean rate is $16.65, but that is for workers operating complex farm machinery, a relatively small number of workers.

These numbers were lower than Black’s figures, so we turned to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s farm labor data for additional verification. They calculate regional wage rates for ""field workers,"" or employees who plant, tend or harvest crops.

We looked at spring and summer wages for the Southeast, which includes Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina. Field workers made $8.86 per hour during the week of April 11 through 17, 2010. They made $9.12 an hour July 11 through 17, 2010.

The federal figures were also lower than Black’s, so we consulted another source: former field worker Andrea Hinojosa, who opposes the immigration crackdown. She is director of Southeast Georgia Communities Project Inc., which provides health, education and other services to farm laborers.

The onion pickers Hinojosa serves generally make 38 cents for each bucket, she said. Fast, experienced workers can make $9.50 or $10 an hour.

It may be possible to make $12 an hour picking onions, Hinojosa said, but it’s rare. $18 an hour is far-fetched.

""I’ve got to tell you, I’ve never seen, never heard of someone making $18 an hour,"" Hinojosa said.  

In sum, it is possible to make $12 to $18 an hour, as Black said, but those amounts are far higher than a typical wage. Information from state and federal agencies, the director of a farmworker aid group, and AJC reporters shows wages are closer to $10 an hour or less.

Black’s statement is accurate on its face. Some farm workers ""can"" earn $12 to $18 an hour. Most, however, do not. His statement leaves out key details and takes things out of context.

Ted Nugent says Rick Perry is first governor to win thrice by landslides
","
Describing current GOP presidential hopefuls as unexciting, Texas guitar artist and Motor City transplant Ted Nugent trumpets his friend Rick Perry’s pizzazz and undefeated streak at the polls.
 and
In a June 1 op-ed column in The Washington Times, Nugent calls Perry a ""powerful and popular"" true conservative, saying: ""He has never lost an election and remains the only person to have won the Texas governorship three times in landslide elections.""

Undefeated, sure. Perry has won every bid for office since his initial election to the Texas House, as a Democrat, in 1984.

But we wondered if Perry is alone in winning the Texas governorship thrice, by landslides every time.

Turns out, according to the Texas Almanac, Democrats Allan Shivers and John Connally each won three times for governor, back when governors served two-year terms.

Shivers enjoyed three landslides, drubbing opponents in 1950 and 1954 and doing even better in 1952 when he was on the ballot as both the Democratic and Republican nominee. Shivers-the-Democrat got nearly 1.4 million votes while Shivers-the-Republican drew 468,000.

Connally had landslide wins in 1964 and 1966, claiming a more narrow victory in 1962 with 54 percent of the vote to Republican Jack Cox’s nearly 46 percent.

Perry, elected lieutenant governor in 1998, ascended to the governorship in December 2000 after then-Gov George W. Bush resigned to prepare for his first term as president. Perry won election as governor in 2002 and re-election in 2006 and 2010.

According to results posted online by the Texas Secretary of State’s office, Perry romped to two of his gubernatorial wins. He carried 58 percent of the 2002 vote, with Democrat Tony Sanchez getting 40 percent, and drew 55 percent in 2010 to Democrat Bill White’s 42 percent.

In 2006, Perry prevailed with just 39 percent of the vote. Among three major challengers, Democrat Chris Bell garnered 30 percent, Independent Carole Keeton Strayhorn got 18 percent and Independent Kinky Friedman landed with nearly 12.5 percent.

Does this win rate as a landslide?

Sure, advised Daron Shaw, a University of Texas government professor who also does polls for GOP candidates. Nope, countered Cal Jillson, a Southern Methodist University professor of political science.

In an interview, Shaw said political scientists have made a cottage industry out of defining landslides, but he said the general rule is a landslide occurs if the victor bests their leading opponent by 10 percentage points or more.

Shaw added that a calculation is in order when the field consists of more than two major candidates. In such cases, he said, he gauges how the winner fared compared to the second-place finisher. By this measure, Perry ended up with 56-plus percent of the 2006 votes cast for him or Bell, and Bell got 43-plus percent.

Jillson told us that one marker of a landslide is beating your opponent by 10 percentage points or more of the votes, but he said such a win in the governor’s race also has to show strength among voters across the state.

As noted Nov. 9, 2006 by Dallas Morning News columnist William McKenzie, Bell defeated Perry in Dallas, Travis and El Paso counties and lost by narrow margins in Harris and Bexar counties. Put another way, McKenzie wrote, among the six major urban counties, only Tarrant favored Perry by a significant margin.

And, Jillson said, he would not term Perry’s ‘06 win a landslide. Indeed, he said, the governor’s 39 percent amounted to a comeuppance; 60 percent of voters chose a different aspirant.

Our take: Perry is the third--not first--Texas governor to win re-election thrice. Two of his wins were bona fide landslides but the third’s landslide status is at least debatable.

"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'Ron Amstutz']","
State Rep. Ron Amstutz says the budget now being debated will rely on substantially less one-time money
","
State Rep. Ron Amstutz, a Republican from Wooster, recently defended Gov. John Kasich’s two-year budget blueprint, which the Republican-controlled House and Senate have left largely in tact.

In a letter published May 28 in The Columbus Dispatch, Amstutz said that budget ""invests in Ohio’s future and a stable fiscal path toward a stronger Ohio.""  

Chairman of the powerful House finance committee, Amstutz was responding to criticism of the $55.6 billion budget that House Minority Leader Armond Budish made in his own letter to The Dispatch. Among Budish’s contentions was that Kasich's budget proposal amounts to Ohio's second largest spending increase, a claim PolitiFact Ohio rated as Mostly True.

Amstutz said Budish’s charge that the budget increases state spending ""left absent a major component to his commentary: reality.""

Among the points Amstutz raised to defend the GOP budget: ""The current budget (now being debated) significantly decreases the use of one-time resources, using $1.2 billion this year and around $100 million the following year.""  

Amstutz said that Budish and Democrats failed to wean the state from one-time money and that the Republican’s use of one-time money for the Kasich budget ""pales in comparison.""
       
Given how often politicians use the term ""one-time money"" as a weapon, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Amstutz claims.
 
When politicians refer to one-time money – they are referring to money that won’t be available in the next budget cycle. The sources of the one-time money include federal stimulus money and savings from debt restructuring.

Ohio relied on unprecedented levels of one-time money to balance the two-year budget, passed in July 2009, when Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and Democratic House were in charge. It will expire at the end of June 2011.

Specifically, that budget contained around $4.89 billion in one-time money. That figure grew to more than $6 billion as a delay of an income tax cut, higher reimbursement rates for prescription drugs under Medicaid, and other money was added.  

Republicans have argued the figure is even higher – more than  $8 billion. The differences between the figures are the result of disagreements over what qualifies as one-time money.

Republicans, especially then-gubernatorial candidate John Kasich, exploited the state’s use of one-time money as reckless and said it leaves them to fill a massive budget hole.

Given the Republican’s rhetoric, it might surprise some that they, too, are relying on such found money to balance the next two-year budget.  

This brings us back to Amstutz, who says the state will use about $1.2 billion this year and use $100 million in the following year.  

The governor’s budget – tweaked since by the legislature -- includes the following sources of one-time money during the first year of the two-year cycle:  
  
These total $1.16 billion.

The only one-time money being used in the second-year of the budget is a transfer of $100 million in unclaimed state funds.

So, where does this leave Amstutz claims?

Again, he says the state is relying on $1.2 billion in one-time money in the first year of the proposed budget, which is pretty darn close to $1.16 billion. And, as he says, the budget eliminates in the second year all one-time money except $100 million.

Though debate still exists over the exact figure of one-time money used in the last budget cycle, the level of one-time money used was unprecedented and is clearly far greater than what is proposed in the new budget.

Amstutz’ statement is accurate and there’s nothing significantly missing for a full understanding. On the Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact Ohio rates Amstutz’ statement as True.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Joseph Cryan']","
Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Cryan says closing Elizabeth MVC office saved no money
","
When the state or local government wants to save money, they often do it by shutting offices.

That’s what the state did in late 2010 to MVC offices in Elizabeth, Wyckoff and Bridgeton, projecting to save more than $1 million.

But a trio of lawmakers are crying foul about closing the Elizabeth office, citing lack of savings and inconveniencing residents. As a result, State Sen. Raymond Lesniak, Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Cryan and Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (all D-Union) said they will introduce budget resolutions to reopen the Elizabeth office, which is in their district. The three legislators are all up for re-election this year and faced primary challenges June 7.

""The Governor's decision to close the Elizabeth MVC was clearly a political one,"" Cryan said in a May 14 news release. ""It saved no money and created unnecessary inconvenience for our residents.""

PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether it saved no money.  

A letter dated Jan. 24 to Assembly State Government Committee Chairwoman Linda Stender from MVC Legislative Liaison Jonathan Pushman, and copied to the Assembly Democratic and Republican offices, states that closing the three agencies ""will indeed enable the State to achieve significant cost savings. The elimination of the agency positions will allow the MVC to realize nearly $1 million in budgetary savings. With respect to the Elizabeth agency specifically, the MVC will save an additional $288,000 by closing that office.""

MVC Chairman Ray Martinez testified May 23 before Stender’s committee and said the Elizabeth closure saved $288,552 in four areas, according to Elyse Coffey, deputy director of communications for the MVC: rent, $70,000; parking, $13,260; security, $112,000; and overhead, $75,676 (office equipment and supplies, janitorial services, maintenance and repairs, snow removal, etc.)

""These are tangible, annual savings,"" Coffey said.

Cryan disputed the savings even before Martinez appeared before Stender’s committee.

""I disagree with the 288K ($288,000) in savings that the MVC has projected from closing the location,"" Cryan said in a statement emailed May 20 to PolitiFact New Jersey. ""According to the MVC, the rent per annum for the location was 80K ($80,000). No additional savings have been highlighted. This projected amount will surely be offset by the increased volume and demand now placed upon the Rahway and Springfield locations. Not to mention the countless inconveniences being met by the residents of Union County as a result of this decision.""

Prior to Martinez’s testimony, the MVC could not provide a specific breakdown of savings for the Elizabeth office since its closure on Dec. 31 and referred PolitiFact New Jersey to the Pushman letter.

Looking for an independent source to confirm the MVC’s numbers, we then checked with the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.

Frank W. Haines III, assistant Legislative Budget and Finance officer, referred us to the office’s analysis of Christie’s Fiscal Year 2011-2012 budget. While the analysis didn’t break down specific savings from each of the closed MVC offices, it identified savings -- provided by the MVC -- from the combined closure of the offices in Elizabeth, Bridgeton and Wyckoff.

In a March analysis report that includes a list of budget questions to agencies including the MVC, the Office of Legislative Services asked the MVC: ""Have these closings resulted in any cost saving so far, and if so are these savings in line with expectations?""

The MVC responded: ""MVC has realized cost savings in FY11 (Fiscal Year 2011) from the closure of five leased agencies Wyckoff, Bridgeton Elizabeth, Randolph and Morristown. Morristown and Randolph were leased properties MVC terminated in December, 2010 when the new facility was completed in Randolph on State-owned property. This resulted in a savings of $402,000. Wyckoff was a leased property in which MVC were served an eviction notice. Our Oakland office was expanded and those expenditures were taken into consideration when estimating a savings. The closings of Wyckoff along with Elizabeth and Bridgeton produced an overall savings of $1.6M. ($1.6 million) These savings came from a reduction of 43 FTEs, (full-time employees) rent and security.""

PolitiFact New Jersey caught the discrepancy in estimated savings -- $1.6 million reported to the Office of Legislative Services, $1.3 million cited to us in a May 18 email -- and asked Coffey about it.

""Many of the numbers that are being tossed around are from various budget documents and budget figures often change, either up or down, as time progresses,"" she said in an email May 24.

Despite three PolitiFact New Jersey requests to the MVC and Office of Legislative Services for the actual amount saved from when  the Elizabeth office closed to present, no one has been able to provide that figure. In fact, Haines, of the Office of Legislative Services, said the number would have to come from the MVC, and the answer the MVC provided in the budget analysis ""is the closest"" we’re likely to get.

Cryan, Lesniak and Quijano aren’t just challenging the true bottom line, however.

""Since the closure of the Elizabeth MVC office, thousands of residents have been forced to travel to Springfield and Rahway and wait many hours to acquire MVC services,"" Lesniak said in the news release. ""Elizabeth is the fourth largest city in New Jersey. It's unconscionable that it has been stripped of its only MVC office and its residents denied basic services.""

The release also states that forcing residents to go to the Springfield and Rahway MVC offices ""has led to three- to four-hour waiting times with residents often having to go back numerous times to get their paperwork processed.""

Returning to Cryan’s comment about a lack of savings, let’s review.

Cryan said ""no money"" has been saved. While there is some question about the actual amount, the correspondence indicates there's no question that there have been substantial savings from the reductions in rent and the elimination of 43 jobs. We rate the statement False.

DNC Chair Wasserman Schultz says Obama has signed bills with 17 small business tax cuts
","
In a face-off between the heads of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee on NBC's Meet the Press on June 11, 2011, the discussion turned to what the government should be doing to accelerate job creation.

""I think we need to cut taxes on small businesses,"" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.

""Well, that's good,"" retorted DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., ""because we've done that, 17 times.""

Looking out for small businesses is a mainstay of political rhetoric these days. ""The small business community is sort of a favored group on which to shower tax breaks,"" said Joseph Rosenberg, research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

But have there been 17 tax cuts for small businesses by the Obama administration?

Asked for backup, the DNC press office pointed us to a Feb. 25, 2011, posting on the official White House blog titled ""Seventeen Small Business Tax Cuts and Counting."" The post enumerates 17 small business tax cuts and credits created or extended through legislation signed by President Barack Obama.

Eight of them were included in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (aka the economic stimulus), the Affordable Care Act (aka the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (aka the Hire Act). Among the cuts: the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees, and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months.

Another eight came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by President Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000. Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012.

Here's the full list:

From the Recovery Act, HIRE Acts, and Affordable Care Act:

1. A new small business health care tax credit

2. A new tax credit for hiring unemployed workers

3. Bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment

4. 75 percent exclusion of small business capital gains

5. Expansion of limits on small business expensing

6. Five-year carryback of net operating losses

7. Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses from 10 to 7 years to allow small business greater flexibility in their investments   
8. Temporary small business estimated tax payment relief to allow small businesses to keep needed cash on hand

From the Small Business Jobs Act:

9. Zero capital gains taxes on key investments in small businesses

10. Raising the small business expensing to $500,000

11. An extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation

12. A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed

13. Tax relief and simplification for cell phone deductions

14. An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs’ start-up expenses

15. A five-year carryback of general business credits

16. Limitations on penalties for errors in tax reporting that disproportionately affect small business

And from the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act:

17. 100 percent expensing

Tax experts at conservative think tanks like Heritage and Americans for Tax Reform don't quibble much with the list, but they do with the context. ""I can't argue with any of these, but it ignores all the proposed and enacted tax hikes on small business,"" said Ryan Ellis, director of tax policy at Americans For Tax Reform.

For example, he said, it ignores President Obama's proposal to allow Bush-era individual income tax cuts to expire for those making more than $250,000. ""A clear majority of small business profits are earned in households making at least $250,000 per year."" Ellis said. ""...That's a tax hike on the small business sector.""

There are also a number of tax increases included in the health care law, Ellis said, some of which apply directly to small businesses. For one, he said, businesses with more than 50 employees could face a tax penalty if they don't provide enough health insurance to their employees. Another example, the 10 percent tanning tax, which he said is ""nearly exclusively applied to small businesses.""

""So the overall story is much more of a problem for small firms than the Obama administration would suggest,"" Ellis said.

Curtis Dubay, senior tax policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, allowed that ""there have been targeted tax cuts for small businesses."" But, he said, ""it's an error to just point to the number of tax cuts. You have to look at the overall impact and that certainly has been steep tax hikes.""

Dubay also noted that six of the 17 cuts were not just for small businesses but were made widely available to all businesses.

Richard Morrison at the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group, said that ""nothing on (the White House list) stands out as egregiously unjustified from a fact-checking perspective. Some of them are temporary, and some aren’t targeted exclusively at small businesses, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they shouldn’t 'count' as far as Rep. Wasserman Schultz’s claim is concerned.""

We think there's room for critics to note that in addition to the 17 tax cuts enumerated by the White House, there are there are also some tax increases in the health care law that will fall on some of the same small business owners that got tax cuts. Some health care law tax increases won't go into effect for a couple years. And with some, like the excise taxes on tanning beds, one could argue it is a tax on the customer, not the small business. As for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire, that might certainly affect a number of small business owners. But that's still just an Obama proposal. It hasn't happened. The only policy actually signed by the president so far was a compromise agreement that extended the tax cuts through 2012. So we rate Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/dnc-chair-wasserman-schultz-says-obama-has-signed-/
