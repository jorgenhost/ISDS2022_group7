No evidence that Trump invoked federal Insurrection Act. And he’s not still president.
","A post hotly circulated on Facebook claims the country is in the control of Donald Trump and the military because Trump, less than a week before his successor’s inauguration, invoked something known as the Insurrection Act. The Facebook user claims ""a high-up and trusted military source"" confirmed that Trump signed the law on Jan. 14, giving himself two more months as president; that the military extended that by two months to May 20; and ""most likely extended again by the military who is now in control…. I am assured that he still is president."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s a new take on a previously discredited claim. There’s no evidence Trump invoked the Insurrection Act. And he is not still president.  President Joe Biden’s inauguration occurred Jan. 20, and Trump stopped being president at noon that day. The Insurrection Act, signed by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, empowers the president, in limited circumstances, to deploy the military and federalize National Guard troops to suppress certain situations including civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion. The act has been used to send the armed forces to quell civil disturbances a number of times during U.S. history. It was most recently invoked during the 1992 Los Angeles riots after four white police officers were acquitted in the roadside beating of a Black man, Rodney King. But there’s nothing in the law that would allow a president to extend his term. ""The Insurrection Act in no way gives an outgoing president additional time in office. It only authorizes the president to use the military to assist states against insurrection upon their request, to enforce federal law during times of unrest and to help enforce federal constitutional rights,"" said Scott Anderson, a governance studies expert at the Brookings Institution, citing Title 10 of the U.S. Code. ""All three of those authorizations require a proclamation first, and none allow the president to use the military in a way contrary to federal law, including by subverting the results of a legal federal election."" During Trump’s final days as president, false claims emerged on Facebook that he had invoked the Insurrection Act and would be inaugurated again as president. There was no evidence that Trump had invoked it, or that he had issued the requisite proclamation ""ordering the insurgents to disperse."" ""Every prior president to invoke the Insurrection Act has complied with this requirement,"" Anderson said. ""Trump never issued such a proclamation so, regardless of what he did or did not sign on January 14th, he did not take the steps necessary to invoke the Insurrection Act."" Syracuse University law professor Mark Nevitt, whose specialties include constitutional and national security law, said there is no evidence that the National Guard has been federalized, or the military has been activated under Insurrection Act authorities.  ""President Biden is currently the commander in chief and Lloyd Austin is the secretary of defense; they have legal authority over the military,"" he said.

No, murder is not legal in a ‘zone of death’ in Yellowstone National Park
","If you believe social media users, there is one area of Yellowstone National Park that you should avoid at all costs when planning your summer vacation.  ""There is a place in the U.S. where murder is legal,"" a TikTok user claimed in a video.  In the video, a man claims that a ""zone of death"" exists in Yellowstone National Park. As he speaks, a map of Yellowstone and the state borders within the park appears behind him.  ""You see this little 50-mile strip of land in Idaho?"" he asks viewers. ""That is where murder is legal, and here's why. In all criminal proceedings in the U.S., the jury has to live in both the state and the district in which a crime took place. In other words, if there’s any crime that happens in this little strip of land, the jury in the trial has to be people that live in this little strip of land. The problem is that no one lives there, so the case would just get thrown out."" So, has this TikTok user discovered a foolproof scheme to get away with murder?  No. The TikTok video simply called a longstanding constitutional mystery back into the spotlight.  Legally, things are a bit complicated in a 50-square-mile region of Idaho that has been labeled the ""zone of death."" But, no, murder isn’t legal there. In 2005, Brian Kalt, a Michigan State University law professor, published a paper titled ""The Perfect Crime,"" in which he explored the idea that ""there is a 50-square-mile swath of Idaho in which one might be able to commit felonies with impunity."" He dubbed it the ""Zone of Death."" Kalt argued that this peculiarity existed ""because of the intersection of a poorly drafted statute with a clear but neglected constitutional provision: the Sixth Amendment’s Vicinage Clause."" The Sixth Amendment says, ""In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed."" While this requirement is typically not an issue, Yellowstone National Park presents a unique challenge. The park is primarily in Wyoming, but it spreads into Idaho and Montana. In terms of federal judicial districts, Congress assigned the entire park to the District of Wyoming.  So, what would happen if, hypothetically, someone were to commit a felony or a Class A misdemeanor in Idaho’s small strip of Yellowstone National Park, where the federal government has jurisdiction? (Kalt noted that his analysis doesn’t apply to lesser crimes, where the accused isn’t guaranteed a jury trial.) Keeping the Sixth Amendment provision in mind, the jury for a federal criminal trial would need to be made up of individuals who live in Idaho, and who fall within the federal District of Wyoming — that is people, who live on that same swath of Yellowstone.  But no one lives there. As a result, Kalt argued, no jury could ever be assembled that would satisfy the Sixth Amendment provisions.  Additionally, Kalt said that only the defendants in federal criminal cases can request a change of venue. In his paper, Kalt theorized that such a case could be dismissed: ""Assuming that you do not feel like consenting to trial in Cheyenne, you should go free."" That’s the argument in the TikTok video, too. But in practice, it’s not quite that simple. When PolitiFact reached out to Kalt about the TikTok user’s claims, he emphasized that the claim that murder was legal in the so-called ""zone of death"" was inaccurate. The loophole ""does not make murder legal in the zone,"" Kalt said. ""It just presents a reason why it might be harder to prosecute someone for it successfully. But breaking the law is breaking the law, whatever happens to the person who does it.""  Since Kalt’s paper was published, the ""zone of death"" has received more attention. It inspired the 2008 novel ""Free Fire"" and ""Population Zero,"" a 2016 horror movie.  Kalt lobbied Congress to change the law so that the Idaho and Montana portions of Yellowstone fell within their respective state’s districts. But the legal loophole remains unclosed. To date, no felonies in the ""zone of death"" have been prosecuted.  When a hunter illegally shot an elk while standing in the Montana portion of Yellowstone and argued for his right to a trial with a jury made up of people who lived in that region, Vox reported that ""the court dismissed the argument out of hand."" The hunter later took a plea agreement that prevented him from appealing on Sixth Amendment grounds. It remains unclear exactly how justice would be pursued for crimes committed in the ""zone of death."" ""I don’t think the prosecution would just give up,"" Kalt said.  He pointed out that the loophole has limitations that ""sensationalistic sources like the TikTok video ignore,"" and noted that his argument was theoretical. ""The theory is just a theory,"" he said. ""So people shouldn’t talk about it like it is some well-settled precedent.""  A TikTok user claimed, ""There is a place in the U.S. where murder is legal."" A provision in the Sixth Amendment might make prosecuting some crimes committed within the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park complicated. It hasn’t been done before, and it’s unclear exactly what would happen. But murder isn’t legal in that region or anywhere else.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jun/04/tiktok-posts/no-murder-not-legal-zone-death-yellowstone-nationa/

"['Taxes', 'Texas', 'Don Huffines']","
Texas has some of the highest property taxes in the nation
","Former GOP state Sen. Don Huffines’ recently launched gubernatorial bid is wagering that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott isn’t Republican enough for Texas.  According to his nascent campaign website, the border is too open, the voter rolls are too rife with ""illegal aliens,"" and the taxes are too high. To cure the state of its taxation problem, Huffines’ campaign proposes an unusual solution for a state that already doesn’t collect income taxes — the elimination of property taxes altogether.   ""Texans have some of the highest property taxes in the nation, and the tax only goes up,"" his campaign website says.  ""We will put the broken property tax system on a path to zero,"" it continues. There’s little question that property taxes in Texas have generally been rising year over year. The Texas Comptroller’s Biennial Property Tax Report shows that single family home values have been on the rise since 2010, resulting in a corresponding rise in the property taxes levied by local governments in each of those years.   In 2010, local governments in Texas collected $40.2 billion in property taxes. By 2019, the latest year for which data is available, that number had risen to $67.2 billion. Nearly half of these totals is collected from property taxes levied on single family homes.   But has this rise launched Texas’ taxes into the realm of high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey? Does Texas now have ""some of the highest property taxes in the nation,"" as Huffines claims?  State and local governments depend on tax revenue flowing from three different categories, explained Kevin Erdmann, a tax policy expert at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.   ""There's three pretty basic areas of taxation: sales tax, income tax and property tax,"" he said. ""Those are the big three to choose from and each state has chosen to weight each one slightly differently. But at the end of the day they all have bills to pay.""   Texas is one of nine states that doesn’t collect income tax revenue, therefore relying more heavily on the two other areas of taxation.   ""I don't think there's much dispute about Texas focusing on property taxes. Typically in discussions about tax bases, Texas will be referenced as a state that's a good example of a state that depends on property taxes as a revenue source,"" Erdmann explained.    But there isn’t a perfect method for comparing Texas’ dependence on property tax revenue to other states. This is partly because states tax real property in a variety of ways. For instance, while some states impose a tax rate on a home’s market value, others impose it on a percentage of the market value, according to the Tax Foundation, a non-partisan and pro-business think tank. In some states, counties also can differ in how levies are calculated.  According to Janelle Cammenga, a policy analyst with the Tax Foundation’s Center for State Tax Policy, there’s a variety of ways property tax burdens on residential properties can be measured.  ""There are a couple different ways you can compare, none of them are perfect, but they can all kind of give you an idea of where Texas is going to lie,"" Cammenga said.   For instance, state rankings could be organized by property tax collections per capita, which would provide a rough estimate by dividing a state’s total residential property tax payments by its number of residents.   Under this methodology, Texas would have the 13th highest property tax burden with Texans paying $1,973 per year, according to a Tax Foundation analysis. Washington D.C., New Jersey and New Hampshire would top that list, each with over $3,000 in annual per capita property tax payments. Another way to rank states would be to compare states’ effective tax rates on owner-occupied housing, or the average amount of residential property tax payments. This method takes home values into account by expressing this average amount as a percentage of home value.   Here, Texas would rank No. 6, with homeowners paying about 1.6% of their home value in property taxes per year, according to the Tax Foundation’s analysis. New Jersey again tops that list, followed by Illinois and New Hampshire.   This methodology also was used in an analysis cited by Huffines campaign spokesperson. According to this Wallet Hub study, released earlier this year, Texas’ effective tax rate is the 7th highest in the nation.  A third way to compare is by looking at how property tax burdens compare across counties. For instance, which states have the most counties with median property tax payments of over $5,000?  New Jersey has 19 counties in which the median property tax burden is higher than $5,000 per year — the highest in the nation. Texas would rank 7th, after New York, Illinois, California, New Hampshire and Connecticut, according to the Tax Foundation.  In Texas, the high watermark is set by Collin County, where the median property tax burden is $5,600. Fort Bend County and Travis County follow with median taxes at $5,563 and $5,439, respectively.  ""It’s safe to say that Texas tends to have pretty high property taxes,"" Cammenga said. ""Whether or not it’s the highest — that really hard to say. They're probably not, but it is up there.""  It's unclear exactly how feasible it would be for a state to eliminate property taxes altogether, especially one that already doesn’t collect income taxes, experts said. In 2018, property taxes made up 44% of state and local tax collections in Texas.  Both experts we spoke with agreed that, if Huffines were elected and able to fulfill this campaign promise, Texas would be the first state in the nation to eliminate property taxes.  ""Eliminating that is a really tall order. That's almost half of (Texas’) tax collections,"" Cammenga said. ""I don't know of a state that has eliminated property taxes, because it's such an essential part of local finances.""  ""I don't think there's another state that has literally zero property tax,"" Erdmann said.  Huffines has pledged to eliminate property taxes if elected governor. He justifies this pledge by claiming that Texas has ""some of the highest property taxes in the nation.""  There are several different ways to compare and rank states’ property tax burden. From the ranking methodologies reviewed here, Texas has between the 6th highest and 13th highest property taxes.  Huffines’ statement is somewhat subjective — there’s no absolute way to define ""some of the highest."" Nonetheless, experts generally agree that, even though there’s no standard way to compare and rank states‘ property tax burden, Texas is heavily dependent on property tax revenue.   We rate this claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2021/jun/04/don-huffines/texas-has-some-highest-property-taxes-nation/

Sticker shock: Ron DeSantis exaggerates cost of gas pump stickers with Nikki Fried's picture
","Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a Democrat, mounted her campaign for governor with a rebuke of conditions under two decades of Republican leadership. ""I’m here to break the rigged system in Florida,"" Fried said in her June 1 video announcement. ""It’s corrupt. It’s anti-democratic. And it’s time for something new."" Asked about her campaign, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis dismissed Fried as someone who is more show than substance and ""has done nothing in office."" ""She put her face, spent millions of dollars to put her face on every gas pump across this state, purely to boost her own image at your expense as a taxpayer,"" DeSantis said June 2. .@NikkiFried is a #lockdownlobbyist who has opposed every commonsense measure that has kept Florida safe and free like open schools, businesses, and places of worship. @GovRonDeSantis has done more in one week than Fried in her time as Ag Commisioner. pic.twitter.com/yw3pQp6YL0 Fried’s photo had been on many gas pumps in Florida. She added it to the customary inspection sticker that verifies that the pump is delivering the correct amount of gas and does not have a card skimmer. Those inspections are a standard part of the Agriculture and Consumer Services Department that Fried oversees. But those stickers didn’t cost millions of dollars. The cost was about $5,000. We asked DeSantis’ office about this, and they said they would look into the labor costs. We did not hear further. Fried’s campaign sent us two invoices from vendors: One for 120,000 stickers bought by Fried’s Republican predecessor, and one for 120,000 with her picture. The stickers the department bought in 2014 under Commissioner Adam Putnam cost $5,022. His face was not on the stickers. When we contacted the Iowa-based vendor, the sales department told us the 120 rolls purchased would have had either 500 or 1,000 stickers per roll. (The higher number seems more likely; otherwise, the state would have spent $5,000 for half as many stickers as Fried purchased.)   The 120,000 stickers bought on Fried’s watch from a Tallahassee vendor cost $5,027.16.   From these records, it looks like Fried’s department spent $5.16 more than in 2014 for the same number of stickers under Putnam. The sticker chosen by Fried, the only Democrat elected statewide, did not sit well with state Republican lawmakers. The Legislature in 2019 reacted to the stickers with Fried’s photo by adding a clause to the budget to bar them. By 2020, the Agriculture Department had changed the design for new stickers, but the old ones remained. In February 2020, lawmakers threatened to put a hold on $19.7 million in spending until the department submitted a plan for removing the stickers with Fried’s photo. The department removed the stickers and replaced them with ones lacking Fried’s face. FDACS inspection stickers used in 2019 vs. 2020. (Courtesy Tampa Bay Times, Fried campaign) Fried is far from the first politician to use official business to boost her name recognition. The doyen of the practice was North Carolina Labor Commissioner Cherie Berry who, starting in 2005, put her photo on every elevator certificate in the state. It seemed to work. One analysis found that come election time, Berry, a Republican, did better in counties with a higher count of elevators per 1,000 residents. In the pre-digital days, Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer — who served from 1971 to 1987 — had every bus stop bench and construction site sign painted with the slogan ""William Donald Schaefer and the citizens of Baltimore.""  Schaefer took his cue from Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. Shortly before Schaefer won election in 1970, he toured Chicago where he saw Daley’s name everywhere. ""That’s the way to do it,"" he told a Baltimore business leader with him on the trip. DeSantis said Fried spent millions of taxpayer dollars to put her face on gas pump stickers across Florida. The sticker with Fried’s image really did happen, but DeSantis’ number is way off — he overshoots by a factor of 400, at least. The most the state paid was about $5,000. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, American Rescue Plan does not cost more than World War II
","Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been some eye-popping numbers coming out of Washington, D.C., including this one: $1.9 trillion. That’s the price tag for the Biden Administration’s COVID stimulus plan. The measure cleared the Senate and House on narrow, largely party-line votes. All of Wisconsin’s Democrats supported the plan, while all Republicans were opposed. Republican Derrick Van Orden, who lost to 12-term U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-La Crosse, by fewer than 3 percentage points in 2020, and has said he’ll run again in 2022, has been hammering Kind on the package’s cost. For example, on May 11, 2021, Kind sent this tweet: ""Thanks to the #AmericanRescuePlan, Wisconsin is receiving over $50M in funding for our seniors. This money will help provide relief and expand access to meals, vaccines, caregiver support, health resources, and more.""  That same day, Van Orden retweeted Kind’s message and added this, in part:  ""@RepRonKind Has spent more $ in 100+ days than was spent fighting WWII, setting the country on the road to record inflation that will destroy our senior's retirements."" Is Van Orden right about the cost of the American Rescue Plan, the primary measure that has passed since Biden took office in January? In short, let’s say the claim is, well, inflated. Van Orden did not respond to emails from PolitiFact Wisconsin requesting backup for his claim.  But let’s dig in anyway, with this important note up front: When comparing dollar amounts over time -- particularly a period of about eight decades -- you can’t just look at raw spending totals. Everything costs far more now than it did then. In other words, for a fair comparison, you have to control for inflation. In June 2019, USA Today published an article titled ""What were the 13 most expensive wars in U.S. history?""  To compile the list 24/7 Wall St., a Delaware company that runs an online financial news operation, used a 2010 report from the Congressional Research Service titled ""Costs of Major U.S. Wars"" and updated the numbers for inflationary purposes.  For some context, here are the top five wars, and total U.S. spending (all in 2019 dollars). 5. Korean War: $389.81 billion 4. Vietnam War: $843.63 billion 3. War in Afghanistan: $910.47 billion 2. Iraq War: $1.01 trillion 1. World War II: $4.69 trillion   So, World War II -- which the U.S. entered in 1941 and which lasted until 1945 -- is the most expensive, by far.  But it was far more expensive than the Biden Administration’s stimulus package, not the reverse as Van Orden claimed. What’s more, the $1.9 trillion stimulus passed under President Joe Biden was less than the $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed under Republican President Donald Trump in March 2020. All told, the various stimulus and relief bills passed under Trump in 2020 tallied $3.8 trillion. To be sure, Biden has proposed several massive spending plans, including a separate American Jobs Plan -- a $2.3 trillion development package aimed at improving the nation's aging infrastructure, among other spending. His recently-unveiled federal budget includes $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade.  But Van Orden did not cite those measures in tweeting his claim about Kind. Rather, he specifically responded to a Kind tweet about the American Rescue Plan and cited what Kind had already voted for, not what is on the table. Van Orden said ""@RepRonKind ""has spent more $ in 100+ days than was spent fighting WWII.""  According to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report, and additional calculations to cover more recent inflation, World War II’s price tag (in 2019 dollars) was $4.69 trillion. The American Rescue Plan signed into law in March by Biden -- and supported by Kind -- carries a cost of $1.9 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  We rate Van Orden’s claim False.    ",/factchecks/2021/jun/04/derrick-van-orden/no-american-rescue-plan-does-not-cost-more-world-w/

No, Stanley Meyer was not assassinated by the Pentagon
","A decades-old conspiracy theory claiming the Pentagon assassinated an Ohio inventor resurfaced recently thanks to a widely circulating Facebook post. The May 25 post includes a nearly one-minute video showing a man reacting to an old news broadcast from the now-defunct WTVN-TV in Columbus, Ohio. The broadcast is a segment on a local man named Stanley Meyer showing off what he claimed was a water-powered car that he invented. ""Imagine if we all had water powered cars,"" the caption on the post says. ""Pentagon killed this man."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post alludes to the theory that Meyer’s death in 1998 was due not to natural causes but to an assassination by the government to suppress his invention. But there’s no evidence of that. In the credulous WTVN broadcast, a reporter said an official from the Pentagon had visited Meyer to check on his invention. That statement has helped fuel suspicions that the government had something to do with his death.  In an email to PolitiFact, a Pentagon spokesperson said the agency doesn’t have any information on Meyer or his death.  Meyer was an inventor with no formal scientific background who claimed to have developed a ""water fuel cell"" that could be used instead of gasoline to power a car. The fuel cell purportedly worked by breaking down the water into hydrogen and oxygen, and using the hydrogen to power the car. Meyer claimed during the broadcast his fuel cell could run on ""rain water, well water, city water, ocean water."" However, it was unclear how his fuel cell would be able to split the water into its component elements, as Meyer also claimed the process required a fraction of the energy it would normally take to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen.   Such a technology would have had to to defy the first and second laws of thermodynamics in order to work, according to Nature magazine, which dismissed the idea of water as fuel as a long-running myth. Energy cannot be created or destroyed and, when energy is transformed from one form to another, its final state cannot be greater than its initial state, unless energy is added to the system. (Some newly developed electric vehicles use a hydrogen-powered fuel cell to produce electricity, and emit only water vapor.) Meyer claimed that the U.S. government was interested in his water fuel cell. His twin brother, Stephen, reported that he and Meyer were dining with potential foreign investors at a Cracker Barrel in Ohio on March 20, 1998, when Stanley Meyer suddenly felt a jolt of pain in his neck, according to the Columbus Dispatch. As Stanley Meyer rushed out of the restaurant, he told his brother ""they poisoned me"" and, once outside, fell to the ground and died at the age of 57. Because of the suddenness of his death and Meyer’s dying declaration, the police investigation into the incident took three months, according to the paper. However, no evidence of foul play was ever discovered. The Franklin County coroner's office determined Meyer had high blood pressure and died of a brain aneurysm, the Dispatch reported. The only drugs found in his system were lidocaine and phenytoin — seizure medication. High blood pressure is one of the risk factors associated with a brain aneurysm, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms of an aneurysm include a sudden headache, stiff neck, vomiting and seizures. The coroner’s report obtained by the Dispatch initially described Meyer’s dining companions as officers from NATO. One of the investors with Meyer at the time of his death, Philippe Vandemoortele, told a Netherlands blog in 2020 that he doesn't know why he was identified as a NATO officer or how rumors that Meyer had been deliberately killed started.   ""I have some doubts about whether his death happened by chance, but I know nothing more than anyone else,"" he told the blog. ""What is certain is that I didn’t kill him, he was my friend and I even paid his bills the week before."" A Facebook post said Stanley Meyer, a man who claimed to have invented a water-powered car, was killed by the Pentagon. Meyer claimed he was poisoned moments before he died in 1998, fueling speculation that his death was suspicious. But a police investigation found no evidence of foul play, and his death was ruled the result of a brain aneurysm brought on in part by high blood pressure.

No one's stripping the Pledge and July 4th from Virginia school lessons
","Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin says that Terry McAuliffe, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, wants to restrict Virginia schools from teaching about Independence Day and the Pledge of Allegiance.  Youngkin worked the claim into his talking points in May. Here are three examples: During a May 4 interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Youngkin said Democrats are ""next onto...taking the Pledge of Allegiance and the Fourth of July out of the curriculum of things that actually bind us together, unite us as Americans and Virginians. And it just seems like Terry McAuliffe and the left liberal Democrats here want to take our education policy from having everybody in the fast lane to having everybody in the broken down lane."" Youngkin’s campaign repeated the claim in a May 4 Facebook post urging voters to watch his interview with Carlson. ""Youngkin speaks on Fox News about Democrats and liberal Terry McAuliffe pushing a radical political agenda in Virginia, including...removing the Pledge of Allegiance and the Fourth of July from curriculum, teaching divisive critical race theory in the classroom, and more,"" his campaign wrote. On May 14, Youngkin told Fox News host Laura Ingraham, ""We're actually going to take the Fourth of July and the Pledge of Allegiance out of the list of things that bind us. This is just part of the agenda of the liberal left led by Terry McAuliffe and (Gov.) Ralph Northam.""  We fact checked Youngkin’s claims and found no evidence that McAuliffe wants to remove Independence Day and the Pledge of Allegiance from school curriculum or that there is a Democratic agenda to do so. Youngkin’s proof Macaulay Porter, Youngkin’s campaign spokesperson, says Youngkin’s claims are based on the August 2020 final report of the Virginia Commission on African American History Education in the Commonwealth. The 34-member panel of educators was appointed by Gov. Ralph Northam a year earlier to recommend ways of broadening instruction about Black experiences into teaching American history. Porter pointed to an item on Page 48 of the report in a section recommending changes to some of the state’s ""essential knowledge"" guidelines about history for first graders. One current standard is teaching, ""People in Virginia’s communities are united as Americans by common principles and traditions, such as celebrating Independence Day (and) pledging allegiance to the flag."" The commission recommended changing the standard to requiring first graders to know that, ""people in Virginia’s communities are united as Americans by common principles and traditions."" The specific mention of July Fourth and the Pledge would be lifted from the guideline. ""Glenn said this proposal to remove the Fourth of July and the Pledge of Allegiance is part of the liberal agenda, and that McAuliffe is leading that liberal agenda,"" Porter wrote in an email. ""Both of those things are undeniably true."" Holes in Youngkin’s claim There are huge problems with Youngkin’s claim. For starters, he has not offered any statement by McAuliffe on teaching about Independence Day and the Pledge. We’re unaware that such a statement exists. McAuliffe has called Youngkin’s claim a ""falsehood."" The commission’s report was submitted to the Virginia Board of Education, which sets standards for learning and must approve any changes to them. The board will begin considering new standards for history next year that are scheduled to go into effect in  the 2024-2025 school year and remain for seven years. It’s up to the board to adopt recommendations by the commission. Dan Gecker, president of the state Board of Education, said Youngkin’s statement misconstrues the commission's work. He said the report does not recommend removing Independence Day and the Pledge from instruction and the board is not considering such action. ""Oh, my gosh, no,"" he said. ""Can you picture that?"" Gecker said the deletion Youngkin points to is not a policy proposal, but merely a ""technical edit"" the commission recommended to a subset of standards. The board did not adopt the change during an Oct. 14, 2020 meeting when it reviewed the commission’s proposals for technical edits. But even if the board had removed the language in the section Youngkin points to, state standards would have still required teaching about the Pledge and the Fourth in kindergarten through second grade. By the end of second grade, students must know ""the words and the meaning of the Pledge of Allegiance."" They must be able to ""describe why United States citizens celebrate major holidays, including...Independence Day."" Beyond the standards, state law requires all students ""to learn the Pledge of Allegiance and to demonstrate such knowledge."" It mandates ""the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in each classroom,"" although students can decline to participate. ""The State Board of Education, even if it wanted to, couldn’t remove the Pledge of Allegiance from schools,"" said Charles Pyle, director of communications for the state Department of Education. ""It would take an act from the General Assembly."" Our ruling Youngkin says Terry McAuliffe favors ""taking the Pledge of Allegiance and the Fourth of July out of the (school) curriculum."" It’s one of at least three Youngkin claims that McAuliffe ""leads a liberal agenda"" to do so. But Youngkin hasn’t produced any evidence McAuliffe supports such action, and we haven’t found any. Moreover, there’s no evidence of a Democratic agenda to limit teaching about the Fourth and the Pledge. A commission seeking to broaden instruction about Black participation in American history recommended removing a reference to the Pledge and the Fourth from one subsection of state learning standards.  Youngkin ignores that the state Board of Education did not adopt that recommendation. Even if the board had approved it, other sections of the standards would still require teaching about the Fourth  and the Pledge. And he ignores that - beyond the board’s purview - state law requires students to learn the Pledge. We rate Youngkin’s claim False.  ",/factchecks/2021/jun/03/glenn-youngkin/no-ones-stripping-pledge-and-july-4th-virginia-sch/

The country's credit rating is down, but is Florida's up?
","
In light of Standard & Poor's recent downgrade of America's credit rating from AAA to AA+, Republicans in Florida are trying to draw a contrast with President Barack Obama by claiming -- or at least passing along the news -- that Florida's credit rating has been upgraded.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott made the declaration Aug. 11, 2011, in an interview with Panama City radio station WFLA 94.5

""Our credit rating went up since I've been in office,"" he said. ""And their credit rating (the federal government's) is dropping because they’re not doing what we're doing in Florida. We are the most fiscal responsible state in the country.""

We've seen similar claims pop up repeatedly in the past few days. For example:

• Adam Hasner, a former state House member and a candidate for U.S. Senate, tweeted, ""S&P's upgrade of FL's credit proves balanced budget is first step towards fiscal solvency."" 
• The Republican Party of Florida also posted the good news on Twitter. ""Obama & the federal govt could learn a few things from FL & @FLGovScott—FL's credit rating was recently upgraded to AAA.""

• Same for Scott's official campaign Twitter feed @ScottForFlorida, which sent this message: ""RT @FreedomsMob: USA downgraded by S&P, Florida upgraded to AAA by S&P http://t.co/F2qa5XK.""

The link takes people to an interview between Scott and CNBC host Larry Kudlow. ""While the U.S. had its own debt downgraded, the Sunshine State of Florida (got) upgraded by S&P,"" Kudlow said before introducing Scott.

Did Florida's credit rating go up, while the United States' credit rating went down?

Standard & Poor's is a New York-based ratings agency that studies the financial markets. It issues guidance to investors and rates various investments for financial risk. That includes investments in public debt, such as bonds issued by the state of Florida.

S&P spokesman Olayinka Fadahunsi told us that Florida has held S&P's AAA rating since February 2005. That means the agency considers Florida to have ""extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments.""

It's also the highest rating the agency gives.

So how could Florida's rating have been upgraded?

It wasn't, Fadahunsi said.

Here's what happened: In January 2009, the agency changed its outlook on Florida debt. An ""outlook"" is an evaluation of the likely direction of a rating over six months to two years. In 2009, S&P's outlook on Florida's rating dropped from ""stable,"" which means that a rating isn't likely to change, to ""negative,"" which means that a rating may be lowered.

In July 2011, as the United States was having its rating issues, things reversed course in Florida. S&P revised its outlook for Florida from negative back to stable (registration required to see report) based on the latest budget passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Scott.

""The outlook revision reflects our view of the progress the state has made in addressing its structural imbalance through significant cost-cutting measures adopted in fiscal 2012 and maintenance of strong reserves,"" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst John Sugden-Castillo.

The outlook change did not affect Florida's AAA rating.

We also asked S&P spokesman Fadahunsi whether the agency considers a change in outlook a credit ""upgrade.""

""We don't consider outlook changes upgrades or downgrades,"" he said.

State Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater put it best in an Aug. 9, 2011, interview with the St. Petersburg Times. ""Florida was AAA before the downgrade, it's AAA today, and in fact the rating agencies just upgraded our longer term outlook,"" Atwater said.

Part of the problem with this myth is that the media has at times perpetuated it. On Aug. 16, for instance, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece headlined ""Upgrading the States.""

It began:

""Ohio and Florida get plenty of attention as Presidential election swing states, but this year they deserve notice for another reason. While Uncle Sam was having its debt downgraded, Ohio and Florida both got upgrades from Standard & Poor's in July as a result of their improved fiscal management.""

After more detail about Ohio, it added:

""Ditto for Florida, which won a AAA rating after closing a budget hole with what S&P said were 'significant cost-cutting measures' and making a commitment to maintaining strong reserves. Governor Rick Scott's 2012 budget was praised for 'significant measures' to address its budget deficit and for being 'proactive in reducing expenditures to adjust for revenue shortfalls.'""

We also found this Aug. 16 report from WOKV radio in Jacksonville. ""While the United States credit rating with Standard & Poor's may have been downgraded recently, Florida's jumped from AA+ to AAA."" 
The WOKV report quotes Atwater as seemingly acknowledging the ratings upgrade. ""We went through, got lower pricing, because a triple A bond rating can give us that. In this marketplace, there aren't many of us out there who have that rating,"" Atwater said, according to the report. 
But CFO spokeswoman Alexis Lambert said the report misinterpreted Atwater. ""The CFO was discussing Standard & Poor's revised outlook for Florida from negative to stable and the state’s ability to refinance bonds in the current market conditions,"" Lambert told us. 
To recap: Florida's credit rating was upgraded to AAA in 2005 while Jeb Bush was governor. Its rating has been the same ever since. The only thing that changed is S&P's outlook on Florida debt. It went from stable to negative, then back to stable. But that isn't considered an upgrade, the ratings agency says.

(We should note that Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida, corrected his tweet about the credit rating. ""Correction: S&P made positive change to the outlook of FL's credit worthiness, not the rating."")

Standard & Poor's did react favorably to Florida's budget behavior this year. Both the S&P press release and a longer report we reviewed from the July outlook change spoke highly of Florida's fiscal strategy, especially its willingness to cut spending as revenue dropped. But it's not accurate to say Florida's credit rating went up, so we rule Scott's statement False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/17/rick-scott/countrys-credit-rating-down-floridas/
"['Candidate Biography', 'History', 'Foreign Policy', 'States', 'Texas', 'Jay Carney']","
White House press secretary says Perry ""wanted to secede from the union""
","Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, brought up secession when a New York Times columnist asked about the latest Republican presidential aspirant, Texas Gov. Rick Perry.

In her op-ed column posted online Aug. 16, 2011, Maureen Dowd describes the stumping Perry as galloping ""through Iowa like an unbroken stallion in danger of cracking a leg."" Her column notes that the governor called President Barack Obama ""the greatest threat to our country"" and questioned Obama’s patriotism and sense of duty.

Also mentioned: Perry saying Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would be treated ""ugly"" in Texas for tackling the economic slump by printing more money. In Cedar Rapids on Aug. 15, Perry said ""printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost ... treasonous in my opinion.""

Obama, Dowd writes, batted away the Texan. Her column then quotes Carney telling her: ""We may disagree with our political opponents, but we certainly think they’re all patriots — even those who wanted to secede from the union."" We take that as Obama's spokesman saying Perry wanted Texas to secede. But did Perry say that?

Asked for backup information, White House spokesman Adam Abrams pointed us to an April 17, 2009, Austin American-Statesman news article recapping Perry’s response to an Associated Press reporter who had asked him about people associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas.

Perry, who had just spoken at an April 15, 2009, Austin tea party rally, suggested Texans might at some point get so fed up with Democratic-led actions in Washington that they would want to secede. PolitiFact Texas later transcribed the exchange:

Reporter Kelley Shannon: ""Some have associated you with the idea of secession or sovereignty for your state...""

Perry: ""Oh, I think there’s a lot of different scenarios. Texas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that.

""You know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention. We’ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we’re a pretty independent lot to boot.""

A day after the rally, the Statesman reported, Perry called potential secession a ""side issue of Texas history. ... We are very proud of our Texas history; people discuss and debate the issues of can we break ourselves into five states, can we secede, a lot of interesting things that I'm sure Oklahoma and Pennsylvania would love to be able to say about their states, but the fact is, they can't because they're not Texas.""

As noted recently by the Texas Tribune, Perry also touched on secession before the rally. He’s heard in audio accompanied by still photographs posted on YouTube in March 2009 telling tech bloggers visiting him in his Capitol office that from its beginnings as a state, ""one of the deals was"" that Texas could leave the union ""any time we want."" Perry continues on the recording: ""So we’re kind of thinking about that again."" His guests laughed. An anonymous Texas blogger takes credit here for putting the audio and pictures together.

This week, we reached one of the tech bloggers, Robert Scoble of Half Moon Bay, Calif., who said the meeting occurred because the bloggers were in Austin for a conference. He said the visitors thought Perry ""was being funny. I always thought"" Perry’s secession reference ""was just Texas bragging"" mixed with Perry’s disappointment in the country’s direction.

By email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said she has no details about the meeting. She said, though: ""The governor was not advocating secession. He never has and he never will.""

After Perry made his April 2009 comment, a Perry spokeswoman told the Statesman that Perry believes Texas could secede if it wanted. Not so, advised Sanford Levinson, a professor at the School of Law at the University of Texas at Austin, saying that between the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and the 1845 Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States, there is no explicit right for the state to return to its days as a republic.

""We actually fought a war over this issue, and there is no possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a 'right' to secede,"" Levinson said in an e-mail. Levinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows for Texas to break itself into five states but doesn't specify whether that would require congressional approval — and forming new states still wouldn't constitute secession.

That was hardly the end of the issue.

In April 2010, Perry said in an interview with Newsweek and the Texas Tribune he wanted to clear up his reply on secession the year before. ""It was asked as a, you know, what do you think about the people who shout out the word 'secede.' And I say that we live in an incredibly wonderful country and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen. …""

We rated Perry’s recap of his 2009 remarks Mostly True because he didn’t acknowledge in the later interview either his position that Texas has the right to secede or his initial speculation about ""who knows what may come"" from people angry about actions in Washington.

Also, in June 2010, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said Perry had threatened to secede, a claim we rated False.

Via the Nexis search tool, we found 169 major newspaper articles as of that time linking Perry and secession. But none quoted Perry threatening to push for secession, though critics and comedians framed his words in that way.

Our conclusion was that in a politically theatrical moment, Perry stated an old (and factually incorrect) claim that Texas retains the right to leave the union. That is not the same as his saying giddyap, I want to leave. Perry didn’t call for secession then and hasn’t since.

Cain says he did ""not exactly"" say communities have the right to ban mosques
","
Just when we thought metro Atlanta’s Herman Cain had moved past the controversy over his opinions on Islam, he tumbled right back into the fray.

The GOP candidate and former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza generated headlines in March when he said he would not hire a Muslim for his Cabinet. Cain later denied he made that statement, a claim we rated Pants on Fire.  

In July, Cain ignited another controversy after he told anchor Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he thinks communities have the right to ban mosques.

Wallace brought up the issue when he moderated Thursday’s GOP debate in Ames, Iowa.  

""You said that communities have the right to ban Muslims from building mosques, before you later apologized. ... How do you reassure people that you know enough to be president of the United States, sir?"" Wallace asked.

After some back and forth, Cain replied with this:

""The first point that you raised, about saying that communities have a right to ban mosques, no, that's not exactly what I said. Unfortunately, the people who helped you put that together have misquoted me. I have gone on record, and I put it in a press release that's available at my office that simply says that if anyone misunderstood my intent, I apologize for that. But never will I apologize for saying that Sharia law does not belong in the courts of the United States of America.""

That’s ""not exactly"" what Cain said? Then what did he say?

We contacted a campaign spokeswoman for comment but did not receive a response.

Undeterred, we looked at a transcript and video of the July 17 ""Fox News Sunday"" episode where Cain supposedly said communities have the right to ban mosques.

Cain’s remarks came as Wallace pressured him to explain his opposition to a mosque proposed for Murfreesboro, Tenn., southeast of Nashville. He had recently said it was an attempt to ""sneak"" Shariah law into the U.S. legal system.

  
WALLACE: Don't Americans have a right of whatever religion under the Constitution, which you speak so much about, to free speech and freedom to worship? 
CAIN: To the people in Murfreesboro, it is hallowed ground. They are objecting to the intentions of trying to get Sharia law. [...] 
WALLACE: But couldn't any community then say we don't want a mosque in our community? 
CAIN: They could say that. 
So in this exchange, Cain agreed that any community can ""say"" that they don’t want a mosque in their community. But did Cain mean that they have a right to ban a mosque?

A few seconds later, Cain expanded on his position: 
WALLACE: So, you're saying that any community, if they want to ban a mosque ... 
CAIN: Yes, they have the right to do that. That's not discriminating based upon religion -- against that particular religion. There is an aspect of them building that mosque that doesn't get talked about. And the people in the community know what it is and they are talking about it. 

So not only can a community ""say"" they oppose a mosque in their town. Cain told Wallace that if a community wants to block a mosque because they oppose Sharia law becoming part of the U.S. legal system, they have ""the right"" to do so. He even specified that this doesn’t count as religious discrimination.

Now, Cain mentioned during Thursday’s debate that he issued an apology on his ""Fox News Sunday"" comments, so we took a look at it. We thought it might say that the media misinterpreted him or that he really didn’t think that a community has a right to ban a mosque.  

It did not. The closest he came was this:

""I am truly sorry for any comments that may have betrayed my commitment to the U.S. Constitution and the freedom of religion guaranteed by it. Muslims, like all Americans, have the right to practice their faith freely and peacefully.""

So where does this leave us?

While Cain did not ""exactly"" say that ""communities have the right to ban mosques,"" he made this same point. Then he drove it home by adding that this does not count as religious discrimination.  

Cain comes awfully close to earning a Pants on Fire. In fact, if he said that he ""never said"" that communities have the right to ban a mosque, his trousers may well have burst into flames.

But Cain was careful. He said it was not ""exactly"" what he said. This inched his statement ever so slightly away from patent absurdity. As a result, his claim is merely False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/17/herman-cain/cain-says-he-did-not-exactly-say-communities-have-/

Mitt Romney said as governor he built a Massachusetts rainy day fund
","
Mitt Romney usually stresses his business background rather than his time as Massachusetts governor. But with President Barack Obama still reeling from the Standard & Poor’s credit downgrade, Romney has lately reminded voters of his bipartisan budget-cutting with the legislature when he was governor.

Here’s what Romney said about his work with the Democratic legislature in a speech to a Manchester Rotary club on Aug. 8, 2011.

""We worked together to find a way not to just reduce the rate of growth in spending but to actually cut back on spending in the state budget. And so I was able to do that, and then we worked together in ensuing years to hold down our spending level relative to our revenue level. And that was why at the end of my four-year term, the rainy day fund was established at more than $2 billion.""

We wanted to explore whether Romney is right that his bipartisan efforts were so successful.

To back up the claim, the Romney campaign pointed us a to series of state financial statements.

They show that shortly after he took office in 2003, Romney and the legislature did cut spending for the 2004 budget year by slightly more than 1 percent. However, spending increased in subsequent years. And they also show that when Romney left office in 2007, Massachusetts’ Rainy Day Fund did indeed hold more than $2 billion.

Massachusetts budget watchers we spoke with don’t quarrel with those particulars. They also say it's true that Romney didn’t act alone.

""Obviously he did that with the Democratic legislature."" said Geoff Beckwith, director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, a group that represents local governments in the state.

Michael Widmer of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a non-partisan fiscal policy group, presented a less-rosy picture of bipartisan cooperation but acknowledged the results. ""Romney presented budgets and the legislature rewrote his budgets, and then he’d veto a few things, and then they’d override his vetoes.""

The analysts agree that Romney’s account of his fiscal record is largely accurate but doesn’t tell the whole story.

Widmer notes that aside from 2003, when Romney and lawmakers took emergency action to cut state aid to cities and towns, spending under Romney rose every year, often far faster than the rate of inflation. The state also received more revenue after the legislature and Romney made adjustments to state fees and taxes. Romney’s campaign has characterized them as ""closing loopholes"" or  increases for a specific purpose, such as transportation. Others, however, describe them as tax hikes.

""There were no broad-based tax increases,"" said Widmer, ""but part of the revenue growth was corporate tax increases and fee increases.""

The growth of the nation's economy also played a significant role. Romney came into office during a downturn, but for much of his term his term, the stock market boomed. Collections from Massachusetts’ capital gains tax on Romney’s watch outstripped estimates by $1.3 billion.

""That’s where most of the growth in the rainy day fund came from. It wasn’t part of some sort of concerted effort to hold down spending beyond what the estimates were,"" said Beckwith.

Added Widmer, ""All of these numbers are in the context of national forces that he as governor had very little to do with or any other governor.""

Our Ruling:

Mitt Romney said he worked with Democrats to leave behind a rainy day fund that topped $2 billion. The state's financial records back that up.

But it's important to note that the spending reductions he touts occurred in just one year, 2003. Other years, thanks to economic growth, Romney and the legislature were able to increase spending. And besides the spending reductions in that one year, Massachusetts also earned a revenue windfall from a surge in capital gains receipts.

But after the federal government declared last week that it does not plan new rules affecting farm vehicles, the Illinois plans were shelved, according to Guy Tridgell, a spokesman for the Illinois agency. ""That issue is null and void,"" Tridgell told us.

Rewind: An Aug. 11, 2011, press release from the U.S. Department of Transportation says the agency’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration reviewed farm-vehicle regulations this year in an effort ""to make sure states don't go overboard in enforcing regulations on agricultural operators."" At issue, the release says, was whether some states might view tenant farmers as common or contract carriers and as not exempt like other farmers from state commercial driver’s license requirements.

The vast majority of about 1,700 public comments the agency received in response ""called for us to preserve the guidance that leaves states to carry out the farm exceptions as they have for many years,"" said the agency’s administrator, Anne Ferro. ""We want to make crystal clear that we are not imposing any new regulations.""

John Porcari, deputy secretary for the federal Transportation Department, told us that Illinois’ move toward requiring tenant farmers to have commercial driver’s licenses, which ""defied common sense,"" touched off the government’s May request for wide public comment. That request, he said, was then widely and erroneously interpreted as a signal the agency was contemplating new transportation mandates for farmers.

The result, Porcari said, was ""a bit of agricultural legend. Some people said we were attempting to require commercial driver licenses"" in situations including a tractor crossing a road. ""That wasn’t and isn’t the case,"" he said. ""We are not, repeat not, requiring"" them.

Why did even the suggestion of regulations cause a stir among farmers?

An Aug. 11, 2011, analysis by columnist Ken Root of the (Dodge City, Kan.) High Plains Journal summed up the issue. He noted that farmers have enjoyed exemptions from commercial driver regulations put in place by a 1986 federal act establishing the commercial driver's license to regulate truck drivers nationwide.

Change is likely, Root writes: ""As more sectors of the transportation industry are required to comply with regulations, farmers are less likely to remain exempt because they are seen as holding an economic advantage over the commercial haulers.

""In grain-producing areas, literally all farms of any size have a semi-trailer grain truck,"" Root’s column says. ""They use it to haul to the local elevator or farther away (even across state lines) if the price is higher. They haul for several months each year and get in the dump line with commercial operators yet they don't pay the same registration for their vehicles. That creates animosity and an opening for regulatory agencies to argue that one standard should be imposed on all vehicles and all drivers.""

Root’s column, published before the federal announcement, says that Illinois is ""targeting farmer-owned trucks to gain more revenue. The argument is that one standard should exist for all uses of a vehicle and equivalent fees should be paid.""

Hours after he made the statement we’re checking here, Perry told the Des Moines Register that he’d based his declaration on information from U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. ""Senator Grassley, when I asked him about it last night — I’ve got to go with your senior senator,"" Perry said. The newspaper said Perry’s staff, ""checking their BlackBerrys, said it might be a recent development that federal transportation officials dropped the idea.""

The newspaper said Grassley, referring to the federal announcement, wrote in an electronic newsletter last week that common sense had appeared to prevail in the matter.

Far as we can tell, the regulation questioned by Perry hasn't even been proposed at the federal level. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/16/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-government-wants-require-commercia/

Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland raps Josh Mandel as a flip flopper on abortion, gay rights
","
Former Gov. Ted Strickland recently pulled a page from the Ohio Democratic Party’s playbook to attack Josh Mandel, the Republican state treasurer who now appears to be running for the U.S. Senate.

Mandel, 33, hasn’t formally announced his candidacy but is raising money for the race and taking shots from Democrats as if he’s an official candidate.

Mandel, a former state legislator from Lyndhurst, has his eye on the seat held by Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Avon.

Strickland took up for his fellow Democrat in a recent interview with Politico, a national political news website. Strickland framed Mandel as a candidate willing to shift his ideals to further his political career.

Strickland told Politico that Mandel – whose likely Senate run has gained the support of the Senate Conservatives Fund – has not always been so staunchly conservative.

""Josh Mandel used to be pro-choice, now he’s anti-choice,"" Strickland said. ""He used to be sympathetic towards gay and lesbians and now he’s [not].""

Democrats have portrayed Mandel as a political opportunist going back to his run last year for state treasurer, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Strickland’s claim to see if Mandel is the shape-shifter his opponents have made him out to be.

Let’s slice Strickland’s attack in half, examining the accuracy of each claim.

There is no question Mandel is now anti-abortion. He has endorsed the ""heartbeat bill,"" a controversial proposed law banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.

When asked about Strickland’s comments, a spokesman for Mandel’s campaign said, ""Josh has always been solidly pro-life and believes all innocent human life should be protected.""

When we talked to Strickland, he said that Mandel seemed to grow more stringent in his anti-abortion views over time, culminating with his support of the heartbeat bill. Mandel supported exceptions to anti-abortion laws for cases of rape and incest, according to an Ohio Right to Life 2006 candidate survey. On a similar survey two years later, he didn’t list those exceptions to qualify his support for anti-abortion laws.

Ultimately, Strickland said he has no evidence to show Mandel ever supported abortion rights.

""I’m just going to have to be straight with you, I can’t give you a document or recording that supports what I said,"" Strickland said.

So Strickland’s claim that Mandel used to be ""pro-choice"" is unsupported. But did Mandel change course on his support for the gay community?

When we asked the former governor to back up that part of his statement, Strickland cited quotes from Mandel when he was involved in student government in college, and compared those words with Mandel’s more recent legislative voting record.

Mandel was president of the undergraduate student government while he attended Ohio State University. In April 2000, the student government voted to support a domestic partnership plan to allow qualified students to buy student health insurance for their domestic partners, according to The Lantern, Ohio State’s student newspaper.

Mandel supported the plan at the time.

""The undergraduate student government representatives have been and will continue to advocate for domestic partner benefits in public and private settings,"" Mandel told The Lantern. ""Students want it, students deserve it and the university has a responsibility to provide it.""

Despite his support for domestic partner benefits in 2000, Mandel nine years later voted against a bill to shield gay and transgender Ohioans from being discriminated against in housing and employment issues.

House Bill 176 sought to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of classifications for which it is illegal to discriminate for housing, employment and public-accommodation purposes. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House by a vote of 56-39, with five Republicans joining Democrats to support the measure. But the bill did not go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Mandel voted against the bill. He was not among a handful of Republicans to explain their vote on the House floor that day.

Mandel’s campaign now says he was wrong in college.

""Josh has always opposed discrimination against any American citizen and has also always believed that marriage is between one man and one woman,"" his spokesman, Anthony Conchel, said in a statement. ""He also feels he was wrong in college about domestic partner benefits and feels strongly that they should never be funded with taxpayer dollars.""

So where does that leave us?

Strickland claimed Mandel reversed his stances on two social issues – abortion and gay rights.

On the latter, Mandel’s legislative voting record and recent statements do not match up with his position in college, and the treasurer now says he was wrong in college.

Mandel said he’s always held the same view on abortion rights, and Strickland cannot prove otherwise. So we have to conclude Strickland was wrong there.

Olens: Governor isn't covered by open meetings laws
","For a few brief minutes, a breakfast meeting featuring Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens became a grievance-fest.

In May, Gov. Nathan Deal used Georgia State Patrol troopers to block a Fox 5 reporter from a news conference where Deal signed a controversial immigration bill into law. The station had just aired a story questioning his daughter-in-law’s role in raising money for the governor’s campaign.

Three months later, members of the Atlanta Press Club, which sponsored the breakfast, were still angry, and they pelted the state’s top lawyer with questions. One asked whether it was legal for Deal to use troopers to keep reporters from a news conference.

""Well, time for me to go home now,"" Olens quipped.

He continued:

""The question presented from a legal context is whether the state’s open meetings act precluded that activity. And the answer is no. The answer is the governor having a meeting isn’t, frankly, subject to the open meetings act,"" Olens said.

""It’s the governor, it’s one person, it’s not a board,"" he said. ""So if you literally look to the wording of the act it doesn’t relate to that kind of activity.""

The most powerful elected official in the state isn’t covered by state open meetings law? We thought this claim was worth a second look.

First, a word about open meetings. These laws are the reason why any citizen can pull up a chair at a county commission meeting and watch elected officials debate whether they should let developers build a new shopping center or ban residents from owning pit bulls.

This scrutiny is supposed to keep politicians honest.

When he took office, Olens said he would push for reforms that would strengthen open meetings and records laws. A hearing on the proposed changes is scheduled for Aug. 30 at the state Capitol.

Now back to Olens’ claim that ""the governor having a meeting isn’t, frankly, subject to the open meetings act.""

The state Attorney General’s Office pointed us to Title 50, Chapter 14 of Georgia’s open records law. We took a good look.

The law says that gatherings of a quorum of the members of a governing body must be open to the public and announced at least 24 hours in advance. Agencies must make agendas available to the public before the meeting and release minutes within two business days afterward.

The statute says state departments, agencies, boards, commissions, public corporations and authorities, counties, municipal corporations, school districts, and a host of other bodies are covered by the law.  

But it doesn’t say a thing about the governor.

The law doesn’t apply to governors, said Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the
Georgia First Amendment Foundation

""Mr. Olens' interpretation is correct,"" Manheimer said.

This is not to say that the governor can meet up with anyone in private, Manheimer said. If he meets with any of the bodies mentioned in the state’s open meetings law, those public officials would have to comply with that law.

And the governor can choose to abide by the law, even though he’s not technically subject to it.

State and federal statutes often protect or exempt chief executives from open meetings law, said Mark Caramanica, an expert on freedom of information laws at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. For instance, he said, a White House Cabinet meeting is closed to the public.

David Hudson, an Augusta attorney who is counsel for the Georgia Press Association, said that Georgia law was drafted this way decades ago because the priority was to ensure boards that have the authority to vote, act on and implement public policies would conduct their business publicly. A governor, as a single person, does not have this kind of power, Hudson said.  

It’s worth noting that the Georgia Legislature is exempt from open meetings law, too, thanks to the 1975 state Supreme Court decision Coggin v. Davey. Members of the media sued to complain that they were excluded from a General Assembly committee meeting, but legislators argued they weren’t covered by the open meetings law. The General Assembly won.

So there you have it. Of all the elected officials covered by Georgia’s open meetings laws, Nathan Deal isn’t one of them.

Lloyd Doggett says Texas has worse unemployment than 25 states and it's tied with Mississippi for most minimum-wage workers
","
U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett told ABC News on Aug. 11, 2011, that Gov. Rick Perry’s rosy depictions of employment conditions in Texas aren’t entirely accurate.

""Twenty-five states have lower unemployment than Texas does today,"" the Austin Democrat said, adding that ""we're tied with Mississippi for more minimum-wage jobs than anywhere in the United States.""

Is Texas middling in unemployment and tied with the Magnolia State for minimum-wage jobs?

Yes and yup.

According to the latest monthly state-by-state unemployment rates, posted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas’ seasonally adjusted June unemployment rate of 8.2 percent placed it 26th among the 50 states. North Dakota had the lowest rate, 3.2 percent. The most populous states faring better than Texas were Pennsylvania, ranked 18th (7.6 percent), and New York, which was 23rd (8 percent).

Regarding minimum-wage workers, the Austin American-Statesman said in a July 17 news article that Texas and Mississippi led the nation last year with 9.5 percent of hourly workers earning at or less than the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25. Hourly workers aren’t the entire labor force, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as adults who are working plus those lately looking and available for work.

The Statesman story says that according to the bureau, 550,000 Texans earned no more than the minimum wage in 2010, and the number of Texas workers earning the federal minimum wage or less was greater than the totals for California, Florida and Illinois combined. In the story, Lori Taylor, an associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, attributes the state’s lower wages to its having a younger, less educated workforce and a lower cost of living.

In March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in an online post that nearly 5.8 million Texas workers were paid hourly rates in 2010, representing 55.7 percent of the state’s workers, a proportion that compares with 58.8 percent nationally. A bureau economist, Steven Haugen, told us in an interview that most other workers are salaried, though some work on commission or do piece work; the bureau doesn’t collect data on those workers’ pay rates, he said.

A table in the bureau’s post lists each state and its percentage of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage  (people who work for tips and worker younger than 20 are among those who can be paid less than minimum wage). Texas and Mississippi each had 9.5 percent of hourly workers paid at or less than minimum wage, tying for first among the states. Under Texas law, employers must pay workers the federal minimum wage.

Alabama and West Virginia, at 9.3 percent, were next highest, followed by Louisiana (8.9 percent), Oklahoma (8.6 percent), Georgia (8.5 percent), Tennessee (8.3 percent), Kentucky (8.1 percent) and Missouri (8 percent). Washington, which has a state minimum wage rate higher than the federal rate, had the lowest share of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage, 1.1 percent.

In sheer numbers, Texas had 268,000 hourly workers earning minimum wage and 282,000 paid below the minimum wage, the bureau says, the most of any state by a wide margin. Almost 13 percent of the nation’s hourly workers paid at or below the minimum wage were in Texas, the second most-populous state with more than 25 million residents, or about 8 percent of the nation’s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Mississippi, with almost 3 million residents, had 34,000 and 29,000 hourly workers, respectively, earning the minimum wage or less.

One in four Texans lack health insurance
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared over the weekend that he was running for the Republican nomination for president. In his announcement speech, he said that if elected, he would rein in the federal government just as he's pursued policies of lower taxes, less spending and less regulation in the state of Texas.

Those policies, he said, have resulted in strong job growth.

No, they didn't, replied Paul Krugman, the liberal New York Times columnist. Krugman wrote in his column that simple population growth, among other things, has fueled new jobs in Texas. Meanwhile, Krugman said, unemployment has risen in Texas just like it has in other states.

""In June 2011, the Texas unemployment rate was 8.2 percent. That was less than unemployment in collapsed-bubble states like California and Florida, but it was slightly higher than the unemployment rate in New York, and significantly higher than the rate in Massachusetts. By the way, one in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation, thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach. Meanwhile, Massachusetts has near-universal coverage thanks to health reform very similar to the 'job-killing' Affordable Care Act.""

Krugman was right on his unemployment numbers -- we checked them with the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But we were interested in checking his claim about health insurance, that ""one in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation, thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach.""

To check this, we turned first to the U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts a regular survey on health insurance status, the Current Population Survey. According to the latest numbers, 26.1 percent of Texans had no insurance in 2009 -- just about equal to the one-in-four number Krugman cited and the highest number among the 50 states. The Census Bureau also averaged its data for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009. In that analysis, Texas also ranked first, with 25.5 percent uninsured.

Gallup also conducts polls on whether people have insurance or not, and most recently polled during 2010. For that year, it concluded that 27.8 percent of Texans lack health insurance, which comes to nearly 3 in 10. That too made it the state with the highest uninsured rate in the country.

Krugman adds the kicker that these numbers are ""thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach,"" suggesting that the conservative philosophies of Perry and other state leaders result in less health coverage.

We asked Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that advocates for low- and middle-income Texans, about the uninsured in Texas. She noted several relevant trends.

• Employment-sponsored health insurance is declining, as it is across the nation. But Texas is 8 to 10 percentage points below average when it comes to workers covered by their employers.
• Enrollment in government plans that insure the poor such as Medicaid, is about the average in Texas, even though poverty rates in Texas are higher.
• Texas generally takes a hands-off approach when it comes to regulating health insurance.
• The income limits for parents to qualify for Medicaid are set extremely low -- $188 per month for a family of three, for example, which excludes many working poor families. (As in most states, healthy adults without children can't qualify for Medicaid at all.)

""We have not done things that other states have done to make health care more affordable and accessible,"" Dunkelberg said.

On the other side of the political spectrum, John C. Goodman of the Texas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, which advocates free market approaches, said Texas uninsurance rates are explained by ethnicity and poverty. ""The state’s population is disproportionately Hispanic and Hispanics tend to have twice the uninsured rate. Also, we have a lot of low-income people in the state,"" he said.

In ruling on Krugman's statement, we're looking at his statement, ""One in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation."" He got his numbers right, so we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/15/paul-krugman/one-four-texans-lack-health-insurance/

Democrats say Republican Rep. Bob Gibbs caused the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating
","
After Standard and Poor's decision to lower the credit rating of the United States government from AAA status to AA-plus, Democrats and Republicans jumped into the blame game with equal vigor.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives, pointed the finger at Rep. Bob Gibbs, a Republican from the 18th District in east-central Ohio.

The DCCC issued a statement headlined, ""Credit agency says Rep. Gibbs recklessly caused downgrade, higher interest rates."" It said that ""the downgrade of America’s credit rating and the expected higher interest rates that come with it are thanks to Rep. Bob Gibbs recklessly protecting tax breaks for multi-millionaires and tax subsidies for Big Oil.""

PolitiFact used the same source to evaluate this claim as we used to rule on a similar claim from Republicans: the S&P report, which is available to anyone online.

S&P based its downgrade on politics more than finance. It faulted ""the political brinksmanship of recent months,"" complained that the statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default ""have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy"" and said that ""the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge.""

The report criticized both major political parties, but it did not apportion blame or indicate which party might bear more responsibility. It did not assign value to specific spending or tax votes, beyond indicating that new revenues might have helped head off a downgrade, and it did not name individuals.

The DCCC cited half a dozen sources to back up its assertion that ""the Gibbs-Boehner downgrade of American credit could raise interest rates for consumers.""

All of those sources were articles that speculated on the possibility of interest rates increasing, and all of them came before the Federal Reserve made its promise to hold short-term interest rates near zero for at least the next two years. In fact, some consumer interest rates could increase in the future, but rates so far have not increased on one indicator, offers for new credit cards.

Regardless, we stumble over the DCCC's line that Gibbs can be blamed individually for the downgrade and any of its potential consequences, and over the way it gives the freshman legislator equal billing with Speaker of the House John Boehner.

PolitiFact Ohio rated the similar GOP claim Mostly False, noting that it blamed Democrats for the downgrade, a claim that contains an element of truth because S&P held both parties responsible.

The DCCC’s statement specifically claims that S&P blamed Gibbs for ""recklessly"" causing the downgrade and raising interest rates.

U.S. Rep. Gingrey says debt deal could lead to tax hike
","
U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey joined a large, unhappy, bipartisan chorus when he announced his ""no"" vote on the Aug. 2 debt ceiling pact.

The Marietta Republican said in a news release that the deal didn’t do enough to advance a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution to balance the budget. Also, it could cause disproportionate harm to the Department of Defense.

But it was this criticism about tax increases that piqued PolitiFact Georgia’s attention:
""It further concerns me that tax increases could come into play as the newly created commission formulates its proposal,"" Gingrey said.

Tax increases could ""come into play"" as a result of this bill? There’s been a lot of talk about whether the debt deal could lead to more taxes, so we decided to check this claim out.

We contacted Gingrey’s office and asked for proof, but it did not provide any.

Fortunately, the PolitiFact National team in Washington checked out a related statement about the Budget Control Act of 2011 by U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia.

""There are no tax increases in this debt limit bill. Period,"" Cantor said on Twitter on Aug. 1, one day before the debt deal was signed by President Barack Obama.

PolitiFact National ruled Cantor’s statement Mostly True. There are no explicit tax increases or other measures that raise revenue in the bill, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will increase the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion and lead to at least $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years.

But a newly created bipartisan deficit reduction committee could potentially recommend revenue increases.

This is how it works:

Roughly $900 billion in cuts were implemented with the passage of the bill. Additional cuts will be determined by the new Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, otherwise known as the debt ""super committee.""

The committee is made up of 12 members of the House and the Senate, with six members from each party. Its goal is to reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over fiscal years 2012 to 2021. It must recommend cuts by Nov. 23.

Then, both houses of Congress must give these recommendations in an up-or-down vote, no amendments allowed.

If the committee deadlocks and can't agree to $1.2 trillion in cuts, or if Congress doesn't approve the committee's recommendations, an automatic $1.2 trillion in cuts take place in defense and domestic programs. Several programs, including Social Security, benefits for Medicare recipients and initiatives for low-income Americans, are exempt.

And while the bill does not ban revenue increases, getting them passed by the super committee could be tough. Even if a tax increase gets through the committee, either house of Congress could vote it down.

Also, there’s some discussion on how the Congressional Budget Office will decide how much the super committee’s proposal will reduce the deficit. Some argue that what method the CBO chooses could make it easier or harder to raise taxes.

Still, we think the more relevant issue is that while the committee is not barred from raising taxes, its makeup and the realities of divided government will make it tough to do so.

Since there’s room for a tax hike or two in the bill, tax increases could ""come into play,"" as Gingrey said. His statement is accurate but could use a little more context.

We give him a Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/15/phil-gingrey/us-rep-gingrey-says-debt-deal-could-lead-tax-hike/

Democratic group claims New Jersey’s pension and health benefit reform destroys bargaining rights for public-sector employees
","
The roar of the protests outside the Statehouse has faded, but a new group of Democratic activists is going after the Democratic legislators who sided with Republican Gov. Chris Christie in supporting New Jersey’s pension and health benefits reform.

Referring to its targets as ""Christie-crats,"" NJ-CAN kicked off a petition drive last week calling for the removal of Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester) and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) from their leadership posts. Both legislators helped craft the pension and health benefits legislation, and voted for the bill.

The petition, which was posted on the group's website on Aug. 9, states: ""Sweeney and Oliver betrayed core principles of the Democratic Party by engineering the passage of Governor Christie’s State Pension and Health Benefits Bill, including the destruction of public sector collective bargaining rights.""

PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether the bill includes ""the destruction of public sector collective bargaining rights,"" and found that NJ-CAN is exaggerating the impacts on unions’ rights.

The legislation weakens collective bargaining rights, but doesn’t destroy them.

""It is destructive to all collective bargaining without being the destruction of it all,"" said Hetty Rosenstein, state director of the Communication Workers of America, the largest union representing state workers.

Now, let’s talk about how the pension and health benefits bill affects union workers.

Signed into law by Christie on June 28, the legislation mandates higher payments from workers for pension and health care expenses, but the impact on union negotiations concerns the health care piece. Pension contributions have not been collectively bargained, but instead set by state statute.

Health care expenses have been part of negotiations, but the higher health care contributions outlined in the legislation are non-negotiable for four years. For workers under an existing union contract, the higher contributions and four-year time frame begin when their contract expires.

But the legislation doesn’t take away all bargaining rights, and the health care contributions are scheduled to become part of negotiations once the four-year period is complete.

Newark-based labor union attorney Bennet Zurofsky, an NJ-CAN member who helped write the petition, acknowledged the statement may include ""a small amount of hyperbole in it."" But Zurofsky argued that without the health care piece, collective bargaining will not be meaningful.

""You’re bargaining over the crumbs,"" Zurofsky said.   

Rutgers labor professor Jeff Keefe agreed the legislation gives unions much less to bargain with, but he said the word ""destruction"" is ""overkill."" Unions can still negotiate wages, uniform allowances and other issues, Keefe said.

However, without health care as part of negotiations, an employer can demand wage cuts and a union has nothing to counter with, Keefe said.

Philip Harvey, a labor law professor at Rutgers, said in an email that the legislation amounts to a ""’‘destruction of bargaining rights’ vis a vis health care expenses,"" but not all bargaining rights.

The elimination of bargaining for health care expenses will have indirect effects on other issues, Harvey said. Public-sector unions will enter negotiations in an ugly mood, making them go less smoothly, he said. Also, the unions will resist demands for other concessions more strongly in light of how the health care contributions are non-negotiable, he said.

Oliver and a spokesman for Sweeney both pointed out that collective bargaining for health care payments will be restored after the four-year period.

""The bill clearly does not destroy collective bargaining rights. In fact, I insisted upon the sunset provision that protects collective bargaining rights going forward, and the bill would not have advanced in the Assembly unless collective bargaining rights were protected,"" Oliver said in a statement. ""Collective bargaining for health care resumes in 2015.""

The ruling

NJ-CAN claimed the new pension and health benefits reform includes ""the destruction of public sector collective bargaining rights."" The legislation eliminates negotiations over health care contributions for a four-year period, a move that some experts said would make bargaining over other issues more difficult.

But you can’t say bargaining rights have been destroyed when unions can still negotiate wages and other issues, and when the health care negotiations are scheduled to resume at the end of the four years.

Since ""destruction"" is too strong of a word to explain the impacts on unions, we rate the statement Half True.

Portland mayor says nearly 87 percent of food scrap pilot participants were satisfied with the program
","
Fresh off winning a resolution to ban plastic bags in Portland grocery stores, Mayor Sam Adams is pitching another way to make the city ever greener: curbside composting.

The mayor wants to rework the way the city collects its residents’ garbage. Under his proposal, Portlanders would get composting pails for their kitchens which they would empty into their yard debris roll carts. The debris and compost would be picked up every week while regular garbage pick-ups would drop to every other week.

About 2,000 households have been doing this since May 2010 as part of a pilot program. The City Council is set to vote on the proposal in the next week or so with the goal of getting the whole city composting by the end of October.

In selling this new idea to residents, the mayor and his staff have been citing all sorts of statistics, including this pretty persuasive one: ""Of the 2,000 Portland households in the year-long pilot, 87 percent of participants reported being satisfied with the overall system.""

It didn’t take long before the stat found its way around the media. Not only does it appear at least twice on city websites, but it also made its way into reports over at OPB News and KGW News (8).  The statistic also caught the eye of local blogger Victoria Taft, who questioned its veracity.

We wanted in on the action, so we called the mayor’s office to check on the poll. An hour later, we had a copy in our inbox.

A quick look at the first page of the poll seemed to bear out the mayor’s claim -- at least partially. According to the survey his office conducted, 63 percent were ""very satisfied"" with the program, while another 24 percent were ""somewhat satisfied."" Add those together and you have that 87 percent satisfaction rate. (The others were either ""not satisfied"" or ""don’t know."")

Those numbers are right. But we had two issues with the survey: the design and the sample.

The design of the poll seemed to tilt the response toward the positive end. You only have three categories ""very satisfied,"" ""somewhat satisfied"" and ""not satisfied"" and the mayor’s office lumps the first two together to mean ""satisfied.""

Typically, however, there’s a bracket, said Stuart Elway, a pollster out of Seattle.

""You can get into arguments about how many points there should be in a scale,"" Elway said. ""Typically you would have a balanced number, so you'd have two positive and two negative.""

We know for certain from the mayor’s survey that 63 percent of the respondents were definitely satisfied. That second category, though, is squishy. Would those folks, if given the option, have cited mild dissatisfaction? No one can be certain.

On to the sample.

According to the report the mayor’s office sent us, the survey only covered 391 responses. That’s a difference from the claim in our ruling statement. The statement makes it sound as though all 2,000 pilot homes responded and that, of them, 87 percent liked the program.

We asked the mayor’s office about this discrepancy. Dan Anderson, the mayor’s spokesman, told us that we were right -- only 20 percent responded. But, he said, the statements on the city’s website were still accurate. That 20 percent, he said, is statistically significant and could, mathematically speaking, represent the whole.

""This isn’t Survey Monkey,"" he said referring to a website that allows users to make quick and dirty polls. ""It’s sophisticated, it’s accurate, it’s demographically diverse. We’re confident that it’s representative of what those in the pilot program felt of the program.""

The website, he said, could be clearer, but was still accurate. He promised to update it. He also sent us some minutes from the August 10, 2011 City Council meeting in which Adams speaks about the survey.

""The 20 percent in terms of return rate in a neighborhood of 2,000, we do -- we do polling, our recent polling by the city of Portland, actually polled a much smaller sample,"" Adams said. ""So 20 percent is representative. We think, adequately representative in terms of statistical validity.""

But he’s not entirely right.

Indeed, a 20 percent response rate to a mail survey is on the high end, said Elway. Still, when the respondents are self-selected, as they were here, it’s hard to tell whether they’re truly representative.

""You really can't apply the laws of probability for a mail survey,"" Elway said. ""But what you can do is say ‘Of the 20 percent that we got back, how well do they match the population?’ The more of those kinds of measures you have, the more confidence you can have that the results are valid.

We asked the mayor’s office if they’d taken a look at whether the respondents reflected the larger group’s demographics, but they hadn’t collected many of the details.

The mayor’s office made one other point during our discussion: Usually self-selecting respondents trend negative. If you really dislike something, you’re motivated to let people know.

Elway said that is sometimes true, but that it’s probably not as much of an issue for a pilot group.

If anything, he said, it’s possible the poll might be skewed positive.

""It doesn’t sound like a totally bogus poll or anything,"" he said. But ""if I were the client looking at this, I would look at the positive number I got back with squinty eyes.

So where does all this leave us? Well, we’re not sold that the satisfaction rate is as high as 87 percent, given the survey design and the way the sample was collected. But, it does seem obvious that, among the pilot homes, the program is relatively popular.

We’ll give this statement a Half True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/14/sam-adams/portland-mayor-says-nearly-87-percent-food-scrap-p/

Do scientists disagree about global warming?
","Climate change has become a touchy subject in the Republican primary. Though some candidates once supported plans to reduce carbon emissions, such strategies have fallen out of favor with Republicans in recent years. Even acknowledging that human beings are causing climate change can be politically problematic for some Republicans. Our colleagues at the Miami Herald asked Republican presidential candidate and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty about his views on climate change in an interview on Aug. 3, 2011. His response piqued our interest:

""Well, there’s definitely climate change. The more interesting question is how much is a result of natural causes and how much, if any, is attributable to human behavior. And that’s what the scientific dispute is about,"" said Pawlenty. ""It’s something we have to look to the science on. The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes... There’s lots of layers to it. But at least as to any potential man-made contribution to it, it’s fair to say the science is in dispute.""

We divided Pawlenty’s answer into his two essential claims:  

  • Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than man-made, phenomenon.

  • The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute.

To check the first claim, we turned to the most recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the 2007 report states. ""The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.)

In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC’s conclusions: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

The IPCC report states that the period from 1995 to 2006 contains 11 of the 12 warmest years on record since instrumental measurement began in 1850. It concluded that global surface temperature rose 0.76 degrees Celsius from the end of the 19th century (1850-1899) to the beginning of the 21st (2001-2005).  The U.S. Global Change Research Program’s report similarly found that the average global temperature increase by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900.

While these temperature changes may sound small, keep in mind that these are averages. The rise in temperature, and its visible effects, are more pronounced in certain parts of the world than in others. The polar ice sheets are particularly vulnerable to temperature increases. Greenland lost 36 to 60 cubic miles of ice from 2002 to 2006 while Antarctica lost 36 cubic miles of ice during roughly the same time period.

Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami, was one of the many scientific contributors to the 2007 IPCC report.

""The rise in global mean temperature since the 19th century may seem small, and projections of global mean warming over the next century range from 2 to 5 degrees Celsius,"" Soden said. ""One way to put these numbers into perspective is to realize that the current climate is now only about 5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the last ‘glacial maximum’ (approximately 20,000 years ago) when ice covered much of North America extending all the way down to St Louis.""

If you’ve been following the debate recently, you may remember that climate research on temperature was called into question in 2009 when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data.

But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including those conducted by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University, and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. A few reports recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data.

We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientists do not claim that humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whether other human activities contribute as well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures.

For Pawlenty’s second claim -- that there is dispute about the causes of climate change -- we decided to look at the opinions of world scientists about the issue.

Several studies have attempted to quantify how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change.

A  2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences - found that out of 1,372 climate researchers surveyed, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing the climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change.  It also concluded that ""the relative climate expertise and
scientiﬁc prominence"" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""

An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- surveyed scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146) and asked: ""Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?"" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes to this question.

Climate change skeptics have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or proving that the signatories exist.

To be clear, we’re not saying that no scientists dispute man-made climate change. When we contacted the Pawlenty campaign, they pointed us to several published pieces, such as writings by John R. Christy, who was counted as a dissenting researcher as part of the 2010 study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

But these skeptics seem to be a small -- even tiny -- minority, in contrast to Pawlenty’s comments suggesting significant disagreement. Many of the skeptics agree that climate change is occurring and that human activities play a part. But they disagree with some of the conclusions formulated in mainstream climate science.

To summarize: Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or man-made forces. The overwhelming majority of scientists polled feel that human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Also, based on scientific studies by the IPCC and others, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity.

Based upon the preponderance of evidence we conclude that Tim Pawlenty’s claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change.  It is not ""fair to say the science is in dispute,"" as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming. We rate his statement False. Editor's Note: Pawlenty announced he was dropping out of the presidential race on Aug. 14. Also, this report was changed to reflect a more expansive definition of external forcing. ",/factchecks/2011/aug/14/tim-pawlenty/do-scientists-disagree-about-global-warming/

Retired police captain says law enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than most people
","Government pensions and other retirement benefits have provoked bitter debate between public employees, who have planned their retirements on the promise of a pension, and taxpayers who say the increasing costs of the benefits are more than they can afford.

Retirement packages for police officers and firefighters often come under scrutiny because, in recognition of the extra stress and physical requirements of the job, they often permit workers to retire earlier.

The threat of a pension cut in Cranston prompted Robert Barber, a 58-year-old retired captain in the city's Police Department, to argue that any reduction in benefits would be unfair.

""The City of Cranston entered into a contract with me. The agreement was that I would serve my community and risk my life so that, at the end of my career, if I reached it, I would be able to live the rest of my life with some dignity,"" he wrote in a commentary in The Journal.

And, he wrote, that life is not likely to be as long as most retirees’.

""Statistically,"" he said, ""law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population.""

We were intrigued by that statistic. Police officers certainly experience a lot of stress in their jobs, but in some cases their level of physical fitness is higher.

When we emailed Barber, who retired at age 50, he said he first heard the statistic in a Bryant University psychology class. He directed us to two documents. The first didn’t deal directly with longevity. It was a Reuters Health account of a 2009 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, which compared 312 Buffalo, N.Y., police officers with 318 residents. Ultrasound showed that the officers tended to have thicker walls in their neck arteries, which might be an early sign of heart disease. The second was a 24-page report from 2002 on ""Fitness in Law Enforcement"" written by a member of the Pittsfield Township Police Department in Michigan. It promotes more fitness among officers and states, ""Solid research has shown the life expectancy, after retirement, of a police officer is much shorter than that of the general population."" But no research is cited. We were hoping for some harder evidence. So we went looking for some actuarial data on our own.

When we called MetLife, the spokeswoman referred us to the Society of Actuaries. But the society didn't have any data either. ""Unfortunately, we do not keep this type of data regarding life expectancy for various careers,"" spokeswoman Kim McKeown told us in an email.

We examined two websites that calculate life expectancy, but they were more interested in income, education, smoking, drinking, exercise and seatbelt habits, and whether a person was in a manual or non-manual occupation. Being a law-enforcement officer wasn't a factor in the calculation.

The creator of one of the sites, statistician Dean P. Foster of The Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania pointed us to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that fishermen, loggers, pilots, farmers, roofers and even garbage men face a higher risk of death on the job than police officers.

A Google search helped us locate Steven Greenhut, director of the journalism center at the right-leaning Pacific Research Institute in California and author of ""Plunder! How Public Employee Unions Are Raiding Treasuries, Controlling Our Lives And Bankrupting The Nation.""

He sent us a copy of an April 2010 study by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which covers 1.6 million public employees. It compared life expectancies for male police officers with male workers and retirees who were not in the public safety field.

Whether a person was age 50, 55, 60 or 65, the life expectancies of the police officers were slightly higher than for other workers. For example, men age 60 who had taken regular retirement were projected to live to age 82.7, versus age 81.9 for workers who were not in the public safety field. (Firefighter rates were close to those for police officers.)

Even when CalPERS added in all the men who had retired as a result of work-related injuries, the life expectancies of the police officers were essentially identical to other public employees. The life expectancy for someone age 60, regardless of why they stopped working, was 81.8 years, just a tenth of a year lower than for regular workers.

In 2006, Oregon's Public Employees Retirement System did an analysis comparing the life expectancies of members who were age 60. Police officers and firefighters were expected to live to age 82.6. The ages were 84.3 for school workers and 83.4 for other public employees.

Women in the police and fire departments, and workers outside the school districts were expected to live to age 85.7. Among women working in the schools, the life expectancy was 87.0 years.

Where does that leave us?

Barber said police officers die 10 years earlier than the general population.

But the actuarial studies we found showed little difference in life expectancy.

In the latest California study, police officers were actually expected to live a bit longer than other state employees. In Oregon, the combined life expectancy for police and fire was only slightly less than average.

We rate Barber's statement as False.

"['Polls and Public Opinion', 'Texas', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says a poll showed him the only Republican besting Obama in Texas
","
As word surfaced Aug. 8, 2011, that Rick Perry was poised to join the 2012 race for president, fellow Republican Mitt Romney made what the New York Times called a veiled reference to Perry’s home-state appeal.

""You know there was a poll, I guess it was about a month ago, that was a little surprising,"" the newspaper quoted the former Massachusetts governor saying during a New Hampshire campaign stop. ""It had me as the only Republican candidate who in Texas could beat President Obama. I think I was ahead by eight points. No one else was ahead of him.""

Romney the only GOP presidential powerhouse in the Lone Star state?

An online search led us to the results of a poll taken in late June by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling, which works with Democrats. The poll of 795 Texas voters, taken June 25-27, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Forty-four percent of the respondents identified themselves as Republicans, 35 percent as Democrats, 21 percent as Independents.

And according to the poll, 50 percent of respondents favored Romney over Obama, who was backed by 42 percent -- indeed an eight-point edge. Summarizing, the pollster said Obama ""performs weakest"" against Romney.

Contrary to Romney’s August recap, though, other Republicans also outperformed Obama.

U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, led Obama by 45 percent to 40 percent; U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann led Obama by 47 percent to 44 percent and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty narrowly bested Obama by 44 percent to 43 percent.

According to the poll, Obama was tied with Republican Herman Cain, at 43 percent, and led Sarah Palin by 46 percent to 44 percent. Perry, who had recently acknowledged he would weigh a bid for president, trailed Obama 47 percent to 45 percent.

In a press release accompanying the poll results, the polling firm said Bachmann was the most popular Republican contender in her own right and the only one in positive territory with a 39 percent to 36 percent favorable/unfavorable rating.

Romney was viewed unfavorably by 43 percent of respondents, favorably by 37 percent. Perry, governor since late 2000, was approved by 43 percent of respondents but disapproved of by 52 percent -- though 52 percent of Republican respondents wanted him to run for president.

Some 85 percent of respondents who voted for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008 preferred Romney to Obama; 78 percent preferred Perry to Obama.

In an interview, the polling firm’s director, Tom Jennings, credited Romney with accurately reflecting his lead over Obama in the poll and that he fared better than other Republicans.

While three other Republicans likewise bested Obama in the poll’s one-on-one hypothetical matchups, Jennings said, Romney was the sole Republican whose lead outpaced its margin of error. ""He could argue he was the only one ahead outside the margin of error,"" Jennings said.

Romney spokesman Ryan Williams echoed Jennings’ point about Romney being the only Republican whose lead over Obama in the June poll exceeds the poll’s margin of error. Williams said too that Romney, responding to a town-hall question about his appeal in the South, meant to point out he was the strongest Republican--not necessarily the only potentially winning Republican--against Obama, according to the poll.

Finally, we came up empty on other polls matching Obama against individual Republican aspirants in Texas.

However, a poll taken May 24-31 for the non-partisan Texas Lyceum, a statewide leadership group, gauged favorable/unfavorable ratings of candidates. Among the survey’s likely voters, 22 percent of 147 respondents planning to vote in the 2012 Republican presidential primary said they had not thought enough about the race to make a choice. Of those who had a preference, Romney was favored by 16 percent, Palin by 14 percent, Paul by 10 percent, Perry by 9 percent, Cain by 8 percent and Pawlenty by 7 percent. The margin of error on these choices was plus or minus 8 percentage points, ""indicating that there is no clear favorite,"" the group said.

Another poll, taken May 11-18 by the University of Texas and the Texas Tribune, showed 12 percent of polled Republicans preferring Palin for president, 7 percent for Romney, 10 percent for Paul and 4 percent for Perry. Some 14 percent said they did not know who they would vote for if the presidential primary were held then.

More significantly eight months out from the Texas primary, the UT poll’s results reaffirmed the state’s Republican lean. Asked how they'd vote in a general election for president, 30 percent of polled voters said they would vote to re-elect Obama, while 48 percent said they’d vote for the Republican nominee, whoever it is. Jim Henson, the poll’s director, told us in an interview that barring unforeseen circumstances, any Republican is likely to best Obama in Texas.

In the June poll, all told, Romney performed better in Texas than other Republicans against Obama, but contrary to his statement, he was not the only Republican to best him. He was the only candidate who did so by more than the poll's margin of error. 
But Romney is hardly the only Republican who could win the state. No Democratic presidential nominee has carried Texas since 1976.

"['New Jersey', 'Drugs', 'Government Regulation', 'Public Health', 'Marijuana', 'Nicholas Scutari']","
State Sen. Nicholas Scutari says New Jersey has the most restrictive medical marijuana program in the U.S.
","More than a year and a half after it was enacted, New Jersey is implementing its medical marijuana law.

State Sen. Nicholas Scutari, a primary sponsor of the law, said he’s glad Gov. Chris Christie decided to move forward with the program -- which, he said, is the most restrictive in the country by three measures.

""Certainly we're going to be the most restrictive state in the land … in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace,"" Scutari (D-Union) said during a July 27 NJToday interview.  

Is New Jersey really the most restrictive in those three categories?

Most of the experts we spoke with said New Jersey definitely has one of the most -- if not the most -- restrictive medical marijuana programs overall.

Within Scutari’s three parameters, we found the state senator’s statement sound.

Washington, D.C., and 16 states have medical marijuana laws. Maryland has a law, but it only allows medicinal marijuana use as a legal defense, so we aren’t considering it. The District of Columbia isn’t a state -- and Scutari said ""most restrictive state."" So, while we’ll look at Washington, D.C.’s program, it won’t factor into our final ruling.

We’ll compare New Jersey with other programs by Scutari’s three measures -- who’s eligible to get medical marijuana, how medical marijuana is recommended and how a patient actually gets it.

We should note that medical marijuana technically can’t be prescribed, but doctors can recommend it for patients.

Every state describes certain medical conditions or treatments that qualify a patient to receive medical marijuana.

New Jersey’s list of conditions is consistent with other states in some instances -- but of the 17 laws we are considering, only two -- New Jersey and Washington, D.C. -- don’t have a provision for chronic pain, according to a breakdown of medical marijuana laws by the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the legalization of marijuana.

Tamar Todd, a staff attorney for Drug Policy Alliance, a drug policy reform organization, said while ""pain is one of the categories where it is most needed,"" it also is ""the category that allows the most abuse.""

The only mention of pain in New Jersey’s law states that a patient with cancer or AIDS or who is HIV positive, qualifies for medical marijuana ""if severe or chronic pain, severe nausea or vomiting, cachexia, or wasting syndrome results from the condition or treatment thereof.""

""[New Jersey’s law] avoids some of the big loopholes that exist in some other states’ laws,"" like California and Colorado, said Jonathan Caulkins, professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.

Between New Jersey and Washington, D.C., the nation’s capital has the more restrictive list of conditions, said Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, though D.C.’s law also includes some medical treatments that New Jersey does not.

New Jersey, like most other states and Washington, D.C., allows other medical conditions to be added to the program.

Now, let’s look at how a doctor can recommend medical marijuana for a patient and how a patient can get medical marijuana.

New Jersey lists several requirements a physician must meet in order to be eligible to recommend medical marijuana. One example is a provision requiring doctors to register with the state health department. New Jersey’s medical marijuana program is the only one in the country with that mandate, O’Keefe said.

Once a doctor recommends in writing medical marijuana for someone in New Jersey, the patient or a caregiver must go to one of six dispensaries -- what the state calls ""alternative treatment centers."" There is no provision allowing patients to grow marijuana at home in New Jersey, and patients can get a maximum amount of two ounces per month. Delaware -- which allows up to six ounces --  and D.C. -- which allows up to two ounces --  are the only other medical marijuana programs that don’t have a grow-at-home provision.

O’Keefe said, ""If you are talking about restrictive, I think it’s reasonable to say that having dispensaries only is more restrictive,""  because marijuana is being grown in a controlled setting, rather than in private homes.

The ruling

Scutari said New Jersey will be the most restrictive state in the nation for medical marijuana because of who can get it, how a doctor can recommend it and how it is distributed.

Most experts we spoke with agreed New Jersey is one of the most restrictive states for medical marijuana overall. But by Scutari’s three measures, PolitiFact New Jersey found that the Garden State is generally the most restrictive.

So, we rate Scutari’s statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.",/factchecks/2011/aug/14/nicholas-scutari/state-sen-nicholas-scutari-says-new-jersey-has-mos/
