White House visitor logs voluntarily released, with potential for exceptions
","During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama talked about the importance of restoring trust in government. To close the credibility gap, Obama said, ""we must take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; and to give our people the government they deserve."" ""That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online,"" he said. We've been looking into the question of White House visitor logs. It's true that the Obama administration is releasing more information on White House visitors than any previous administration and posting those details to the Web. But the story is more complicated than that. And as we've noted before with this administration, you have to read the fine print because it includes some loopholes. When Obama first took office, the administration did not immediately release information on White House visitors, and it refused records requests from the news Web site msnbc.com and the advocacy organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. CREW filed suit for the records in July 2009, and by September, the White House announced its intention to release some of the logs in a settlement with CREW. Starting Sept. 15, 2009, the White House said it would release records of all visitors, but the records would be released 90 to 120 days after the visits occurred. But the administration outlined a series of exceptions for records that would not be released: • personal information such as dates of birth, Social Security numbers or phone numbers• information that would be of concern to law enforcement or a threat to national security interests• personal guests of the president and vice president and their families (""i.e., visits that do not involve any official or political business"")• records related to a ""small group of particularly sensitive meetings (e.g., visits of potential Supreme Court nominees). The White House will disclose each month the number of records withheld on this basis, and it will release such records once they are no longer sensitive."" It's that last point that stuck out to us. They'll release all the records unless the record is ""particularly sensitive."" That seems like a standard that can encompass an awful lot. CREW first filed suit against the Bush administration in 2006 for the White House visitor logs. Because White House records are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the group argued that they belonged to the Secret Service and could be released under FOIA. A federal judge agreed with CREW in 2007, but left the records sealed pending appeal. The settlement with the Obama administration stopped that process. CREW says it still believes that the records are subject to FOIA but that it chose to settle because ""the administration agreed to go much farther than we had asked in court: rather than just providing documents about specific visits upon request, the administration is posting the records of nearly all White House visitors,"" according to an e-mail to PolitiFact from CREW executive director Melanie Sloan. It's worth noting CREW's founder was Norm Eisen, who now is Obama's special counsel for ethics and government reform. He joined the administration in January 2009 and wrote the blog post announcing the new records policy. Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations, isn't satisfied with the settlement and has filed suit to force the release of all the logs. ""The problem with these exemptions is that they're just exemptions that (the White House is) making up,"" said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. ""By their own admission, they're not releasing everything."" Some open government organizations have nevertheless praised the administration's move. It's a ""huge step toward a more transparent government,"" said Ellen Miller of the Sunlight Foundation, writing on the group's Web site. Mentioning the exemptions, she said, ""We are going to trust them to make the right decisions. ... One misstep and the goodwill we are offering them right now goes out the window."" So far, the White House has released one month of visitor logs. An Obama administration spokesman said that so far, it has not withheld any records for political sensitivity. A few records are still being processed for national security concerns, according to the White House Web site. Getting back to Obama's statement, he said, ""For the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online."" He's right that the release was unprecedented -- there is no dispute that the Obama administration has released more information from the logs than any previous administration. But there is still a gap for roughly the first nine months that Obama was in office. And the administration has given itself a significant loophole with the exemption for sensitivity, especially given that there's already a substantial delay built into the release. So while he's opened the records and earned praise from open-government advocates, it's not quite as sweeping as he suggests. We find his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7AC40>],/factchecks/2010/jan/28/barack-obama/white-house-visitor-logs-voluntarily-released-pote/

Obama criticized McCain on a spending freeze
","With voters concerned about the economy and growing public debt, President Barack Obama called for a spending freeze. ""Families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same. So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year,"" he said during his first State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010. ""Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years,"" he said. ""Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary government programs will."" We should point out that the largest parts of the federal budget are defense and the entitlement programs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Still, didn't Obama oppose a spending freeze during the general election? We decided to check it out.Obama's Republican opponent in the election, Sen. John McCain, supported a spending freeze. In fact, what he proposed sounds an awful lot like the one Obama is suggesting.We reviewed the transcripts of the three presidential debates and found McCain and Obama jousted over a spending freeze each time.• In the first debate, Obama and McCain answered a question about how the economic crisis would affect their proposals crafted before the crisis. After a bit of pressing, McCain suggested a spending freeze ""on everything but defense, Veteran Affairs and entitlement programs. ... I think we ought to seriously consider (it) with the exceptions the caring of veterans, national defense and several other vital issues.""""Would you go for that?"" moderator Jim Lehrer asked Obama. Obama replied, ""The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are underfunded. I want to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy doesn't make sense. (Obama was referring to money that goes to private insurers as part the Medicare Advantage program.) Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.""• In the second debate, a voter asked what sacrifices Americans should make to help the nation ""get out of the economic morass that we're now in.""McCain said, ""I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate. I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working. I know a lot of them that aren't working. ... And I recommend a spending freeze that except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze. And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even know about until months later.""Obama, on the other hand, said it was important ""for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Sen. McCain about an across-the-board freeze. That's an example of an unfair burden-sharing. That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.""• Finally, the third debate, on cutting the deficit:McCain: ""I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, okay? Some people say that's a hatchet. That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, okay? ... I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs.""Obama: ""Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. It's proposed periodically. It doesn't happen. And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.""Obama's team seems to have anticipated that these quotes would be revived. Before the State of the Union speech, one of the administration's top economists wrote a defense of the proposal for the White House blog titled ""Budget Freeze-eology 101: Hatchets vs. Scalpels.""Jared Bernstein, chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden, gave the following explanation for Obama's proposal:""There are two ways to do a freeze like this: (1) an across-the-board freeze on every program outside of national security; and (2) a surgical approach where overall totals are frozen but some individual programs go up and others go down. In short, a hatchet versus a scalpel. ""During the campaign, you may recall that John McCain touted option 1 -- the hatchet approach of an across-the-board freeze. ""The president was critical of that approach then, and we would be critical of it now. It's not what we're proposing. To the contrary, the entire theory of the president's proposed freeze is to dial up the stuff that will support job growth and innovation while dialing down the stuff that doesn't. Under our plan, some discretionary spending will go up; some will go down. That's a big difference from a hatchet."" Bernstein, though, oversimplifies what McCain described during the debates. McCain said he would exempt other areas besides defense, and he said programs should have to compete for funding (""some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency""). Obama's answers, on the other hand, never gave any indication that he would embrace the idea of a spending freeze, something that he is doing now. So we don't find Bernstein's explanation convincing. We give Obama a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696B740>],/factchecks/2010/jan/28/barack-obama/obama-criticized-mccain-spending-freeze/
"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry says Hutchison voted for Roe v. Wade
","U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison’s record on abortion makes some Republicans uncomfortable, so it was no surprise that it came up during the Jan. 14 Republican gubernatorial debate.Gov. Rick Perry invoked abortion to try to illustrate what he called the senator’s “issues with inconsistency.”“You voted to continue Roe v. Wade,” Perry said to Hutchison.Hutchison, who said during the debate that she always comes down on the “side of life,” has not always voted in ways that please two state groups, Texas Alliance for Life and Texas Right to Life's political action committee, which have endorsed Perry. Nor have Hutchison's votes on abortion issues satisfied some abortion rights advocates. ""She's voted for every unreasonable restriction in the book,"" Donna Crane, policy director for National Abortion Rights Action League Pro-Choice America, said through a spokeswoman.Historically, the senator has supported abortion rights, with restrictions. Her campaign points to her record of voting for legislation limiting the procedure, including the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. To Texans watching the debate, Perry’s statement on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, may have seemed odd. That’s because Congress can’t vote to overturn a Supreme Court decision based on a constitutional right, University of Texas law professor Scot Powe said.Congress could, however, act to amend the U.S. Constitution to prohibit abortions.But for an amendment to become law, it must be passed by two-thirds of both houses of Congress and be ratified by three-fourths of the states. That hasn’t happened.We wondered what vote the governor was referring to during the debate. His campaign pointed us to a 2003 vote that Hutchison cast for a resolution expressing support for Roe v. Wade. The resolution, an amendment to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, expressed ""the sense of the Senate that (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade … was appropriate and secures an important constitutional right; and (2) such decision should not be overturned.”In and of themselves, such ""sense of the Senate"" resolutions enact no laws, spend no public funds and are largely symbolic. The resolution was not included in the final version of the bill in Congress. The late-term ban was later upheld by the Supreme Court.In 2003, Hutchison told the Dallas Morning News that she ""thought it was a very clean amendment that said Roe v. Wade has evolved into allowing reasonable restrictions to be put on by states, while also allowing women in the early stages (of pregnancy) to have that capability, if that is what they and their doctors decide.""When asked this week about her vote, Hutchison's campaign said that the senator believes states should be able to keep their ability to restrict abortion and that the amendment sent that statement. However, the only reference that the 2003 resolution made to state restrictions was the observation that Roe v. Wade actually limits ""the power of States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy."" During the gubernatorial debate, Hutchison voiced a different concern: that overturning Roe v. Wade would lead to ""abortion havens"" because some states would pass looser laws on abortion while others would outlaw the practice altogether.Hutchison was among 17 senators, including six Republicans, who voted both for the ban on the late-term procedure and the resolution affirming Roe. While critics have called those dual votes an attempt by lawmakers to appeal to both sides in the abortion debate, Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, disagrees. Supporting restrictions on abortion while recognizing that access to abortion services is needed in some cases actually reflects the moderate views most Americans have on the issue, he said.""The idea that pro-choice means unrestricted access to abortion services and that pro-life means that life begins at conception and therefore abortion is murder are the poles in this debate,"" Jillson said. ""But there’s a vast middle ground. And for two-thirds of America, that's where they live.""Summing up: On its face, Perry's statement that Hutchison ""voted to continue Roe v. Wade"" is wrong because senators have no such power regarding Supreme Court decisions. If Perry had substituted ""affirm"" for ""continue,"" the statement would have been accurate, though perhaps less politically potent.But the brunt of Perry's charge is correct: Sen. Hutchison voted for a resolution that said Roe v. Wade should not be overturned. We rate his statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970EE5C0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/27/rick-perry/perry-says-hutchison-voted-roe-v-wade/
"['Economy', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison “has voted nine separate times to raise the national debt ceiling.”
","Gov. Rick Perry casts his leading Republican challenger, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, as a fiscally irresponsible lawmaker who’d bring a free-spending approach to state government.  Amplifying that theme, Perry’s campaign said Nov. 30: “Hutchison has voted nine separate times to raise the national debt ceiling.”  We wondered if that was so.  Perry’s camp compiled votes — undisputed by Hutchison — showing that since joining the Senate in 1993, Hutchison has voted nine times to raise the ceiling. But she’s also voted five times against raising the ceiling.  Our request for an explanation of Hutchison’s votes didn’t generate an immediate reply from her. If she does pipe up, we’ll update this item. UPDATE: Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky offered a statement Jan. 28 suggesting that Hutchison's ""aye"" votes while George W. Bush was president reflected her support for his across-the-board tax cuts and spending initiatives including commitments to fight terrorism, provide prescription drugs to senior citizens and rebuild after 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike. Sadosky said: ""She has voted against efforts to increase the debt ceiling when it is necessitated by wasteful spending like that seen in the stimulus bill and in the annual discretionary appropriations bills proposed by the Democratic-led Congress and presidency.""  We wondered anyway what any vote on the debt ceiling really means.  Josh Gordon of The Concord Coalition, which was founded by the late Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass) to advocate for long-term fiscal responsibility, advised that votes to raise the ceiling might be portrayed as big deals to score political points. In reality, they’re not, he said, though they are necessary.  “If they didn’t do it, the (U.S.) Treasury would no longer be able to borrow money,” Gordon said. “Everything from savings bonds to Treasury bills to very short-term financial instruments of the Federal Reserve would cease to be worth anything. It would basically destroy the economy.”  Unlike congressional votes on taxes or spending, Gordon said, lawmakers' votes to increase the debt limit aren't necessarily indicators of members' fiscal philosophies.  Gordon said the fact all but two of Hutchison’s votes to raise the ceiling occurred with Republicans in charge of the Senate was probably not a coincidence.  Typically in Congress, the majority party bears responsibility for attending to essential business, including hikes in the debt ceiling if necessary. When the ceiling issue comes up, members of the minority party can vote ""no"" knowing the other side will muster the votes to do it. Hutchison’s five “no” votes occurred when Democrats controlled the Senate. With Democrats holding the Senate majority, she voted for raising the ceiling as part of the Wall Street rescue plan approved in October 2008 and earlier voted for raising the ceiling in June 2002.   Perry got all of Hutchison’s “yes” votes right. We rate his claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D6200>],/factchecks/2010/jan/27/rick-perry/us-sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-us-sen-kay-bailey-hutc/
"['National', 'Pop Culture', 'John Boehner']","
Boehner claims House Republicans dominate Twitter, YouTube and other social media in Congress
","Quick quiz of your online fluency: Do you know what PWNED means?We'll admit we had to Google it. In Internet geek, it's trash talk that means you ""owned"" your opponent.Here it is in a recent press release from House Republican Leader John Boehner: ""PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress.""The release said, ""The conventional wisdom is being turned upside down as House Republicans demonstrate an unmatched ability to connect with the American people on the Internet’s most popular communities. Once considered the party of online innovation, new research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring some of the most popular social media communities on the Web.""Indeed, there's been a widespread perception that Democrats had the lead. During the presidential campaign, the Washington Post dubbed Barack Obama ""the king of social networking."" By nearly every social networking measure -- Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and Twitter -- Obama's engagement and influence dwarfed the McCain campaign. Obama's text messaging became a powerful grass-roots tool for getting out his message and raising money. The Obama campaign even mocked Sen. John McCain for his inability to navigate the Internet and ran an ad linking him to a record player and a Rubik's Cube. We decided to fact-check Boehner's boast about Republican domination of social media in Congress.First stop: Twitter.Earlier this month, Mark Senak, senior vice president and partner at Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm in Washington, D.C., issued a report titled ""Twongress: The Power of Twitter in Congress"" in which he analyzed the Twitter use of all members of Congress. The findings surprised him.In Congress, he found, there are 132 members using Twitter actively: 89 Republicans and 43 Democrats. It breaks down like this: In the Senate, there are 14 Republicans using Twitter compared to 11 Democrats; and in the House, there are 75 Republicans using Twitter (42.13 percent of the Republican caucus) and 32 Democrats (12.45 percent of the Democratic caucus).And the GOP leads in tweet production: ""Republicans send out more tweets and have the attention of many more people than do the Democrats,"" the report says.The disparity in Twitter usage was most pronounced in the House. In the House, only one Democrat ranks in the top 10 in terms of the number of followers; and only two are in the top 20. Not only do more House Republicans actively use Twitter, they have many more followers and send out far more Twitter messages, 29,162 tweets compared to 5,503 for their Democratic counterparts, according to the report, which tallied their messages through the end of 2009. The power of Twitter, however, is not just in the number of followers you have and how many messages you send out a day. The idea is to get people on your followers list to ""re-tweet"" -- pass on -- your message, potentially exposing your message to an exponentially larger group. So analysts also look at your ""influence"" and ""clout,"" which factors in how often people ""re-tweet"" and cite your messages. And by that measure, House Republicans are far outpacing Democrats.Measured by the sheer number of followers, Boehner leads the Republicans in the House with 18,800; followed by Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., with 16,500. But it was Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who led House Republicans in ""clout"" and ""influence"" because she is re-tweeted so often. And for the record, the supposedly out-of-touch McCain beats everyone in Congress for total followers, with nearly 1.6 million.""When I first saw the results, I was surprised,"" Senak told PolitiFact. ""That was a counterintuitive finding after the Obama campaign. But when when I thought about it, the party that is not in power always has had to be more aggressive in using communication tools to get their message.""So Round 1, Twitter, to House Republicans.What about YouTube? On Jan. 21, 2010, YouTube's CitizenTube posted a year-end wrap-up that showed 89 percent of Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats in Congress have started YouTube channels to engage their constituents. More importantly, people are watching the Republican channels much more often. According to the report, eight of the top 10 most-viewed and most-subscribed YouTube channels in Congress are from the GOP, though Democrats took two of the top three spots. The top 4, in order, are Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Boehner. A tracking of YouTube views by industry analyst TubeMogul shows that with few exceptions, Republican videos consistently drew more clicks than those from Democrats. None of the videos have gone viral, said David Burch of TubeMogul, and no one is getting huge viewership. ""Obama spoiled us in terms of what 'a lot' means,"" during the campaign, he said. Obama remains on the cutting edge. On Jan. 25, 2010, the administration rolled out a new White House iPhone app which will allow users to watch White House live-streaming video.Still, in Congress, the GOP is ahead. Round 2, YouTube, to Republicans.And lastly, Facebook, the favorite of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Palin's Facebook page has more than 1.2 million fans.No one in the House has that kind of reach. And we couldn't find any comprehensive analysis of engagement on FaceBook by members of Congress. But as of Jan. 22, 2010, Boehner had 31,757 fans of his page, compared to 8,745 for Pelosi.Boehner's director of new media, Nick Schaper, said House Republicans are building an important lead in social media. ""We're pretty proud of that,"" he said.For many Republicans, the Obama campaign was a real eye-opener to the power of social media tools. And so Republican leaders made a conscious effort to ramp up their involvement. In weekly meetings, members of the Republican conference routinely discuss their social media successes and talk about how best to use various tools.Engagement in new social media just makes sense, Schaper said. It's easy to use, but it takes commitment.Boehner typically tweets about 5 to 10 times a day.""The more active you are, the more followers you get,"" Schaper explained. ""Everyone on the press team considers Twitter an important part of the process. We make it a focus, not a secondary kind of thing.""It's a great resource to reach people with your message, he said. Boehner might only have about 19,000 followers on Twitter, but if enough people re-tweet some of his messages, he can reach a couple hundred thousand people in just a couple hours.But while House Republicans may rightly crow about deeper engagement in social media than their Democratic counterparts, Senak, the author of the study, says neither side is doing particularly well compared to other large institutions. Both parties have a minority of members engaged in Twitter. And neither side has fully embraced the give-and-take of Twitter. Most members have elected to follow very few other people and rarely ""re-tweet."" In other words, he said, they are mostly using Twitter as a soapbox.""Both sides have room for a tremendous amount of improvement,"" Senak said.But the bottom line is that Boehner is correct when he boasts that the House GOP dominates the Democrats on Twitter, YouTube and other social media in Congress.Still, we had to ask, is Boehner really so plugged-in that he knows what PWNED means?Schaper artfully sidestepped the question and said, ""He surprises me every time I talk about it (social media). I think people would be surprised.""On this claim, Boehner earns a True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF0100>],/factchecks/2010/jan/25/john-boehner/boehner-claims-house-republicans-dominate-twitter-/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Kay Bailey Hutchison']","
Hutchison says Texas has 45 health-related state agencies
","
Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, running for governor, said she wouldn't hesitate to trim state spending to cope with a looming state revenue shortfall of up to $17 billion.

""We should start cutting across the board now in our state agencies,"" she said during the GOP gubernatorial debate Jan. 14. ""We have over 300 state agencies. Forty-five of those agencies are related to health care. I'm just wondering if we couldn't consolidate some of those state agencies.""

Forty-five agencies, all concerned with health care? We decided to check.

Hutchison's campaign sent us a list of 50 councils, boards, committees and state departments, all characterized by Hutchison's camp as relating to health care in some capacity. The 50 were plucked from a list of more than 300 entities that the governor was making appointments to as of February 2008.

Case closed? Not quite.

The veracity of Hutchison's statement depends on how broadly ""agency"" is defined.

Two experts we spoke with understood how Hutchison made the stretch. But Harvey Tucker, a political science professor at Texas A&M, said that according to how state law defines what constitutes an agency, Hutchison ""probably went too far.""

Ken Levine, interim director of the Sunset Advisory Commission, which reviews government agencies and makes recommendations to the Legislature about what services can be consolidated, declined to weigh in on the truthfulness of Hutchison's claim. But he said that it's not realistic to count all the entities on Hutchison's list as full-fledged agencies.

For instance, the governor appoints members of advisory committees — we counted four of them on Hutchison's list, including the Dental Hygiene and the Family Practice Residency advisory committees. But ""I wouldn't count those as state agencies,"" Levine said. 

Also, some of the entities Hutchison may envision as targets for possible consolidation to cut costs don't cost much money now.

The vast majority of advisory committee members are not salaried state workers. Put another way, panels including the Dental Hygiene Advisory Committee do not have line-item appropriations in the budget. The dental hygiene panel's six members only get state money to reimburse travel expenses.

Separately, we found three published state lists that put Hutchison's claim of 45 health-related agencies in question.

According to an appendix to the latest state budget and compilations by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts and the Texas State Library and Archives, Texas has no more than 15 health-related agencies including the mammoth Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees smaller units.

One way Hutchison gets to a higher number is by counting components of some agencies as if they were separate entities. For instance, Hutchison includes on her list the Executive Council of Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy Examiners plus the Texas Board of Occupational Therapy Examiners and the Texas Board of Physical Therapy Examiners. A council spokeswoman told us that those three entities amount to one state agency. 

Except for a section of the state ethics code relating to financial disclosure by public officials, it's difficult to find a strict definition or criteria for what constitutes a state agency in Texas. We decided to take the state's word for how many health-related government agencies it has: 15, including the five health and human services agencies traditionally associated with health care.

Hutchison's list — ranging from the sprawling HHSC to itty-bitties like the Chronic Kidney Disease Task Force — shapes up as overly long.

We rule her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097110E80>],/factchecks/2010/jan/25/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-we-have-45-health-related-state-age/
"['National', 'Elections', 'Pundits', 'Dick Armey']","
Armey says Tea Party is more popular than Democrats, Republicans
","The Tea Party is getting popular -- really popular, if you ask Dick Armey, a former House Republican leader whose organization FreedomWorks helped organize the fledgling group, which has used tea bags to symbolize its opposition to new taxes.

""This is the broad center of American politics,"" he said in an interview with MSNBC. ""Look at the polling data. Right now the Tea Party polls higher than the Republicans and the Democrats.""

The Democrats and Republicans have been around awhile, so we were a little skeptical that the new party had gained such ground.

We contacted FreedomWorks to find out which poll Armey was referring to and were told to check out a December 2009 NBC-Wall Street Journal poll.

The poll asked the following question:

""As you may know, this year saw the start of something known as the Tea Party movement. In this movement, citizens, most of whom are conservatives, participated in demonstrations in Washington, D.C., and other cities, protesting government spending, the economic stimulus package, and any type of tax increases. From what you know about this movement, is your opinion of it very positive, somewhat positive, neutral, somewhat negative, or very negative? If you do not know enough to have an opinion, please say so.""

The poll found that 41 percent of respondents had a positive view of the Tea Party movement (either somewhat or very positive), while only 23 percent saw it negatively and 21 percent were neutral and 15 percent did not have an opinion. By contrast, 28 percent viewed the Republican Party positively, 43 percent saw it negatively and 27 percent were neutral. The Democratic Party was seen positively by 35 percent, negatively by 45 percent and neutral by 19.

But some political analysts have questioned whether the poll exaggerated the Tea Party's favorable ratings because the group is not well known and because of the heavy coverage it gets from  Fox News, a conservative news outlet. About 76 percent of those who see the Tea Party movement favorably also said they get their news from Fox, according to an analysis on MSNBC's First Read.

On Meet the Press in response to Armey's comments, NBC political editor Chuck Todd questioned whether the Tea Party was ""in the center. I mean, when we did our own polling on this, it's clear that the Tea Party gets a big benefit because there's one news organization that gives them a huge bump all the time. I mean, their favorable rating among Fox viewers is through the roof, and the rest of the country sort of doesn't know a lot about these folks.""

PolitiFact interviewed Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and she made the same point.

""We know from other polls that a lot of Americans don't know what the Tea Party is,"" she said. Indeed, the same NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showed that only 7 percent of respondents know a great deal about the Tea Party and 22 percent know a fair amount.

Bowman also questioned the validity of comparing the parties because of the way the poll was worded. The Tea Party question included information about the group's activities such as ""protesting government spending,"" while there were no such labels for Republicans or Democrats. ""I think people were responding to deep concerns about government,"" she said, not necessarily the Tea Party movement.

While it's clear that Republicans and Democrats are not polling well -- and that the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll provides some useful information about the mood of the country -- it doesn't show definitively that the Tea Party is the most popular party in the country, Bowman said.

We also spoke with Jay Campbell, vice president for Hart McInturff, the firm that conducted the poll. For the same reasons outlined by Bowman, he told us Armey's comments were not an accurate representation of the poll's findings.

""The main problem with it is that they're making a comparison that is not an apples-to-apples comparison at all,"" Campbell said. ""If we had said that the Democratic Party was the party of the working class, they might have polled more favorably."" His firm included the descriptions for the Tea Party because pollsters were concerned that respondents otherwise would not know what it is.

A December 2009 Rasmussen poll also contradicts Armey's statement. It found that in a three-way generic ballot, Democrats attracted 36% of the vote. The Tea Party candidate picked up 23%, and Republicans finished third with 18% of the vote. Another 22% are undecided. And a Fox News poll released Jan. 21, 2010, demonstrated that President Barack Obama would beat a potential Tea Party candidate in a White House run.

So Armey is drastically overstating the group's standing. Yes, the Tea Party is viewed favorably by people who know about the group (particularly those who get their news from Fox), but the pollsters who conducted the survey say it's not accurate to say that the party is more popular than Democrats or Republicans. Also, other polls contradict Armey's statement and indicate that Democrats are more popular than Tea Party candidates. So we find Armey's claim to be False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D96840>],/factchecks/2010/jan/25/dick-armey/armey-says-tea-party-more-popular-democrats-republ/

Congresswoman says Democratic presidents create more private-sector jobs
","As the recession continues to inflict economic pain on most Americans, the political battle to frame the debate rages on. In a House floor speech on Jan. 21, 2010, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., held up a chart showing job creation statistics under two former presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  ""This chart goes back to 1992, the year that President [Bill] Clinton was elected,"" Maloney said. ""It shows that during his time there was very robust job creation in the private sector, and then during the Bush years it fell dramatically. This dark line is the job creation, going up during the Clinton years, falling dramatically under the [George W.] Bush administration. It also shows that Democrats have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs.""   We wondered whether that pattern held true for other presidents as well, or whether Maloney had simply chosen two presidencies that conveniently showed her party in the most favorable light. So we ran the numbers and got some interesting results.   We did this by turning to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site, where visitors can customize data tables on national employment statistics. We used the month-by-month totals for nonfarm employment in the United States. (We actually ran the numbers twice -- once using Maloney's cited statistic, private-sector employment, and a second time using the combination of private-sector and government employment. It turned out that the general trends were virtually identical, so we'll be sticking with the statistics on just private-sector employment below.)   The BLS data go back to 1939, but since that fell in the middle of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, we skipped forward to Harry Truman and compared him and all of his post-World War II successors. We also did some minor massaging of the numbers in order to make the statistics more comparable.   First, we calculated how much the number of jobs rose or fell on each president's watch. Then we divided that result by the number of jobs there were when the president began his first term, in order to get a percentage increase in jobs over that president's tenure. This enabled us to minimize the effect of population growth, which would otherwise credit later presidents with larger employment increases than earlier ones.   Next, we divided this job growth percentage by the number of years the president occupied the Oval Office, creating a statistic that calculates percentage job growth per year as president. This allowed us to more fairly compare the job growth rates under, say, Gerald Ford with those of two-termers such as Ronald Reagan and Clinton.   Finally, we lumped the Democratic presidents' annual job-growth percentages together and averaged them, and did the same for the Republicans. Because President Barack Obama has served just one year in office -- a length of time that some would consider statistically problematic -- we ran the Democratic numbers both with and without Obama, so that readers could choose their preferred statistic.   Before we provide the final totals, let's run down how each president did. Here are the average annual percentage increases in jobs for each postwar president:   Harry S. Truman (Democrat): increase of 2.95 percent a year Dwight D. Eisenhower (Republican): increase of 0.50 percent a year John F. Kennedy (Democrat): increase of 2.03 percent a year Lyndon B. Johnson (Democrat): increase of 3.88 percent a year Richard M. Nixon (Republican): increase of 2.16 percent a year Gerald R. Ford (Republican): increase of 0.86 percent a year Jimmy Carter (Democrat): increase of 3.45 percent a year Ronald Reagan (Republican): increase of 2.46 percent a year George H.W. Bush (Republican): increase of 0.40 percent a year Bill Clinton (Democrat): increase of 2.86 percent a year George W. Bush (Republican): increase of 0.01 percent a year Barack Obama (Democrat): decrease of 3.0 percent a year   (Can we take time out here to say how surprised we are that Eisenhower, who presided over the ""happy"" 1950s, managed an anemic half-percent job growth per year, while Jimmy ""Malaise"" Carter finished second with 3.45 percent annual job growth?)   Now for the totals. If you exclude Obama, Democrats averaged 3.03 percent annual job growth, compared to 1.07 percent for Republicans -- a nearly 3-to-1 advantage.   If you include Obama, the Democrats still held a significant edge. With Obama included, the Democrats averaged 2.03 annual job growth, compared to the same 1.07 for Republicans -- about twice as high as the GOP.  And based on some quick calculations he did, Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said that the U.S. working-age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents, making the Democratic accomplishment even more impressive. So the statistics are clear: Democratic presidents have been more successful at creating jobs. But how much importance should we assign to this fact? We hereby list some caveats that we and several historians we contacted came up with.   -- The president actually deserves less credit for the good times -- and less blame for the bad times. It's a truism of politics that when things go well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things don't go well, the president usually gets too much blame. Shouldn't the Republican Congress of 1995-2001 get a share of the credit for Clinton's robust job growth? Shouldn't the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes.   -- Timing can be hugely important. ""Statistics about employment growth over presidential terms are dominated by the timing of the business cycle, including Federal Reserve policy, and have no apparent connection to economic policies attributed to the White House, as opposed to Congress,"" said Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. One example: Clinton had the good fortune to enter office when the economy had just undergone a recession. This relatively low starting point made it easier for him to rack up big gains over eight years. The converse is true for George W. Bush: He took office right as the tech bubble was bursting, meaning that any jobs he added to the nation's total amounted to digging the country out of a jobs hole.   -- Outside factors can play a big role. Truman's private-sector employment numbers likely benefited from the post-World War II demobilization of troops. (Private sector jobs grew at 2.95 percent per year during his presidency, compared to 2.7 percent a year for all jobs.) Meanwhile, Lyndon Johnson took office right as the first wave of baby boomers was turning 18, a fact that almost certainly boosted his job-creation figures. And research by James D. Hamilton, an economist at the University of California at San Diego has shown that oil price shocks -- something entirely out of a president's control -- have caused most postwar recessions. As Yale political scientist David Mayhew points out, conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set -- in this case, just 12 postwar presidencies -- need to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, most experts we spoke to agreed that the pattern is too consistent to dismiss out of hand.   And it's not the only one that reflects a strong correlation between an economic factor and the president's partisan affiliation. In his 2008 book Unequal Democracy, Princeton University political scientist Larry Bartels showed that changes in income inequality are strongly correlated with the president's party. Under every postwar Republican president, Bartels concluded, the gap between rich and poor has grown, and under every Democratic president except for Carter, that gap has shrunk. (For those on the lookout for ideological bias, Bartels made a point of writing in his introduction that he is ""an unusually apolitical political scientist"" who last voted in 1984, for Reagan. ""I was quite surprised to discover how often and how profoundly partisan differences in ideologies and values have shaped key policy decisions and economic outcomes,"" he wrote. ""I have done my best to follow my evidence where it led me."")   Ultimately, the experts we contacted said that, despite the caveats, Maloney's calculations, and our expansion of them, were justified.   ""This is a reasonable exercise in the scheme of things,"" said liberal economist Dean Baker. ""Obviously, luck matters a lot, but when there is a consistent pattern over more than 60 years, it starts to look like more than just luck.""   Kevin Hassett, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former economic adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, argued that the best way to evaluate presidents is to look at their policies. Still, he added, calculations like Maloney's ""are worth doing. They can be thought-provoking and can ignite debates that help inform.""   So the significance of this pattern is open to question, but on the facts, the evidence is clear: We rate Maloney's statement True, not just for the two presidents she cited, but for the postwar presidency as a whole.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B39DC0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/25/carolyn-maloney/congresswoman-says-democratic-presidents-create-mo/

Campaign finance ruling on United Citizens is historical, but 100 years is a stretch
","It's clear that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on campaign finance reform, allowing corporations to spend as much as they like on their own political ads, marked a major reversal of current campaign law.But according to leading Democrats, the ruling went much further than overturning recent law.""With a stroke of a pen, the court decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures and override the will of millions of Americans who want their voices heard in our democracy,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. Other Democrats echoed similar sentiments, that the Supreme Court has overruled more than a century of established law.This more-than-100-years talk confused us. We thought the Supreme Court ruling hinged on a recent campaign finance law, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., more formally referred to as the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002 -- and clearly less than 100 years old. So we decided to look into Schumer's statement.But first, a little bit more about the case, which was kicked off by Hillary: The Movie, a documentary film that portrays Clinton as deceitful, ideological and power-hungry. During the 2008 presidential campaign, a group called Citizens United wanted to promote the movie in the days leading up the election. But the Federal Election Commission said they couldn't do that; the 2002 campaign finance law banned corporations from ""electioneering"" -- running ads or messages that mentioned a specific candiate -- during the 30 days before a primary and 60 days before an election. The FEC said Citizens United could not promote the movie without violating the law. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, not only threw out the time limits for electioneering, but added that the federal government could not set limits on corporations spending whatever they wanted to promote their own political messages during campaigns. The ban violated free speech protections, the court said.So the ruling does go further than just ending the ban on electioneering. But how far back does it go?We asked Schumer's staff about the 100-year-old comment, and they pointed us toward a 1907 law called the Tillman Act. They cited the dissenting opinion issued this week, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, that said, ""The majority’s approach to corporate electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past. Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907.""But as we dug deeper into the history of the Tillman Act, the picture got murky because of the difference between independent expenditures and direct contributions. An independent expenditure means money that corporations go out and spend on their own to portray a particular candidate as unfit for office, or on an issue. A direct contribution means a donation to a candidate's campaign, for the campaign to spend any way it likes. Corporations may not make direct contributions to federal campaigns from their own treasury; they have to create a separate political action committee, or PAC, for that. The recent ruling did nothing to change that ban. The Tillman Act said corporations could not ""make a money contribution in connection with any election to any political office."" Now, does this mean that independent expenditures are outlawed, or just direct contributions? We looked at several court opinions and legal articles, and everything we looked at suggested that back then, people weren't thinking of campaign contributions in those terms. And in 1947, Congress came back and passed another law, the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, banning corporations and unions from making independent expenditures.  In fact, much of modern campaign finance laws dates to the post-Watergate period in the 1970s, when Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act and a series of amendments. That's when modern reporting requirements for campaigns were put into place, and the Federal Election Commission was established. A history on the Web site of the Federal Election Commission notes that before this the laws were largely ignored, ""because none provided an institutional framework to administer their provisions effectively.""So what about Schumer's comments that the Supreme Court ""decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures."" This glosses over a lot of detail. Yes, it was more than 100 years ago that the first law limiting corporate spending was passed. But we don't see evidence that the Tillman Act even envisioned a distinction between direct contributions and independent expenditures. And the ban on direct contributions still stands. Perhaps some of you are probably thinking, what's the difference? So what if a company can't contribute directly to a candidate if it can run ads about what a great person Joe is. Well, in practice, it's an important distinction. Corporations aren't allowed to coordinate their ads with the campaigns, and campaigns have their own ideas of messaging and strategy. In his campaign memoir, The Audacity to Win, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe discussed in detail why spending by groups outside the campaign is less effective than commonly thought.We also don't want to downplay the historical importance of the Citizens United ruling. The Citizens United case does overturn some notable precedents and laws. The majority opinion specifically said it was overturning a 1990 precedent, Austin vs. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, which said that the federal government could regulate corporate spending as laid out in the reforms of the 1970s. You could also argue that the Citizens United case overturns the campaign finance portion of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. Schumer said the Supreme Court ""decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures."" But he ignores the fact that the ban on direct donations from corporations to campaigns still exists. And the oldest law that specifically banned independent expenditures dated to 1947. You could also argue that we should be dating this from the 1970s campaign finance laws, or even the 1990 Austin case. So he's exaggerating the scope of the ruling and how long the laws have been on the books. We rate Schumer's statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B2FC0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/22/charles-schumer/campaign-finance-ruling-united-citizens-historical/

Perry says he cut the business tax
","
A ""he said, she said"" exchange between U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Gov. Rick Perry during the Jan. 14 gubernatorial debate may have left Texans scratching their heads.

When the senator accused Perry of raising taxes on businesses, one of the things she pointed to was legislation that the governor signed in 2006 restructuring the state’s franchise tax on businesses.

Perry responded several times by saying that ""we lowered the business tax from 4 percent down to 1 percent.""

The mixed messages put forth by the two candidates -- higher taxes, lower taxes? -- made us wonder who was right. In a companion item, we examined Hutchison’s claim about the business tax. Now, we’ll look at Perry’s.

The centerpiece of a 2006 tax overhaul was a reduction in the property tax rate that local school districts use to generate money for operations. The Legislature revamped the franchise tax and increased the cigarette tax to help districts offset the loss of revenue from the rate cut.

Strictly speaking, Perry's statement about the franchise tax rate is correct: As part of the changes, it was cut from about 4 percent to 1 percent. But another major revision -- widening the tax base -- was so significant that tax experts told us that simply comparing the before-and after rates doesn't give the true picture.

Before 2006, the franchise tax was essentially a 4.5 percent tax on a company’s profit. The new version, often called the margins tax, reduced the rate to 1 percent while broadening its application. Now, the tax is applied to the annual revenue of qualifying companies minus one of three options: the cost of goods sold, employee compensation or 30 percent of total revenue.

""The earlier tax was mainly on profits,"" said Billy Hamilton, who served as deputy comptroller under state Comptrollers John Sharp and Carole Keeton Strayhorn. ""The new tax is on the broader margin base. It is a different tax, and comparing the two rates is an apples and oranges comparison.""

As anticipated, Texas businesses paid more in franchise taxes after the overhaul than they did before: In 2006 and 2007, franchise tax revenue was $5.75 billion. In 2008 and 2009, the first two years of the revised tax, total revenue rose to $8.7 billion.

However, one expected consequence of the legislation didn't pan out. Before the restructuring, a frequent criticism of the franchise tax was that it had become virtually voluntary, paid by only about 1 in 16 Texas businesses. The revision was designed to apply the tax to more businesses. However, because of exemptions that the Legislature gave small businesses, the number of companies that pay the franchise tax is lower than before the law was signed, said Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association.

""The tax has become more concentrated on larger businesses,"" he said.

It's also important to note that the 2006 tax changes didn't affect all businesses the same way. Because of the property tax reductions, some saw their taxes drop. Others did not.

Summing up, Perry was correct when he said the business tax rate was cut. But he failed to point out that the change in the tax base essentially transformed the franchise tax into a new levy, one that generated more money from businesses. 
In our book, an otherwise accurate statement that leaves out important details or takes things out of context is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979CC100>],/factchecks/2010/jan/22/rick-perry/perry-says-he-cut-business-tax/
"['National', 'Bipartisanship', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden says every Senate decision now requires 60 votes
","In case you haven't heard, the traditionally blue state of Massachusetts just elected Republican Scott Brown to take the seat of the late Edward Kennedy, a standard-bearer for the the Democratic Party. A lot of ink has been been dedicated to what this means for Democrats in the midterm elections, the party's strength and, of course, the health care reform plan in the Senate. The upper chamber needs 60 votes to prevent a Republican filibuster on the bill, and with Brown's election, Democrats have lost their supermajority. Vice President Joe Biden lamented this obstacle in a speech just days before Brown defeated Democratic Senate candidate Martha Coakley. ""As long as I have served … I’ve never seen, as my uncle once said, the Constitution stood on its head as they’ve done,"" Biden said at a Florida fundraiser Jan. 17, 2010, according to a White House pool report. ""This is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators."" We're going to check the second part of Biden's statement, that this is the first time in his political career that every decision in the Senate has required 60 votes. But first, some Senate history. Once upon a time, senators could stall debate indefinitely by reading from cookbooks or reciting Shakespeare (think Jimmy Stewart's impassioned speech in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). In 1917, new rules allowed Senate leadership to end debate so long as it had support from two-thirds of the Senate. In 1975, the Senate reduced that to three-fifths, or 60 of the current 100 senators. Around this time, the old-school filibuster started to become less popular. With only 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster, the majority party would simply file cloture motions -- the technical term to set up a vote to stop debate -- and get on with it, said Senate historian Don Ritchie. Of course, both the minority and the majority have benefited from the tactical tool. The minority can unify and oppose a cloture motion, effectively stalling a bill. And the majority, knowing it has no chance of winning on a vote, can file a cloture motion and then blame the opposition for holding things up. But back to Biden's statement. He won his Senate seat in 1973, just two years before the Senate adopted its new cloture rules, and served until Jan. 15, 2009, shortly before he was sworn in as vice president. The Senate historian's office provided us with a list of cloture votes since 1919, which have been on the uptick in the last three decades. The 110th Congress, which spanned from 2006 to 2008, boasts the most with 112 votes. There were 54 such votes from 2004 to 2006, and 49 vote from 2002 to 2004. There have been 39 cloture votes so far this session, which has been under way since January 2009. Is the increasing use of cloture an example of pure obstructionist politics, as Biden's statement would imply? It's more complicated than that, said Ritchie. In the early '70s, when Biden first came to the Senate, the membership of both the Democratic and Republicans parties were more ideologically diverse and, as a result, party-line votes were scarce, Ritchie said. ""In the late '80s, the two parties became more internally coherent and cohesive,"" he said. ""As a result, leadership was invoking cloture a lot more."" This dynamic has come to a head in recent years when the Senate leadership, whether Republican or Democratic, has had such narrow majorities, Ritchie said. The minority is more likely to unify against legislation, effectively filibustering a bill. As a result, the majority is essentially forced to round up 60 votes to keep the process going. Sarah Binder, a congressional expert teaching at George Washington University and a fellow with the Brookings Institution, echoed Ritchie. In the early 1970s, senators ""were less likely to vote with fellow partisans, so there was a less partisan use of cloture,"" she said. ""Today, there's no ideological overlap between the parties."" Binder also pointed out that the size and scope of the leadership's agendas has grown dramatically in recent years, but it has little time to get big things done. Invoking the 60-vote rule is one way to keep the agenda moving. Back to Biden: His overall point -- that the Senate more frequently requires 60 votes to get things done these days -- has some truth to it. According to Senate experts, there have been more and more cloture votes as the upper chamber becomes increasingly split along party lines. But he said ""every single solitary decision has required 60 senators,"" which is an exaggeration. In 2009, for example, there were 397 roll call votes. According to the Senate Historian's office, only 39 of them were cloture votes. Indeed, we found plenty of major bills that did not require 60 votes to start or end debate, including a bill meant to give more children health insurance and a bill to prevent mortgage foreclosures. Furthermore, the Senate frequently passes noncontroversial bills unanimously, so there are countless pieces of legislation such as post office namings and resolutions that don't require 60 votes. As we like to say at PolitiFact, words matter; if Biden had said every ""major"" decision requires 60 votes, he would have been on more solid ground. As a result, we rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D75A80>],/factchecks/2010/jan/22/joe-biden/biden-says-every-senate-decision-now-requires-60-v/

Chain e-mail says Congress raised own salaries while acting to kill Social Security benefit hikes
","It is now conventional wisdom that American voters are angry -- very angry. And few things set them off as much as perks for lawmakers and the denial of benefits for seniors. A chain e-mail ties together these two hot-button issues and runs with them.The version we received reads, in part:""U.S. House & Senate have voted themselves $4,700 and $5,300 raises.""1. They voted to not give you a [Social Security] Cost of living raise in 2010 and 2011.""2. Your Medicaid premiums will go up $285.60 for the 2-years and You will not get the 3% COLA: $660/yr. Your total 2-yr loss and cost is -$1,600 or -$3,200 for husband and wife.""3. Over 2-yrs they [Members of Congress] each get $10,000""4. Do you feel SCREWED?""5. Will they have your cost of drugs - doctor fees - local taxes - food, etc., increase? NO WAY . They have a raise and better benefits. Why care about you? You never did anything about it in the past. You obviously are too stupid or don't care.""The e-mail closes with a call to action on the 2010 midterm elections: ""SEND THE MESSAGE -- You're FIRED.""Let's take these claims one by one:A congressional pay raiseUnder a law in force for two decades, members of Congress are entitled to a pay raise every year unless they vote to reject it.For two out of the past four years, lawmakers have voted to decline their cost-of-living increase. In votes taken in 2006 and 2009 -- affecting their pay during 2007 and 2010, respectively -- lawmakers turned down the pay raise. In 2007 and 2008, however, lawmakers didn't act to reject their pay raise, so their salaries increased -- by $4,100 for 2008 and by $4,700 for 2009. That boosted the rank-and-file congressional salary to its current level of $174,000. (Leaders in both chambers get more.)So it's true that Congress has acted (or, more precisely, failed to act) in a way that increased lawmaker salaries. But if you compare apples to apples by focusing on the most recent two-year period, as the e-mail does with the Social Security COLA (cost-of-living adjustment), congressional salaries in 2009 and 2010 increased by $4,700 -- less than half of what the e-mail alleged.Bottom line: The e-mail is partly right. Lawmakers did raise their salaries, but by less than the e-mail said.A cost-of-living increase for Social SecurityIn September, PolitiFact looked at an earlier chain e-mail that claimed that ""for the first time in history, the Democratic Congress will not allow an increase in the Social Security COLA."" We'll recap and update our original analysis here.Until 1975, it took an act of Congress to adjust Social Security payments for inflation. But a law enacted in 1972 -- and signed by President Richard Nixon -- created a formula to automatically calculate the COLA every year. The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment was tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).The government compares that index in the third quarter (July, August and September) of the current year to the third quarter of the previous year. Every year since the formula was put into effect, it has resulted in a cost-of-living increase. In fact, high oil prices in the summer of 2008 helped produce a sizable COLA increase in January 2009 of 5.8 percent -- the highest increase in more than 25 years.But lower energy prices and the effects of the recession combined to reduce the CPI-W during the period used to calculate the 2010 Social Security COLA. So in a break with tradition, there was no COLA for Social Security recipients this year. And projections by the Congressional Budget Office suggest that there won't be a COLA for Social Security recipients in 2011, either.But as we stated in our analysis of the earlier e-mail, this process occurs without any intervention by Congress. So it's incorrect to say, as the current e-mail does, that Congress ""voted to not give you a [Social Security] cost of living raise in 2010 and 2011.""In addition, CBO projections aside, it's not yet official that Social Security beneficiaries won't get a COLA for 2011. The statistics that determine whether that will happen won't be calculated for another 10 months or so.Finally, several bills are pending in Congress that would provide seniors with additional money to make up for the lack of a Social Security COLA this year. The bills -- S. 1685, H.R. 3536, H.R. 3557, H.R. 4429, H.R. 3572 and H.R. 3536 -- are being offered by both Democrats and Republicans, and most of them would provide recipients with additional payments of $150 or $250. President Barack Obama is on record saying that he supports the idea of a $250 one-time payment to seniors. As of yet, none has advanced beyond the committee stage.How big could the hit from a lost COLA be? For someone who has a $3,054 monthly benefit -- a comparatively generous amount, based on what a steady earner at the maximum level would get every month if he or she had retired in 2009 at age 70 -- would lose $1,099 over the course of the year compared to what they'd get with a 3 percent COLA. But most recipients would take a much smaller hit, according to Social Security Administration tables.Bottom line: On this point too, the e-mail is partly right. Social Security recipients won't be getting a COLA in 2010, and they are projected not to receive one for 2011, either. But it's inaccurate to blame Congress for that -- and the e-mail fails to note that the president and many lawmakers are working to provide a COLA to seniors retroactively.Increases in premiums for MedicareLet's get one thing clear before we start: It's not Medicaid premiums the e-mail writer meant. It's Medicare premiums.Americans age 65 and older get their health coverage through Medicare and pay monthly premiums to support Part B of the program -- coverage for outpatient services, including physician visits. These premiums are subtracted from a recipient's Social Security check.Part B premiums typically rise every year, but in the past, the annual increase in Social Security benefits has generally exceeded the annual rise in Part B premiums, meaning that the amount of a recipient's Social Security check has risen year after year despite the Part B increases. With the absence of a Social Security COLA this year, the rise in Part B premiums threatens, for the first time, to reduce the amount in Social Security checks compared to the prior year.But we need to raise a couple of caveats. Under a so-called ""hold-harmless"" law, 73 percent of Social Security beneficiaries are protected from any reduction in Social Security benefits caused by a rise in Part B premiums.Another 17 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are covered by both Medicare and Medicaid, and under current law, Medicaid -- not the recipient -- covers the higher Part B premium.And another 3 percent are new enrollees in Social Security or Medicare. While they will pay the higher Part B premiums, they won't see any change in their Social Security check amount because they either weren't getting Social Security checks last year or weren't enrolled in Medicare last year.So, the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries will see the amount in their Social Security checks stay the same, rather than decline, due to this year's Part B premium increases.Those who will see a decrease in their Social Security check -- about 5 percent of Medicare enrollees -- are generally those who have a modified adjusted gross income greater than $85,000 (for individuals) or $170,000 (for couples). For these recipients, the typical year-to-year increase in Part B premiums will be $14.10 per month. That works out to be $169.20 additional per year for an individual, or $338.40 additional for a couple -- levels far below what the e-mail alleged.Meanwhile, there's one additional factor that could cut into Social Security benefits: an increase in premiums for Medicare Part D, the part that covers prescription drugs. The impact from Medicare Part D premium hikes will vary widely because it's a voluntary program and because enrollees may choose among a variety of plans, each with different levels of benefits and premiums.One estimate cited by the Kaiser Family Foundation predicts that 1.2 million beneficiaries could see their Part D premiums rise this year by at least $10 a month -- a change that would mean dollar-for-dollar reductions in their Social Security checks. That's about 3 percent of those enrolled in Medicare as a whole. A larger number of beneficiaries could see smaller monthly changes.Bottom line: The e-mail is correct that the absence of a Social Security COLA this year will affect Medicare premiums (even though it mistakenly called them Medicaid premiums). However, the vast majority of beneficiaries will see no reductions in their Social Security checks, and the relatively small proportion who do see a decliine -- many of them at the higher end of the income scale -- are likely to see increases far smaller than those alleged in the e-mail.SummaryAs with many chain e-mails we've seen, this one takes nuggets of truth and distorts them, adding several layers of inaccuracies.For one thing, the losses suggested in the e-mail are on the higher end of the scale. If the recently retired high-earner who was cited above also got hit by both types of premium increases, he or she would stand to lose $1,389 for the year. If his or her spouse was in the same situation, they would lose a combined $2,778. That's not so far off from the $1,600 to $3,200 claimed by the e-mail. But it's also for an extreme case. For most recipients, the hit would be much smaller.So let's recap. To its credit, the e-mail is correct that Congress has acted to increase its own pay, that Social Security recipients will not see a cost-of-living increase this year and that some recipients may in fact see a decrease in their checks from rising Medicare premiums.But the e-mail got many key details wrong. It cherry-picked its data in a way that overstated the increase in congressional salaries; it wrongly blamed Congress for killing the Social Security COLA (when in fact many lawmakers and the president are working to reverse that development); it vastly overstated the number of people who will be hit by rising Medicare premiums; and it used an extreme case in constructing its example of income being lost.If the author of the e-mail had been more careful in vetting the statistics, this missive could have been informative. But since the author was not, we will rate it Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972C1A40>],/factchecks/2010/jan/22/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-congress-raised-own-salaries-whi/

Medina says TxDOT lost $1 billion
","
The Texas Department of Transportation has become an easy target this campaign season, and Debra Medina, the Wharton businesswoman vying to knock Gov. Rick Perry from his seat, took a swing at the agency during the Jan. 14 GOP gubernatorial debate.

""We've got to look at transparency, efficiency and accountability in all areas of state government,"" she said. ""We have seen sloth, if you will, sloppy management in the Texas Youth Commission, in criminal justice, in the Texas Department of Transportation, where they misplaced a billion dollars.""

A billion dollars, MIA?

Chris Lippincott, TxDOT director of media relations, said: ""That's not correct.""

In October 2007, TxDOT officials accidentally counted $1.1 billion in bonds revenue twice, he said — a mistake that led the agency to commit an extra billion to road projects.

Chief Financial Officer James Bass realized the agency had erred by a billion dollars when it approved $4.2 billion for construction in fiscal 2008. Because of the mistake, the department announced huge cuts in spending that froze some road projects that were ready to go.

""There was an accounting error,"" Lippincott said. ""A miscalculation.""

Actually, there were two accounting errors, according to an August 2008 state audit of the agency. In adding up what was available for projects, department forecasters added $581 million of bond money that was already in a $3.1 billion total. Then, they lumped in another $488 million from the Texas Mobility Fund, money that was actually already tabbed to pay for past projects. Taken together, that was $1.069 billion that at least some people in the agency counted twice.

TxDOT didn't announce its gaffe until a February 2008 legislative hearing, where lawmakers were skeptical that it was just a number-crunching error and not a tactical move to create a financial crisis and thus pressure legislators to ease the limits on private toll road contracts.

The audit concluded that ""ineffective communication, a complex reporting structure, and misunderstanding of reported data led the Department of Transportation to overschedule $1.1 billion in planned contract awards for fiscal year 2008.""

No one has shown that any money was misplaced, as Medina claimed. The money never existed in the first place. 
But she didn't miss the point. The transportation behemoth did make a billion-dollar mistake, a misstep that hobbled crucial road projects.

We rate Medina's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809789BB40>],/factchecks/2010/jan/22/debra-medina/medina-said-txdot-lost-1-billion/

Vermont's governor inflated his record on reducing opioid treatment waiting lists
","The Department of Health estimates about 8,000 people in the state are in treatment for opioid use disorder. The state has had wait times for treatment off and on for more than five years and has struggled to ensure that professionals can meet the demand. During his successful re-election campaign, Republican Gov. Phil Scott touted his administration's overwhelming success in fighting opioid addiction. ""We had a waiting list (for drug treatment) in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700,"" Scott said at a gubernatorial debate in Rutland last month. ""We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero."" That gave us pause – did waitlists for treatment in Chittenden plummet from 700 to zero during Scott’s tenure? We asked the campaign for evidence to back up the candidate’s claims, but we never heard back. The Vermont Department of Health, however, closely tracks waitlists at the state’s six ""hubs,"" the regional centers where people addicted to opioids can get high-intensity medication-assisted treatment. State data indicates the governor is off on the original waitlist number – by several hundred. In January 2017, when Scott took office, there were 145 people on hub waitlists statewide, and only 134 on the waitlist for the Chittenden hub. Hubs are the lynchpin of Vermont’s hub-and-spoke drug treatment model. Drug treatment is typically initiated at hubs, where people suffering from opioid abuse disorder can get daily doses of their medication, along with counseling and referrals to social services. Less intensive services are provided at so-called ""spokes,"" a collection of about 90 providers made up of doctor’s offices and community clinics, where patients can get follow-up care. The numbers tracked by the state do show a precipitous decline in waitlists at hubs since 2017. In fact, in 2018, there were no waitlists for treatment at any hubs in March, May, June, July and August, the last month for which data is available. In Chittenden County, the state hasn’t counted a single person on a waitlist at the Howard Center’s Chittenden Clinic, the regional hub for Chittenden and Addison counties, from September 2017 to August 2018, except for one blip in April 2018, when two people were on the waitlist. Dana Poverman, the director of Medication Assisted Treatment at the Howard Center Chittenden Clinic, said the number on the waitlist is still zero. ""We’ve really come a long way in terms of access to medicine-assisted treatment,"" she said. That’s thanks in large part, Poverman said, to the opening of the state’s sixth hub in St. Albans and a dramatic increase in spoke providers. Less is known about what waitlists look like at Vermont’s spokes. The state doesn’t formally track how many people might be waiting for treatment from providers. Beth Tanzman, the executive director of the Blueprint for Health, which oversees the spokes, says the state has ""a pretty good sense of what access looks like"" through regular check-ins. ""Our understanding right now is that we are able to get everyone into care easily within 72 hours,"" she said. In Chittenden County, people are typically able to access same-day treatment, Tanzman said. In Middlebury and Springfield, where there is a dearth of spoke providers, immediate care is more difficult to obtain. Our ruling In trumpeting Vermont’s success tackling the opioid epidemic, Scott said waitlists for treatment in Chittenden County had fallen from about 700 to zero. He’s right that, according to available data, there is basically no longer a waitlist for treatment at Chittenden’s regional hub at the Howard Center. But he’s completely off the mark when it comes to how long the waitlist was when he first came into office.

Were GOP's House losses dramatically smaller than historical pattern?
","In recent midterm elections when presidents faced a backlash from voters, the president accepted their brushback. In 2006, George W. Bush acknowledged a ""thumping"" by Democrats. In 2010, Barack Obama said he’d been delivered a ""shellacking"" by Republicans. By contrast, when President Donald Trump addressed the results of the 2018 midterms -- when his party lost at least 31 seats and control of the House -- he focused primarily on Republicans’ ability to flip at least three seats in the Senate. ""It was a big day yesterday,"" he said. ""Incredible day. And last night the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House."" (Officially, Republicans currently have the same number of seats in the Senate -- 51 -- with three races still undecided in Mississippi, Florida and Arizona. You can read more about that in a separate fact-check.) Later in the day-after press conference, Trump said, ""In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents and overcame a historic number of retirements. The most House Republican retirements in 88 years -- 43 House Republicans retired."" The Republicans did have to cope with many retirements, which in 2018 reached a high for Republicans going back at least as far as 1930. But Trump is wrong that the Republicans outperformed historical precedents. The losses were fairly average or worse than average. Here is the data for midterm losses for the president’s party going back to the Civil War. The 2018 figure is in green. We have set it for 31 net-seats-gained that were confirmed by Nov. 8. This number could grow a bit as about a dozen races are yet to be called, and a Democrat is leading in five of those uncalled races. If we ignore the small number of years in which the president’s party gained seats in the House, the average loss going back to 1862 is 38 seats and the median loss is 30 seats. That may make the loss of at least 31 seats in 2018 seem pretty average -- though even there it would be wrong to say, as Trump did, that 2018 represented a dramatic overperformance. It would even be worse if Democrats end up winning the five uncalled contests where they are currently ahead. More problematic is that the swings in recent years have been much smaller. Going back to 1970, the average midterm loss for the president’s party has been 23 seats, and the median loss has been 14 seats. By this standard, a loss of 31 seats (or more) looks pretty substantial. Indeed, if you look just at losses suffered under Republican presidents, the total for 2018 exceeds all but two midterms going back to the Great Depression. The 2018 total even edged out the losses under George W. Bush in 2006, which was the last time the Democrats re-took the House in a midterm election. ""This one was clearly pretty bad,"" said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. And while the Republican outlook in the House was indeed harmed by retirements, as Trump said, the GOP conversely benefited from district lines that were drawn largely by Republicans following the 2010 Census. ""Republican gerrymanders likely minimized the damage, preventing even more GOP losses,"" said Costas Panagopoulos, a political scientist at Northeastern University. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump said, ""In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents."" That’s not what the numbers currently show, and the GOP’s position in the House is likely to end up worse as the outstanding races are called. If you look all the way back to the Civil War era, the expected GOP losses are in line with the long-term historical average -- not a dramatic overperformance. And if you look at the patterns typical over the last 50 years, the projected losses for 2018 are one-third higher than the average losses and more than double the median losses during that period. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A61DC0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/08/donald-trump/were-gops-house-losses-dramatically-smaller-histor/

Readers who look below the headline will see no story and no documentation, just a nearly-10-minute video of Jones' show in which an anonymous caller, identified as ""Kevin in West Virginia"" who says: ""I actually moved to Maryland and I had to vote in Maryland for the early election or for early voting, and one thing that I witnessed -- people had already voted and they're letting them vote again. And this was in Hagerstown, Maryland. And I don't quite understand how they can do that."" Jones asks: ""What were you seeing?"" Kevin responds: ""Well, I'm blind so I didn't see it. I could hear them saying, ‘Um, you know, Oh! You voted yesterday but you can go ahead and recast your vote again today.' I mean, it's insane, and I wish I could have pulled my phone out or recorder at the time and gotten this on audio or something."" Jones then asserts, without offering evidence, that Democrats in Maryland, Texas and ""all over"" have been busted for doing the same type of thing, adding, ""And it's always Democrats because they have no morals."" Jones does not ask, and the caller does not say, if there was any indication that the person trying to vote again was a Democrat. ""Somebody's making a joke, I'm guessing,"" Donna Duncan, assistant deputy for election policy at the Maryland State Board of Elections, told PolitiFact in a phone interview. She said that early voting is done through the electronic voter registration database and anyone who tried to vote twice would be immediately flagged. Their only other option, if they insisted that they hadn't voted yet, would be to cast a provisional ballot, which would be investigated by election officials and never counted if it was confirmed that the person had already voted. Duncan said she was unaware of any specific complaints of double voting in the Nov 6 election. In short, InfoWars is alleging voting fraud by Democrats in Maryland based on the claim of a single anonymous caller who says he overheard a comment that was casually made in public under circumstances that, even if accurately interpreted, don't implicate any particular political party.

Facebook meme makes false claims about benefits to immigrants who cross border illegally
","A popular meme on Facebook gives the false impression that people who cross into the United States illegally are automatically given a wide range of benefits, including the right to vote. The meme says that people who cross illegally into Canada, Iran, and North Korea face harsh consequences as punishment for that action. For instance, it says that crossing illegally in Iran gets you eight years in prison. Whereas crossing illegally into the United States leads to benefits. ""If you cross the border illegally in the U.S., you get a drivers license, medical insurance, housing, career training, the right to vote,"" said the meme posted Oct. 31 on the Facebook page Judge Jeanine Pirro Fans. It's been shared more than 90,000 times. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Immigrants who are apprehended by Border Patrol are not provided the benefits the meme claims, they're rather placed in removal proceedings or returned to their countries. Some may apply for immigration protections such as asylum, but that still doesn't immediately grant them priviliges such as a driver's license or the right to vote. Immigrants who live in the United States illegally are generally barred from most federal benefits. However, in some states, low-income children can be eligible for health insurance regardless of immigration status. Some states also issue driver's licenses to people who are illegally in the United States. But those things are not guaranteed or broadly available across the country. The meme misleads and leaves out significant context to create a false narrative. States are responsible for issuing driver’s licenses — and most don’t issue them to immigrants in the country illegally. About a dozen states do grant driving privileges regardless of immigration status. Those cards are limited for driving and not valid as official forms of identification for federal purposes. Some states call the cards a Driving Privilege Card or Driving Authorization Card. Immigrants must provide certain required documentation in order to get the cards. Immigrants in the country illegally are ineligible to buy medical insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace under the Affordable Care Act. They are also ineligible for non-emergency Medicaid. However, some states, such as California, allow low-income undocumented children and youth under 19 years old to get medical coverage through their state’s Medicaid program. Under law, hospitals can’t turn away someone needing emergency care based on immigration status. Individuals living illegally in the United States are ineligible for federal housing assistance. But it’s possible that they live in a household where someone is a lawful permanent resident or U.S. citizen eligible for housing benefits. In 2017, the Office of Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development asked the department to clarify and offer guidance on noncitizen eligibility for some programs. This is vague. But children in the country illegally are allowed to go to public school regardless of immigration status. This was guaranteed by a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case.  Noncitizens are not allowed to vote for candidates running for federal office, such as the presidency or congress. However, a small number of jurisdictions allow noncitizens to vote in local elections for school board or city council. If someone crossed into the United States illegally and eventually became a naturalized U.S. citizen, that person would have the right to vote as would someone born in the United States. A Facebook post said, ""If you cross the border illegally in the U.S., you get a drivers license, medical insurance, housing, career training, the right to vote."" The post attempts to contrast illegal border crossing consequences and punishments in other countries and the United States. If someone is caught crossing U.S. borders illegally, they're placed in removal proceedings or returned to their countries. They don't automatically get the benefits outlined in the meme. People who already live in the United States illegally may be able to get some priviliges such as a driver's license or medical care — if their state allows it, not many do. Those benefits are not guaranteed across the country. Immigrants in the country illegally are barred from federal housing benefits. Children can go to public school regardless of immigration status, though it's unclear if that's what the post suggests by ""career training."" Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections, a few jurisdictions allow noncitizens to participate in local elections. The post leaves out important context to distort the facts.

A bus for the caravan needs additional context
","A story shared on Facebook claims that the Mexican government is helping the migrant caravan by paying for professional charter buses to help leapfrog the group closer to the United States border. The story was posted by the Red State, a conservative political blog, on Oct. 30 and cites a Fox News journalist, who reported from Mexico. The broadcast showed footage of buses lined up as hundreds of Central American migrants waited to board. The caravan is one of three trekking through Mexico and includes thousands of people. The Red State story said that the growing migrant caravan headed toward the U.S. border was followed by ""disturbing reports of the migrants getting state-funded help from Mexico."" This report was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the story was partially accurate, but lacked some essential details. In the Oct. 30 broadcast, Fox News reporter Griff Jenkins said it was the first time he had seen ""an organized bus operation from the state of Oaxaca actually getting volunteer buses to put people on them and take them to their next location."" He said the buses were intended for women and children, but many fathers and husbands didn’t want to be separated from their families. Jenkins also said that while the Mexican police had tried to dissuade the caravan from crossing the Guatemala-Mexican border in mid October, it seems ""at least Mexican towns are really assisting them to make their way now."" An AZ Central story from the same day reported that migrants began arriving in Oaxaca that morning from Santiago Niltepec, a town about 30 miles to the south. For the first time, the outlet reported, buses were ""used to transport women and children."" Several images captured by the Associated Press also show families and children on buses, with reporting that the rides were donated to help some families get to the next destination. The images were taken the morning of Oct. 30 in the Niltepec, Oaxaca state. It is not known who paid for the donated rides. It isn’t clear if those were the same buses that Jenkins saw, but the time, date and region matches multiple reports that said families took donated buses to get to their next destination. A few days later, on Nov. 2, a Mexican governor offered to help assist the caravan with buses, The Associated Press reported. Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes announced in a video that authorities in the state would provide humanitarian assistance as well as buses to leapfrog them to the country’s capital. But almost immediately after, Yunes withdrew the offer in a second video, saying that because Mexico City’s water system was undergoing maintenance, it would not be correct to send the migrants there. However, reports say that the scheduled maintenance had been known for some time. Most of the migrants were reported to have continued on foot instead, and reached the Mexican capital over the weekend. It is unclear whether the buses Fox News saw and reported on were the work of the Mexican federal government, but other reports from the same day and region said buses were donated for some migrant families to use to get to their next destination. At one point, a Mexican governor did make an offer to transport migrants by bus to Mexico City, the group’s next stop at the time. However, he withdrew that plan almost immediately thereafter.

More felons regained right to vote in Florida than population of many states
","Florida has had one of the toughest processes in the nation for felons to regain their voting rights, but that changed on election night when voters approved amending the state constitution to restore the right to vote to  many felons. How many? News articles put the figure at above 1 million. One observer -- an NYU business professor -- compared it to the population of several states: ""The number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire,"" tweeted Professor Scott Galloway who told PolitiFact that he wasn’t involved in Amendment 4 in Florida. Galloway was talking about the states individually and not combined. We found that it was difficult to pinpoint the number of felons who are now eligible to vote but estimates put it above the residential population of many smaller states. Amendment 4, approved by about 64 percent of voters, amends the state Constitution to restore voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete the terms of their sentence including parole or probation. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses. Florida has previously had one of the toughest processes in the nation for felons to regain their voting rights, which involved waiting for years and then appearing before the governor and state Cabinet. The Palm Beach Post found that the current Cabinet, made up entirely of Republicans, restored the voting rights of twice as many whites as blacks. Two leaders of organizations that advocated for Amendment 4 -- Marc Mauer at The Sentencing Project and Howard Simon at the ACLU of Florida -- wrote a memo in February that estimates how many felons could regain the right to vote. Their conclusion: as many as 1.4 million. Here’s how they arrived at the figure: They started with the total Florida disenfranchised population, which they estimated was about 1.7 million. Then they subtracted felons who are not eligible including those convicted of murder or felony sex crimes, those in prison or in jail, under probation or supervision or who have not paid fees, fines or victim restitution. That ultimately leaves a group of about 1.4 million. However, there are some factors that could bring that number lower including many of those felons have not paid restitution, fines or fees. In Florida, a 2007 analysis by the Department of Corrections found that of 80,000 people awaiting rights restoration nearly 40 percent had not completed restitution payments, the ACLU and the Sentencing Project found. Failure to pay restitution would make them ineligible to vote. And if we apply the 40 percent level of non-payment, that could reduce the eligible population from 1.4 million to about 840,000. Many news outlets have cited the 1.4 million figure. We asked some state officials questions about the figure and did not receive back any replies that disputed it. The day after the amendment passed, the state Division of Elections had not released any details about how the amendment will be implemented, other than to stay it takes effect in January. (Many state and county election officials were focused on expected recounts following the election.) Galloway’s tweet said that the number of felons who can regain the right to vote is larger than the population of of 10 states that ranged from about 579,000 (Wyoming) to 1.3 million (Maine and New Hampshire.) If we use the estimate of 1.4 million Florida felons are now eligible to vote, then Galloway’s tweet is correct. If we assume that the number of eligible felons is lower due to non payment of fines -- around 840,000 -- then six states on this list have a higher population. State Census population estimate July 1, 2017 Wyoming 579,315 Vermont 623,657 Alaska 739,795 North Dakota 755,393 South Dakota 869,666 Delaware 961,939 Rhode Island 1,059,639 Montana 1,050,493 Maine 1,335,907 New Hampshire 1,342,795 Galloway tweeted that ""the number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire."" The populations of the states Galloway cited range from about 579,000 to 1.3 million million. The number of felons who are now eligible to register to vote is as many as 1.4 million, according to the ACLU and the Sentencing Project. However nonpayment of fines could bring that number down to 840,000. In that scenario, six of the 10 states on Galloway’s list have a higher population. Galloway’s tweet generally seems on point though it could be that the ultimate number of eligible felons is a lower number than some of the states’ populations he cited. We rate this claim Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F82200>],/factchecks/2018/nov/08/steve-galloway/more-felons-regained-right-vote-florida-population/

Donald Trump's talk of a historic Senate gain depends on races that remain undecided
","President Donald Trump, taking stock of the election results during a White House press conference, downplayed Democrats’ retaking of the House and highlighted GOP gains in the Senate. Republicans flipped at least three Senate seats last night, with races in Arizona and Florida still too close to call (Republicans are ahead in the votes counted). Republicans lost a seat it held in Nevada. In Mississippi, a Republican and Democrat are headed to a Nov. 27 runoff, where the Republican is favored. So, as we write this, Republicans have 51 seats in the Senate and are likely to add one more in Mississippi. The number can grow to 54 if the races in Arizona and Florida stay the GOP’s way. Trump, who campaigned vigorously for a handful of Republican candidates in tight races, sought to highlight the historical significance of his party’s Senate wins. ""This election marks the largest Senate gains for a president's party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy's in 1962,"" Trump said. Trump’s read of historical election tallies depends on the outcome of the outstanding outcomes in Mississippi, Arizona and Florida. Few presidents’ first midterm elections in modern American political history have yielded Senate gains for the president’s party. Part of the equation in this particular election was that Democrats’ were disadvantaged by the fact that they were defending more seats than Republicans. That included 10 states Trump won handily in the 2016 presidential election. It’s also not unprecedented that the House and Senate end up split between two parties following a midterm. Still, it’s fairly unusual for a president’s party to notch a net gain in the Senate during a president’s first midterm, as the data from 538.com below shows: YEAR PRESIDENT SENATE NET LOSS/GAIN BY PRESIDENT’S PARTY 2018 Donald Trump (R) +0-3 2010 Barack Obama (D) -6 2002 George W.

But the outstanding elections will determine if Trump’s claim is ultimately correct. President George W. Bush saw Republicans net two Senate seats in 2002, while President Richard Nixon and Republicans gained one seat in 1970, according to 538.com. If the results hold and Republicans win in Mississippi, Florida and Arizona, Trump would be correct that Republicans’ Senate gains in the 2018 midterms (+3) represent the largest first midterm Senate pickup since President John F. Kennedy’s Democratic party gained four seats in 1962. Those races are not yet called, though. While Republicans are in a better position in all three states, Trump is counting gains that are not yet certain. We rate statements based on what's known at the time they were made.

No, the Starbucks COO never said men are 'root of all evil'
","Rosalind Brewer is the first woman and the first black American to hold the position of chief operating officer at Starbucks. Recent Facebook posts claim she’s also wary of the people who often serve in that role: white men. ""Starbucks COO Rosalind Brewer has shocked shareholders after it was revealed she believes white men are the root of all evil,"" reads one post that appeared in Facebook groups like ""The Liborants,"" ""The Deplorables"" and ""LARGEST GROUP EVER! We need to 10000000 members to Make America Great Again!"" on Nov. 5. The claim stems from an old story on News Punch, a website with the tagline ""where mainstream fears to tread."" The story, published Feb. 17, 2018, has this headline: ""Starbucks COO: White Men Are Root Of All Evil."" ""Starbucks COO Rosalind Brewer has shocked shareholders after it was revealed she believes white men are the root of all evil,"" the story says. ""According to a recently surfaced 2015 CNN interview, Brewer says she is extremely ‘triggered’ by the sight of white men in business."" This story has also been shared on Facebook in recent days, and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Sean Adl-Tabatabai, is listed at the bottom of the story as editor-in-chief of Your News Wire (that website, YourNewsWire.com, redirects to News Punch’s home page). In response to an email seeking more information about the claim, Adl-Tabatabai said: ""That was an old story from YourNewsWire.com. I’m not sure why it has been appearing on social media again, but we have unpublished it now that it has been brought to our attention as its (sic) not something we now stand by."" The story, which was pulled after PolitiFact’s query, linked to a Washington Post story from December 2015 with the headline: ""Sam’s Club CEO called ‘racist’ for remarks on diversity."" Before she moved to Starbucks, Brewer was at the helm of the Walmart chain. The Post story concerns comments she made in an interview with CNN that month that prompted the allegations of racism.   During the interview, CNN anchor Poppy Harlow notes that Brewer is a rarity in ""the corner office"" as a minority, female CEO. ""Where do you fall on who has to make the change and how it is going to happen so that there are more women like you represented in the top echelons of corporate America?"" Harlow then asks. Brewer says it has to start with the top leadership at a company. ""My executive team is very diverse, and I make that a priority. I demand it of my team and within the structure. And then, every now and then, you have to nudge your partners, and you have to speak up and speak out. And I try to use my platform for that. … I try to set an example. I mentor many women inside my company and outside the company because I think it’s important."" Brewer then agrees with Harlow that diversity is important in hiring for top positions at a company.  ""And I talk to my suppliers about it. Just today I met with a supplier, and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian males. That was interesting,"" Brewer says. ""I decided not to talk about it directly with the folks in the room because there were actually no females, like, levels down. So I’m going to place a call to him."" Her remarks led to hashtags like #boycottsamsclub and #boycottracistsamsclub, according to the Post. But while the comments may have been controversial, they don’t indicate that she thinks white men are ""evil"" or ""the root of all evil.""

Yes, armed U.S. civilians are headed to the border
","Days after false claims that Beto O’Rourke was illegally using campaign funds to help the migrant caravan, the Patriot Journal published a ""special report"" on Nov. 5 announcing that supporters of President Donald Trump were en route to meet the migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. ""Even Donald didn’t expect his supporters would take matters into their own hands,"" begins a story about armed civilians heading south as Central American migrants continue their march north. ""After Democrats caught funding caravan, Trump supporters send a swift response,"" the headline says. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The piece seems to be based on another story that’s quoted in the article and attributed to MSN. ""Gun-carrying civilian groups and border vigilantes have heard a call to arms in President Trump’s warnings about threats to American security posed by caravans of Central American migrants moving through Mexico,"" the excerpt says. ""They’re packing coolers and tents, oiling rifles and tuning up aerial drones, with plans to form caravans of their own and trail American troops to the border."" Turns out that story, though published on MSN’s website, is actually by The Washington Post. The newspaper goes on to report that Shannon McGauley, president of the Texas Minutemen, was then preparing to head from the Dallas area for the Rio Grande to defend the country against what Trump has called ""an invasion."" McGauley said the Texas Minutemen have 100 volunteers on their way to the Rio Grande ""who want to help stop the migrants, with more likely on the way,"" according to the Post. McGauley said he couldn’t put a number on how big the group will ultimately be.   On Nov. 2, the Washington Post also reported that U.S. military leaders are concerned about the presence of ""unregulated armed militia"" groups turning up in areas where U.S. troops will operate. The paper couldn’t independently confirm the report’s authenticity, the story says, ""but military officials did not dispute its veracity."" U.S. Army documents obtained by Newsweek and published on its website on Nov. 1 report an ""estimated 200 unregulated armed militia members currently operating along the southwest border."" Rumblings about militia groups trying to stop the migrant caravan date back to at least late October. The Associated Press reported that month that militia members and far-right activists were raising money and airing plans to head to the border. Border Patrol warned some Texas landowners that ""possible armed civilians"" could come onto their property because of the caravan, according to the AP. On Nov. 4, Willamette Week, an alternative newspaper in Portland, reported that, like the Texas Minutemen, Oregon militia members say they’re also going to the border. But the weekly cautioned against reading too much into the claims of militia members. It cited a tweet from J.J. MacNab, an expert on U.S. paramilitary militia groups and anti-government extremist organizations: ""Reporters should keep in mind that militia members talk tough online but rarely actually show up,"" she said. P.J. Tobia, a producer for VICE News Tonight, piggybacked on that sentiment, tweeting: ""I spoke to a lot of militia folks this week. Almost all are staying home. The ones on the border already are mostly from nearby and would be there anyway. And ALWAYS take their self-reported headcounts with much salt."" It’s unclear how many militia group members will wind up at the border in addition to the couple hundred the Army estimates are already there. Still, news reports indicate that action is afoot, even if it’s just collecting cash for the cause. One Oregon woman said she had raised about $4,000 online before Halloween to help militias buy supplies, according to the AP.

He considered the appearance a success, and he said so to the Carmel Pine Cone a few days later. The newspaper covers Eastwood’s hometown, where he was elected mayor in 1986. A story published in the paper on Sept. 7, 2012, reports that Eastwood had three points that he wanted to make that day: ""That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left, that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who’s not doing a good job."" ""President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,"" the paper quotes Eastwood as saying. ""(Mitt) Romney and (Paul) Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that’s what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle."" That’s not quite what the Facebook post said. Eastwood was talking about Obama, the person, not his presidency.

Dated photo used to make false claim about migrants, disease
","A 2014 photo of a man with a rash has been dredged up and re-posted on Facebook by a group that claims numerous diseases are coming across the border into the United States. But the accompanying photo is four years old. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar shared the original photo with the Houston Chronicle in 2014, along with a series of other images that showed cramped and unsanitary conditions in a Customs and Border Protection facility in South Texas. The claim that immigrants bring infectious diseases isn’t new. We’ve fact-checked a couple iterations of the claim over the years. In 2014, a congressman said migrants may be bringing the Ebola virus across the U.S.-Mexico border. We rated that Pants on Fire. In 2015, Donald Trump said, ""Tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" At the time, the health experts we spoke with agreed that there was no evidence of massive influx of infections across the border. Most recently, other posts have gone viral about the migrants in the caravan heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border supposedly bringing diseases. There are no known reports of this being the case, according to The New York Times. The photo in the Facebook post is from a particular outbreak of scabies in 2014. Scabies is a treatable skin condition, but it can spread rapidly under crowded conditions. That outbreak was largely contained to migrants living in close quarters in detention centers. Only a small handful of border patrol agents appear to have contracted it. There is some evidence that diseases cross between the U.S.-Mexico border, but the Center for Disease Control attributes spread of disease in that region not to illegal immigration but to legal back-and-forth between the United States and Mexico. There is no evidence that undocumented immigrants to the U.S. are carrying deadly diseases. Spread of disease is more likely from the much larger numbers of legal crossing across the border and the number of international travelers visiting other countries and then returning to the United States.

Pants on Fire claim: Armed Black Panthers on Atlanta streets on Election Day
","The eponymous Right Wing News website posted an apocalyptic headline on election day.""Black Panthers Just Took Over City – All Out War On Election Day,"" it said.

""We are not responding to the New Black Panthers or anyone. It’s smooth sailing."" As anyone reading further in the article will see, the headline is a dressed up take on a demonstration that happened over the weekend. The Atlanta chapter of the New Black Panther Party –– not to be confused with the original Black Panther Party, members of which have disavowed the new group –– held what it called an ""armed rally against voter suppression"" on Saturday, Nov. 3. A handful of members bearing semi-automatic style weapons walked around Atlanta’s West End neighborhood.  A photo posted on the New Black Panther Party’s Facebook page, Nov. 3, 2018 In some photos, they hold signs for Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor. (If she wins, she would be the country’s first African-American woman governor.) The New Black Panther Party posted over 20 photos on its Facebook page, along with the disclaimer that, ""we are not working for and we did not plan this event with either campaign, and we have members with different political views both here in Atlanta as well as nationwide and even right here in this post."" Under Georgia law, it is legal to carry long guns, including semi-automatic rifles, in public. Brian Kemp, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, tweeted a photo from the rally Nov. 4, saying ""How radical is my opponent? Look at who is backing her. The New Black Panther Party is ‘a racist...antisemitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews, and law enforcement.’"" Abrams campaign spokeswoman Abigail Collazo responded to the rally and the photos Monday. ""Brian Kemp is the only candidate in this race who has posed for pictures with supporters wearing racist, hate-filled T-shirts and refused to denounce them, while Abrams continues to condemn any racist, anti-Semitic, or otherwise discriminatory words and actions,"" Collazo said.

False Facebook post claims millions of fraudulent votes cast in California
","A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims that more than a million votes tallied in California were cast by unregistered voters, before the polls were even closed on Election Day. The post attributed the data to findings by the conservative group Judicial Watch. We reached out to Judicial Watch, which denied any affiliation with the post. ""Not ours,"" said Jill Farrell, a Judicial Watch spokesperson. ""Just some random person misinterpreting."" Farrell suggested the post may have been a botched interpretation of a lawsuit Judicial Watch brought against the state of California and Los Angeles County. The litigation centers on California’s handling of state voter rolls, which contain a large number of voters who are considered ""inactive."" Registered voters may be rendered inactive if official election materials like a mail ballot or voter guide are sent and returned as undeliverable. According to our friends at Snopes, estimates do show some California counties list more registered voters on their rolls than eligible adults, though some argue the methodology underlying this count is dubious. The merits of the legal arguments are beyond the scope of this fact-check. What’s key here is that the Facebook post misses the critical distinction between inactive voters and fraudulent votes. Judicial Watch argues that retaining inactive voters on the rolls poses a voting fraud risk. The group does not claim more than a million fraudulent votes were cast in California, as this Facebook post states. At the time the post was circulated, the votes had not even been tallied yet.  We rate this Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFF980>],/factchecks/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/false-facebook-post-claims-millions-fraudulent-vot/

Did Beto O'Rourke really use campaign funds to help the migrant caravan?
","Sen. Ted Cruz is in a closer-than-comfortable race with U.S. Rep Beto O’Rourke, and trying to draw a connection between the El Paso Democrat and the migrant caravan. He’s helped by recent reports that he’s caught in a ""caravan scandal,"" as one headline describes allegations that O’Rourke is illegally using campaign resources to help Honduran migrants. ""Mr. Open Borders O’Rourke—who has called for amnesty—has staffers giving aid to the caravan coming for our border,"" reads a story posted on Patriot Journal on Nov. 2. ""Money raised to help O’Rourke get elected is being used to fund migrants. This is clearly breaking campaign finance laws."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) CrowdTangle data shows it had been shared on Facebook more than 16,000 times as of Election Day. The Patriot Journal doesn’t have contact information on its website, and the publication did not immediately respond to a Facebook message seeking more information about its story. However, its claim seems to stem from a video posted to YouTube on Nov. 1 by Project Veritas, an organization that creates undercover sting videos of its targets, including media organizations. (Patriot Journal embedded the video in its story.) The approximately 24-minute video is titled: ""Nobody needs to know: Beto campaign appears to illegally spend funds on supplies for caravan aliens,"" and it shows clips of campaign staffers talking about buying food and giving rides to immigrants.   ""For me, I can ignore the rules,"" a field manager says near the beginning. ""I don’t mind breaking the rules and I can defend any position."" ""Don’t ever repeat this and stuff but, like, if we just say that we’re buying food for a campaign event, like the Halloween events, cause there’s block walks coming up for Halloween,"" a field organizer is recorded saying a few moments later. When the undercover Project Veritas staffer says, ""I know that we’re using some of the campaign resources to help with the migrants and like I just didn’t want anybody to get in trouble with that, like I didn’t want them to ask me any questions about people using resources,"" O’Rourke’s campaign manager says, ""Don’t worry."" James O’Keefe, the conservative activist behind Project Veritas, is then shown in El Paso explaining to viewers what he says the videos mean. ""The videos that you’re about to see appear to show Beto’s campaign workers and his staff all the way up to his campaign manager, Jody Casey, knowingly using campaign resources and funds to help assist, subsidize illegal aliens entering the United States, some of them from the migrant caravan,"" O’Keefe says. A later clip of the field manager shows him talking to another staffer about ""that migrant caravan."" ""A few of them got here already and they’re dropping them off like really close to Missouri,"" he says. (Missouri is the name of a street in El Paso.) The staffer then says the migrants are ""the Hondurans."" In response to an email seeking more information about the allegations, O’Rourke’s campaign forwarded this statement from Nov. 2: ""Ted Cruz shamefully and falsely suggested that the Beto for Texas campaign used campaign dollars to fund a caravan that remains hundreds of miles from the U.S.-Mexico border."" The campaign also pointed PolitiFact to two news stories in the Texas Tribune and the El Paso Times. The Tribune story, posted online Nov. 2, reports that the campaign said staffers recently ""took it upon themselves"" to use campaign funds to donate supplies to an El Paso nonprofit. The campaign said the contributions, totaling less than $300, will be ""appropriately reported"" to the Federal Election Commission, according to the story. O’Rourke’s campaign said the staffers were responding to an unrelated situation in which the federal government dropped off more than 100 migrants seeking asylum at a bus station in downtown El Paso, the Tribune reports.   The El Paso Times reported on Nov. 2 that Chris Evans, a spokesman for the campaign, said staffers used prepaid credit cards to buy ""wipes, diapers, water, fruit and granola bars"" and donated them to Annunciation House, a nonprofit that provides support to immigrants. But it’s not illegal to donate campaign funds to a nonprofit as long as the parties abide by this rule: The organization can’t compensate the candidate—if it’s going to at all—before using or spending the entire donation, according to FEC. In other words, the donation can’t personally benefit the candidate. The Tribune also talked to a campaign finance expert, Paul S. Ryan with the government watchdog group Common Cause. He told the publication that unless the donations are improperly reported to the FEC, they don’t break any laws. So here’s what we know: Though in the video a campaign staffer talks about helping Honduran immigrants, describing them as members of the migrant caravan who recently arrived in El Paso, the caravan was still hundreds of miles away as of Nov. 5. The campaign says that staffers did use funds to help migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The Annunciation House, where the campaign said the goods were donated, has been assisting families released from federal detention centers following background checks and fingerprinting, according to the El Paso Times. Still, though the ""staffers are shown expressing awareness that what they are doing is improper, or at least could be perceived as improper,"" the Tribune reports, the campaign doesn’t appear to be breaking the law unless it fails to properly report its donations to the FEC. We rate this statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809749F680>],/factchecks/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/did-beto-orourke-really-use-campaign-funds-help-mi/
