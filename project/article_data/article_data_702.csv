Fact-checking how Texas ranks for children’s health in light of new abortion law
","A new Texas law restricting abortion, and the Supreme Court’s recent decision to let it take effect, have prompted widespread opposition in liberal social media circles. The Texas law outlaws abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many women may even know they’re pregnant, and makes no exceptions for rape or incest. Advocates of abortion rights had hoped the Supreme Court would prevent the the law from taking effect, saying it violated the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Opponents of abortion, meanwhile, hope that the justices’ initial decision not to block the Texas law could portend the overturning of Roe v. Wade in its entirety. One post by the liberal group Occupy Democrats accused Texas of providing little support for babies once they’re born. The post said, ""Let’s get this straight: (Texas is) a state that criminalizes abortion but ranks 50th in baby wellness checks, ranks 50th in clinical care for infants, ranks 50th in uninsured women, ranks 43rd in maternal mortality, ranks 44th in school funding per child, and ranks 46th in child hunger. … doesn’t give a damn about children.""  Does Texas rank that low among states on all six of these measurements?  We found that the post was correct on two of the measures, and close on another, but was wrong or unsupported by current data on the other three. After our inquiries, Occupy Democrats changed its post to reflect our analysis. Texas ranks significantly higher than 50th, though it’s still below average. Texas ranked 34th among the states in the percentage of children up to age 2 who had one or more preventive doctor visits during the previous 12 months, according to the National Survey of Children's Health, conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Maternal and Child Health Bureau in 2016 and 2017. Texas ranked better by this measurement than Alabama, Alaska, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Rafael Rivero, a co-founder of Occupy Democrats, told PolitiFact that he may have intended to cite adolescent wellness checks. By that measure, Texas ranks 48th, above only South Dakota and Alaska. We couldn’t find an exact metric for this, but Occupy Democrats cited a collection of rankings by the UnitedHealth Foundation, which included several metrics under the general heading ""clinical care-infants.""  One of those metrics is for prenatal care, not clinical care for infants, and looks at the percentage of live births in which the mother began prenatal care between the first and sixth month of pregnancy, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Texas was near the bottom, ranking 49th; only New Mexico was lower. While prenatal care is important for the health of mothers and newborns, the ranking doesn’t support the claim about clinical care for infants. In 2019, Texas ranked dead last in health insurance coverage for women between the ages of 19 and 64, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Medicare kicks in at 65, so women over that age are all covered.) All told, 23% of women in Texas are uninsured, about double the national rate. The most recent data we could find from the CDC, covering 2018, had Texas ranking 12th among the 25 states for which data was available. Texas’ rate was better than the rates in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee. Rivero pointed to a ranking that showed Texas at 43rd, but it was based on a USA Today analysis that used earlier data, from 2012 to 2016. Census Bureau data shows that Texas ranked 44th in per-pupil spending for K-12 public school systems in 2019.  The six states that spent less were Arizona, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, Oklahoma and Utah. In Texas, 13.1% of households had either ""low"" or ""very low"" food security, averaged for the years of 2017, 2018, and 2019. That was tied for 40th with North Carolina. The states that ranked below Texas were Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and West Virginia. As a postscript, Occupy Democrats changed its post to reflect our reporting. (PolitiFact’s policy is to rate the original statement but to include in our article any subsequent corrections or explanations by the speaker.) Here’s a screenshot of the revised post:  The original Occupy Democrats post said that Texas ""ranks 50th in baby wellness checks, ranks 50th in clinical care for infants, ranks 50th in uninsured women, ranks 43rd in maternal mortality, ranks 44th in school funding per child, and ranks 46th in child hunger."" The post was correct about the women’s health insurance rankings and school spending, and it was close for child hunger. However, the most recent data shows that Texas is closer to the middle than to the bottom for baby wellness checks and maternal mortality. And a claim about clinical care for infants was unsupported.

Chuck Schumer’s incorrect statement about Americans stranded in Afghanistan
","Critics of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pounced on a remark by the senator that suggested that every American who wanted to leave Afghanistan has already done so. Schumer made his comments on Sept. 3, during an interview with WSYR-TV, the ABC affiliate in Syracuse, N.Y. Schumer was discussing the rushed evacuations from Afghanistan after the U.S.-backed Afghan government and military fell to the Taliban.  ""There'll be a job for congressional oversight — there always is,"" Schumer said. ""But at the moment, actually, I'm still focused on trying to get some of those brave Afghans out. The Americans — all of whom have wanted to come out have come out, praise God. But there are a lot of Afghans who risked their lives for our soldiers and others. Many got out, some didn't. And I'm still working on trying to get some of them out. The comment by Schumer that prompted criticism was that all Americans in Afghanistan who ""have wanted to come out have come out."" Schumer was wrong. On Sept. 7, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that there are still ""somewhere around 100"" American citizens who want to leave Afghanistan. Blinken was speaking from a news conference in Doha, Qatar, and he said the U.S. was working on additional flights to evacuate people from Afghanistan. On Sept. 6, U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, said four U.S. citizens from his district ""were part of the first successful ground evacuation since the U.S. left Kabul.""  Meanwhile, the current count of Afghans who want to leave but haven’t been able to evacuate yet is uncertain. However, as of late August, there were an estimated 250,000, according to estimates by nonprofits cited by the New York Times. Schumer’s office acknowledged his mistake. ""He misspoke and he regrets the confusion his comments have caused,"" Schumer’s office said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""He intended to say, as he has been saying, that the U.S. will get everyone out that wants to get out. And he will keep working with the Biden administration to help everyone who wants to get out."" Schumer said that among Americans in Afghanistan, ""all"" who ""have wanted to come out have come out."" That’s incorrect; the State Department has acknowledged that there are still ""somewhere around 100"" American citizens who want to leave Afghanistan.  Schumer’s office later said that he had misspoken.

No, Bill Gates didn’t call for the ‘withdrawal of all COVID-19 vaccines’
","In 2020, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates emerged as a leading voice in the effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

""We made a terrible mistake,"" the blog post quotes Gates as saying in the purported speech. ""We wanted to protect people against a dangerous virus.

These vaccines — Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca — they’re killing people left and right — and they’re injuring some people very badly.""  This is false. There is no evidence that Gates said these things or called for COVID-19 vaccines to be withdrawn from the market. The claims can be traced back to a blog post from the site The Daily Expose.

No, the U.S. government isn’t telling farmers to destroy their crops
","A collection of videos circulating on social media claim the U.S. government is forcing farmers in the U.S. to destroy their crops. Several of the videos say the intent is to cause food shortages and mass starvation in the country. The videos were edited together into an eight-minute compilation and shared in an Aug. 24 Facebook post titled ""Farmers destroying crops world wide."" A majority of the videos appear to be taken from TikTok. ""In this video we will see farmers getting letters from the government to destroy their crops,"" a caption for the post reads. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The first video in the compilation features a man claiming his father works in the agriculture industry, and was told the federal government would offer farmers 1.5 times the value of the crops to have them destroyed. Farmers who refused the offer would have their federal subsidies withheld, he said. ""They are trying to create a food shortage,"" the man in the video says. ""We have eight months to get our own food supply. We're probably going to be facing mass starvation.""  The USDA said on its website there is ""no nationwide shortage of food,"" and no disruptions in the food supply chain. ""USDA and the Food and Drug Administration are closely monitoring the food supply chain for any shortages in collaboration with industry and our federal and state partners,"" the department said. ""We are in regular contact with food manufacturers and grocery stores."" Another video features a man claiming to have a letter from the USDA asking him to destroy his crops. He claims he also received information on how to dispose of the destroyed crops. The man said the information is ""on government paper,"" and the video briefly shows a piece of paper with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality logo, but no USDA letter.  The document from the Nebraska agency has nothing to do with crops — it’s about livestock manure and is dated January 2018.

The video then shows what appears to be a black substance being dumped onto the ground. While the video no longer appears on the man’s TikTok page, he posted a follow-up video admitting he was joking. The substance wasn't actually oil, but sediment and water that had settled at the bottom of an oil tank. There is no Department of Hydrocarbons.

Are women disproportionately impacted by voter ID laws?
","President Joe Biden has pointed a finger at states that have enacted new restrictions on voting, saying that some laws disproportionately hurt different groups of Americans, including women.  ""Women are also disproportionately impacted by voter ID laws — especially married women who change their names, or those whose IDs do not accurately reflect their gender,"" Biden said in an Aug. 26 proclamation on Women’s Equality Day.  A reader asked us to check out Biden’s claim. Biden’s point is rooted in the fact the majority of U.S. women change their names when they get married, unlike men. Some women change their name again after they get divorced. This means that women are much more likely than men to have name variations between their IDs and their voter registrations. How this plays out for women can vary depending on each state’s laws.  For example, in Texas, voters who have a substantially similar name on their registration and ID do not have to update their records and can sign an affidavit to vote. Indiana law, on the other hand, requires that the name on the ID be the same as the name in the individual's voter registration record. The majority of states have some type of voter IDrequirement, and the trend over recent years has been more strict procedures. ""Across all states there are some additional hurdles women have to jump over if they get married and change their name,"" said Tammy Patrick, an elections expert at the Democracy Fund. ""It’s just a question of how easy that transition is and how many hurdles."" For transgender women, the research we found estimates the number of adults who lack IDs that reflect their current name or gender — not how many were blocked from voting as a result.  Brennan Center found many women lack document with current legal name The White House pointed to a 2006 telephone survey of 987 voting-age citizens conducted for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, one of the top national advocates for expanding voting rights. The survey asked voters questions about their IDs, such as if their photo ID had their current name, as opposed to their maiden name. The Brennan Center found that 66% of voting-age women with ready access to any proof of citizenship had a document with their current legal name. (The survey didn’t ask women if they were prevented from voting as a result of lacking an ID with their current name.) The Brennan Center has not repeated that survey since 2006, but it did point to more recent examples of women who changed their names and were flagged at the polls as a result of voter ID rules.   A TV station reported in 2013 that a Texas district judge, Sandra Watts, had to sign an affidavit affirming her identity after a poll official noticed that she had one name shown as her middle name on her driver’s license and a different middle name on her voter registration card. One of the middle names was her maiden name.  ""What I have used for voter registration and identification for the last 52 years was not sufficient yesterday when I went to vote,"" Watts said.  Watts told PolitiFact: ""My legal name is Sandra Lee Watts; however, when I married in 1964, Texas automatically changed the name on my driver’s license using my maiden name as my middle name. Since 1964, my driver’s license reflects the name of Sandra Mathison Watts.  That name was not identical to my name on my voter registration and that presented a problem at the time I went to vote.""  Wendy Davis, a Texas state senator and candidate for governor in 2013, also had to sign an affidavit because her driver’s license included her maiden name while her registration record did not. Davis had authored the amendment to give voters the affidavit option if their names were substantially similar. But women were not the only ones who were directed to sign an affidavit. Greg Abbott, then the Texas attorney general and now governor, also signed an affidavit in 2013 when he voted, because his driver’s license showed that his name was Gregory Wayne Abbott while on voter rolls he was listed as Greg Abbott. What state laws say about name changes Some states have a more efficient process than others for name changes, said Amber McReynolds, founding CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute & Coalition. The process can be relatively smooth for automatic voter registration states — places where citizens can register to vote while getting their driver's license. In other states, voters need to take separate steps to update their voter registration.  Some voters may face a time crunch to update their records if they get married close to Election Day. ""Voters do not plan their weddings around elections,"" said McReynolds, former director of elections for the city of Denver. Women who change their last names generally update their names on a variety of documents, and not solely their voter registration. Name variations on documents can create problems for women when they apply for a driver’s license under the federal Real ID rules. Most voter registration systems now happen online or at state motor vehicle offices, said Matthew Weil, an expert on elections at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""If a woman changing her name goes through the steps to change her last name — going to SSA, going to the DMV, etc. — I doubt that there are many who are registering to vote with a new last name before that happens,"" Weil said. Report shows many transgender individuals lack an ID that matches their gender The second part of Biden’s statement pertained to voters whose IDs do not match their gender. The White House pointed to an article by the Brennan Center that cited data from the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA School of Law. The institute published a report in February 2020 about the potential for transgender citizens to encouter obstacles to voting due to identification documents that do not match their gender.  The report estimated that 965,350 transgender adults would be eligible to vote in the 2020 general election and that about 42% of those in the states that do not vote entirely by mail  — 378,450 — had no identification documents that reflected their correct name or gender.  The report draws on the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, as well as Census data and information on voter ID laws from the National Conference of State Legislatures. The 2015 survey showed that some transgender people reported having difficulty at the polls, but Herman was not aware of any entity that had data on how many were barred from voting. Some states have taken steps to make the process easier for transgender residents to update their documents, according to the Brennan Center. For example, Maine makes it free for nonbinary individuals to change the gender designation on their IDs.  A reader who asked us to fact-check Biden’s statement pointed to research showing that women report voting at higher rates than men and support voter ID. We found those points aren’t mutually exclusive: For decades, women have reported higher voting rates than men, and women (as well as men) tell pollsters they support voter ID.  In 2020 a higher share of women (68.4%) than men (65%) turned out to vote, according to a survey by the Census Bureau. The Pew Research Center and Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics have documented that in recent decades women have reported voting at higher rates than men. Researchers cite various factors in the gender gap in turnout, such as that women ""are more likely to rely on government services and are often more directly affected by highly debated issues like reproductive rights, child care/family leave, among others,"" said Kelly Dittmar, a Rutgers political scientist. Experts on election laws, including Wendy Weiser at the Brennan Center, said both things are true: Voter ID affects women more than men, and women have higher turnout rates at the ballot box. ""Overall turnout does not negate facts about disproportionate burdens,"" Weiser said. ""It is entirely possible (and in this case, likely) that women are more likely to vote overall, and that the gender turnout differential would have been even greater if there weren’t burdens that disproportionately affected women."" Biden said, ""Women are also disproportionately impacted by voter ID laws — especially married women who change their names, or those whose IDs do not accurately reflect their gender."" The White House pointed to a 2006 survey that found 66% of voting-eligible women have a document with their current legal name. But the survey didn’t ask women if they were prevented from voting as a result of lacking an ID with their current name.  The Williams Institute at UCLA found that about 42% of transgender adults eligible to vote in 2020 in states that don't vote entirely by mail had no ID documents that reflect their correct name or gender. But the report did not contain a count of trans adults who were not able to cast a ballot due to voter ID. Women are significantly more likely to change their name than men, so they are more likely to end up with name variations between their voter registration and their IDs. And women are more likely than men to go through a process to update their documents with their new name, but the process can vary by state. We rate the claim Mostly True.

Virginia is 6th in getting unemployment checks out fast, but last in resolving benefit disputes
","Gov. Ralph Northam has had a consistent reply to criticism that the Virginia Employment Commission has responded poorly to the huge surge of unemployment claims during the coronavirus crisis. ""While the Virginia Employment Commission is sixth in the nation for getting benefits to eligible people quickly, there have been times in the pandemic when VEC’s pace of resolving those difficult claims just hasn’t been acceptable,"" Northam said in an Aug. 18 speech to the General Assembly’s money committees. Sixth in the nation? Let’s take a look. We asked Northam for the source of the ranking and were pointed to data from the U.S. Department of Labor that, in a variety of ways, ranks states’ performances in distributing unemployment benefits. Northam cites Virginia’s performance in sending first unemployment checks to individuals within three weeks of their applications. When you measure from April 2020 through June 2021, 83% of Virginia applicants got their first checks within 21 days. That ranks sixth. The national average was 64%. Much of the high ranking comes from Virginia’s strong performance during the first fiscal quarter of Northam’s time frame. Virginia got 89% of the checks out on time from April through June 2020 - fourth best among states.  The VEC faced peak demand during that quarter, receiving between 30,000 and 150,000 new unemployment claims each week.  Virginia’s performance in getting checks out on time has declined in all but one fiscal quarter since, even though the number of new claims has been much lower. In April through June 2021, the latest quarter for which statistics are fully compiled, the VEC paid 57% of its new claims on time, ranking 38th. The state received less than 8,500 new claims a week for most of that period. Widespread criticism of VEC focuses on another performance measure: Virginia is last in the nation in resolving cases when there is doubt about whether an applicant is eligible for unemployment pay. As a result, many Virginians in financial duress have waited long periods to get benefits they’re entitled to. According to Labor Department data, Virginia resolved only 5% of such cases within three weeks from April 2020 through June 2021. The national average was 48%. Virginia ranked last in four of the five fiscal quarters during the span, and 49th in the other. The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission reported in July that the VEC responds to ""only to a small portion"" of phone calls and is hampered by outdated computers and employee turnover. The VEC, seeking to resolve a class lawsuit, says it has cut its number of disputed unemployment claims from 92,128 in May to 860 in August - a 98% drop. The agency says it has hired 300 people since spring to handle public inquiries. At Northam’s request, the General Assembly in August appropriated $73.6 million to improve technology and call center capacity at the agency, and help it retain its staff. These important problems, however, are not the focus of our fact check. Northam said the embattled VEC ""is sixth in the nation for getting benefits to eligible people quickly…"" while acknowledging significant failures at times. U.S. Labor Department data show from April 2020 through June 2021, 83% of Virginia applicants got their first checks within 21 days. That ranks sixth and includes a crucial period in spring 2020 when unemployment claims skyrocketed because of the coronavirus crisis. Breaking up the statistics, however, shows Virginia’s performance has declined as the number of unemployment claims dropped. In April through June 2021 - the latest financial quarter for which complete statistics are available - 57% of Virginians received their first checks within three weeks. That ranked 38th in the nation. So, there’s a little bit of cherry picking in Northam’s statement that Virginia is ranked sixth, and we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/sep/07/ralph-northam/virginia-6th-getting-unemployment-checks-out-fast-/

Ted Cruz blames migrants, not mask policies, for Texas' coronavirus problem
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, recently said on Fox News that, over a six-month span, the Biden administration has released more than 7,000 COVID-19 positive migrants in a single Texas border community.  Cruz joined Fox News hosts during an Aug. 4 episode of America Reports, where he was asked to respond to data released by the White House showing that Texas and Florida — two states where Republicans have rejected public health measures like mask mandates — accounted for one-third of all new COVID-19 cases nationwide during the last week of July.  President Joe Biden suggested ""that the lack of mask mandates is going to help the spread, saying that (Republican governors) need to lead or get out of the way,"" Fox News co-host John Roberts told Cruz. ""With the cases spiking, senator, does he have a point?""  Instead, Cruz focused on migrants who tested positive for the coronavirus. ""In the last several months, the Biden administration has released over 7,000 illegal aliens who were COVID positive just in one Texas city — in the city of McAllen in the Rio Grande Valley,"" Cruz said. ""Last week, the Biden administration released over 1,500 illegal aliens in McAllen who were COVID positive.""  ""Joe Biden likes to talk about this pandemic. Well I’ll tell you what, the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris was a superspreader event because their open border is endangering not just the people of Texas, but people all across the country,"" Cruz said.  Clips of the Cruz interview have been widely shared in viral Facebook and TikTok posts since it aired. But is it true that the Biden administration has released more than 7,000 COVID-19 positive migrants in McAllen in the past several months? And are these infected migrants released in McAllen and elsewhere driving the surge of COVID-19 cases in Texas and the U.S., as Cruz suggested?  The 7,000 figure stems from a news bulletin released by the city of McAllen the same day as Cruz’s Fox News appearance. The bulletin announced local officials’ plans to erect a temporary emergency shelter in response to a ""rapidly escalating surge of immigrants at the Texas-Mexico border.""  Housing and processing of migrants released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in McAllen has been managed by the Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, a non-profit. Under Catholic Charities’ protocols, migrants are tested for COVID-19 after they are released by Customs and Border Protection.   Migrants who test negative for the virus are admitted to the non-profit's Humanitarian Respite Center, where they can connect with relatives or sponsors living in the U.S. The temporary tent shelters erected by local county and city officials are designed to increase the Respite Center’s capacity to help keep immigrants ""off the streets,"" the city said.  Migrants who test positive for the virus are taken ""to quarantine sites in the Rio Grande Valley area"" for 10 days, the city said. ""Once an immigrant has completed quarantine, they proceed on their final northbound travel out of McAllen.""  However, any migrant quarantining under Catholic Charities can choose to leave if a relative picks them up. Executive Director of Catholic Charities Sister Norma Pimentel recently told the Los Angeles Times that the non-profit has ""no right to keep them if they want to leave. We encourage them to stay.""  Between mid-February and early August, Catholic Charities has processed 87,000 immigrants released by Customs and Border Protection. More than 7,000 of them tested positive for COVID-19, McAllen officials said — a positivity rate of about 8%. By comparison, the city of Brownsville, which also tests migrants after they are dropped off by Customs and Border Protection, reported a positivity rate of about 9.3% between January and August. And Texas’ statewide positivity rate over the course of the pandemic is around 12%, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.  But these positivity rates over long time periods don’t reflect the present surge of cases fueled by the delta variant, which became the cause of more than 80% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. beginning in July, according to federal estimates.   Neither the city of McAllen nor Catholic Charities responded to requests for data showing recent positivity rates. However, Dr. Ivan Melendez, the health authority in Hidalgo County, where McAllen is located, estimates that the current positivity rate of migrants released by Customs and Border Protection is around 15%. And only about 3% of the county’s hospital bed capacity is taken up by migrants.   By comparison, Texas’ has recorded a statewide positivity rate of about 18% over the last month, which has strained hospital capacity statewide.   ""If the migrants were not here, we certainly would still have a pandemic. Our numbers would almost be exactly the same,"" Melendez said. ""That being said, you can't bring in (thousands of) positive cases into a community and not expect for it to have some impact.""  When asked during his Fox News interview if laws banning mask mandates could be blamed for COVID-19 surges in Texas and Florida, Cruz responded by shifting blame on COVID-19 positive migrants released by Customs and Border Protection, using the 7,000 McAllen cases as an example.   Blaming the present surge on immigrants and the Biden administration’s immigration policies has become a popular talking point for many Republicans, although there’s little evidence to back that up.   On the same day of Cruz’s Fox News interview, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis claimed that Biden ""imported more virus from around the world by having a wide open southern border."" PolitiFact rated that claim False, finding that case data provides poor support for the notion that the virus is being spread primarily by migrants.  Gov. Greg Abbott used similar language during a Fox News interview in July, when he accused the Biden administration of ""importing COVID into Texas as well as the United States.""  But the distribution of COVID-19 cases throughout the U.S. doesn’t correspond to migration patterns. Even if migrants eventually disperse to other locations once released by Customs and Border Protection, they would have an impact on coronavirus rates locally first, experts told PolitiFact last month. But national case distribution data doesn’t show that.   In Texas, state data shows that the seven-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is around 22,700 as of Aug. 31, or about 78 cases per 100,000 people. By comparison, Hidalgo County's seven-day average of new daily cases is less than half that. The same is generally true for the rest of the Texas border region. Of the 32 counties that comprise the Texas Department of State Health Services Border Area, only eight have a seven-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases above the state’s average, according to John Hopkins data.  Rather, COVID-19 distribution data provides more evidence to pin the present surge on areas with low vaccination rates. A New York Times analysis in July, for instance, found COVID-19 case rates in counties with vaccination rates below 30% were double that of counties with vaccination rates above 60%.  And data published by the Mayo Clinic shows that states with vaccination rates below 40% have recorded some of the largest increases in coronavirus hospitalizations in recent months. None of those states are along the U.S.-Mexico border. ""Are (the migrants) the cause of the pandemic? No. Are they part of the pandemic? Yes,"" Melendez said. ""Are they having a higher positivity rate than the rest of the community here? No."" When asked about Cruz’s characterization of migrants’ role in the present surge, spokesperson Steve Guest focused on the number released by the city of McAllen.  ""This is yet another bogus so-called fact check designed to obfuscate the crisis on the border that has resulted from Biden’s disastrous political decisions,"" Guest said. ""Sen. Cruz is correct about Biden’s super spreader event: over 7,000 COVID-positive illegal aliens have been released since February in McAllen.""  In responding to a question about the correlation between states with policies prohibiting mask mandates and recent coronavirus surges, Cruz said that migrants who tested positive for the coronavirus should instead be blamed for an increase in cases, and he used numbers recently released by McAllen city officials as an example.   ""In the last several months, the Biden administration has released over 7,000 illegal aliens who were COVID positive just in one Texas city — in the city of McAllen in the Rio Grande Valley,"" Cruz said.  The Catholic Charities non-profit in McAllen has recorded over 7,000 positive cases among migrants released by Customs and Border Protection since February. That’s a positivity rate of about 8%. However, most migrants who test positive are released to non-profits that place them in quarantine before they move throughout the U.S.  Cruz’s overall point — that migrants are fueling the current COVID surge — is not supported by data. The 8% positivity rate of migrants released in McAllen is less than the state’s average. And data shows that the distribution of COVID cases throughout the U.S. corresponds more to low vaccination rates than migration patterns.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/sep/03/ted-cruz/7000-covid-positive-migrants-quarantined-mcallen-a/

Yes, “millions of Americans” could lose their housing in the middle of a pandemic
","The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the economy, and that has been felt especially in the housing sector. To prevent widespread evictions that would likely mean more people being unhoused or homeless, the federal government implemented a moratorium on evictions.  But that safety net is unraveling as the U.S. Supreme Court on August 26, 2021, on a 6-3 vote, ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  At least four states, Illinois, California, New Jersey, New Mexico as well as  Washington, D.C., will continue to ban evictions, at least temporarily. In at least five states, renters who’ve put in an application for rent assistance but haven’t received the funding yet are entitled to some protection from eviction. Those are Washington state, Oregon, Minnesota, New York and Nevada. The White House called on more states to take action to prevent evictions. ""Horrifying to think that millions of Americans have to worry about losing their housing in the middle of a pandemic."" U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., tweeted on August 27, 2021. Is Pocan right that ""millions of Americans"" could lose their housing in the middle of a pandemic? Let’s take a look. When asked to support the claim, Pocan’s office referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Week 35 Household Pulse Survey: August 4 – August 16. The HPS, according to the Census Bureau, is designed to provide near real-time data on how the pandemic has affected people’s lives.  Under the category of ""Likelihood of leaving this home due to eviction in next two months,"" 1,292,008 responded Very Likely and 2,219,048 responded Somewhat likely. That is a total of  3,511,056 facing the ""likelihood"" of eviction in the next two months. The New York Times in an August 27, 2021 article ""Supreme Court’s Decision Opens Door to Millions of Evictions"" reported that ""Millions of Americans around the country face the prospect of losing their homes after the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Biden administration’s latest federal moratorium on evictions."" The article pointed out that the Biden administration is working to speed up the distribution of billions of dollars in federal aid to people who are behind in rent because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.  In an August 3, 2021 report, PolitiFact National discussed ""What’s happening with the federal eviction moratorium and rental assistance?""  The PolitiFact article, citing Census Bureau reports, noted that about 3.6 million people face eviction within two months, and about 6 million households are behind on their rent; estimates of the back rent owed are in the tens of billions of dollars.   The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a July 8, 2021, article noted, ""A surge in evictions is almost certain to happen when the moratorium ends. But the truth is they've been happening all along.’ The special report said that evictions in Milwaukee County were continuing despite the moratorium. ""In reality, the eviction ban is far from absolute and only covers tenants who meet its criteria, which includes a substantial loss of income or extraordinary out-of-pocket medical expenses,"" according to the Journal Sentinel report. Attorney Carmen Ayers, Legal Action of Wisconsin’s housing law priority coordinator, said the agency is seeing many clients ""facing the pain and trauma of losing their home, and often many of their belongings, to eviction."" ""Millions of Americans are at risk of eviction,"" Ayers said in an email. ""In Wisconsin alone, about 23,000 tenants are likely to face eviction in the next two months, according to Census surveys. Being homeless during a pandemic is horrifying — people are risking their health and lives when they double up with friends or family or seek refuge in crowded homeless shelters, and it exacerbates the risk to public health overall."" Ayers went on to note that evictions and facing homelessness ""has always been traumatic and consequential."" ""It pushes families further into poverty and harms communities. But to force families from their homes — many who are immunocompromised, elderly, or families with children too young to be vaccinated — as the pandemic rages on is simply inhumane,"" Ayers said. Pocan said the end of the eviction moratorium means ""millions of Americans"" could lose their housing in the middle of a pandemic."" The U.S. Census Bureau’s weekly Household Pulse Survey found that 3,511,056 respondents are facing the ""likelihood"" of eviction in the next two months. Several media reports also noted that the threat of homelessness could impact millions as the U.S. Supreme Court ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium. However, there are a few states that have implemented eviction moratoriums at the state level. Wisconsin is not one of those  states. For a statement that is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing, our rating is True.

What’s the average cost of a COVID-19 hospital stay?
","To encourage people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., posted a comparison between the cost of a hospital stay and the vaccine. ""The average hospital stay for a case of COVID-19 costs about $17,064. The vaccine is free,"" said Jayapal in her Aug. 30 Instagram post. A post shared by Pramila Jayapal (@repjayapal) It’s true that all three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. are free to recipients. We wanted to know if Jayapal was correct about the average cost for a hospital stay for COVID-19 patients. Health policy and industry experts said the $17,064 figure sounds about right, based on available data. But they also noted that figuring out an ""average"" cost for a hospital stay is tricky due to varying factors among patients. The cost of COVID-19 care can vary widely depending on someone’s age, location, length of stay at the hospital, the hospital where they receive care, severity of illness and comorbidities. Whether someone has no insurance, commercial health insurance, Medicaid or Medicare also plays a role. ""Pinning down an average is hard because for everyone who ended up on a ventilator for weeks, costing millions, there are also people who are in and out of (the) hospital in a day or two once they stabilize,"" said Niall Brennan, president and CEO of the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that compiles claims data and offers research on health care costs and utilization. As backup for Jayapal’s claim, her office sent us an Aug. 26 report from ABC Action News in Tampa. The report said, ""No set amount has been found to be a solid average cost. But the numbers hover between $15-25,000 or more."" The news station cited FAIR Health, a nonprofit focused on health costs and health insurance transparency, as a source. FAIR Health analyzed national data from January to May 2020, near the start and first peak of the pandemic, to assess the costs of hospitalization for a COVID-19 patient. FAIR Health highlighted the median — the middle point — for two different measures of cost: the charge amount, which is the amount charged to a patient who is uninsured or obtaining an out-of-network service; and the allowed amount, which is the total fee negotiated between an insurance plan and a provider for an in-network service. The allowed amount includes both the insurer’s and the member’s share of the total fee. The median charge amount for a COVID-19 hospitalization ranged from $34,662 for patients ages 23 to 30, to $45,683 for people ages 51 to 60, according to FAIR Health. The median estimated allowed amounts ranged from $17,094 for people over 70 to $24,012 for people ages 51 to 60. Jayapal used the lowest number as an example of the cost of a hospitalization due to COVID-19, her spokesperson said. The FAIR Health estimates for the median hospitalization cost are in line with what we found from other sources. An Aug. 20 brief about unvaccinated COVID-19 hospitalizations from the Peterson Center on Healthcare and Kaiser Family Foundation said various sources suggest an average hospitalization cost of around $20,000. The brief pointed to estimates from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which said that the average Medicare fee-for-service COVID-19 hospitalization cost was $24,033. (CMS said its data was preliminary.) The Peterson-KFF report said that another study of Medicare fee-for-service enrollees pegged the average cost at $21,752. According to that study, the mean cost was higher if the patient died in the hospital ($32,015) and was highest if the patient needed ventilator support ($49,441). Researchers also said there were racial and ethnic disparities in costs related to COVID-19. ""Racial and ethnic minority patients incurred higher medical costs than non-Hispanic white patients, and non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients accounted for disproportionately high numbers of hospitalizations requiring ventilator support and inpatient deaths,"" the study said. The American Hospital Association referred us to the Peterson-KFF August brief. ""It’s important to note that these reflect averages, and that there is significant variation — for example, some hospitalizations were as much as $80,000 for patients who had prolonged (intensive care unit) stays,"" said Thomas Jordan, a spokesperson for the trade group. Exactly how much a person will end up paying out-of-pocket for a hospitalization also depends on multiple factors. For those with health insurance, that can depend on the type of plan they have. Early in the pandemic, commercial insurers waived cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment, so those individuals might not pay any of the cost, said Ellen Meara, a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. However, people with high deductibles in their private insurance plan, and Medicare-insured individuals can face high out-of-pocket costs — often in the thousands of dollars — due to cost sharing, she said. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said that unvaccinated employees enrolled in Delta’s account-based healthcare plan will be subject to a $200 monthly surcharge beginning Nov. 1,  ""to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company."" He said that the average employee’s hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost Delta $50,000 per person. Jayapal said, ""The average hospital stay for a case of COVID-19 costs about $17,064. The vaccine is free."" It’s difficult to determine an average cost for a hospital stay for COVID-19. Many individual factors can cause estimates to swing widely. But Jayapal’s figure is in line with several credible estimates, and to her bigger point, the vaccine is much cheaper.

House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy wrong on telecom law violations in Jan. 6 records request
","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., warned telecommunication and internet companies not to hand over certain information sought by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. ""If these companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they are in violation of federal law and subject to losing their ability to operate in the United States,"" McCarthy wrote on Twitter Aug. 31. ""If companies still choose to violate a federal law, a Republican majority will not forget and will stand with Americans to hold them fully accountable under the law."" The committee — which includes seven Democrats and two Republicans — has asked over 30 companies, including Google, AT&T and Verizon, to retain records for a list of individuals believed to be relevant to the assault investigation. There’s no indication that McCarthy’s name is on the list. That’s the first step toward issuing subpoenas that could include the communications of sitting lawmakers. Republican leaders have railed against the committee since it was created, but our focus here is on McCarthy’s assertion that the companies would break a federal law if they complied with a committee subpoena. PolitiFact and many other news organizations have asked McCarthy’s office multiple times to name the law he has in mind. So far, there has been no response. Legal experts say they don’t know of any law that would do what McCarthy says. The head of the House Republican Study Committee, the policy arm of House GOP leadership, laid out part of the GOP’s legal argument in a letter to the committee. We asked legal experts to assess the key points in that letter as well. Study Committee chair Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., said that the Supreme Court has spelled out the limits of the congressional subpoena power. Banks cited the ruling in the case of Trump v. Mazars, when former President Donald Trump fought the release of his tax records by his accounting firm.  ""A congressional subpoena is valid only if it is ‘related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of Congress and must serve a valid legislative purpose,’"" Banks wrote Aug. 27. Banks said the committee is entitled only to information needed to pass laws and conduct oversight. He made other points, but the requirement for a legislative purpose was central to his case. The resolution creating the select committee gave it a broad investigative scope, and the option to suggest new laws. Under the resolution — which passed 220-190 on a party-line vote — the committee was told to look at how campaigns and online platforms, along with other entities, might have motivated the attackers. The resolution named several groups to put under the microscope, but in case it left any out, it expanded the committee’s reach to ""other entities of the public and private sector as determined relevant by the Select Committee."" That last clause could sweep in members of Congress. As for a legislative purpose, the resolution said the committee could offer ""legislative recommendations as it may deem advisable."" So the committee’s mandate under the resolution appears to address some of Banks’ arguments about the limits of congressional subpoena authority.  But McCarthy’s argument is not about that. It’s about the legal risk companies would face if they agree to turn over records under subpoena. And according to experts we spoke with, his argument is wrong. The law professors and a telecommunications lawyer we reached said someone could certainly challenge a committee subpoena in court, but there’s no guarantee they would win. ""I suspect a court would give Congress great leeway in deciding what information the body needs for its investigation into the Capitol riot,"" said University of Iowa law professor Andy Grewal. ""But it’s certainly possible that the congressional subpoena could be narrowed"" by the court. As for the legal hazard faced by the telecommunication and social media companies, the experts drew a blank. ""I don’t see there being a penalty for compliance, even if the subpoena is later deemed unlawful,"" said Ellen Goodman at Rutgers University Law School. David Alan Sklansky at Stanford Law School echoed that, saying, ""I don't know what McCarthy is talking about."" There are, however, two sets of legal standards under privacy law for getting access to telecommunications records. A request for ""metadata"" — information about who sent a message or placed a call, and from where and when — is subject to less scrutiny than  a request for ""content,"" the emails and text messages themselves.  ""Federal law does protect the privacy of non-content phone records in the hands of the carrier, but if the disclosure is ‘required by law’ there is no legal prohibition"" against releasing it, said Albert Gidari, a retired lawyer who represented telecommunication companies on these legal matters for over two decades.  Gidari said the process is more demanding for the content. A court-issued warrant or the individual’s consent would be necessary for a company to be authorized to release the messages. But federal law, Gidari said, expressly protects the companies ""for complying with a subpoena or warrant compelling disclosure."" ""I am not aware of any law under which a company would forfeit its ‘ability to operate in the United States’ for complying with a subpoena to turn over private information,"" he added. We reached out to several companies that the committee contacted. Most did not respond, but Google and Reddit said they are working with the committee. Facebook told other news organizations the same. The companies can’t simply ignore a congressional subpoena. They could face a misdemeanor charge if they did. But they can seek to quash a subpoena and leave it to a court to decide. McCarthy said that telecommunications companies would violate federal law and risk ""losing their ability to operate in the United States"" if they handed over records sought by the Jan. 6 investigation committee. McCarthy’s office has been silent on what law the companies would be breaking. Law professors and a telecommunications lawyer who handled such matters said that there is no such law barring companies from turning over information sought through a proper subpoena or warrant, and that companies can’t be penalized for complying with a subpoena.

Trump’s baseless conspiracy about protester shoved by police in Buffalo
","President Donald Trump tweeted a baseless conspiracy theory about the 75-year-old protester shoved to the ground by police in Buffalo, N.Y., accusing the man whose injury was captured on video of being a member of antifa, trying to disrupt police communications and faking his fall. ""Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur,"" Trump said in the June 9 tweet, which he posted with no supporting evidence. ""75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment.""  Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up? The president referenced a TV segment from One America News Network, a cable network that has ""repeatedly published false or misleading information,"" according to NewGuard, a company that monitors news outlets.  ""I watched,"" Trump wrote. ""He fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?"" The OANN segment cited a conservative blog post. It claimed Gugino was ""using his phone as a capture scanner"" to ""monitor the location of police"" before he was pushed to the ground.  Here's the absolutely insane OAN report that Trump is referencing: ""The latest tensions in the Buffalo police department could be the result of a false flag provocation by far left group antifa"" pic.twitter.com/d709XfSj8U Sage Green, who knows Gugino through activism work in Buffalo, said she never knew him to be related to any antifa-type work, nor to be savvy with technology.  ""I’ve never known him to be someone who has any radical tactics,"" Green said. ""He’s not the troublemaker in the crowd.""  There’s no evidence that Gugino was trying to ""scan police communications"" before he was shoved — or that Gugino’s fall, which left him bleeding from his ear and resulted in second-degree assault charges against two officers, was part of ""a set up."" ""Not a piece of proof,"" said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a press conference. Kelly V. Zarcone, Gugino’s attorney, said in a statement that Gugino has ""always been a peaceful protester."" ""No one from law enforcement has even suggested anything otherwise, so we are at a loss to understand why the president of the United States would make such dark, dangerous, and untrue accusations against him,"" she said. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. A roughly 40-second video of the incident — which Buffalo police initially described as a ""skirmish involving protesters"" in which Gugino ""tripped and fell"" — was captured by WBFO’s Mike Desmond on June 4. The video is graphic, but can be viewed here. The video shows Gugino approaching a line of police officers with a phone in his right hand and what looks like a helmet in his left. Gugino stands face-to-face with a pair of officers and talks for a few seconds as a third officer shouts for Gugino to move.  One officer shoves Gugino with a baton while another pushes him with his hand. The force sends Gugino stumbling backward and hitting the ground hard. ""He’s bleeding out of his ear,"" a person says repeatedly as Gugino lays motionless and blood pools on the pavement beneath him. Zarcone, Gugino’s attorney, said Gugino remains hospitalized. The incident is under both internal affairs and criminal investigations, and the two officers facing charges have been suspended without pay. More than 50 members of the Buffalo police riot response team have since resigned from the unit but are still working for the department.  The Buffalo Police Department and a spokesperson for the Erie County district attorney’s office both told us they could not comment on the case pending investigations. Gugino has worked on causes around Buffalo through PUSH Buffalo, the Western New York Peace Center and other organizations. The Buffalo News reported that he is also involved in Catholic peace activism and nuclear disarmament.  Three activists who have worked with Gugino described him as willing to be involved in a range of social justice causes but said he was not an agitator.  ""From what I know of Martin, he has never spoken to me with being affiliated with antifa-type work,"" Green said.   In a statement to PolitiFact, OANN’s Pearson Sharp said the network is working on another report detailing Gugino’s background as an activist. ""We have found substantial evidence that suggests Martin Gugino is, if not a professional provocateur, at least an enthusiastic one,"" Sharp told PolitiFact, citing past tweets, arrest records, and comments he said others made about Gugino. The blog post cited by OANN includes a since-deleted tweet from Gugino saying, ""F--- the police."" The Buffalo News reported that the Twitter account belonged to Gugino. Another tweet featured an anti-police hashtag. The blog post also linked to Gugino’s personal blog, where he says he’s been arrested — but not convicted — for participating in prior protests. OANN’s Sharp said Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown called Gugino an ""agitator"" and a ""key and major instigator,"" adding that Brown wouldn’t ""single someone out like that without good reason."" But in those comments, Brown was talking about a different protester.  Trump’s claims that the incident was a ""set up"" and that Gugino was waving his phone in an attempt to scan police communications are similarly unsubstantiated, with the only proof being that Gugino was holding a phone at the moment that he was pushed. There are several mobile apps that let users listen to police scanners, and as the Washington Post noted, the Buffalo police radio frequencies are publicly available online. These apps don’t give users the ability to ""black out the equipment,"" according to BBC News. Green, Gugino’s friend, said she didn’t think Gugino had any capability to interfere with police communications.  The OANN segment said ""newly released videos appear to show Gugino using a police tracker on his phone, trying to scan police communications."" But the segment showed only an edited version of the original video that was slowed down. The OANN segment — and the blog post it pulled from — also highlighted a photo of Gugino standing beside WBFO’s Desmond, as well as a separate Twitter video that shows an unidentified protester saying, ""He’s looking to get punched in the face."" But that doesn’t substantiate Trump’s claims about a ""set up"" and a ""scanner,"" either.  Trump said, ""Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment ... Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?"" This is an unsubstantiated conspiracy that made its way from a conservative blog site to Trump via One America News Network.

No evidence Buffalo protester’s injuries were staged
","Two police officers in Buffalo, N.Y., have pleaded not guilty to assault charges in connection with an elderly protester who was critically injured after a video showed them shoving him.  Facebook posts have cast doubt on the altercation. One shows an image of the man, 75-year-old Martin Gugino, with his head on the ground. An arrow pointing to his ear says, ""‘Blood’ coming from the front of ear."" An arrow pointing to his mask says, ""Tube running from under mask."" An arrow pointing to the back of his head says, ""No blood on sidewalk or back of head."" Another Facebook post shows four stills from the video, the same image featured in the other Facebook post, and a photo with tubing, batteries and a fluids bag.  ""The incident in Buffalo is fake!!!"" this post says. ""This guy has been arrested many times before. He was antagonizing the cops. The cop pushed him away from him and the guy purposely fell! Look at this fake blood he hooked himself up with!! My friend in Buffalo said the hotels in Buffalo are filled with Antifa and they plan a big attack in Buffalo and Cheektowaga. ! Pray!"" These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  They’re also baseless. We found no indication this incident is ""fake."" In a statement published by Reuters, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said that the officers ""pushed"" Gugino outside of City Hall, ""causing him to fall and hit his head on the sidewalk."" Flynn also said that Gugino was in critical condition at the Erie County Medical Center, where he was treated for a head injury, loss of consciousness and bleeding from the right ear. You can watch the video of the incident here. It was taken by a reporter for WBFO, a local radio station. In the footage, Gugino is seen approaching a line of officers with a phone in his right hand and a helmet in his left. As he stands face-to-face with two officers, he looks like he’s talking to them for a few seconds as a third officer tells him to move. One of the officers then shoves Gugino with a baton and the other pushes him with his hand. Gugino stumbles backward and falls on his back. Blood starts seeping out of his ear and the phone falls from his hand as he lies motionless on the ground.  ""He’s bleeding out of his ear,"" someone says repeatedly. Though the image in the Facebook posts claims no blood spreads to the sidewalk or the back of his head, around the 14-second mark it’s visibly pooling there. This Reuters photo shows a different angle of the blood pooling at his head. While the video rolls, we see officers walking past Gugino as he lies on the pavement. The incident is under both internal affairs and criminal investigations, and the two officers facing charges have been suspended without pay. More than 50 members of their unit have since resigned from that team but are still working for the department.  We reached out to the Buffalo Police Department about the claims in the posts. Capt. Jeff Rinaldo said he couldn’t comment under a state law that lets police departments shield disciplinary records. He referred us to the Erie County district attorney’s office, which is investigating the incident. A spokesperson for the Erie County district attorney’s office said they couldn’t comment because it’s ""under investigation for prosecution.""  A spokesperson for the City of Buffalo did not immediately respond to our voicemails. Police initially said that Gugino tripped and fell. John Evans, president of the Buffalo police union, told the Buffalo News that the officers were following orders to clear Niagara Square of people protesting the May death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck. ""It doesn’t specify clear the square of men, 50 and under or 15 to 40,"" Evans said. ""They were simply doing their job. I don’t know how much contact was made. He did slip, in my estimation. He fell backwards."" Prosecutors disagree. The district attorney has stated clearly that his office believes officers pushed Gugino and caused him to fall and hit his head. Kelly Zarcone, Gugino’s lawyer, told PolitiFact that he’s now out of the intensive care unit but still hospitalized.  On June 9, President Donald Trump amplified the conspiracy theory about Gugino when he tweeted: ""Buffalo protester shoved by police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than he was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?"" The Trump campaign didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s requests for comment. But there’s no evidence Trump’s claims — or the allegations in the Facebook posts — are true.  ""Martin has always been a PEACEFUL protester because he cares about today’s society,"" Zarcone said. ""No one from law enforcement has even suggested anything otherwise so we are at a loss to understand why the president of the United States would make such a dark, dangerous and untrue accusations against him.""

Trump’s Ellis Island award in the 1980s was not for brotherhood or diversity
","President Donald Trump won an award in the 1980s called the Ellis Island Medal of Honor that has provided fodder for online claims, in part because it resulted in a photo of him standing next to famous American icons Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali.

Trump was chosen for professional contributions that benefited New York City as a developer, as well as for his German heritage. In the first year, ""people were honored with the award for what they stood for more than what they did,"" Coca had said. Parks, for example, was honored for standing up to adversity. Trump’s recognition came from ""doing well for the city of New York"" through his business endeavors. The medal has changed over the years, and now recipients are chosen for philanthropic efforts as well as other contributions.  The image of Parks, Trump and Ali was taken during a ceremony honoring the recipients and also features Joe DiMaggio, Victor Borge and Anita Bryant, who are cropped out in the version that appears in this Facebook post.

Trump saying “I can’t breathe” in video isn’t referring to George Floyd
","Videos being posted in June 2020 on Facebook show President Donald Trump sarcastically saying ""I can’t breathe,"" but he wasn’t mocking George Floyd — he was poking fun of political rivals in the past. The videos we saw omitted the date of Trump speaking and the context of his remarks, which could leave viewers with the false impression that Trump was ridiculing Floyd’s dying words.

These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Trump’s comments are from his Feb. 20th campaign rally in Colorado Springs, Colo., the night after a Democratic primary debate where candidate Mike Bloomberg got battered by his opponents. ""Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked!..."" Trump said while grabbing his own neck and pretending to gag. ""’I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe! Don’t ask me the question please!"" At the same rally, Trump also mocked then candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. ""How about Klobuchar. Did you see her? She choked. She choked,"" he said. ""She couldn't breathe.""  Trump has used the phrase before and accused political rivals of choking, including while mocking Mitt Romney on April 12, 2016, in a speech in Rome, N.Y.  ""The RNC hasn't won an important election in a long time. We've had (Barack) Obama far too long. The last election should have been won, except Romney choked like a dog. He choked. He went, ‘I can't breathe, I can't breathe,’"" he said, referring to Romney’s loss in the 2012 presidential race. ""Romney choked …. Romney can't recover from a choke."" (Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, won his race in 2018 for U.S. Senate in Utah.) In 2015, Trump also derided U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as a ""lightweight choker."" Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pinned Floyd’s neck under his knee. Floyd can be heard repeatedly telling the officers, ""I can’t breathe."" After a few minutes, Floyd becomes silent, but Officer Derek Chauvin keeps his knee in place. The phrase ""I can’t breathe"" became a rallying cry among demonstrators protesting against police brutality after the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who died in New York after an officer put him in a chokehold.

The misleading claim that millions of absentee ballots end up ‘missing or in landfills’
","The coronavirus pandemic has escalated the political battle over efforts to expand voting by mail, with the White House, Congress and local election officials feuding over whether to make it easier to cast ballots from home this year. A June 3 House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on protecting the right to vote amid the pandemic illustrated the divide — and turned up some questionable claims. Voting rights advocates on the left, including former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams, argued that Americans need more access to voting by mail. Advocates said there has been scant voter fraud in the past, and polls show most Americans support voting by mail. Conservative legal activists, including J. Christian Adams, said that voting by mail has been problematic. Adams, who served on President Donald Trump’s defunct voter integrity commission, is president and general counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which has filed lawsuits seeking to get jurisdictions to keep voter rolls up to date or to oppose expansions of voting by mail. ""We found numerous failures in election administration, and we know from federal data that voting by mail is the most vulnerable form of voting, where hundreds of thousands of ballots have been rejected for defects and millions more end up missing or in landfills,"" Adams testified.  The mailed ballots rejected for defects — sometimes as part of safeguards against voter fraud — represent a small percentage of the votes cast over four general elections. And Adams' statement that millions of ballots end up ""missing or in landfills"" is misleading. RELATED: How battleground states are preparing for the pandemic election’s massive increase in voting by mail Adams’ foundation released a two-page document  in April that included voting-by-mail statistics during the past four general elections, from 2012 to 2018. Using U.S. Election Assistance Commission survey data, the foundation said that about 146 million ballots were mailed out to voters.  Of those, 28 million ballots were ""not returned by voter, spoiled, returned as undeliverable, or otherwise unable to be tracked."" The federal commission refers to these ballots as ""unknown,"" not ""missing."" Those ballots ""represent 28 million opportunities for someone to cheat,"" Adams wrote.  But experts say that’s a mischaracterization of what’s generally happening with these ballots. It’s more accurate to refer to them as uncast or unreturned.  ""The vast majority are sitting on kitchen counters or put in the trash or recycling because individuals who received them did not end up casting votes,"" said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. There are a few reasons why someone may receive an absentee ballot and then not use it. First, millions of these ballots are in the states of Colorado, Oregon and Washington that mail ballots to every active voter. Just as many voters don’t show up in person to vote, many voters in those states skip voting even when they are sent a ballot at home. For voters in other states, some were on ongoing lists to get absentee ballots for every election cycle, and may not have been engaged in a particular one. Even among voters who requested a ballot for that particular election, there are those who, for whatever reason, ultimately didn’t vote. ""Conflating voters choosing not to cast their ballot with ‘missing’ ballots is a fundamental flaw in the argument"" against voting by mail, wrote Vote at Home CEO Amber McReynolds, formerly Denver’s head of elections. Adams’ spokesman told us that the comments about landfills refers to a statement by Paul Gronke, a Reed College political science professor and director of the Early Voting Information Center. ""Election officials ‘know’ what happened to those ballots,"" Gronke told ProPublica. ""They were received by eligible citizens and not filled out. Where are they now? Most likely, in landfills.""  Gronke told us that his words were being misinterpreted to suggest something nefarious.  ""These ballots were not returned,"" he said. ""They are not ‘missing.’ These are ballots that are not voted, and most likely, are simply discarded with the trash or paper recycling. That was the source of my somewhat tongue-in-cheek comment about a landfill."" We sent Adams a summary of what experts said to dispute the characterization of these ballots as ""missing."" Adams defended his use of the word to describe ballots that are essentially unaccounted for. ""They are missing because nobody knows where they are,"" he said. ""They might be in landfills. They might be in the woods. They might be in a trunk."" Adams’ group said that during the four most recent general elections, about 1.3 million ballots were rejected upon receipt out of about 146 million ballots, which works out to about 1 percent. Federal data shows that rejected absentee ballots are a small subset. In 2016, about 1% of absentee ballots were rejected, most commonly for missing or mismatched signatures, or for arriving after the deadline. Signature checks are one of the ways election officials try to safeguard against absentee voter fraud, but they can also trip up voters who simply forgot to sign their ballots, or whose signatures have varied over time. ""If you talk to election officials, they’ll tell you that signature problems are almost all due to current signatures not matching what’s on file, not due to people fraudulently voting for others,"" MIT political science professor Charles Stewart said. Rejected ballots can make a difference in an extremely close election, such as Minnesota’s 2008 U.S. Senate election between then incumbent Republican Norm Coleman and Democratic challenger Al Franken. The outcome of that election was tied up in eight months of litigation over absentee ballots that had been initially rejected because of errors by would-be voters hoping to participate in the election, said Ed Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University. ""Obviously, that’s an unusual case, but it is one example (among others) that shows that absentee ballots are generally more vulnerable to disputation than in-person ballots,"" he said.  Adams said in voting by mail ""hundreds of thousands of ballots have been rejected for defects and millions more end up missing or in landfills."" Adams was referring to the outcome of mailed ballots during the past four general elections. Mail-in ballots rejected for defects represent  a very small share of the ballots issued, about 1 percent. Adams’ claim that ""millions more end up missing or in a landfill"" is misleading in implying that they were mishandled. He is referring to ballots that were mailed to voters and then ultimately ended up in a category that the federal government calls ""unknown."" Election experts said it’s wrong to call these ballots missing — they represent voters who ultimately didn’t cast a ballot. This claim has an element of truth, but leaves out important context that could give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Joe Biden says he doesn’t want to defund police
","President Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that Democratic rival Joe Biden wants to ""defund the police."" But there was no record of Biden taking that position at the time of Trump’s claims, and Biden has since rejected the idea through a spokesman and in a TV interview. ""Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats want to ""DEFUND THE POLICE,"" Trump said in the first of two June 7 tweets making the same point. ""I want great and well paid LAW ENFORCEMENT. I want LAW & ORDER!""  Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats want to “DEFUND THE POLICE”. I want great and well paid LAW ENFORCEMENT. I want LAW & ORDER!

In Minneapolis, a veto-proof majority of city council members pledged to replace the city’s police department with a community-based public safety model following protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody. But Biden told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O’Donnell that he does not intend to defund the police in a clip the program aired on June 8.  ""No, I don’t support defunding the police,"" Biden said. ""I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.""  .@NorahODonnell: “Do you support defunding the police?”Former VP Joe Biden: “No, I don't support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.”https://t.co/TvsHluVVSW pic.twitter.com/AuJiPyheX6 Earlier that day, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates addressed Trump’s claims by saying that Biden ""does not believe that police should be defunded.""

Similar policies are outlined under ""Joe’s vision"" on Biden’s campaign website, but there’s no mention of defunding the police or anything that could reasonably be construed as such. Biden would invest $300 million for the federal Community Oriented Policing Services Program, his campaign website says. His plans also include expanding the Justice Department’s authority to investigate unconstitutional policing, excessive force and systemic police misconduct. RELATED FACT-CHECK: Fact-checking Kamala Harris’ claim about Donald Trump and investigations of police misconduct The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In a June 8 statement, Trump spokesman Tim Murtaugh argued that because Biden himself had not addressed the ""defund the police"" idea, Americans had ""no way of knowing where he really stands."" But neither did Trump, who said Biden shared that position. In a June 6 op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, Biden vowed to establish a national police oversight commission during his first 100 days in office. He called on Congress to ""outlaw chokeholds, stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces, improve oversight and accountability, and create a model use-of-force standard."" ""We need to implement real community policing and ensure that every police department in the country undertakes a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, and their de-escalation practices,"" Biden wrote. Trump said Biden wants to ""defund the police.""

Barr says federal police didn’t use chemical irritants to clear area by DC church. They did
","On a Sunday morning news show, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said federal officers used no chemical irritants to disperse a crowd of people near a D.C church President Donald Trump was due to visit. Appearing on CBS News’ Face the Nation, Barr said Park Police and Secret Service used ""standard crowd control"" methods during the June 1 action. Host Margaret Brennan reminded him that the Park Police had said chemical irritants were used. ""No, there were not chemical irritants,"" Barr said June 7. ""Pepper spray is not a chemical irritant. It's not chemical."" Brennan interjected: ""Pepper spray, you’re saying, is what was used."" ""Pepper balls. Pepper balls,"" Barr clarified. Barr’s statement about chemical irritants is wrong. The Park Police issued a statement saying its units fired pepper balls, a product that contains a chemical irritant. Pepper balls are a generic term for small plastic balls that burst on impact. They fall into the category of less-lethal impact munitions. Think of the popular mock battle game called paintball using balls filled with something other than paint.  The Park Police told PolitiFact that its officers deployed products from the PepperBall company. The weakest variety of pepper ball on the PepperBall company’s website contains a 0.5% concentration of the chemical irritant pelargonic acid vanillylamide, or PAVA, a synthetic compound.

Are Texans’ property taxes ‘no longer really dependent’ on values?
","Citing economic concerns from the coronavirus pandemic, some local officials in Texas have asked state leadership to consider freezing property appraisals at their 2019 values to protect against a drastic increase in property taxes. During a May 24 television interview with reporter Jason Whitley of WFAA-TV in Dallas, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the proposal is ""a terrible idea."" ""We don’t want to freeze your taxes, because then they can’t go down,"" Patrick said. ""This is what the scam is by the cities and counties. It sounds good, ‘We want to freeze your values.’ Well the bill that we passed last year, Jason, says this: Your taxes that you pay are no longer really dependent on your values, it is on their revenue growth."" Patrick went on to explain that cities and counties have been growing their property tax revenue by 8% or more annually, and that the legislation passed last year prevents them from growing their property tax revenue by more than 3.5%. ""So the value of your house, Jason, or anyone watching, no matter how high it goes up, they have to lower their tax rate to bring their (total revenue growth) to 3.5%. It is a seesaw. The values go up, they have to lower their rate so they cannot grow any more than 3.5% in their budget."" Patrick gets some parts of his larger explanation right, but his initial claim that property tax bills paid by individuals are no longer dependent on property values needs further examination. Broadly speaking, property tax bills are based on the value of a person’s home or business (determined by an appraisal district) and the tax rate set by local taxing entities (cities, counties, school districts, etc.). Texas does not have a state property tax. State lawmakers approved a bill in 2019 that lowers the cap on how much local entities can collect in increased property tax revenue, which affects the property tax rate they ultimately charge. The legislation established an automatic election for entities that want to exceed the cap. Previously, voters needed to petition to prompt an election. The legislation did not change the formula for calculating property tax bills, which relies on the tax rate and home and business appraisals. When asked for more information about this claim, Patrick’s spokeswoman Sherry Sylvester pointed to the text of the bill and the lowered cap on increasing property tax revenue. ""Lt. Governor Patrick did not say that appraised values are no longer a factor in the property tax equation,"" she said in an email. ""What he wanted to make clear is that they are far less important now because local governments can't just keep the tax rate the same and increase their revenue based on a rising appraisal."" To be clear, Patrick said: ""Your taxes that you pay are no longer really dependent on your values, it is on their revenue growth."" Examining property taxes Dick Lavine, former chairman of the Board of Directors of the Travis Center Appraisal District, said the equation for calculating property taxes is ""foundational,"" and was not altered by the bill Patrick referenced. Lavine, who serves as senior fiscal analyst at Every Texan (formerly the Center for Public Policy Priorities), described the process for levying property taxes in an email: ""The city/county determines the size of the pie (total revenue to be collected). Your individual appraisal determines how big your slice (your personal tax bill) is. If your appraisal has gone up more than the average, then your tax bill will go up more than the average. And vice-versa. ""So if the city/county is increasing its total property tax revenue by 3.5%, your tax bill might go up by more than 3.5% or less than 3.5%, depending on how much your appraisal changed compared to everyone else's."" The legislation the state adopted last year requires most local taxing entities to seek voter approval through an election if they want to increase property tax revenue (the size of the pie) by 3.5% or more than the revenue collected one year prior. Previously, this limit was set at 8%. This allows taxing entities to then calculate the annual tax rate, which is applied to individual property values to determine the final property tax bill a resident must pay. Bruce Elfant, the Tax-Assessor Collector in Travis County, said the first thing taxing entities do is determine where the tax rate needs to be set in order to bring in the same amount of revenue as the year before. This rate was previously called the effective tax rate, but the bill Patrick mentions renames it the ""no-new revenue tax rate."" It is based on properties taxed both years and does not include revenue from new construction. ""So, in theory, if the values rise, this rate should go down and if property values decrease, this rate will go up,"" said Susan Zavala, director of the Property Tax Collections division at the Travis County Tax Office. From there, cities, counties and school districts assess their budgetary needs and decide whether to grow their property tax revenue by changing the tax rate. The bill adopted in 2019 limits how much taxing entities can increase revenue for maintenance and operations by a different cap, depending on the jurisdiction. For cities and counties, the cap is 3.5%. For school districts, it is 2.5%. If a taxing jurisdiction wants to increase revenue beyond this cap, it triggers an automatic election. Previously, voters had to petition in order to prompt a ""rollback election."" This is the rollback rate, renamed the ""voter-approved tax rate"" under the new law. This rate allows taxing jurisdictions to grow their revenue and collect on debt that has already been approved by voters, Zavala said. But, all things considered, Zavala said property values are ""still part of calculating how much taxes you will owe and it definitely can affect how much you pay in taxes."" State Sen. Paul Bettencourt, who authored the new tax law, said the bill is about ""changing the culture"" by putting ""more emphasis on the tax rate setting than on the value setting."" Historically, Bettencourt said taxpayers were fixated on appealing appraisals and ""committing jitsu"" to keep their values low, even though values are just one part of the equation. He said the bill puts ""a complete flashlight on the tax rate setting process."" ""Basically, we're taking the elected officials’ setting of tax rates and bringing it up to at least the same level of importance as the value itself,"" said Bettencourt, R-Houston. ""Because both sides of the equation times each other, equals the bill people pay."" He said this is a ""really subtle problem"" the legislature has been fighting, so many of the changes in the new law are about ""transparency in tax rate setting."" ""If he had said ‘completely’ dependent versus ‘really,’ I don’t think anybody would be arguing,"" he said. Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, agreed. ""In fact, all your appraisal does is determine what your share of the jurisdiction’s desired amount of property taxes is,"" Craymer said in an email. ""If your home is 1% of a jurisdiction’s tax base, you’re going to pay 1% of whatever revenue the jurisdiction wants to raise, whether they want more money or less. Your value doesn’t turn into a tax bill until jurisdictions adopt the tax rate that will apply against that value. No matter what your value is, your tax bill is zero until jurisdictions adopt their tax rates."" Our ruling Patrick said a 2019 law adopted in Texas means that property taxes in the state ""are no longer really dependent on your values, it is on (city and county) revenue growth."" The bill Patrick mentioned limited how much taxing entities can increase property tax revenue before triggering an election, but it did not change the role property values play in any part of the calculation. Property values remain essential to the process. The law’s author said the bill was more about shifting culture than changing the literal calculation for taxes, as it increases transparency and requires an automatic rollback election. But regardless of where the bill shifted focus, property values dictate what a person’s tax bill will be each year and they are part of the equation for cities and counties when they calculate the annual tax rate.

Glenn Grothman on target about tie between vitamin D and COVID-19, but vitamin D isn’t a known cure
","People across the globe continue to seek answers on how to defeat the coronavirus that has sickened millions. One proposed solution has gained attention in recent weeks: Vitamin D. A link between vitamin D and COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, caught the eye of U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah.  In a May 21, 2020 news release, Grothman encouraged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to look into vitamin D’s impact on the virus.  ""Research illustrates a clear correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and (higher) COVID-19 mortality rates,"" the release said. Studies cited by Grothman do suggest vitamin D deficiencies may have contributed to COVID-19 deaths in some countries. But many questions remain about the relationship between the two, and researchers say more work should be done to better understand it. Is Grothman right about the correlation? Grothman’s news release cited studies out of Northwestern University and Trinity College in Dublin that reached similar conclusions: Countries with more deaths from the virus, such as Spain and Italy, also had higher rates of vitamin D deficiencies.  ""We saw a significant correlation with vitamin D deficiency,"" Vadim Backman, a Northwestern professor who helped author one study, told the university website Northwestern Now. Why look into vitamin D in the first place? Aside from building healthy bones, vitamin D can boost the immune system by suppressing what’s called a cytokine storm — severe inflammation that occurs when the immune system becomes overactive and releases too many cytokine proteins. Backman said cytokine storms may contribute to COVID-19 deaths because the storms can damage people’s lungs. An April 17, 2020 article on WebMD also indicated that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms had high levels of cytokines in their system. The idea, then, is that vitamin D could suppress a catastrophic immune response and prevent people from developing severe COVID-19 symptoms that lead to death. ""It will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected,"" Backman said in the interview. Let’s return to Grothman. He did not say researchers found a connection, only a correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 deaths. That’s on target. Vitamin D is by no means a cure for the virus, and Grothman conceded that we don’t yet know the extent of the relationship. In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Grothman reiterated his belief that federal agencies should further explore the issue.  ""I think a lot of times, the CDC and (National Institutes of Health) and that crowd primarily focus on new drugs,"" he said. ""If you have something right under your nose, let’s go with it."" For now, researchers caution against reading too much into the available studies.  J. Wesley Pike, a biochemistry professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said there is not enough proof yet to suggest a meaningful relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19. Researchers will need to conduct further studies to determine if that vitamin is effective in combating the coronavirus. ""There’s simply no evidence that taking vitamin D will protect you,"" Pike said. ""But again, we don’t know. The answer is it’s possible.""  A group of researchers in Europe and the United Kingdom noted in a May 2020 paper that vitamin D supports the immune system and is recommended to help people maintain a healthy lifestyle. People can up their intake and avoid deficiencies through supplements, eating vitamin D-rich food and getting safe sunlight exposure. But vitamin D is not a ""magic bullet"" to prevent or treat COVID-19, they wrote, and should not be taken in excessive doses that could present their own health risks. Grothman claimed ""research illustrates a clear correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and (higher) COVID-19 mortality rates."" Early studies into vitamin D suggests it may curb the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and reduce mortality rates. Further research is needed to examine the issue, and vitamin D is not a cure for the coronavirus.  But Grothman did not say it was a cure, only that there was a correlation. One expert noted the correlation was ""significant"" We rate his claim True.  See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com",/factchecks/2020/jun/08/glenn-grothman/glenn-grothman-target-about-tie-between-vitamin-d-/

No, Texans can't tote guns under disaster declaration for protests
","Protests over the death of black Minnesotan George Floyd have swept the nation, with daily demonstrations in cities across the country — including in Texas. There have been reports of looting and violence at some protests, and law enforcement entities have come under fire for tactics used against participants and journalists covering the events.  A Facebook post circulating online urges Texans to take advantage of a recently passed state law allowing people to carry firearms during disasters. The post claimed the law, adopted in 2019, ""allows any Texan who can legally own a firearm to carry their handgun, open or concealed, for a full week after a state or natural disaster is declared.""  ""Arm yourselves, protect your family, loved ones and neighbors,"" the post reads. ""Stand together, Stand your ground, protect your family and your property. If you feel threatened, You have every right to protect yourselves!  Be vigilant and look out for one another, stay safe."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration on May 31 in response to violence that broke out at protests in some parts of the state. The law highlighted in the post moved through the state’s legislature as House Bill 1177 and it  was authored by state Rep. Dade Phelan, a Republican from Beaumont. The bill does regulate firearm usage during a natural disaster, but it was passed with 2017’s Hurricane Harvey front of mind, with lawmakers arguing that the measure was necessary to give survivors of natural disasters a way to protect themselves and their property. But does it apply to this situation? We decided to find out. ‘Evacuating from an area’ HB 1177 allows handgun license holders and other Texans who are not prohibited by law from possessing a firearm to legally carry and transport their handguns during a mandatory emergency evacuation. It includes parameters that dictate when the law is applicable: not only must there be a state of disaster, but a person must also be ""evacuating from an area following the declaration of a state of disaster"" or ""reentering that area following the person’s evacuation.""  The post does not make mention of the circumstances that would trigger this protection and insinuates that the law applies at any time within a week of a disaster declaration. For this reason, Lauren Lumsden, Phelan’s legislative director, said it was inaccurate. ""It does not appear that the Facebook post was a correct application of the bill, since they do not seem to be evacuating,"" she said.  Attorneys specializing in government law reached by PolitiFact agreed with that interpretation. ""Assuming that the Governor has declared a qualifying state of disaster, it is my opinion that the statute does not allow the unrestricted open carrying of handguns,"" said Texas appellate attorney and former Texas Assistant Solicitor General Ryan Clinton. ""Rather, it allows handguns to be openly carried when a person is ‘evacuating from’ or ‘reentering’ an area following the declaration of a state of disaster in the area."" Clinton also noted that the law does not apply to people who are otherwise banned from having a firearm under state or federal law. Mike Cox, legislative director of the Texas State Rifle Association, said many members had reached out to the organization about similar claims. After consulting with attorney Richard D. Hayes, II, of Houston-based law firm Walker & Taylor, Cox said he agreed that the law does not currently apply. ""The circumstances that would allow for the unlicensed carry of a handgun after a declared disaster are fairly limited,"" Hayes said in a blog post and video on the matter. ""It doesn’t suspend 46.02 for all purposes. It really relates to evacuating."" Our ruling The Facebook post stated that HB 1177 applied to the ongoing state of disaster and allowed open carry of handguns. The post omits a major part of the law, which specifies that it only applies during particular scenarios.

No, 'antifa' had no plans to raid wealthy Raleigh neighborhoods
","Some pundits and politicians have raised questions about people protesting police brutality throughout the country -- in some cases accusing them of having ulterior motives. A right wing pundit falsely accused liberal billionaire George Soros of funding the protests. President Trump has suggested some are ""anarchists."" And in Raleigh this week, a message that was posted to neighborhood boards and texted amongst people suggested that ""antifa"" planned to come into wealthy areas and steal from residents. ""Antifa may be heading into the wealthy neighborhoods tonight to take what should be theirs,"" one text said on June 2. Was this true?  No. This type of rumor is being spread across the country about people marching in remembrance of George Floyd. Not only is there no evidence to support it, the claims inaccurately portray Antifa as an organized terrorist group. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a collection of far-left groups that rally against white supremacy and other causes. Unlike many other organizations, antifa doesn’t have an official membership, leader or base for operations.  Antifa is ""more like a scene than an organization,"" said Joan Donovan, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. ""Anarchists around the globe participate in music and culture, hosting book fairs, art shows, workshops, and music nights,"" Donovan said. ""That’s about as organized as it gets, but when we see ‘Antifa’ or black bloc emerge, it is to counter the far right organizing in public."" So for law enforcement authorities, it can be difficult to track who is and isn’t part of antifa. And that’s part of the reason some legal scholars say Trump’s promise to designate them as a ""terrorist group"" is an ""empty threat."" Nonetheless, NBC News found similar rumors to be circulating widely across the country on social media apps and through text messages. But so far, there’s little to no evidence that antifa has coordinated attacks on people or property. An FBI report obtained by The Nation, a liberal news outlet, showed the agency has ""has no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence"" in the violence that occurred during the Washington D.C.-area protests on May 31. Claims that the group was busing protesters to South Dakota prompted an investigation by the Sioux Falls police chief, who found the rumors to be a ""false flag,"" according to the Argus Leader newspaper. Unfortunately, the false rumor chains are common even apart from the protests, Donovan said. ""We have seen similar warnings like this at the beginning of the pandemic, where text messages were circulating saying that robbers were coming to people’s houses claiming to be the CDC,"" Donovan said. ""I’ve also seen the claims about ‘bus loads’ of activists many times over the last decade."" The warnings are meant to generate tension between certain demographic groups. In the context of the protests, Donovan thinks they’re part of an underground ""race-based antagonism"" campaign to erode support for Black Lives Matter. NBC reported that the viral texts about antifa often feature an appeal toward familiarity or authority. And that was the case in Raleigh, too. The text obtained by PolitiFact and WRAL showed someone saying that ""antifa may be heading into the wealthy neighborhoods tonight to take what should be theirs. I didn’t want to post on FB and create mass hysteria. I wanted you and your family to be aware so you can be prepared."" The text said the intel came from ""the wife of someone well connected to the RPD."" Contacted by PolitiFact, the Raleigh Police Department said it had heard about the rumors circulating through the community -- but was unable to find evidence they were true. ""Just like the media and everyone else finds information that is posted publicly online, so does the Raleigh Police Department. However, the RPD cannot confirm the validity of that online information,"" said Donna-maria Harris, the department’s public affairs manager. The Wake County Sheriff's Office had a similar response. ""We don’t have any information that is verifiable,"" spokesman Eric Curry said. The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation isn’t aware of any credible threats from antifa, spokeswoman Anjanette Grube said. PolitiFact also reached out to the FBI’s North Carolina field office, which is located in Charlotte. Spokeswoman Shelley Lynch said the FBI shares any information about credible threats with local agencies. ""I can't comment on any specific social media post. I can say, the FBI is in regular contact with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners and anytime we have information on a credible threat, we share it with them,"" Lynch wrote in an email. A PolitiFact review of arrests from June 2 (when we obtained the viral text) and June 3 found no record of breaking and entering in wealthier neighborhoods around downtown Raleigh. A text message circulating through the Raleigh community says ""Antifa may be heading into the wealthy neighborhoods tonight to take what should be theirs,"" one text said. This message is part of a broad network of misinformation across the country. It hasn’t been true in other communities and local authorities said it’s not true in Raleigh, either.
