Sanders: Welfare reform more than doubled 'extreme poverty'
","One thing that sets Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders apart from opponent Hillary Clinton is that he opposed a 1996 law known widely as welfare reform. The Vermont senator said the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which both Democratic President Bill Clinton and a bipartisan Congress supported, contributed to poverty today. ""What welfare reform did, in my view, was go after some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country,"" Sanders said at a Feb. 24 press conference in South Carolina. ""During that time, I spoke out against so-called welfare reform because I thought it was scapegoating people who were helpless, people who were very, very vulnerable. Secretary Clinton at that time had a very different position on welfare reform. ... Now what happened as a result of that so-called welfare reform bill? Since legislation was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.6 million."" We wondered if the number of families living in extreme poverty — defined as households living on less than $2 in cash per person per day — has more than doubled, and we also wanted to know if the 1996 legislation caused that trend. We found that the best estimates show Sanders’ numbers are right on, and there is some well-regarded research that ties welfare reform to the rise in extreme poverty. The numbers Sanders’ campaign pointed us to figures from the Census’ Survey of Income and Program Participation, which researchers Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer examined in their 2015 book, $2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America. When welfare reform passed in 1996, there were about 636,000 American households living on $2 per person per day or less. As of mid 2013, that figure has more than doubled, to about 1.5 million such households, with about 3 million children living in these circumstances. That’s a 130 percent growth in families in extreme poverty, compared to just about 20 percent growth in the population as a whole. This data has some shortcomings, acknowledged by Edin and Shaefer, professors at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan, respectively. For example, there are concerns that survey respondents misreport how much cash assistance they receive from the government, which could mean that some of these households actually have cash income higher than $2 a day. Additionally, SIPP only counts cash income, so it doesn’t capture whether these families receive in-kind government benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, child day care or subsidized housing. Even if the SIPP data isn’t perfect, Edin and Shaefer found that the general trend was consistent with corresponding data, such as an increase in those reporting zero income among people receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known colloquially as SNAP or food stamps. In any case, by a reasonable measure, Sanders’ figures are correct. The causes What was welfare reform? The bipartisan legislation sought to encourage the poor to join the workforce and stay there. It responded to a sense that welfare recipients were choosing government cash over getting a job. The law put a five-year lifetime limit on receiving welfare cash, established as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and it established workforce participation requirements. The previous program had no such requirements. Welfare reform, combined with earned income tax credit expansions and a booming economy, benefited the working poor, experts told us. But the instability of the low-wage market revealed the program to be an ineffective safety net for people who weren't able to find and keep work, Edin and Shaefer found. They aren’t able to maintain a stable earned income, and as a result they cannot reap the benefits of a work-based safety net and the earned income tax credit. ""We believe a lot of families are better off as a result of the package of changes made during the 1990s, in particular the EITC,"" Shaefer told PolitiFact. ""Those who are able to maintain employment, buffer against the instability, receive more assistance than ever before. It’s those at the very bottom that we argue are doing worse."" Just 23 out of every 100 people living in poverty receive welfare cash, as of 2014, and that ratio has dropped nearly every year since 1996 when it was 68 out of 100, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. People living in extreme poverty might not be taking advantage of welfare cash benefits because of the stigma, lack of confidence in the program, or the work requirements and time limits, contributing to some families’ extremely low cash income. Welfare reform put TANF administration into the hands of the states in the form of block grants. This means that states can use the funding for cash benefits or for administering programs intended to increase employment, like childcare or job training. But there is wide variation between the states as a result. For example, in 2013, 78 out of 100 impoverished families in Vermont received cash benefits, but just 4 out of 100 did in Louisiana. Shaefer said some states use these block grants to pay for programs they would have paid for absent the federal funds, leading to less cash in the hands of individuals.   Certain states and the 1996 legislation for structuring welfare in such a way are both responsible for these state-level shortcomings, said Ron Haskins, who was involved in crafting welfare reform and is now codirector of the Brookings Center on Children and Families. There are other factors affecting this upward trend in extreme poverty, including broader economic trends affecting low-wage employment and housing stability, Edin and Schaefer note. But there’s no doubt that welfare reform played a role. ""I think welfare reform was one major factor driving the increase in extreme poverty and probably the biggest single factor, although it’s harder to be sure about the second claim,"" said Christopher Jencks, professor of social policy at Harvard University. Though acknowledging extremely poor people who are unable to maintain a job would have been better off under the pre-reform system, Haskins said Sanders is ignoring all the positive benefits of welfare reform. For example, poverty among single-mother households, which were most affected by by welfare reform, is lower than what it was prior to welfare reform, even during the Great Recession. ""Sanders is onto something, but he only told half the story,"" Haskins said. Our ruling Sanders said, ""Since (welfare reform) was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled."" Sanders is talking about a very specific and small percentage of American households living on less than $2 cash income per person per day. That figure has more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.5 million since 1996 when Bill Clinton signed welfare reform. The data isn’t a perfect capture of how much these people receive in government benefits, and only so much blame can be placed on welfare reform legislation. But experts told us the law did play a significant role in this trend. We rate Sanders’ claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/02/bernie-sanders/sanders-welfare-reform-more-doubled-extreme-povert/

Ted Cruz wrongly says Harry Reid likes Donald Trump best in GOP field
","In an urgent quest to keep his presidential hopes alive, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, attacked GOP frontrunner Donald Trump from several directions in the run-up to Super Tuesday primary balloting. ABC News This Week host George Stephanopoulos prodded Cruz about his charge that Trump has forsaken conservative principles by expressing a willingness to work with congressional Democrats. ""You've been making that point about Donald Trump supporting Democrats for several weeks right now,"" Stephanopoulos asked Cruz on Feb. 28. ""It doesn't seem to be sticking. Why not?"" Cruz responded that he’s seen positive movement in the polls during that time, and he charged that Trump would be too quick to compromise on such issues as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Supreme Court nominations and religious liberty. Then he added, ""There's a reason (Senate Democratic Leader) Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals. We've had too many deals in Washington."" We wondered: Did Reid, one of the fiercest Democratic partisans in Congress, really give his blessing to Trump? The short answer is that he did, but only jokingly. Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. On Jan. 27 — one day  after Trump said he got along well with Reid and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on MSNBC’s Morning Joe — Reid told reporters at an impromptu media availability, ""Look, we've gotten along fine,"" referring to Trump. ""With that bunch of people running, I'm kind of pulling for him,"" Reid said. Reid also said, ""Oh, I remember the good old days when he did a fundraiser or two for me."" Apparently realizing that his words could be misconstrued, Reid took to the Senate floor in short order, seeking to clarify that he had only been joking about ""pulling for"" Trump in the presidential race. ""There are some things I shouldn’t joke about,"" Reid said on the floor. ""I tried to be funny an hour ago at my weekly stakeout and I guess it wasn’t very funny, at least I don’t think so. The danger Donald Trump’s candidacy poses to our country is not a joke. Since he launched his bid for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he is a hateful demagogue who would do immeasurable damage to our country if elected. I have come to the Senate floor many times to decry his hateful comments. Donald Trump threatens to diminish the integrity of our democracy around the whole world. If he wins the nomination of the Republican Party to run for president of the United States, the Republican Party will never recover from the damage he will inflict on conservatism."" This public clarification of Reid’s position isn’t something that Cruz reflected when he made his comments on This Week. (We viewed the video of Cruz’s remarks here and conclude that he seems to be making a serious point about what Reid said, not saying it in a tongue-in-cheek manner.) Cruz also glossed over the fact that Reid said he is ""pulling for him,"" which is not exactly the same as Reid saying Trump is the Republican he ""likes best."" And Cruz amplified these inaccuracies by saying that the reason for Reid’s seeming warmth to Trump was that Reid felt he could cut deals with him. None of the news accounts we found said that Reid cited a willingness to strike deals as the reason for his purported support of Trump. Deal-making was brought up by Trump, not by Reid. When we checked with Reid’s office, spokesman Adam Jentleson reiterated that the comments Cruz cited on This Week were just a joke. Reid, Jentleson said, ""has repeatedly denounced Trump for stoking the fires of racism and resentment and spoken out repeatedly on the floor, including before he said the quote"" that Cruz referenced. Indeed, there is ample evidence from both before and after Reid’s comments that the Democratic leader is strongly opposed to Trump’s candidacy. For instance, during a Dec. 8, 2015, floor speech, Reid said, ""Donald Trump is standing on the platform of hate,"" and on Jan. 20, 2016, Reid tweeted that by advancing a bill on refugees, the GOP ""is catering to (the) hateful agenda of Donald Trump."" Reid added in that tweet that Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim travel to the United States is ""reprehensible."" Then, in late February, Reid tweeted that ""Republicans should think about this: If they follow (Senate Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell's lead, they'll be as responsible as Trump/Cruz for debasement of their Party."" When we contacted Cruz’s campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said, ""I'll leave it to Sen. Reid to speak the sincerity of his comment, but the takeaway still stands — the Washington establishment recognizes Trump will cut deals with them to further their agenda. That is the very thing Americans are fed up with."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals."" Reid did tell reporters that ""with that bunch of people running, I'm kind of pulling for"" Trump, but he quickly went to the Senate floor to clarify that he had been joking. Indeed, Reid has spoken out forcefully and repeatedly against Trump’s candidacy, both before and after the comments Cruz referenced. And importantly, Reid said nothing about Trump’s willingness to cut deals. We rate Cruz’s statement False.",/factchecks/2016/mar/02/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-wrongly-says-senate-democratic-leader-har/

Yes, Donald Trump has been linked to the mob
","Donald Trump ""seems terrified to release his taxes"" because they may reveal his true net worth, his donations to liberal causes, or something even seedier, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested on Meet the Press. ""There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia,"" Cruz said Feb. 28. ""Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported."" Pressed by host Chuck Todd to back up his claim, Cruz cited reports by ABC and CNN. A Cruz spokesman forwarded us several other media reports detailing the real estate developer’s alleged ties to organized crime. The Trump campaign did not get back to us. Is Cruz right that the Donald has worked with a few Dons in his career? HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER It’s important to note that Trump hasn’t been charged with any illegal activity, and it’s reasonable to argue that he was unaware or even a victim in some cases. But Cruz has a point that the mogul has been linked to the mob for decades. Mob control a ‘fact of life’ Before we detail Trump’s alleged ties, none of this proves that Trump was happy doing business with the mafia or even in cahoots with them at all. La Cosa Nostra had a virtual monopoly on concrete in New York at the time Trump was adding his name to its skyline in the 1980s. And the mafia’s control over building supplies and labor unions meant that the crime families had a hand in most construction projects in Manhattan. Trump and other major developers ""had to adapt to that situation"" or build elsewhere, said James B. Jacobs, a mafia expert who was part of a state task force on organized crime. ""That was the fact of life, that was the way it was,"" he told PolitiFact. ""The contractors and developers weren’t pure victims. You could bribe the mob-controlled union leaders and get relief from the more arduous conflicts. But we had no information that Trump was any different.""   That being said, Trump’s business dealings with the mob or mob-related characters are widely documented. Let’s run through them. Mafia concrete for Trump Plaza Trump was first tied to the mafia in the 1980s, when a $7.8 million subcontract for Trump Plaza was awarded to S&A Concrete, according to Fortune. The company, as Cruz correctly says, was partially owned by Anthony ""Fat Tony"" Salerno, the boss of the Genovese crime family. Trump himself acknowledged as much in a December 2015 interview with the Wall Street Journal, admitting that S&A Concrete was ""supposedly associated with the mob."" ""Virtually every building that was built was built with these companies,"" he said, adding, ""These guys were excellent contractors. They were phenomenal. They could do three floors a week in concrete. Nobody else in the world could do three floors a week. I mean they were unbelievable. Trump Tower, other buildings."" When Salerno was indicted in 1986, the charges specifically mentioned Trump Plaza. Salerno’s 1992 obituary ends with a nod to the luxury highrise and 15 other Manhattan buildings. Trump World Tower, supported by the Quadrozzi Concrete Company, is also tangentially related to La Cosa Nostra. The head of the company, John Quadrozzi Sr., was tied to the Lucchese crime family and indicted for making illegal payoffs to the mob in 1992. TIME and Daily Beast have speculated that Trump Tower was also built with mafia influence, though the evidence is less concrete. Atlantic City partnerships Trump’s alleged mob dealings were not confined to New York. According to reports from the Huffington Post  and Philadelphia Inquirer, Trump made a deal in Atlantic City with Kenneth Shapiro, an associate of mob boss Nicky Scarfo, and mob-connected labor boss Daniel Sullivan. Trump seemed aware of this, calling Shapiro ""a third-rate, local real estate mafia"" and Sullivan ""the guy who killed Jimmy Hoffa."" Nonetheless, in 1981, Trump leased a portion of the land for Trump Plaza and Casino from a company the two men controlled, according a report by New Jersey gaming regulators. The company refused to cooperate with the authorities, and Trump eventually ended the partnership and bought out their shares. Later Trump brought on Sullivan as a labor negotiator at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and introduced the man to his own banker, according to the Los Angeles Times. Through intermediaries Trump bought the property for the casino from the ""crown prince"" of the Philadelphia mob, Salvatore Testa, for $1.1 million in 1982. Multiple media reports and an unauthorized biography about Trump allege this was more than twice its market value. (Testa purchased the property in 1977 for $195,000.) According to The Federalist, two construction companies controlled by Nicky Scarfo ended up building Trump Plaza and Casino. ""You had contractors that were supposedly mob-oriented all over Atlantic City,"" Trump said when the Wall Street Journal asked him about it, adding that ""every single casino company used the same companies, just I hope you will say that."" A few years later, Trump’s organized crime connections extended overseas. In 1992, a Senate subcommittee named Danny Leung, who was then the vice president for foreign marketing at Trump Taj Mahal, as an associate of the Hong Kong-based organized crime group 14K Triad. ""Leung has also given complimentary tickets for hotel rooms and Asian shows to numerous members and associates of Asian organized crime,"" reads the report, which also identified three other triad-connected business associates or former employees of Trump’s gambling empire. According to gaming regulators, Leung ""flew in 16 Italian organized crime figures from Canada who stole more than $1 million from the casino in a credit scam,"" reported the New York Daily News in 1995. ""The incident was never reported because Trump never filed charges."" Leung, who had a separate contract to bring gamblers from Toronto to the casino, denied the affiliation to organized crime, and his casino and junket licenses were renewed. (The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and his other Atlantic City properties folded a decade later.) Mob-linked business adviser And there’s Felix Sater, ""a twice-convicted Russian émigré who served prison time and had documented mafia connections"" and the subject of the ABC story Cruz referenced. Sater pleaded guilty to a charge of money laundering in 1998 and was indicted again in 2000 for taking part in a $40 million stock scheme involving four Mafia families, according to the New York Times report. From 2003 to 2007, Sater traveled the country promoting projects for Trump, and his company was a partner in the Trump SoHo hotel. Trump told the Times he ""never knew that."" Three years later, Sater returned to the Trump Organization and had business cards that described him as Trump’s ""senior advisor,"" the AP reported. Trump told the AP that he’s ""not familiar"" with Sater. Our ruling Cruz said, ""There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia."" While it’s important to note that these connections were not atypical in the real estate and casino businesses in the 1980s, Cruz’s statement is accurate.

No, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele is not a billionaire
","There’s little question that Chris Abele is the wealthiest man to serve as Milwaukee County Executive. Consider some of his predecessors in the office: Bill O’Donnell took the bus to work. Tom Ament lived for a time in a small apartment on Milwaukee’s west side. Scott Walker gave back part of his salary for years and lived a middle class life in Wauwatosa. Abele, who won the job in 2010, came to Milwaukee from Boston in the 1990s and caused a stir with well-publicized philanthropic efforts, such as gifts to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Milwaukee ($5 million) and the Marcus Center, as detailed in a February 2005 Milwaukee Magazine profile. That, combined with his business endeavors and real estate holdings -- side-by-side condos in a downtown high rise, a house on Lake Drive -- leave no question that Abele is a wealthy guy. But how wealthy is he? On the night of the Feb. 16, 2016 primary, in which Abele ran a narrow second to Democratic state Sen. Chris Larson in the nonpartisan race, one of Abele’s political foes offered her take. ""Despite being outspent more than ten to one by a billionaire County Executive, Chris Larson pulled into a lead,"" said Marina Dimitrijevic, director of the Wisconsin Working Families Party, in a statement. Dimitrijevic is also a Milwaukee County supervisor, and the former Chairwoman of the County Board. Abele has been referred to as a millionaire plenty of times. But is Abele a billionaire? The Working Families Party has used that phrase repeatedly during the campaign, an effort that aims to cast Abele as out of touch with the needs of average families. Larson has pushed a similar theme. When we asked Dimitrijevic for evidence for her claim that Abele is worth more than a thousand millions, she responded with an email that cited, among other things, a  2006 article in Boston Magazine. ""Chris Abele belongs to a billionaire family,"" Dimitrijevic wrote. ""In fact, his father was among one of the wealthiest people in Boston and now Vermont."" Abele’s father, John, was a co-founder  of Boston Scientific, a medical equipment company. He became very wealthy when that company went public in 1992, and enjoyed another windfall when the company’s drug-coated stent product was a huge success in 2004. A 2014 Forbes story cited by Dimitrijevic estimated his fortune at $1.5 billion in March 2008, based on his Boston Scientific stock. The earlier Boston Magazine story put his wealth at $3.3 billion. Fair enough. But that’s his father and he’s not running for county executive. What about Chris Abele? Dimitrijevic noted that Abele’s economic interest statement ""show pages and pages of stock and company ownership."" His list includes CSA Partners, an investment firm, she noted. (We’ll get to that in a minute.) ""Whether it's millions or billions, the fact is that Chris Abele belongs to an elite family that has access to enormous amounts of wealth,"" Dimitrijevic said. Hmmm. Sounds like this claim just got marked down to pennies on the dollar. Abele’s wealth So what do we know about Abele’s wealth? We asked his spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, whether her boss was a billionaire. She didn’t provide a response. But, frankly, it’s pretty easy to see that Abele is not a billionaire: Argosy Foundation: Abele is the head of the Argosy Foundation, located on Wells Street in a building overlooking Cathedral Square. He told a Milwaukee audience in 2004 that the foundation, formed by his father was worth about $1 billion, and could grow beyond that, the Milwaukee Magazine profile said. But the group’s most recent IRS filing, from 2014, says Argosy has unrestricted assets of $9.8 million -- not billion. In any case, it’s a foundation and not Abele’s personal wealth. His homes: Abele owns two condos on the 29th floor of the Moderne tower in downtown Milwaukee. He purchased one in March, 2015 for $2.1 million and the adjoining unit for $700,000 in the fall of 2015. He also owns a Lake Drive mansion assessed at $2.34 million. That suggests a lot of money, but by itself is not evidence of billions. Venture Capital Fund: In 2013 Abele committed at least $10 million of his own money to CSA Partners LLC, a venture capital fund that invests in young companies. At the time, he told the Journal Sentinel the fund could grow ""plenty north"" of $15 million if it finds the right opportunities. Again, millions, not billions. Importantly, there’s the list that Abele is not on: The annual list of billionaires published by Forbes magazine. Ten Wisconsin residents were on Forbes’ 2015 list, including home improvement store magnate John Menard; Herbert Kohler, the former CEO of the plumbing fixture and hospitality company; and four members of Racine’s Johnson family. But no Chris Abele. Indeed, Abele’s father was not on the billionaire list either. On a separate 2015 list, of the richest person in each state, Forbes put John Abele’s fortune at $600 million. We put the question to Abele in a brief interview. He said it was well-known around the city that he was well-off, in part because of his philanthropy. He said an estimate of his net worth has never been published. He noted that the Forbes lists are educated guesses. ""They have to estimate a lot,"" he said, adding that ""there is a lot that they just don’t know."" Abele then answered the question directly: ""I am not a billionaire."" Our rating Dimitrijevic claimed Abele was a billionaire. There’s plenty of evidence that Abele is a wealthy man, with a even-wealthier father. Meanwhile, the family’s Argosy Foundation doesn’t appear to have anywhere near $1 billion in assets, and, regardless, that isn’t Abele’s personal holdings.

Obama: None of the GOP candidates have climate change plan
","Foreign leaders are ""troubled"" by some of the rhetoric coming out of the Republican presidential primary, and it’s not just what they’re hearing from Donald Trump, says President Barack Obama. ""But this is not just Mr. Trump. Look at the statements that are being made by the other candidates,"" Obama said at a Feb. 16 news conference. ""There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change, that thinks it’s serious. Well, that's a problem. The rest of the world looks at that and says, how can that be?"" Obama’s statement sounded similar to a take from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, who recently said, ""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real."" We rated that claim False because a couple GOP presidential candidates (including some who are no longer in the running) have acknowledged its existence. Obama’s claim is different: He said none of the Republicans thinks the country should do anything about climate change. To different degrees, the remaining candidates don’t believe man-made climate change is happening, or at least not to the extent that Obama and a vast majority of climate scientists believe it’s happening. All of the Republican candidates — Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson — call for scaling back environmental and energy regulations. Some support going through the private sector for renewable energy source development, alongside continued development of fossil fuels, and environmental protection. But none have a fleshed-out plan to specifically address the issue of climate change. Here’s where the remaining Republican presidential candidates stand on climate change and what they propose to do (or not do) about it. Donald Trump Trump has said repeatedly that he does not believe in climate change, even suggesting it’s a conspiracy invented by China to make the United States less competitive. His website doesn’t have any information on his plans to combat climate change or how he would approach energy issues. He has said he would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, and the environment will be ""fine."" When MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump in November what he would do about climate change, Trump did not outline a specific plan, but he said, ""We want to have clean air to breathe and we want to have beautiful clean water. That's very important to me."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio believes the climate is changing, but he questions how much of it is man-made. ""The climate has always changed,"" Rubio said in January. ""There’s never been a time when the climate has not been changing."" He has criticized international climate efforts, as well as Obama’s regulatory measures, saying they are more damaging to the economy than they are helpful to the environment. ""If you’re overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption,"" he said at the same event in January. ""I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy."" Rubio has not released a plan to quell the effects of climate change. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas Cruz believes man-made climate change is not real. He has called it a ""pseudoscientific theory"" and has criticized Obama for calling it a major security threat. His website says he would abolish the Energy Department and eliminate at least 10 existing climate change and environmental programs. Like Rubio, he calls for an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy, meaning he supports development of fossil fuels as well as renewable resources, which he says amounts to an ""energy renaissance."" ""We must harness our nation’s energy resources and remove federal impediments to energy exploration, development and trade,"" he wrote. Ben Carson Carson does not believe in man-made climate change. He has said it’s part of a natural cycle and cannot be ""an excuse not to develop our own God-given natural resources."" His energy plan calls for reducing government regulations on energy production, including fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, but also developing renewable fuels. He also calls on people to be stewards of the environment, but not at the expense of jobs and the economy. He did tell Time in October 2015 that if there is ""clear-cut evidence"" that a certain manufacturing practice is causing significant harm to the environment, President Carson might take some action. ""I would use the EPA to work with business industry and academia to find the cleanest, most environmentally friendly way to do things, rather than just all right, we’re coming in here and we’re shutting you down,"" he said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich As recently as Feb. 29, Kasich has said he believes there is a climate change problem, acknowledging he is going against the grain of his party. But he has not proposed a full-fledged strategy to address it, and his fact sheet on energy does not mention climate change. He has, though called for pursuing renewable energy sources as one possible response. In August, he questioned the extent of man’s impact on the environment, calling full-blown climate change ""some theory that is not proven."" He said he wouldn’t want to destroy any jobs in order to address these concerns. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Bush has dropped out of the race, but we’re including him because he was still in the running when Obama made his statement. He believes climate change is real and human activity is a contributing factor. He had an energy plan but not a specific environmental protection plan. He has argued that some of the Obama administration’s regulations go too far, such as Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Like most of the other Republican candidates, he called for reducing regulations and increasing growth in the energy sector, both fossil fuel and renewable sources. ""Energy resources must be developed in a way that protects human health and the environment,"" his energy plan said. ""Rules play an important role in making sure this is the case. But the Obama administration’s excessive rules too often usurp state and tribal authority and go beyond what is necessary."" Our ruling Obama said, ""There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change."" None of the remaining Republican presidential candidates have laid out a specific plan to address climate change. All of them call for scaling back Obama’s environmental regulations, to boot. Some have called for private-sector development of renewable energy sources. Bush, who was in the race when Obama made his comment, and Kasich both have said they believe human-caused climate change is real and have said pursuing these alternative energy sources could mitigate the problem. But neither has outlined a specific plan. For some Republican voters, this stance might be a plus. But it doesn’t change the veracity of Obama’s statement. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/01/barack-obama/obama-none-gop-candidates-have-climate-change-plan/

Donald Trump wrong that New York Times can't be sued for a 'story that they know is false'
","Donald Trump has made little effort to hide his distaste for the media. In a typical comment, he said at one of his rallies in South Carolina that the media are ""absolutely dishonest. Absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. Totally dishonest people."" Now Trump is proposing changes to libel laws. On the Feb. 28, 2016, edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked the Republican presidential candidate to expand upon comments he’d made a few days earlier in Fort Worth, Texas -- that ""one of the things I'm going to do if I win ... I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money."" Trump replied, ""Well, in England, I can tell you, it's very much different and very much easier. I think it's very unfair when the New York Times can write a story that they know is false, that they virtually told me they know it's false, and I say, why don't you pull the story, and they say, we're not going to do that, because they can't basically be sued. And you (Wallace) can't be sued because can you say anything you want, and that's not fair."" Trump’s comments that media ""basically can’t be sued"" if they ""write a story that they know as false"" struck us as inaccurate, and when we checked with experts in media law, we found that current law already covers the situation Trump describes. (His campaign did not respond to two inquiries for this article.) One immediate problem with Trump’s assertion is that he said a publication can’t be sued for publishing an article known to be false. In reality, there’s no barrier to filing a lawsuit against a media outlet for libel. ""It is relatively easy to sue"" in a case like this, said Lyrissa Lidsky, a University of Florida law professor who has written about media law. Actually winning that lawsuit is a different matter, she added. Still, while libel lawsuits are typically hard to win under United States law, Trump happened to cite the main type of case in which the media outlet would be at serious risk of losing the case -- that is, when it published something defamatory that it knew to be false. Legal experts referred us to the unanimous 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan, which holds that the First Amendment generally protects even false statements about public officials and public figures -- but does not protect statements made with ""actual malice,"" which means that the publication knew they were false and published the material anyway, or that they were published with reckless disregard to whether the material was true or false. ""Under New York Times vs. Sullivan, the type of knowing lie that Mr. Trump describes is not protected by the First Amendment,"" said Leonard M. Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor and an attorney of counsel to the firm Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP. Roy S. Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, agreed that under Sullivan, ""it is possible for a public-figure plaintiff to prove that the false statement was published either with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for its truth."" Of course, the plaintiff in Trump’s example would have to do more than just assert their case -- they would have to prove it in court. ""A public figure or public official must plead and prove actual malice,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. ""If he or she does, then yes, he or she could prevail, absent some other defense."" None of this is easy to do, of course, although someone like Trump would at least have significant resources to pursue such a case if he wished. In the real world, proving actual malice is ""not impossible,"" said David Ardia, who codirects the University of North Carolina’s Center for Media Law and Policy. Ardia added that ""if Trump were to win the presidency and attempted to change libel law to make it more favorable for public figures to win, he'd have to deal with the First Amendment, which provides robust protections for speech that is critical of public officials."" Our ruling Trump said ""the New York Times can write a story that they know is false"" yet ""they can't basically be sued."" United States libel laws for public figures are indeed tilted toward media outlets and against plaintiffs. However, contrary to what Trump said, plaintiffs can always sue if they wish. And they can certainly win in the scenario Trump cited -- if the New York Times knowingly published something false and defamatory. Indeed, the seminal Supreme Court decision on this subject explicitly says that media outlets are not protected from libel suits if they knew something was false but published it anyway. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2016/mar/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-ny-times-cant-be-sued-story-the/

Would Donald Trump be 'neutral' between Israel and its enemies?
","A political action committee supporting Marco Rubio portrays Donald Trump as not being in the Israel fan club. In a TV ad running in Florida, a screen shot shows a man wearing a bandana featuring what appears to be Arabic letters holding a rocket-propelled grenade. Trump ""says he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies,"" says the Conservative Solutions PAC ad. Is that accurate? Trump did make a statement about being ""neutral"" in negotiations between Israel and Palestinians, but the ad omits other statements Trump made in support of Israel. Trump’s position on Israel at a town hall and debate The ad cites the MSNBC town hall with Trump in South Carolina on Feb. 17. (A spokesman for the super PAC cited Trump’s comments at the town hall and at a subsequent debate.) MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, efforts have failed to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other’s right to exist. Trump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator. ""Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don't want to say whose fault is it. I don't think it helps."" About two weeks later at the debate in Houston, Wolf Blitzer asked Trump: ""How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?"" Trump defended his record by saying that he had been grand marshall of the Israeli Day parade a few years ago and received awards from Israel. But he said when negotiating a deal, it wouldn’t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy: ""It doesn't help if I start saying, 'I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,' "" Trump said, adding that he can’t negotiate as well if he takes sides. ""With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel."" Trump’s additional comments about Israel In December, Trump told the Associated Press that he doubted the commitment of Israelis and Palestinians to the peace process. But he suggested the big lift may have to come from Israel. ""A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things,"" Trump said. ""They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm okay with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal."" Trump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a ""huge sticking point"" in talks. The same week, when he spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump praised Israel by saying that the country has already ""given a lot"" but doesn’t get credit for it. He explained his strategy if elected: ""I don’t like to as a deal maker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that. I’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room,"" he said. ""I don’t want one side or the other saying ... I think people know where I stand, okay?"" He said he would want to enter negotiations with a ""clean slate"" and the attitude of ""everybody is even, we love everybody, let’s see if we can do something."" Trump also reminded Jewish Republicans that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013. ""I am a big fan of Israel,"" Trump said in the video endorsement. ""And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel."" During his own campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled the trip after Netanyahu faced backlash after Trump’s comments about Muslims. When asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, ""I haven’t been working too much with the Arab leaders."" Trump’s rhetoric is notable on Israel because it is ""cooler and more detached"" than his GOP rivals, wrote Aaron David Miller, a former adviser to Republican and Democratic secretaries of state on Arab-Israeli negotiations who now works for the Woodrow Wilson Center. But while Trump has said he can be a better negotiator if he appears neutral, he has made several comments that suggest he has closer ties to Israelis than Palestinians. Trump’s spokespersons did not respond for this fact-check. Our ruling A PAC that supports Rubio says Trump ""says he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies."" Trump has said that in order to negotiate between Israelis and Palestinians he can’t take sides. ""Let me be sort of a neutral guy,"" he said at a town hall. But the ad omits that Trump has had ties to Israel for years -- he has called himself ""pro-Israel"" and endorsed Netanyahu’s re-election in 2013. That is a good indication Trump isn’t neutral.

EMILY's List leader correct that Texas home to millions of Latinas, none ever elected to Congress
","EMILY’s List, the national Democratic group that backs ""pro-choice"" women running for office, endorsed former Hidalgo County Democratic Party Chairwoman Dolly Elizondo in the crowded March 2016 primary field for Texas’ 15th Congressional District. Elizondo is one of six Democratic candidates vying to replace retiring Rep. Rubén Hinojosa of Mercedes in the South Texas district. EMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock praised Elizondo’s record, according to a Feb. 1, 2016, Texas Tribune news story, and also suggested a greater significance to Elizondo’s candidacy. ""Texas is home to millions of Latinas,"" Schriock said, ""but the state has never elected a Latina to Congress."" Is all of that so? Latina population To get a sense of Latina Texans, we reached out to the Office of the Texas State Demographer, which by email provided us with a few different data sets. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s one-year survey, Texas’ Hispanic or Latino population in 2014 numbered 10.4 million--with the female Hispanic population that year totaling nearly 5.2 million residents. Put another way, Latinos comprised about 39 percent of the state’s nearly 27 million residents in 2014, per the bureau, with Latinas accounting for 19 percent of residents. The Texas State Data Center’s own most recent population estimate, for 2013, put the female Hispanic population at 5.1 million, and the entire Hispanic population at 10.3 million. It’s worth noting that that number included nearly 1.7 million minors. Upshot: Texas has lately been home to more than 5 million Latinas. Texas representatives To check Texas’ history of congressional representation, we asked EMILY’s List for its backup for Schriock’s statement. A spokeswoman, Rachel Thomas, said by email that Texas through history has elected three women of color to the House and none to the Senate--and each of the elected women were African-American. A web search led us to a searchable history of women in Congress, also cited by Thomas, posted at history.house.gov. That history showed that through 2015, Texas, a state since 1845, had elected seven women to the House, including current Republican Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth and Democratic Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Dallas and Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston. Historically, too, four of Texas’ congresswomen were white, three were black. According to a similar history of Hispanic Americans in Congress on the House website: --Seventeen Hispanic Texans, all men, have won election to Congress including current Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Houston as well as Republican Rep. Bill Flores of Bryan and Democratic Reps. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio, Henry Cuellar of Laredo, Filemon Vela of Brownsville, and Hinojosa, whose seat Elizondo seeks. --The first Latino elected to the House from Texas was Henry B. González of San Antonio, who served from 1961 into early 1999. With 37 years in the House, he also was the longest-serving Hispanic member of Congress. --The first woman to represent Texas was Lera Millard Thomas of Nacogdoches, a Democrat who won 74 percent of the vote in a special election to serve out nine months remaining in her husband Albert Richard Thomas’ term upon his death in 1966. The first woman of color to represent Texas was Houston’s Barbara Jordan, who was elected to the House in 1973 with 81 percent of the vote and served until 1979. --Nationally, 107 Latinos and 313 women have served in Congress, counting 11 Latinas. --The 11 Latinas to have served in Congress -- all in the House: Washington Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, Florida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, New Mexico Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham, New York Democrat Nydia M. Velázquez, and California Democrats Grace Flores Napolitano, Gloria Negrette McLeod, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Loretta Sanchez, Linda T. Sánchez, Hilda L. Solis and Norma Judith Torres. All except McLeod and Solis are currently serving in the House. Our ruling EMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock said: ""Texas is home to millions of Latinas, but the state has never elected a Latina to Congress."" Of late, more than 5 million Latinas live in Texas, whose voters have historically sent 17 Hispanic men to Congress including one to the Senate--but no Latinas. We rate this claim True.

Nevada Rep. Joe Heck says 'no evidence' Guantanamo used as terrorist 'recruiting tool'
","It’s not entirely clear whether terrorists really care about the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center. Despite President Barack Obama’s new plan to close the facility, Republicans are promising to block the move under the rationale that none of the 91 detainees should be moved to the United States. But Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, a U.S. Senate candidate, went further than most and said terrorist groups don’t use Guantanamo at all in recruitment efforts. ""There is no evidence to support the claim that Guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool or affecting relations with allies, both of which are being used to advance the president’s flawed foreign policy goals,"" Heck said in a statement. Heck saying there’s ""no evidence"" that terrorist groups use the site as a ""recruiting tool"" directly contradicts one of the president’s core arguments for closing the detention center, which made us wonder — do groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda use Guantanamo in any fashion to draw in potential terrorists? Terrorist groups often mention Guantanamo in their propaganda and publications, but it’s less clear whether or not the site is used as a ""recruiting tool"" for potential jihadists. U.S. defense officials believe it’s ""no coincidence"" that ISIS forced hostages featured in brutal execution videos wear orange jumpsuits, which defense official Brian McKeon says is ""believed by many to be the symbol of the Guantanamo detention facility."" And U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, who was murdered by ISIS in September 2014, mentioned Obama’s failure to close the site in seemingly prepared remarks in his execution video. Guantanamo mentions aren’t limited to video. Al-Qaeda’s English-language magazine ""Inspire"" contains a handful of references to the detention center, according to Foundation for the Defense of Democracies senior fellow Thomas Joscelyn. But Joscelyn said Guantanamo tends to be referenced only in passing, like in a 2010 article by Osama bin Laden that’s mostly critical of climate change and capitalism. ""I'm finding, once again, that it is infrequently mentioned (especially when compared to other themes) and the regular recruiting messages I've catalogued have nothing to do with Guantanamo,"" he said in an email. Researchers question the importance that terrorist groups like ISIS place on Guantanamo, especially since the facility stopped taking in new detainees in 2008. Rather, the site tends to be lumped in with prisoner torture controversies at the Abu Ghraib and Bagram detention centers, which fades in prominence given new issues and a complex, evolving situation in the Middle East. Brookings Institution researchers reviewed English-language publications from al-Qaeda affiliates and ISIS and found that terrorist groups mention the detention center much less frequently than in the throes of the Iraq War, and call Guantanamo at most a ""supporting argument"" to an overarching narrative. ""And, while Guantanamo at times provides another instance of this crusade or serves as a counterpoint to U.S. claims of benevolence, the narrative of jihadi propaganda operates at a level far higher than that of any single facility in Cuba,"" the authors wrote in a post on the Lawfare blog. Author and nonresident Brookings fellow J.M. Berger said that things like expanded use of drones loom much larger than continuing operations at Guantanamo. ""U.S. counterterrorism action, particularly drone strikes, are arguably much more important to recruitment and definitely more important to propaganda, but no one talks about shutting those down,"" he said in an email. A 2010 United States Institute of Peace report found that young men who are drawn to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda join more because it ""removes the doubt that young men feel about their place in the world, replacing it with purpose and direction."" Berger said recruiters can use Guantanamo as a ""wedge issue"" to further radicalize potential members, but there’s no hard evidence that it’s used as a primary recruiting tool. Joscelyn, who tracks mentions of Guantanamo in English-language al-Qaeda publications, says there’s a key difference between references and recruitment of future terrorists. ""It is possible that some jihadist somewhere was influenced in some way by Guantanamo,"" he said in an email. ""But the people who are arguing that it is being used as a recruiting tool, mainly President Obama and his administration, have not provided any evidence that it is explicitly being used as a recruiting tool (as opposed to passing mentions in propaganda)."" Again, time dilutes the potency of Guantanamo as a rallying cry against American foreign policy, especially given Obama’s opposition to the site over the past seven years. ""It’s not that great of an anti-U.S. message when our own president campaigned on closing it down,"" Northeastern University political science professor Max Abrahms said. Our ruling Heck said that there’s ""no evidence"" that terrorists use Guantanamo as a ""recruiting tool."" Terrorist groups routinely mention the detention site in both written and videotaped propaganda, but the argument is much murkier when it comes to the site’s effectiveness as a ""recruiting tool."" However, Heck saying blankly that there’s ""no evidence"" the site is used by terrorist groups isn’t entirely accurate.

Those numbers clearly mean a lot to management because on the hospital’s website, right under its name, is the statement ""The world’s third-biggest hospital, in South Africa."" That’s not quite right, according to our colleagues at Africa Check. Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital says it trails only West China Hospital, affiliated with Sichuan University in the city of Chengdu, with about 4,300 beds, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, which lists about 9,000 beds.

"['Arizona', 'Education', 'John McCain']","
Is Common Core no more?
","President Barack Obama signed sweeping education reform into law in December that gives states more freedom to develop their own K-12 education standards. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, highlighted this bipartisan legislation as a 2015 accomplishment in a Jan. 4 interview with the Daily Courier in Prescott. The Every Student Succeeds Act replaces the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Unlike No Child Left Behind, the new law singles out the Common Core State Standards. Common Core refers to guidelines in English and math that aim to make children more prepared for college, borne out of suggestions from education officials and nonprofit groups across the country starting in 2009. States were never required to use Common Core standards, but having standards in place earned states points for a share of federal dollars in the Obama administration’s Race to the Top grants. Although, some states received funding without adopting Common Core. Common Core has become politically unpopular among conservatives in recent years, with leaders from Wisconsin to Florida to Arizona trying to move away from them. In the interview, McCain argued that the new law nixes Common Core. ""It did away basically with Common Core,"" McCain is quoted as saying of the Every Student Succeeds Act in the Daily Courier article. Is Common Core really no more? We decided to test McCain’s claim. Local control The Every Student Succeeds Act mentions Common Core several times. The part McCain is talking about reads: ""Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a State from withdrawing from the Common Core State Standards or from otherwise revising their standards."" In other words, the law says states can choose whatever standards they seek fit. McCain spokeswoman Julie Tarallo pointed this out when we asked about McCain’s remarks, noting that ""states are now free to decide what academic standards they will maintain."" But is that so different from what they could do before? U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman Jo Ann Webb said that Common Core was never a federal mandate. States did so voluntarily, as we’ve reported before. Still, part of the criteria for Obama’s Race to the Top program was states having college readiness standards such as Common Core. States were free to adopt their own standards, but they had to prove those standards prepared students for college and work to get a share of billions in federal funding. Race to the Top ended last year. The Every Student Succeeds Act makes it clear that the federal government cannot mandate standards such as Common Core, though Common Core would still be acceptable. The law also prohibits the government, through grants, contracts or other agreements, from taking any action against a state that ""exercises its rights"" to choose its own standards. Arizona’s State Board of Education took a symbolic vote on Common Core in October 2015, repealing its standards in a 6-2 decision. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas, who oversees K-12 education across the state, said after the vote that Arizona is smart enough to ""control the education of our own children."" More than three months later, department spokesman Charles Tack said the state is still in the process of developing its own standards. Arizona still has Common Core in place for this school year. We asked other education experts about the senior senator’s statement. Michael Petrilli is the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a Washington D.C.-based education policy think tank. He said the new law allows states to control their own education policies, but it doesn’t exactly do away with Common Core. ""He (McCain) was imprecise,"" Petrilli said. ""It would have been to correct to say that the act eliminates any relationship between Common Core and the federal government, and that’s important."" Gerard Robinson, the former education commissioner of Florida and an education policy fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said McCain is speaking to the fact that the Every Student Succeeds Act allows states to have more ""decision-making over education."" Cornell University associate professor John Sipple, who specializes in education policy, said McCain’s statement is misleading, but he echoed similar comments about choice. ""States are on their own. They’re welcome to choose the Common Core, they’re welcome to choose another opportunity,"" Sipple said. More than 40 states currently have Common Core State Standards. However, a number of states are revising their education standards. For example, Kansas, West Virginia and Alabama all have bills in their legislatures to repeal Common Core. Our ruling McCain said the Every Student Succeeds Act ""did away basically with Common Core."" The Every Student Succeeds Act does not do away with Common Core. Common Core still exists in states throughout the country. A state can still decide whether or not they want to implement those standards, or create their own. The new law prevents the federal government from mandating what a state decides to do with its specific education policies, such as requiring Common Core. The government did not, however, require states to adopt Common Core before this law. For oversimplifying complex education policy, we rate McCain’s claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/feb/29/john-mccain/common-core-no-more/

""Here’s something else I want everybody here to know: Japanese are very hard-working people,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said. ""We work longer hours than any people in the industrialized world, including the Japanese."" We asked Warren Gunnels, the policy director for the Sanders campaign, for the basis of the candidate’s statement. He pointed us to a January post by a personal finance blog, 20somethingfinance, which said the U.S. is ""the most overworked developed nation in the world."" The post said that the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency that tracks global workforce trends, has found that U.S. workers on average work more hours than the Japanese, French and British. But those are only three developed countries. We found a list from the Central Intelligence Agency and another from the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund - better known as UNICEF - showing there’s about three dozen industrialized nations. Most of those countries are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 democratic nations - almost all with advanced economies - seeking to improve trade relations. The OECD keeps data on the average yearly hours put in by workers in each of its member countries. The statistics show that in 2014, the latest year available, the average U.S. worker toiled 1,789 hours on the job, higher than the average of 1,770 hours among all the countries in the OECD. Employees in Japan, whom Sanders mentioned in his remarks, put in an average 1,729 hours a year - or 60 hours less than their American counterparts. Workers in many other nations, including all of the other members of the G-7 major developed countries of Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany, also worked fewer hours than Americans. But it’s clear there is a group of industrialized countries where workers put in greater average hours than those in the U.S. They are: •Greece, 2,042 hours worked; •Iceland, 1,864 hours; •Portugal, 1,857 hours; •Israel, 1,853 hours; and •Ireland, 1,821 hours. Workers in Hungary, South Korea, Poland and Turkey also logged more hours than U.S. employees. Some international organizations list those four countries as industrialized, while others do not. Let’s get back to Sanders, who long has maintained that most Americans are putting in longer hours as part of his argument that the nation’s economic system is tilted to benefit the very wealthy. PolitiFact National last fact-checked a Sanders statement on working hours in March 2011 and gave a False rating to the senator’s claim that Americans ""now work the longest hours of any people around the world."" We should note that Sanders made a narrower statement in Norfolk, where he limited his comparison of American workers to those from other industrialized nations. Our ruling Sanders said, ""We work longer hours than any people in the industrialized world, including the Japanese."" No doubt, American workers put in more hours than their cohorts in most of the roughly three dozen industrialized nations. But Sanders goes too far in putting the U.S. as No. 1. Depending on whose list of developed nations you use, there are at least five, and as many as nine, countries with workers spending more time on the job than those in the U.S. We rate Sanders’ statement Mostly False.

Fact-checking Donald Trump's claims about Trump University
","Republican frontrunner Donald Trump’s challengers have called him many things; add to that list the charge from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that Trump is a con man. Rubio's recent attacks have focused on allegations of false marketing by Trump University. It wasn’t a real university -- and had to change its name to Trump Entrepreneur Institute because of that. It was largely a seminar program that promised to teach its students the real estate secrets that turned Trump into a billionaire. With some participants paying as much as $35,000, the project drew investigations and lawsuits in at least three states. The university registered as a private company in New York in October 2004 and largely shut down by 2011. When NBC host Chuck Todd raised issues with the university, Trump defended the program, noting that nearly all the students thought it was ""great."" ""They signed these documents saying, they rated the course, 98 percent approval rating and high marks,"" Trump said on Meet the Press on Feb. 28, 2016. And he added, ""We have an A from the Better Business Bureau."" HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER We went to the Better Business Bureau website and saw that as of today, the Trump Entrepreneur Institute has no rating. The website explained, ""This business has no rating because BBB has information indicating it is out of business."" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told us, ""When the school was operational it was rated A."" We asked Hicks to document that rating and didn’t hear back. Katherine Hutt, director of communications for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, said that as a matter of policy, they don’t provide any ratings from previous years. But the organization issued a statement that ""Over the years, the company’s BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-."" We don’t know when the bureau might have given Trump University a top grade, but based on the Internet Archive, the last time the Better Business Bureau gave the university any rating at all was 2010, when it give it a D-minus. That assessment showed up in plenty of news articles. That year, the New York Daily News reported that ""the Better Business Bureau in January slapped a D-minus rating on Trump U., a rating now under review after Trump U. objected."" CBS News said the same thing in an April 21, 2010, article. And  in May, 2011, the New York Times wrote ""The Better Business Bureau gave the school a D-minus for 2010, its second-lowest grade, after receiving 23 complaints."" The Washington Post had the same information in May 2011 when it reported that the New York State Attorney General was investigating the Trump Entrepreneur Institute. The Attorney General’s Office did file charges but stumbled on the grounds that the statute of limitations had passed.  The matter is under appeal. Under the new name Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, ratings ranged from C to B between 2012 and 2014. We found no ratings at all for the past two years. Our ruling Trump said about his entrepreneur institute that ""we have an ‘A’ from the Better Business Bureau."" Literally speaking, that is inaccurate. The Better Business Bureau gives the program no rating today because it’s no longer a going concern. Trump University had an A at some point. The Better Business Bureau doesn't release details of its past ratings, but it did say Trump's program had ratings that ranged from A+ to D-. What we do know, from several published reports and archived Web pages, is that the university had a D in 2010 and under its new name, had ratings ranging from C to B, with no ratings after March 2014. Trump’s claim is literally wrong and also ignores the university’s lower Better Business Bureau scores. We rate it False.

Minutes after Hassan was sworn in as New Hampshire’s 81st governor, she took state legislators and university administrators to task for high tuition costs, which do little but chase students out of state, she said.

""Our population is aging, yet we pursue policies that are driving our young people out of the state,"" Hassan said during her Jan 3. inauguration speech. ""We have the fourth highest in-state tuition for public universities in the country, and too many of our talented students pursue a college education elsewhere.""

In New Hampshire, as in the rest of the country, tuition costs have risen dramatically in recent years. But are they really among the nation’s highest? We decided to do the homework.

To start, here’s a quick overview of the New Hampshire university system.

In total, the state houses four public, four-year schools -- the University of New Hampshire, Keene State College, Plymouth State University and Granite State College. Together, the schools served 35,200 students in 2012 at 14 campuses across the state, according to the University System of New Hampshire’s 2012 Annual Report.

Tuition varies at each school, and often at each campus. So, we approached Hassan’s office to determine which she referred to.

As expected, Hassan’s representatives pointed us to the system’s flagship school,UNH, which is by far the state’s largest school.

For the 2012-13 school year, UNH administrators are charging $16,422 per year for state residents on the Durham campus, according to the University website.

Officials at the U.S. Department of Education, which tracks tuition costs through its College Affordability and Transparency Center, have not yet analyzed the 2012 data to determine the most costly schools.

But this summer they did release rankings based on 2010-11 data, and, according to their findings, UNH did charge one of the nation’s highest in-state tuition.

That year, the school charged $13,672 for in-state students. That rate, which includes some required fees, trailed only Pennsylvania State University’s University Park campus ($15,250), the University of Pittsburgh ($14,936) and the University of Vermont ($14,066).

Considering room and board, among other costs, UNH’s average net price jumped to $17,234 for in-state students. That figure, which considers the average amount of state and federal grants and scholarships, was good for 18th highest among public universities in 2010-11, according to the federal data.

But, for this piece, we’re concerned with tuition rates, not total costs.

New Hampshire’s other schools rated as more affordable. Neither Keene State College ($10,140 tuition for in-state students), Plymouth State University ($9,906) or Granite State College ($6,435) ranked among the 30 most expensive traditional, four-year schools.

In her claim, however, Hassan didn’t specify four-year schools. So, we expanded our research to include community colleges and other public, two-year schools. Even then, UNH still ranked fifth nationally for highest tuition. Only the Michigan Career and Technical Institute ($16,200) placed above it.

(As a side note, all seven of New Hampshire’s community colleges ranked among the top 12 most expensive two-year schools in 2010-11, ranging from $6,432 to $7,123 for in-state tuition.)

Costs at most of the schools have moved since the 2010-11 ratings. Last year, as New Hampshire legislators cut state funding by a record 49 percent, UNH officials raised in-state tuition more than 11 percent to $15,250, which pushed it past the University of Vermont on the list of most expensive schools. And this year, tuition rose again, this time reaching $16,422, according to university records.

Looking forward, administrators  have pledged to freeze tuition costs if state lawmakers agree to restore the funding cuts from previous years.

""We work continuously to reduce costs and increase non-tuition revenue streams,"" Erika Mantz, a university spokeswoman, said this week. ""These accomplishments aside, we know there is still a lot of work to be done. Access and affordability remain central priorities.""

Our ruling

Data for the 2011-12 or 2012-13 school years isn’t available yet. But, according to the U.S. Department of Education, which compares tuition rates across the country, the University of New Hampshire was one of the nation’s most expensive schools in 2010-11 for in-state students.

The state’s other public schools -- Granite State College, Keene State College and Plymouth State University -- didn’t make the national list. But UNH’s $13,672 tuition placed fourth at the time, trailing only Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Vermont.

Lloyd Doggett says Republicans cost country more than $1 billion and slowed economy in delaying 2011 debt-ceiling hike
","
U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett disputes the notion that a partial government shutdown might be needed to make President Barack Obama negotiate spending cuts and long-term changes affecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

The Austin Democrat, reacting to U.S. Sen. John Cornyn’s Jan. 3, 2012, Houston Chronicle commentary, agreed that fiscal sanity matters but, Doggett wrote on Facebook, ""that sanity can hardly be realized by jeopardizing the full faith and credit of the United States.""

His punch line: ""The last time Republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our country’s bills were paid cost us more than $1 billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery.""

Republicans such as Cornyn slammed the country so?

By email, Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us Doggett was referring to resistance by Republicans in 2011 to raising the debt ceiling. At the time, Dohl said, the Republicans ""threatened not to raise the country’s borrowing limit unless lawmakers reduced the deficit.""

That year, Republicans in Congress and the Obama administration unsuccessfully hunted a long-term agreement reducing the debt and budget deficits. Congress raised the debt ceiling in August, enabling the government to pay its obligations, after the Treasury had said action was needed by mid-May.

In August 2011, we rated as Half True a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that record debt and Obama’s ""refusal to control spending led to our nation's credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history.""

The nation’s debt level was a major factor for rating agencies downgrading the country’s ratings. But federal spending also had increased under President George W. Bush. Perry’s claim also overlooked the prime factor cited  for Standard & Poor's downgrade--political divisiveness sapping confidence the nation would soon reach consensus on the debt issue.

Later that year, Congress established a schedule for across-the-board budget cuts or ""sequestration,"" though in December 2012, Congress put off such results a few months amid speculation there would be fresh pushes for alternative approaches.

It’s not unusual for members of one party or the other to oppose a hike in the debt ceiling. Still, the Treasury says, Congress has acted 78 times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit–49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents.

Congress had so much trouble passing increases in the debt ceiling in the late 1980s, according to a news article in the Austin American-Statesman on July 31, 2012, that the House adopted a rule allowing the ceiling to be raised without a vote. ""That rule was in effect for years,"" the story says. ""The problem is always harder when government is divided between the two parties.""

So it was that after the 2010 elections, Republicans newly controlled the U.S. House while Democrats maintained a Senate majority.

And did the 2011 events impose the costs declared by Doggett?

We broke his claim into two parts--the proclaimed interest costs and the impact on the economic recovery--before turning to whether one party should be blamed. 
Interest costs

Dohl said the 2011 delay forced the government to pay additional borrowing costs, according to a July 23, 2012, report from the Government Accountability Office, the audit and investigative arm of Congress. That report says: ""Delays in raising the debt limit can create uncertainty in the Treasury market and lead to higher Treasury borrowing costs. GAO estimated that delays in raising the debt limit in 2011 led to an increase in Treasury’s borrowing costs of about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011,"" which ran through September 2011.

The agency reached that estimate by comparing interest rates on private securities to rates for those issued by the government from January 2011, when the Treasury initially warned of the need to raise the ceiling, to August 2011, when the ceiling was raised. The ""debt limit event led to a premium on Treasury securities with maturities of 2 years or more,"" the report says, ""while Treasury securities with shorter maturities either experienced no change or became slightly less costly relative to private securities.""

Beyond the $1.3 billion in identified costs, the report says, are ""multi-year effects on increased costs for Treasury securities that will remain outstanding after fiscal year 2011.""  Dohl pointed out that the Bipartisan Policy Center, which seeks to develop bipartisan consensus on government policy, applied GAO’s research to conclude that the additional borrowing costs would total $18.9 billion over 10 years.

We queried Washington observers about the report.

Daniel J. Mitchell of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute said by email that the GAO identified an unimpressive ""ripple (not even a tempest, when you compare to overall debt numbers) in the teacup."" The total federal debt, $16.4 trillion as of Jan. 22, 2013, went from $14 trillion to $14.6 trillion as Congress tussled over debt and deficit issues in 2011.

Some suggested the GAO analysis was simplistic, ignoring other factors behind borrowing costs. The report itself acknowledges its researchers could not capture every possible economic and financial factor. 
Economic impact

And did the delayed decision slow the economic recovery?

Dohl, of Doggett’s office, pointed out a July 8, 2011, CNN news report stating the economy had gained a disappointing 18,000 jobs the previous month. CNN also said: ""The main culprit economists are point(ing) to: uncertainty. Businesses are hesitant to hire given uncertainty surrounding federal spending cuts and tax policy, as Congress still has yet to reach an agreement on the debt ceiling and long-term measures for trimming the nation's deficit,"" its report said.

But, the report said, other factors could have affected the job numbers.

""There isn't a single silver bullet--there are a number of factors coming together,"" John Silvia, chief economist for Wells Fargo, told CNN. ""The tsunami, floods, higher gas prices, and the stalemate in Washington all create a lot of uncertainty.""

New York University economist Lawrence White told us by email: ""That we have a soft economy that has taken too long to recover is a well-accepted fact. But the reasons are far more complex than the debt-ceiling crisis of August 2011.""

Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, sounded a similar note, saying the main story in the economy over that period was the ending of federal stimulus aid approved in 2009. ""If the debt standoff added to this, it is hard to see through what channel,"" Baker said. ""There was no noticeable fall-off in either consumer spending or investment demand."" 
Who done it? 
Finally, were Republicans to blame? 
To our inquiry, Dohl noted a July 14, 2011, National Public Radio news report saying that as many as half of House Republicans were resistant to raising the ceiling. The report quoted several Republican members dismissive of White House pressure to raise the ceiling by early August 2011, though it also said that GOP leaders wanted the ceiling raised. The report featured House Speaker John Boehner telling Fox News: ""Missing August 2 could spook the market and you could have a real catastrophe. Nobody wants that to happen."" 
The GAO report singles out neither party for blame, focusing on Treasury actions. By telephone, Tom McCool of the agency’s Center for Economics said the agency never would single out a party. ""We’re not assigning blame to anybody for what happened,"" McCool said. 
Our observers divided over whether it’s fair to peg Republicans alone for the delayed action.

‘We have these conflicts,"" Mitchell said, ""because there are different visions of what to do. To (the) extent these different visions cause a clash on matters such as the debt limit, any potential fallout is, by definition, the fault of both. My main point is that it is ridiculous to give either party more than 50 (percent) of the blame. It takes two to tango in these fights.""

White said deciding who’s to blame is an eye-of-the-beholder action.

Baker, though, cautioned against assigning equal blame. His point: ""It is new to use the debt ceiling as a tool to extract major budget concessions,"" he emailed. ""The Dems had used it to score a few political points as I recall in 2007 (probably in the '80s as well) but they never came anywhere close to a default, nor did they get budgetary changes. It is really only the Republicans who have used it for this purpose. That doesn't make it wrong,"" he added. ""It's just not a game that both parties have played equally.""

According to a Washington Post news account published Aug. 1, 2011, the House vote stemming the debt-ceiling standoff drew the support of more than two thirds of House Republicans as Democrats—some angry that Obama had retreated from a demand for higher taxes—divided on the plan, which was described as cutting at least $2.1 trillion from projected borrowing over a decade. 
Our ruling

Doggett said ""the last time Republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our country’s bills were paid cost us more than $1 billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery.""

The government took on more than $1.3 billion in added interest during the delay period, the GAO estimates.

However, it’s not clear the delay slowed the economic recovery. And while it seems to us that Republican desires for spending cuts greatly explain the delayed action, it’s also correct that GOP leaders wanted the ceiling raised while some House Democrats voted against the measure raising the ceiling.

Anti-gun group misfires in attack on Barrow
","
The war over gun control is heating up.

Attacks from both sides have been almost continuous since a deranged gunman killed 26 people -- mostly children -- at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. The furor intensified last week after President Barack Obama unveiled a package of legislative proposals and executive orders targeting gun violence.

A day after Obama’s announcement, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence got into the fray by attacking a Georgia Democratic congressman on his ties to the National Rifle Association and his opposition to Obama’s gun legislation. The coalition uses U.S. Rep John Barrow’s own 2012 campaign commercial in an attack on him and the NRA.

The Washington-based coalition of 48 religious organizations, lobbyist groups and other associations refers to itself as seeking ""to secure freedom from gun violence through research, strategic engagement and effective policy advocacy. ""

Barrow’s original ad, ""Nobody,"" features him brandishing guns owned and used by his grandfather and father. He used it in his last campaign, when Republicans considered his seat vulnerable. Barrow also touts his endorsement from the NRA in the ad. He ends the spot with the comments, ""I approved this message because these are my guns now, and ain’t nobody gon’ take ‘em away.""

The coalition’s video intersperses selective parts of Barrow’s original ad (and comments) with horrific images and news voiceovers from the Newtown massacre. As the video ends, audio from news reports of the names and ages of some of the children killed at Newtown provide a voiceover for the text, ""Shame on you, Congressman John Barrow. ... Tell Congressman John Barrow to reject NRA blood money.""

The coalition put out a news release with the video. In the release, the coalition’s executive director, Josh Horwitz, says that Barrow ""has decided to put his love of the NRA above his concern for his fellow Americans."" The group noted that during Barrow’s eight-year congressional career, he has received $27,250 in campaign contributions from the NRA. (The coalition has used similar pressure tactics against U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who also criticized Obama’s gun-control policies.)

Further examination reveals that the anti-gun group has left out key parts of Barrow’s statements from the original ad. For example, Barrow begins the ad by saying: ""I’m John Barrow, and long before I was born my grandfather used this little Smith and Wesson here to help stop a lynching."" But the coalition ad leaves off the words ""to help stop a lynching.""

Barrow’s ad also says: ""my father always had this rifle real handy just to keep us safe."" But the coalition ad leaves off ""just to keep us safe."" The coalition ad also leaves out a key line Barrow says in his ad: ""That’s why I support the Second Amendment.""

The gun-control group said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia that it stands by the ad. The statement said the coalition was ""disturbed to see Congressman Barrow double down on his support of the NRA in the wake of the tragedy at Newtown.""

The coalition’s goal was to highlight Barrow’s legislative record on guns and his strong ties to the NRA, said Ladd Everitt, the coalition’s communications director. Everitt characterized Barrow’s original ad as insulting to the constituents in his district.

Everitt said his group couldn’t find evidence to prove Barrow’s grandfather helped quell an attempted lynching. Barrow’s ad seemed to indicate that it was white armed citizens who vindicated the civil rights of black citizens in the Deep South, and ""that narrative of history is a bogus one,"" Everitt said.

Barrow’s original ""Nobody"" ad was rolled out in October during a highly scrutinized re-election campaign for the conservative east Georgia district. Barrow, the last white Democrat in the U.S. House from the Deep South, is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate, mostly Southern, Democrats that often breaks with the party leadership.

The coalition first took note of Barrow last year when he was one of a handful of House Democrats to vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for failing to turn over documents in the botched Fast and Furious gun-tracking operation, Everitt said. The coalition noted that several members of Congress who supported the contempt vote had received campaign contributions from the NRA, including Barrow.

The group also disagreed with his comments about Obama’s gun-safety package. ""I strongly disagree with proposals that would deny law-abiding citizens their Second Amendment rights,"" Barrow said in part about Obama’s proposals. The ad’s use of the Newtown images implies that his pro-gun stance is directly related to the Newtown massacre. For his part, Barrow posted a short Facebook message on the same day of the shooting telling his followers that he was ""shocked by the news"" and asking for prayer for the victims and their families.

Barrow declined to comment on the coalition’s ad. But that’s not surprising, said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia.

"" I think (Barrow) probably correctly senses that in that district being endorsed by the NRA is probably an advantage,"" Bullock said. ""For a Blue Dog to survive, they have to distinguish themselves from the rest of the Democratic Party. He’ll probably say, ‘yes, a liberal group is saying that I’m tied to the NRA.’ "" Being attacked could actually help him win over some voters, Bullock said.

So what to make of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence’s ad?

The group was attempting to put pressure on pro-gun Democrats critical of the president’s gun-control policies. It took a Barrow campaign ad, doctored the video by splicing in scenes and sounds from the Newtown mass shooting and adding a ""shame on you"" tagline.

Even more egregious, the coalition chose to selectively edit Barrow’s original statements, leaving out key elements that helped explain the congressman’s stance on gun rights. By leaving those parts out, the coalition changes Barrow’s central message supporting gun ownership for protection and self-defense.

The group attempted to target Barrow with a highly emotional ad. But it comes across as the Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight.

The coalition gets our lowest rating on this one. Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2013/jan/25/coalition-stop-gun-violence/anti-gun-group-misfires-attack-barrow/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Ron DeSantis']","
Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis says ‘Obamacare’ tax is cheaper than insurance
","
Following President Barack Obama’s second inaugural address, three freshmen Republican members of Congress appeared on Greta Van Susteren’s Fox News show to offer their reactions.

The panel focused on the need to address the nation’s debt problem, but the discussion also turned to a favorite Republican point of attack: Obamacare.

Ron DeSantis, who represents northeast Florida including St. Augustine, Daytona Beach, and areas near Jacksonville, predicted that the health care law will put negative pressure on the insurance market.

""It's structured in a way I think is going to end up failing,"" DeSantis said. ""The tax that they put on you to buy insurance is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance, so I think a lot of people are going to pay the tax and that's going to destabilize the insurance market. And I think you will see problems with increased costs.""

We can’t fact-check DeSantis’ prediction, but we were interested in DeSantis’ claim that the tax penalty imposed by the law is less than the cost of insurance. We decided to check it out.

What’s in the law

The law’s individual mandate requires most adults in the U.S. to carry insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty. The tax is either a specific amount or a percentage of income, whichever is greater, and it’s phased in over time. Here is how the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation summarizes it:

""Those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5 percent of household income. The penalty will be phased-in according to the following schedule: $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, and $695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1 percent of taxable income in 2014, 2 percent of taxable income in 2015, and 2.5 percent of taxable income in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment.""

At most middle-income levels, the percentage of income is greater than the flat fee. Here are a few examples of what the tax would cost:

An individual with $30,000 annual income would pay a $300 penalty in 2014, $600 in 2015 and $750 in 2016.

An individual with $50,000 annual income would pay a $500 penalty in 2014, $1,000 in 2015 and $1,250 in 2016.

An individual earning $100,000 a year would pay a $1,000 penalty in 2014, $2,000 in 2015 and $2,500 in 2016.

Married couples would pay double those amounts since the penalties are assessed per person. Families will eventually pay up to $2,085, or 2.5 percent of household income, by 2016. After 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment.

The cost of insurance

The health care law also establishes insurance exchanges, essentially marketplaces in each state where people can purchase health insurance.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the national average annual premium in an Exchange in 2016 would be about $5,000 for an individual and about $12,000 for a family for the lowest-cost coverage that will be available.

DeSantis’ office pointed us to another survey which said employer-sponsored insurance premiums rose to an average of $5,615 in 2012 for individuals and $15,745 for family coverage, though those figures do not represent what employees themselves paid toward their plans in the form of premiums.

So it’s clear that even for those making high incomes -- the penalty in 2016 on a $200,000 income would be $4,500 -- the overall cost of insurance is greater than the tax.

""The point Congressman DeSantis was making is that under Obamacare the penalty intended to force you to buy health insurance is less expensive than the average annual premium. In which case, many individuals may opt to pay the penalty instead of purchasing insurance in the marketplace,"" DeSantis’ communications director, Amy Graham, told PolitiFact in an email.

Other views

We talked to two experts for their take on DeSantis’ claim. They agreed that dollar-for-dollar, the tax is less than the cost of insurance.

But the matter is about more than just the math.

""People buy health insurance for stability, making sure they aren’t bankrupted by a car accident or heart attack,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor who studies health policy at Washington and Lee School of Law who supports the law. ""For a lot of those people they’re going to decide they’d rather pay a bit more for insurance and have something than pay the penalty and be uninsured.""

Clint Stretch, a tax attorney in Washington, also pointed out that the penalty is not meant to be a better deal than health insurance. It’s meant to nudge the uninsured toward buying coverage.

""Assume an individual could get coverage for $3,000 or not get it and suffer a $1,000 penalty. All else being equal, the law has made the decision to buy insurance a $2,000 decision rather than a $3,000 decision,"" Stretch said in an email. ""In effect the taxpayer’s choice is pay the Treasury or pay the insurance company – if they pay the Treasury they get no benefit.""

Jost added that many people who are subject to the penalty will benefit from other functions of the health care law, such as Medicaid, the health program for the poor that is expanded under Obamacare. There are also tax credits to help people pay for premiums and existing employer-sponsored plans.

""If it were just a question of do I pay $2,000 (or insurance) or $700 (in a tax penalty), yeah that’s pretty much a no brainer,"" Jost said. ""But on the other hand if I can get insurance through my employer for $200 a month and the alternative is not to do that and pay the penalty, it becomes a closer calculation.""

Our ruling

DeSantis said that the tax penalty in the health reform law ""is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance.""

Desantis is correct that health insurance premiums far exceed the penalties Obamacare imposes for not carrying insurance, even on high incomes. We think it’s valid to note that several provisions in the health law bring the dollar amounts closer together to give people an incentive to buy coverage. That’s also the purpose of the tax penalty -- to urge people to get insurance.

But DeSantis is right in the straightforward cost comparison. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/24/ron-desantis/desantis-says-obamacare-tax-cheaper-insurance/
"['Candidate Biography', 'China', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
Terry McAuliffe says Virginia officials ""decided not to bid"" on his electric automobile plant
","
Terry McAuliffe, the only Democrat running for governor this year, is pledging to use his experience as an entrepreneur to create jobs in Virginia.

At a news conference on Dec. 5, he was asked why he decided to locate the manufacturing plant of the electric car company he bought in 2009 in Mississippi instead of Virginia. The company, GreenTech Automotive, has promised to bring at least 1,500 jobs to Mississippi.

McAuliffe replied that he wanted to bring the factory and jobs to the Old Dominion, but officials at the Virginia Economic Development Partnership -- the state’s business recruitment agency -- weren’t interested.

""They decided they didn’t want to bid on it,"" he said.

""We had sites, we had meetings and they chose that they weren’t going to bid on it,"" McAuliffe, chairman of GreenTech Automotive, added. ""I have to go where obviously they’re going to put incentives, but the only incentives are if I create jobs, then I get incentives.""

McAuliffe said Virginia has not been aggressive in recruiting large manufacturers in recent years. ""They’ve gone to all of our Southern neighbors. Hundreds of thousands have been created. I think its been a decision (by Virginia) not to go after these types of manufacturing facilities. I’ve always said we should go after these manufacturing plants. You cannot drive through Southside and Southwest Virginia and see those empty furniture and textile (plants) and not say we need manufacturing jobs.""

McAuliffe’s criticism of Virginia’s economic development efforts is likely to become an issue in this fall’s election. So we decided to see whether he is accurate in claiming that VEDP rejected GreenTech’s efforts to locate its car plant in Virginia.

We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for evidence supporting the candidate’s claim and received this email reply from spokesman Josh Schwerin: ""As Terry said, although GreenTech supplied extensive documentation to support their project, VEDP repeatedly made clear in meetings and correspondence that they did not want to pursue this project.""

The campaign declined to provide additional comments or proof.

So we turned to VEDP. The agency, complying with our request under the Freedom of Information Act, furnished hundreds of pages of emails and documents detailing its dealings with GreenTech. Specific information GreenTech furnished about the cost of the plant, investors, key employees, product information and payroll estimates were blacked out.

The documents and emails trace Virginia’s communications with GreenTech under the two most recent  governors, Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Bob McDonnell. They show that economic development officials were interested but wary about GreenTech’s ability to carry out the project. GreenTech deepened those concerns by not responding to some of the state’s questions, according to the emails.

The story begins in 2009. McAuliffe lost a three-way Democratic primary for governor that spring. Shortly afterwards, he bought a Chinese electric car company, moved its headquarters to Northern Virginia and tried to set up a manufacturing base in the United States.

That August, GreenTech officials approached the Kaine administration about opening a car plant in Virginia. After that point, there were many emails between Michael Lehmkuhler, vice president for business attraction at VEDP, and Gary Tang, GreenTech’s chief operations officer. 
On Sept. 11 and Sept. 14, 2009, Lehmkuhler asked a series of ""standard diligence questions"" about the company’s business plan. Tang replied on Sept. 16 -- his answers were heavily redacted -- and six days later, officials from VEDP and GreenTech toured a potential plant site.

The emails show that a major part of GreenTech’s financial plan relied on a federal immigration program called EB-5. It allows foreigners who invest $500,000 into new enterprises in rural or struggling region, or $1 million in new enterprises in any region, to receive U.S. residency if at least 10 full-time jobs are created within two years as a result of the investment.

The EB-5 program had never been used in Virginia. To set it up, federal laws required the establishment of a ""regional center"" that would administer the program on a state or regional basis. The center finds suitable EB-5 projects, interacts with potential investors and handles legal and reporting requirements to ensure the investors receive their residency.

A regional center can be run by a state or local government or by a private business. GreenTech wanted to run Virginia’s program and asked Kaine to support that goal. The governor in September 2009 asked VEDP to weigh in, but officials there said they needed until at least the end of October to consider the plan.

Meanwhile, Lehmkuhler arranged for GreenTech to tour potential sites in Danville, Martinsville and Waverly on Oct. 7 and 8. But then there was a surprise. On Oct. 6, GreenTech announced plans to build a plant in Tunica, Miss., where it had a regional center.

McAuliffe’s company promised to initially employ 1,500 with a $1 billion investment and produce 150,000 vehicles annually in its first phase, the Memphis Business Journal reported. Watchdog.org later said that Mississippi and Tunica pitched in more than $8 million in public loans and grants, with more added in tax exemptions and rebates. The public investments will be taken back if the company fails to attract $60 million in capital and hire 350 full-time workers by the end of 2014, Mississippi’s Economic Development Authority said.

VEDP officials learned about the plan through media stories published on the morning of the announcement. Lehmkuhler asked Tang for an explanation.

""We will talk about (Mississippi) in a different occasion when our (Virginia) operations are on more solid ground,"" Tang replied in an email that same day. ""(Mississippi) is moving fast, so we need get (Virginia’s regional center) up running quickly.""

Lehmkuhler, in an email to other development officials that day, wrote: ""They’ve never indicated a second project until now. (Tang) confirmed this morning that there will be an announcement today, but in his words ‘our plan has always been doing some in MS but bigger one in Va.’""

That same day, Lehmkuhler sent an email to Secretary of Commerce and Trade Patrick Gottschalk expressing concern about GreenTech. The ""group has no demonstrated ability to run an automotive company,"" he wrote.

""In my opinion, the Mississippi announcement today was prompted by the need to quickly establish an alternative for Chinese investors who are growing tired of waiting for Wang to get the EB-5 process started in earnest somewhere,"" he wrote. ""After telling them about Mississippi for so long, (CEO and President Charles) Wang has told prospective investors that Virginia will now be their primary focus. He needs to have a Virginia EB-5 regional center up and running asap to accommodate those still willing to wait a little longer for the ‘best’ opportunity.""

During the next two days, GreenTech leaders made the scheduled site visits in Virginia. A week later, they told VEDP officials which site they preferred.  

On Oct. 22, Lehmkuhler sent an email to Tang detailing his concerns about the project. ""After a second review of the business plan, we still do not see a direct value proposition that explains how GreenTech will reach forecasted sales that equal 100 percent of planned capacity, both at the start of construction in 2012 and after a major expansion occurs through 2015,"" he wrote.

Lehmkuhler asked Tang to explain how GreenTech, with no car manufacturing experience, would compete with popular hybrids being marketed by major automobile companies. He asked GreenTech to justify its ""overstated"" estimate of the number spin-off jobs that would created by other companies servicing the auto plant in Virginia.

In November 2009, McAuliffe, who suggested the project be referred to by the code name Project Go Clean Green, visited Gottschalk and Kaine separately to talk about GreenTech’s plans for a Virginia plant.

Around the same time, VEDP finished its evaluation of GreenTech’s request for regional center support from the state. The blunt conclusions were laid out in a Nov. 19 memo that Jeffrey Anderson, executive director of the agency, sent to Gottschalk, the secretary of commerce and labor.

Anderson wrote, ""we have grave doubts about the business model presented to us"" by GreenTech. He mentioned several times that the company had not answered key questions that had been raised by the agency. And he warned that Virginia could be sullied by linking a new EB-5 program to the fortunes of a startup company.

""We are concerned that the financing plan does not fit the rules for the EB-5 Program,"" Anderson wrote. ""If the rules of the EB-5 Program are not followed, the investors will not receive the visas that they thought they would receive. If all, or any significant portion, of the investors were to not ultimately receive the visas, that would give the commonwealth a black eye, in the view of other companies or investors looking for possible business connections with the commonwealth.""

Anderson was also troubled by GreenTech’s desire to run the regional center for an EB-5 program in Virginia. Foreigners would look to the center to steer them towards ""reasonable business investments,"" he wrote. ""We believe that having the principals of the regional center be the same as the principals of the company benefitting from the investment creates a conflict of interest.""

On the same day, Tang sent an email to Lehmkuhler suggesting that GreenTech was focusing on one state. ""We have been under lots of pressure to move forward in MS..."" Tang wrote. ""Your expedited process and support is greatly appreciated... If we do not move the project soon in either place (not in both), our project momentum will be damaged.""

Several months of email silence ensued. In February 2010, Anderson asked Lehmkuhler if there was ""any news"" on GreenTech. Lehmkuhler replied that there wasn’t.

GreenTech purchased a prototype vehicle in May 2010 when the company bought EuAuto, a Chinese company that developed MyCar. MyCar is an electric vehicle that can drive 115 miles on one charge and reaches top speeds of 45 mph. In the U.S., dealers can’t sell those types of vehicles if they go faster than 25 mph. Most state restrict the cars to roads with maximum speed limits of 35 mph.

After the announcement, Lehmkuhler was asked for an update by Jim Cheng, secretary of commerce and trade for Gov. Bob McDonnell. Lehmkuhler, in a heavily redacted email, replied that the project was ""stuck in neutral.""

Elizabeth Povar, director of business development at VEDP, added to the reply, ""Bottom line, we have no reason at this point to believe there’s validity to the job creation numbers (or inferred project).""

McAuliffe told Bloomberg News in October 2010 that the first 100,000 cars produced would sell for  $8,500 apiece after federal and state tax credits reduced the price from $10,000. In articles written in 2012, the price escalated to $15,500, according to Torque News, and $18,000, according to the Memphis Daily News.

In August 2011, GreenTech announced plans to build an assembly plant in Inner Mongolia to serve the Chinese market. A month later, Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling’s office asked Lehmkuhler about the project.

Lehmkuhler shared his October 2009 due-diligence email with Randy Marcus, Bolling’s chief of staff. Lehmkuhler added, in a note, ""Never received an answer to any of these observations, despite a promises (sic) 9 to the contrary.""

He also wrote Marcus that the Mississippi plant and product is not what the company originally shared with VEDP. Lehmkuhler wrote that GreenTech ""keeps talking about doing this in Virginia but VEDP will not take another step"" until the company produced ""a qualified business plan and evidence of adequate financing.""  

Lehmkuhler added that that Green Tech was receiving ""no different treatment than any other prospect we deal with.""

GreenTech opened a manufacturing plant in a temporary location in Horn Lake, Mississippi in July 2012, surrounded by political luminaries such as former President Bill Clinton and former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour. McAuliffe said at the opening that the plant would make the innards of the vehicles destined for China, with assembly completed in the Chinese plant.

But the Associated Press reported that work on the original plant in Tunica has not progressed beyond site work and Watchdog.org adds that the workforce runs just more than 100. The company says it has orders from some Domino’s pizza franchises and a Danish company. A recent story from The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tenn., said early exports are planned for Europe.

A final flurry of conversations between GreenTech and VEDP occurred last summer. VEDP’s call center, which periodically contacts business prospects, dialed Wang, who said GreenTech would be interested in opening a plant in Virginia and moving engineers to the state.

Lehmkuhler followed up with a phone call and emails to Wang. The GreenTech executive replied on July 23.  ""We always have interest to do projects in Virginia,"" he wrote and promised to follow up in August. No further emails between the two are recorded.

In November, the McDonnell administration asked for another update on the project. ""I reconnected with Gary Tang a few months ago because they expressed a further interest in Virginia when contacted by the call center (now marked as Do Not Contact),"" Lehmkuhler wrote to Carrie Roth, deputy secretary for commerce and trade.

VEDP officials declined to be interviewed for this fact check, saying the emails speak for themselves.

For perspective, we spoke to Greg Wingfield, president and CEO of the Greater Richmond Partnership, which recruits and promotes business locally.

Wingfield said the partnership and VEDP investigate companies seeking help move into the Richmond region. For publicly traded businesses, that means reading reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and learning about the leadership of the company. For privately held companies or startups, the partnership asks for the information.

""If a privately held company won’t provide it, that sends up red flags and we can’t really go much further,"" Wingfield said. ""There are numerous examples of startups that were playing one state off another state and Virginia has a philosophy that it’s not a pay up-front state. They pay out after a company has performed.""

Our ruling

McAuliffe blamed VEDP for his company’s decision to locate an electric car plant in Mississippi rather than Virginia. ""They decided they didn’t want to bid on it,"" he said.

Records showed VEDP staff were interested in the project and were in the process of its due diligence when GreenTech moved ahead with a plant in Mississippi. VEDP had ""grave concerns"" about GreenTech’s business plan. The agency said GreenTech Agency officials had no ""demonstrated experience"" in manufacturing cars. It doubted the company’s job estimates. It questioned the ethics of GreenTech’s plan to raise money from foreign investors in exchange for U.S. residency.

The record shows that VEDP asked GreenTech to address its concerns and waited in vain for replies. Without those answers, VEDP would not negotiate monetary support for that, or any, project.

Contrary to McAuliffe’s claim, there is no evidence the state agency decided not to bid on the project. Emails show VEDP took GreenTech officials on a tour of potential sites and contacted the company about coming to Virginia almost two years after GreenTech announced it was building a plant in Mississippi.

"['County Budget', 'County Government', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Abele']","
County Executive Chris Abele says Milwaukee County Board’s budget and staff has ballooned since the 1970s
","
Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele is blunt about one of the reasons he backs state legislation to drastically cut the pay and office budget of the county’s legislative branch.

Supervisors elected to the County Board, says Abele, have much less to do than in county government’s heyday, but the board’s budget has ballooned.

""In the ‘70s the county had about 11,000 employees,"" Abele said in a Jan. 18, 2013 interview on WTMJ radio (620 AM). ""A lot of big functions have been moved from the county. Now we have 4,400 employees.""

In the 1970s, Abele continued, elected supervisors were part-time and the total County Board staff numbered three or four -- a couple committee clerks and a secretary. Now the staff totals 38 and supervisors’ pay is full-time.

Abele concluded by claiming that supervisors ""have a lot less to do and we are paying a lot more,"" and he offered the opinion that ""government worked pretty well; you didn’t have a pension scandal back then.""

The state legislation to cut Milwaukee County supervisors’ pay by 70 percent (to $15,000) and the County Board budget by 85 percent is still in draft form. County Board defenders say it will gut the legislative branch and throw checks-and-balances to the wind.

State lawmakers could take the measure up soon and Milwaukee County voters might be asked in a spring 2013 referendum to approve the salary cut.

Let’s take a look at Abele’s assertion that the County Board staff has gone from ""three or four"" to 38 in four decades, and costs taxpayers ""a lot more"" even though the total county workforce is less than half its former size (11,000 to 4,400).

Of course, we are not fact checking Abele’s opinion that things worked better in the old days. Nor are we checking in this item his assertion that supervisors are less busy today.

County workforce

Abele’s numbers on the overall county workforce are on target.

County government employed 11,340 in 1975, compared to something between 4,000 and 4,600 today depending on how you count heads, according to county budget books and other documents we examined.

The most recent payroll showed 4,397, according to the county’s human resources department.

Since the 1970s, the county has sold Doyne Hospital, contracted out the bus system, sold off a power plant, stopped operating a baseball park, partially privatized the Milwaukee Public Museum and outsourced numerous services previously performed by county employees. The state took over the county’s child welfare, food aid and child care programs. The parks system alone has shed hundreds of workers.

County Board staff

Did the board have just three or four staff members at some point in the ‘70s, compared to 38 today (not counting the elected officials)?

Close.

In 1970, the board’s budget listed five staffers (typist, administrator, board secretary, researcher and fiscal analyst). But for an accurate comparison to the set-up today, you have to throw in three committee clerks who in 1970 were housed in the County Clerk’s office. Today they are under the County Board budget.

So that’s a total of eight back then. Today, the board has 38 staff positions.

Abele would have been slightly better off citing the 1960s instead of the 1970s as a reference point. By 1973, the board’s non-elected staff had jumped up to 21, and by 1975 it was 24. So for much of the decade, the staffing was closer to today’s levels.

What’s changed?

There are actually fewer elected supervisors now (18 today vs. 25 then) and they earn less in inflation-adjusted dollars compared to their 1970 counterparts. (The actual unadjusted salaries: $11,500 in 1970 vs. $50,679 now).

But today, each lawmaker has a legislative aide to handle constituent calls and perform other tasks. Also, the board’s research staff has grown considerably, as has the number of general support staff.

The board also has hired people to publicize its work and more formally communicate with the public. And it has its own staff to lobby other units of government on county issues.

County Board budget

Speaking broadly about the County Board budget, Abele said it costs taxpayers ""a lot more"" now than in 1970.

Over a 40-year span, a big increase in raw numbers is hardly surprising. It went from $535,000 then to $6.6 million today.

So, it’s more instructive to measure the change in inflation-adjusted dollars. When we ran those numbers, we found the County Board budget increase was more than double the inflation rate.

By contrast, the overall county operating budget grew at slightly below the inflation rate for the period. Budgets are proposed by the County Executive and his department heads, then adopted with changes by the County Board. The system dates to 1960, when John Doyne became the first elected county executive.

Our rating

Abele said the County Board’s staff grew from three or four workers to 38 since the 1970s, and now costs taxpayers ""a lot more,"" while the total county workforce was more than cut in half in the same period.

He slightly overstates the growth in Board staff, and the time frame needs some clarification, but it’s accurate to say the County Board staff has grown notably since the early 1970s.

And even in inflation-adjusted dollars, the board costs a lot more today than in 1970, from a budget standpoint, even though there are fewer elected supervisors.

"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Barbara Buono']","
Barbara Buono claims Chris Christie is still proposing income tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthy
","
Looking to unseat Gov. Chris Christie this year, Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono has tried to portray the Republican governor as being steadfastly committed to an income tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthy.

But for the second time in less than five months, the truth has stood in Buono’s way.

Buono, the only Democrat to enter the gubernatorial race so far, repeated a claim about Christie’s tax cut plan during a video interview posted Jan. 13 on bluejersey.com, a left-leaning blog.

The governor’s plan ""to kick-start our economy"" is to propose an ""income tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and...he's still proposing it,"" said Buono (D-Middlesex)

Buono received a False for claiming in late August that Christie was demanding ""an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest.""

By repeating a line we’ve already debunked, the senator’s latest claim is outrageously wrong.

Let’s review our findings:

Christie initially proposed in January 2012 to cut income tax rates by 10 percent across-the-board over three years. Under that proposal, higher-income taxpayers, who pay more in income taxes, would have benefited more than lower-income taxpayers.

But the governor has since backed off that plan and endorsed a proposal to cut income taxes only for New Jerseyans below a certain income level and based on their annual property tax bills.

The governor unveiled that proposal on July 2, when he conditionally vetoed a bill that would have raised the income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million. Christie suggested turning that legislation into a tax cut plan based on a proposal made by Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat.

Under Christie’s latest proposal, homeowners with taxable income of $400,000 or less would receive an income tax credit based on their property tax bills. The credit would be phased in over four years and ultimately reach 10 percent of the first $10,000 in property taxes paid.

The proposal would not disproportionately benefit the wealthy, since homeowners earning more than $400,000 would be ineligible and the amount of the tax credit would be based on property tax bills, not income levels.

In a news release from the governor’s office on Jan. 13 -- the same day as Buono’s interview -- the Christie administration affirmed its support for that tax cut proposal.

According to the release, Christie ""has proposed a bipartisan compromise"" under which ""New Jersey taxpayers will be able to claim an income tax credit of up to 10 percent of their property tax bill.""

To support Buono’s latest claim, her chief of staff, Christina Zuk, pointed to lines in two news articles, including this sentence from a Jan. 13 Star-Ledger story: ""Christie also renewed his commitment for a 10 percent income-tax cut that he could not get last year.""

But immediately following that sentence is this quote from Christie: ""All those things are good, and the tax cut proposed (last year) by Senator Sweeney is good.""

The second news article, published Jan. 13 on NorthJersey.com, only states that Christie ""is still pushing for an income tax cut."" The governor’s latest proposal is an income tax cut, but not in the way suggested by Buono.

In response to our findings, Zuk said in an e-mail: ""There are numerous news reports from the past few weeks that indicate that Governor Christie has not abandoned his misguided plan for an across-the-board income tax cut, one that independent experts say would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest in our state.""

Our ruling

In a recent interview, Buono claimed that Christie’s plan ""to kick-start our economy"" is to propose an ""income tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and...he's still proposing it.""

But the governor has backed off such a plan and endorsed a proposal similar to one put forth by the Senate Democrats. Under that proposal, an income tax credit would be limited to taxpayers below a certain income level and based on their property tax bills.

Buono received a False for making a similar claim in August, but we obviously need to add a little sizzle to get our point across. Pants on Fire!

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Ted Strickland']","
Ted Strickland says Ohio's economic turnaround began in early 2010 while he was still governor
","
Ted Strickland is out. But don’t for a minute think the former Ohio governor’s record won’t remain a club in the bag of Republican incumbent John Kasich’s re-election campaign next year.

So while removing himself this month from the Democratic gubernatorial sweepstakes in 2014, Strickland was sure to put a positive spin on his own four years at the Statehouse.

""With the help of President Obama, who provided the funds necessary to keep Ohio and all of America from slipping into another Great Depression, we were able to preserve the social safety net, make important investments in education, and position Ohio’s economy for the recovery that started in February 2010,"" Strickland said in an email distributed by the Ohio Democratic Party.

Kasich won a close contest in 2010 by emphasizing the state’s economic decline on Strickland’s watch. Since then, a steady drop in Ohio unemployment figures has been seen as helpful to Obama’s re-election last year and to Kasich’s improved standing in public opinion polls.

As speculation shifted to other Democratic prospects, the sentiment Strickland clearly hoped to convey with his statement was that Republicans do not deserve all the credit for recovery in the state. But is the sentiment rooted in accuracy or revisionist history? PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

Luckily we were quite familiar with Strickland’s assertion, as it has been a key talking point for Democrats. We confirmed with Jerid Kurtz, communications director for the state party, that it was based primarily on unemployment numberstallied by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

For the seven months encompassing July 2009 through January 2010, Ohio’s unemployment rate was at a 10-year high of 10.6 percent, according to the BLS. In February 2010, the rate dropped to 10.5 percent -- the first month-to-month decrease since November 2007.

After February 2010, the state’s monthly unemployment rate continued to decline for a year, then leveled between 8.8 and 8.9 percent in mid-2011 before dropping again. Preliminary numbers for December 2012place the unemployment rate at 6.7 percent, the lowest since July 2008.

As additional backup, Kurtz pointed to a March 2011 BLS release, which notes employment boosts in several sectors during 2010, Strickland’s last year in office. Manufacturing jobs, for example, increased by 9,300 jobs between January 2010 and December 2010. Employment in education and health services grew by 12,300 jobs over the same period. (Other sectors lost jobs, including financial activities, which reported 5,200 fewer jobs at the end of the year.)

This is not the first time Democrats have argued that the state’s economy was rosier than Kasich implied in 2010. Strickland’s budget director, Pari Sabety, said in November 2010 that the economy was ""on the mend"" and ""in better shape than when we took office.""

PolitiFact Ohio evaluated that claimand talked to economic experts who disputed the ""better shape"" part of Sabety’s statement. The experts said employment figures are the true measure of the health of a state’s economy. At the time 350,000 fewer Ohioans had jobs than when Strickland took office. But two of the experts believed at least a modest recovery was afoot.

Sabety’s claim rated a Half True on the Truth-O-Meter.

We reconnected with Ken Mayland, an economist with Pepper Pike’s ClearView Economics and one of the experts cited in the check of Sabety’s November 2010 statement. Mayland said that employment numbers offer a clearer picture of an economy because they measure who is working. The unemployment rate excludes those who have stopped searching for work.

Mayland said it’s likely the tide began to turn for Ohio as early as 2009, when the national recession ended according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Our check of BLS data shows that after months of decline, the number of employed Ohioans began climbing in January 2010. Employment dipped again that summer but was rebounding by fall. Nearly 30,000 more Ohioans were employed in December 2010 than at the beginning of the year.

Under Kasich, Ohio’s employment ranks have grown by another 80,000, according to the BLS.

We also checked in with Cleveland economic research analyst George Zeller, another expert. Zeller finds fault with the BLS model favored by others and prefers the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Zeller said the QCEW numbers show that Ohio began gaining jobs in 2010, but several months later than February.

If he had to pick a month when the Ohio economy began to turn around, Zeller said he would choose July 2010 or October 2010. ""In the end,"" Zeller wrote in an email to PolitiFact Ohio, ""more than a third of all the net jobs gained in Ohio during 2010 were in October 2010.""

Strickland, in announcing he would sit out in 2014, said Ohio’s economic recovery ""started in February 2010."" The Ohio Democratic Party, which circulated the release, attributed the remark to BLS figures that showed the first in a series of unemployment declines came that month.

Economics is never so simple. One expert thinks the recovery might have started earlier, another believes it started a few months later. Strickland served from 2007 through 2010. The timeline might not be as precise as he suggests, but evidence and expertise confirm the accuracy of his larger point: that Ohio’s recovery started while he was governor.

There’s also the matter of Strickland clearly attempting to share credit for the recovery with Obama, whose support of an auto industry bailout was seen as crucial to Ohio’s economy.

""No governor,"" Mayland said, ""gets blame for the national recession, so no governor should get the credit for the recovery. You can have policies on the margins that help you do a little better.""

PolitiFact Ohio understands that as long as politics exist, politicians will take credit and assign blame for fluctuations in the economy. It was Kasich, after all, who repeatedly dinged Strickland for hundreds of thousands of lost jobs. The issue is likely to remain a key talking point in the 2014 gubernatorial race. So if Strickland and his Democratic allies must resort to the 2010 recovery to defend themselves, they would better serve the truth by not singling out a month.

As is, Strickland’s claim requires clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, that makes it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/24/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-says-ohios-economic-turnaround-bega/
"['National', 'Civil Rights', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Jackie Speier']","
Rep. Jackie Speier says poll shows NRA members believe all gun buyers face background checks
","
On the president’s list of gun-control priorities: require background checks for all gun sales.

That step has widespread support, even among gun owners, gun-control advocates say.

In fact, many assume such a measure is already in place, claimed Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who is vice chair of a new congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.

""Even members of the NRA, when they were polled recently, were under the impression that everyone has a criminal background check,"" she told Ed Schultz in a Jan. 15, 2013, appearance on MSNBC’s The Ed Show.

We wondered: Is that true?

We asked Speier’s office to point us to the poll.

 Mayors Against Illegal Guns

Speier’s communications director, Jenny Werwa, told us the lawmaker based her comment on a July 2012 poll commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

As its name suggests, the group includes city mayors concerned with illegal guns and gun violence and is helmed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat.

The group hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz. His organization, Luntz Global, polled 945 gun owners nationwide in May 2012, half of whom were gun owners who were ""current or lapsed"" members of the National Rifle Association and half of whom were non-NRA gun owners.

The poll showed that ""gun owners’ knowledge of existing laws is tenuous,"" Luntz Global’s report says. ""Over half (53 percent ) of non-NRA members and 57 percent of NRA members believe the statement, ‘Everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check to complete the purchase’ is true.""

The reality is that background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but not for those by private sellers.

The White House wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which supports the current background check requirement, has suggested that an expansion of the law might be a step toward gun confiscation.

 What the NRA says

We contacted NRA spokesmen to ask for their evaluation of Speier’s claim, but they didn’t respond.

We found an NRA response, however, to a similar poll by Mayors Against Illegal Guns conducted by Frank Luntz in 2009.

The Web post calls Bloomberg an ""anti-gun politician-activist,"" and attacks Luntz, a widely quoted communications consultant for Republican politicians and Fortune 100 companies, with decade-old criticism from two polling organizations. 
In other words, the NRA attacked the source of the previous poll, not the results.

We looked for other polls to see if they exposed weakness in the poll’s conclusions.

We didn’t immediately find a survey that addressed gun owners’ knowledge of existing laws. But the Luntz poll also asked about support for ""requiring a criminal background check of anyone purchasing a gun."" The poll found that 82 percent of gun owners were in favor of required background checks, including 74 percent of NRA members.

Recent independent polls show similar numbers. A Pew Research Center poll from Jan. 9-13, 2013, of 1,502 adults found 85 percent of gun owners favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks — nearly identical to the Luntz poll. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted Jan. 11-15 among 1,110 adults showed that 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member support universal background checks.

 Our ruling

Rep. Jackie Speier said, ""even members of the NRA, when they were polled recently, were under the impression that everyone has a criminal background check.""

She relied on a poll conducted last summer by an interest group that broke out results for ""current or lapsed"" NRA members. It showed a majority of those NRA gun owners believe ""everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check."" While we didn’t find recent polls asking a similar question, we did find other polls showing that NRA members support background checks for all, including private purchases and purchases at gun shows.

It should be clarified that the Luntz poll results were for current and former NRA members.

For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/23/jackie-speier/rep-jackie-speier-says-poll-shows-nra-members-beli/
"['National', 'Poverty', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says poverty in U.S. is at an all-time high
","
The rich should pay more taxes because of rising income inequality, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in a Jan. 7, 2013, interview on MSNBC.

Sanders’ comments came after anchor Thomas Roberts asked him whether he, President Barack Obama and Democratic lawmakers are ready to ""go after corporations that in some cases pay no taxes at all."" Roberts asked, ""Do Democrats smell blood in the water here?""

Sanders responded, ""Well, Thomas, it's not smelling blood in the water. What it is is looking at reality, and the reality is that we have growing wealth and income inequality in America. People on top in large corporations doing phenomenally well. Middle class disappearing. Poverty levels at an all-time high.""

The part of Sanders’ comment that caught our eye was that ""poverty levels"" are ""at an all-time high."" We wondered, is that really the case? Is it really higher now than during the Great Depression?

So we looked at U.S. Census Bureau data. This data goes back only to 1959 -- which poses the first problem for Sanders’ claim. Because the federal government did not calculate poverty statistics before then -- here’s a brief history of how the statistic came about, and some of the critiques of it -- we don’t have official data for much of the nation’s history, including, for instance, the Great Depression. This is problematic because Sanders used the phrase, ""an all-time high.""

There’s a second problem: The poverty rate in the most recent year, 2011, isn’t even the highest rate since the data began in 1959. In 2011, the poverty rate was 15.0 percent. Here are the other years that matched or exceeded that rate:

2010: 15.1 percent
1993: 15.1 percent
1983: 15.2 percent
1982: 15.0 percent
1964: 19.0 percent
1963: 19.5 percent
1962: 21.0 percent
1961: 21.9 percent
1960: 22.2 percent
1959: 22.4 percent

In other words, the rate in 2011 was tied for the 10th-highest since 1959. And while poverty in 2010 was the highest it had been in 17 years, it actually dropped, albeit slightly, between 2010 and 2011.

In fairness, we should note that Medicare started in the mid 1960s and Social Security was indexed for inflation in the 1970s, and poverty rates haven’t been as high since then. Sanders vigorously defends both programs.

When we asked Sanders’ office to explain how they came up with the statistic, a spokesman said the senator was referring to the overall number of people living in poverty, not the rate as a percentage of the national population. ""In 2010 and 2011, more Americans lived in poverty than at any time on record,"" said spokesman Jeff Frank. ""That was the point that the senator was making.""

It’s correct that the raw number of Americans in poverty hit a high in 2010, since data began, though the number fell modestly in 2011, from 46.3 million to 46.2 million, according to the Census Bureau.

We asked economist Tara Sinclair of George Washington University whether it’s reasonable to justify what Sanders said by referring to total numbers of people rather than the rate.

She noted that Sanders did say ""levels,"" rather than ""rates,"" which could be interpreted as being consistent with using raw numbers.

""There are reasons to care about the sheer number of poor people, even if the growth in the number of poor people is in part due to population growth,"" Sinclair said.

But she added that the rise in population shouldn’t be discounted, either. ""There are more people in the U.S. than ever before, and that's why people often look at rates,"" she said.

Our ruling

The numbers do not entirely support Sanders’ claim. The best evidence in his favor is that the raw numbers of Americans in poverty hit an all-time high in 2010, at least since records have kept. However, they fell modestly in 2011, the most recent year available.

Meanwhile, the sweeping nature of Sanders’ comment -- that ""poverty levels (are) at an all-time high"" -- is problematic. If you factor in population growth, the rate of Americans in poverty in 2011 was only the 10th-highest since 1959. And it’s impossible to know how many years prior to 1959 were higher, including the Great Depression.

On balance, we rate Sanders’ claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jan/23/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-poverty-us-all-time-high/

George P. Bush says Texas will be majority Hispanic in six years
","
Investor George P. Bush, a nephew and grandson to U.S. presidents, elaborated on his intended 2014 run for land commissioner or another statewide office partly by saying it’s important for Republicans to have candidates who understand the Hispanic community.

Bush, whose mother, Columba, is from Mexico, also waved at the state’s demographic changes, saying in an Associated Press interview reported Jan. 12, 2013: ""We’ll be majority Hispanic in six years.""

That struck us as too soon, though in July 2010, we rated as True a claim that within five to eight to ten years, there would be more Latinos in Texas than there are Anglos. At the time, the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center said it ""is anticipated that the number of Hispanics will exceed the number of Anglos in the state at some point in the coming decade. This benchmark might be achieved a little sooner or a little later if migration is respectively more rapid or more slow than that utilized for this projection.""

Our story did not speak to when the majority of residents would be Hispanic.

Latinos have absolutely gained in prominence.

In the 2000 Census, 52 percent of Texans were Anglo, and 32 percent identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino (of any race). In the 2010 U.S. census, Latinos comprised nearly 38 percent of Texas residents with non-Hispanic whites making up about 45 percent of residents and blacks accounting for nearly 12 percent of the population, according to Robert Bernstein, spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau. As of July 2011 estimates, the Census Bureau says, non-Hispanic whites made up 44.8 percent of the population with individuals of Hispanic origin accounting for 38.1 percent; blacks comprised 12.2 percent, Bernstein said by email.

Separately, we asked the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, about Bush’s statement. By email, he said the data center’s projections suggest Latinos will outnumber any other ethnic group in Texas by 2017 or 2019, depending on growth patterns. Hispanic residents will make up a majority of the population as of 2036 or 2040, he said.

Potter also reminded us that the projections are driven by different possible growth patterns, meaning surprises are always possible. We sought his comment on a Dec. 31, 2012, New York Times news article stating that Hispanic Americans were bearing fewer children than before. Potter saidl: ""Our projections factor in trends in changing fertility among all racial and ethnic groups through 2010. In particular, we noted the declining fertility among Hispanic women in the last few years. Of course the caution comes in here, where if fertility among Hispanics declines at a more rapid pace than the trend we used and more rapidly than other racial/ethnic groups, the time it takes for Hispanics become a majority race/ethnic group, or to exceed 50 percent of the population will take longer.""

After we gathered these figures, Bush adviser Trey Newton of Austin said by email that George P. Bush had consulted Steve Murdock, a Rice University professor who previously served stints as director of the U.S. Census Bureau and as the Texas state demographer. According to Bush’s notes, Newton said, Hispanics will make up a plurality of the state’s population by 2020 and a majority by 2025.

By telephone, Murdock agreed his latest projections indicate Hispanics will make up a plurality by 2020. But Murdock said the projections suggest Hispanics will not make up a majority until sometime between 2030 and 2040. Of Bush’s comment to the AP, Murdock said: ""There may have been some misunderstanding. I am not always as clear as sky.""

Our ruling

Bush said Texas will be majority Hispanic in six years.

We suspect Bush was referring to the time that Hispanics become the biggest subgroup of the population, which is projected to occur by 2017 or 2019, according to the state demographer. However, he said ""majority,"" and Hispanics are not projected to make up the majority of residents until 2036 at the earliest.

Environmental group makes powerful claim about wind
","
While some complained about the fine print in the fiscal cliff deal, a local environmental activist was pleased with one portion of the bill and said something about it that seemed worthwhile to fact-check.

Environment Georgia policy advocate Jennette Gayer sent out a news release thanking federal lawmakers for continuing key tax credits for wind power.

""Wind powers nearly 13 million homes across the country and states like Texas, the number one wind energy producer in the country, generate a little over 30 million (megawatt hours per year),"" Gayer wrote.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered about Gayer’s claim that wind powers nearly 13 million homes in the United States. Is that true?

Gayer pointed us to a couple of websites she used to back up her claim. PolitiFact Georgia was on its way down the windy road of wind energy.

The development of wind energy, harvested by wind turbines, began in the 1970s. It’s grown in the decades since, but it is still a very small amount (3 percent) of the energy that’s produced in the United States, federal officials and researchers say. President Barack Obama talked energetically about wind power on the campaign trail last year, saying it’s creating jobs and it is an important alternative energy source. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had no plans to continue the tax credits.

In 1992, the federal government began offering tax credits to individuals and companies for wind energy production as part of the Energy Policy Act. For every kilowatt hour of power from wind, the government gives the producer a tax credit worth 2.2 cents. At the time, the U.S. had 1.5 gigawatts of installed wind capacity. A gigawatt is the equivalent of 1 billion watts of electricity. A standard light bulb uses 100 watts.

Most of the nation’s wind energy is produced in Texas, the Plains states and the West Coast, analysts say. Very little comes from the South.

""It’s less windy in the Southeast, so there’s not a lot of technology to generate that energy,"" said Eric Lantz, a research analyst with the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Some organizations, such as the Institute for Energy Research, call the tax credits a ""boondoggle."" The institute, citing a study by the American Tradition Institute, says the costs of wind power is more expensive than other forms of energy generation, such as coal, natural gas and nuclear energy.

By 1999, federal officials say they saw an increase in wind capacity. The American Wind Energy Association, a prominent group that supports the expanded use of wind energy, reported this past August that the U.S. had reached the 50-gigawatt milestone.

The association’s estimate is, Lantz said, about a year ahead of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Lantz said he reviewed the EIA’s most recent numbers and believes the association’s 50-gigawatt claim is on target.

So how many homes can 50 gigawatts power? Lantz looked at U.S. census data and other information on the EIA website. He concluded about 12 million homes.

""I think their number is reasonable,"" Lantz said of Gayer’s estimate.

EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan agreed. The federal agency estimated the nation was on pace to generate anywhere from 125 million to 140 million kilowatts of wind energy in 2012. The average American home uses about 11,000 kilowatts of energy a year, Cogan said.

""It seems to check out,"" Cogan told us.

We wondered, though, whether that meant 12 million or so homes in the U.S. were actually being powered through wind energy. Lantz said there is no data detailing the number of homes that actually use wind energy. Some of that energy could be powering commercial or other nonresidential facilities.

It’s not possible to say for sure how many homes actually use wind-generated electricity. But it is clear that there is enough produced to power millions of homes.

To sum up, Environment Georgia analyst Jennette Gayer said wind powers about 13 million homes across America.

From the people we interviewed and research we’ve seen, this claim seems to have some juice.

We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/23/jennette-gayer/environmental-group-makes-powerful-claim-about-win/

Christopher Plante says Rhode Island's governor can't veto proposal for constitutional amendment on same-sex marriage
","
As the debate over same-sex marriage heats up again in Rhode Island, there is talk of allowing voters, rather than the legislature, to decide the issue.

Gov. Lincoln Chafee has said he would veto such a proposal if it were passed by the General Assembly. He has called on the legislature to approve same-sex marriage, which would make it legal in Rhode Island, as it is in the other five New England states.

[The House Judiciary Committee passed it Tuesday; the full House of Representatives is expected to pass it this week. It faces a less certain fate in the Senate.]

During a Jan. 13 interview on WLNE-TV, former Providence Mayor Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. raised the referendum question with Christopher Plante, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island, which opposes same-sex marriage.

Cianci asked Plante what he thought of Chafee's promise to veto a referendum.

Plante said Chafee couldn't do that. ""The governor does not have any power to veto a referendum that would be a constitutional amendment,"" he said.

This is a case in which context is especially important. First, let's just consider Plante's statement without its context.

If a referendum on same-sex marriage were drafted as a constitutional amendment, Plante would be correct. Although Chapter IX, Section 14 gives the governor the ability to veto any legislation passed by the General Assembly, it specifically excludes proposed constitutional amendments, which must always go before the voters. (The governor also gets no veto over General Assembly votes that involve in-house matters such as the decision to adjourn.)

Now let's consider the context.

Cianci didn't ask the question in the framework of a constitutional amendment. While all proposed constitutional amendments must be placed on the ballot, all ballot questions aren't constitutional amendments.

Sen. Frank A. Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who opposes same-sex marriage, has said he would propose an amendment, but that's unlikely to pass both chambers.

The legislation now before the House simply proposes changing the law, not the state Constitution.

If the legislature instead voted to put it on the ballot, its decision would be subject to a gubernatorial veto.

Plante, in e-mails, acknowledged that Chafee would have veto power if same-sex marriage was put to the voters as a non-constitutional question.

But he said he always answers the question the way he did because he believes same-sex marriage SHOULD be a constitutional question, a point he subsequently raised in the interview with Cianci.

""That's what we would be looking for because, if anything's going to happen with marriage, it should happen by the people,"" he said. ""We voted on whether we should change the name of the state. We voted on casinos. How much more important is the institution of marriage?""

Our ruling

Christopher Plante said Gov. Lincoln Chafee ""does not have any power to veto a referendum that would be a constitutional amendment"" on the issue of same-sex marriage.

It's true, as Plante said, that the governor has no veto power over constitutional amendments proposed by the General Assembly.

But the question wasn't posed that way, and Plante's answer might have given some viewers the false impression that Chafee has no say if the General Assembly decides to send the question of same-sex marriage to the voters.

Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Mike Polensek says utility First Energy will have its name on a stadium powered by the city's electric company
","
The Cleveland Browns opened a new source of revenue in January 2013 by selling stadium naming rights at Cleveland Browns Stadium to Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. 
Browns owner Jimmy Haslam vowed that the naming rights money will be used to help the team become more competitive. Haslam didn’t disclose the amount First Energy will pay in the deal, but reportedly it will amount to about $6 million a year for 17 years.

Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek said he hoped the deal would open the door to discussion about the stadium's continuing cost to the city.

""It is ironic,"" he added, ""that they're going to have a name on our building where we supply the electricity. Only in Cleveland.""

By ""they,"" he meant First Energy Corp., parent of the Illuminating Co. and the major electrical utility in northern Ohio. By ""we,"" he meant the city-owned electric utility, Cleveland Public Power, a longtime rival.

Polensek made the remark in an interview on WEWS Channel 5 in which he asserted that the original lease was ""clearly a one-sided, lopsided deal."" It charges the Browns $250,000 a year in rent while leaving the city saddled with $13 million a year in debt and capital maintenance costs, he said.

To PolitiFact Ohio, if Polensek's quip was accurate, it would indeed indeed be ironic --  or almost comically contrary to expectation.

We sought illumination.

Shelley Shockley, communications manager for Cleveland Public Power, quickly confirmed that CPP does in fact supply the electrical power to the stadium that will now bear its rival’s name, and will continue to do so at least until the lease expires in 2029.

CPP also provides power to such Cleveland landmarks as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Great Lakes Science Center, West Side Market and to much of University Circle.

FirstEnergy powers Progressive Field, home of the Indians.

Polensek told us he's a Browns fan who wants a winner and has been favorably impressed by Haslam's approach since becoming owner.

""My concern is how we can get them to face the economic realities that confront the city every day,"" he said. ""Will the Browns at least consider taking a greater role in maintenance of the facility or in doing something more for city recreational programs? Is there something (they) can do to help us out?

""I always believe that reasonable people can come up with reasonable solutions.""

Polensek, who voted against the lease as a councilman in 1996, saying ""city government has not bargained strongly enough on behalf of the taxpayers,"" noted that it explicitly gives the Browns naming rights for the stadium and all revenues received from marketing the name. 
And he has no quarrel with FirstEnergy.

""It's clearly specific in the lease,"" he said. ""If they want to call it Reddy Kilowatt Stadium, and make Reddy Kilowatt the mascot"" -- referring to the old stick figure mascot used by the Illuminating Co. and Ohio Edison and many other power companies -- ""there's nothing we can do.""

First Energy didn’t opt to put Reddy’s name in lights, though.

Cleveland Browns Stadium is now ""FirstEnergy Stadium, Home of the Cleveland Browns."" And, it is powered by Cleveland Public Power.

Pink Slip Rick: Rick Scott's proposal only mandates 48 hours of early voting
","
Activists behind Pink Slip Rick are not impressed with Gov. Rick Scott’s attempts to distance himself from the voting reforms he signed into law in 2011.

Scott called on the Florida Legislature to consider three reforms to avoid hours-long waits that dogged early voting in some counties in 2012: add more sites for early voting aside from election offices, libraries and city halls; shorten the language of proposed constitutional amendments; and increase the maximum number of early voting days from eight to 14.

Scott touted his proposal as giving Floridians ""the greatest access to early voting ever in Florida history – at up to 168 hours.""

But @PinkSlipRick tweeted a strikingly different take on the announcement.

""#PinkSlipRick’s proposal is so vague that it only mandates 48 hours of early voting,"" the tweet said.

We wondered how Pink Slip Rick, which is organized by liberal group Florida Watch Action, could have a tally so much lower from the governor’s statement.

Here’s the answer: Both sides are right.

The 2011 elections law reduced the number of days for early voting from 14 to eight, with supervisors required to offer between six and 12 hours of early voting each day instead of simply eight hours. (Here’s a related check on that.) That meant local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days.

Still, most supervisors offered the maximum of 96 hours, according to an analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith. At 54 hours, Hernando County was among counties offering the smallest amount of time to vote early.

Scott is recommending a law that allows supervisors to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting and maintaining the six-to-12 hour window.

So under Scott’s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). The fewest number of hours they would be required to offer for is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours).

Scott’s proposal largely mirrors recommendations from the state supervisors of elections association.

""Our ultimate goal must be to restore Floridians' confidence in our election system,"" Scott said in a statement. ""We need more early voting days, which should include an option of the Sunday before Election Day.""

So both sides make an accurate remark about Scott’s plan, but they cherry-pick the extreme scenario to fit their interest.

Florida Watch Action executive director Amy Ritter said Scott should have restored early voting the way it was before the 2011 election law, with a minimum of 96 hours.

""Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting,"" Ritter said.

We surveyed several local supervisors for how they might implement Scott’s option. In Miami-Dade County, a spokeswoman said the county would likely resume the pre-2011 law system of offering 14 days with 8 hours each day and eight total hours on the weekend, with more room to offer more hours closer to a presidential election.

In Hillsborough County, supervisor Craig Latimer said the county has always offered the maximum amount of hours for early voting, and he could see offering the hypothetical max of 168 hours in a presidential election.

""There’s got to be relief for large counties,"" he said.

In tiny Franklin County, home to just over 7,000 Panhandle voters, elections supervisor Ida C. Elliott said implementing the full monty of 168 hours would not be feasible, citing overtime costs for workers and a simple lack of need. But even she wouldn’t go to the minimum of 48 hours.

""48? That’s a little too...not enough,"" she said. ""That’s crazy. You’d have to do at least your whole working day, for sure.""

Our ruling

Pink Slip Rick’s remark is accurate but leaves out part of the story. Scott’s proposal would mandate a minimum of 48 hours, but it would also let supervisors offer a maximum of 168 hours.

Local supervisors would make the call, and the ones we spoke with said they would offer more than the bare minimum.

Still, the group is right that 48 hours would be the mandated minimum. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/22/pink-slip-rick/pink-slip-rick-rick-scotts-proposal-only-mandates-/

Rick Scott says his plan would expand early voting hours to record high
","
Gov. Rick Scott wants Florida lawmakers to revisit the 2011 elections overhaul, which was widely blamed for problems with early voting during last year’s presidential election.

In an interview on Miami-based WPLG Channel 10, Scott stressed he wants local supervisors to have the option to implement the most early voting hours in Florida history.

""What I think we ought to be doing is give the flexibility to our supervisors of elections, most of them, as you know, are elected county by county, but say you can do anywhere from eight to 14 days, six to 12 hours a day,"" Scott said in the Jan. 18, 2013, interview, ""so a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we’ve ever had.""

Scott, who refused to extend early voting in 2012 despite long lines at some polls, is also calling on the Legislature to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day -- the day when African-American groups hosted popular ""Souls to the Polls"" events.

Here we’ll examine whether Scott is right to say his proposal would be the most hours for early voting.

Florida’s history with early voting is short.

Former Gov. Jeb Bush signed early voting into law in 2004. That law required early voting to start 15 days before an election, with at least eight hours per weekday and eight hours total for each weekend. Voters had 104 early voting hours.

Even though election supervisors asked for more hours and more locations, Bush and the GOP-led Legislature passed a new law in 2005 that reduced hours and confined voting to election offices, city halls and libraries. Under the new law, early voting lasted 14 days, for eight hours on weekdays and a total of eight hours on the weekend. That’s 96 hours.

In the 2008 presidential election, voters had more time to vote early thanks to an emergency extension ordered by Gov. Charlie Crist (read that executive order.) Many news accounts put the total number of early voting hours in 2008 at 120, but the Department of State calculates it at 116.

In 2011, the Legislature passed a sweeping elections law that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. (Here’s a related check on that.) So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days.

The Legislature is poised to tweak the state’s early voting system again in 2013 because of the long waits to vote in some places during the 2012 presidential election.

Scott, echoing proposals from the elections supervisors association, recommended the Legislature give supervisors the ability to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting, while maintaining six to 12 hours each day. He also wants to add more early voting sites.

So under Scott’s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). On the flip side, the fewest number of hours they would be required to offer is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours).

Activists behind the liberal campaign Pink Slip Rick disapproved of Scott’s proposal, saying Scott should have restored the number of days for early voting to 14, the way it was before the 2011 election law.

""Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting,"" said Amy Ritter, executive director of Florida Watch Action, the liberal group behind Pink Slip Rick.

A few election supervisors we interviewed about Scott’s plan said they welcomed the idea of tailoring early voting to their home county’s needs.

""We kind of came to the conclusion that obviously, with Florida being such a huge and diverse state, one size does not fit all,"" said Brian Corley, Pasco County supervisor of elections.

Corley, who heads up legislative affairs for the state supervisors association, said he does not think Pasco would need the full 168 hours, but ""it’s nice to have the option, if need be, for a major presidential election.""

A spokeswoman for Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes said her office had not yet begun planning for the scenario under Scott’s plan but would probably go back to 14 days of early voting, the way things were before the Legislature’s 2011 law.

""We would likely conduct early voting as it was structured prior to HB 1355,"" said public services director Mary Cooney in an email.

Our ruling 
Scott said that his proposal would allow ""a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we’ve ever had"" for early voting. He’s right that his proposal would give supervisors of elections the option to offer 168 hours of early voting, and that would be a record. 
We should note that supervisors would also have the option to only offer 48 hours of voting, which is less than previous law. But Scott was very careful with his wording, noting that 168 hours was the maximum and outlining the specific days and hours. 
A claim from his critics, Pink Slip Rick, said the law ""only mandates 48 hours of early voting."" We rated that Mostly True, because it didn't leave open the possibility of more hours. Scott's statement, on the other hand, specifically notes that the 168 hours are a maximum.

Congressman's claim mostly misses the mark
","
Editor's note: Some readers noted that employers, too, make contributions into Social Security. The article has been updated to reflect that point. 
Some Democrats in Washington have staked out a position that important programs such as Social Security should not be changed as part of any spending reductions.

U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from DeKalb County, made that point in a Twitter post. The congressman’s rationale included a claim we thought was worthwhile to fact-check.

Johnson wrote on Twitter: ""#socialsecurity has nothing to do with the deficit -- why are we even talking about it?""

Social Security is one of the most important functions of the federal government. Social Security and Medicare account for about one-third of federal spending. In this age of trillion-dollar deficits, it would seem that Social Security is a factor in the nation’s fiscal challenges. Or is it?

Uncle Sam pays about $60 billion in Social Security benefits each month to about 60 million recipients, mostly retirees who paid into the system when they were working. It’s widely believed the number of recipients will increase in the future as Americans live longer. Lawmakers are concerned that the federal government will have less money to pay recipients in the coming years.

Eighty percent of the money for Social Security comes from employees, their employers and the self-employed, Johnson’s office told us. The federal government takes a percentage of the pay of most workers for Social Security. It had been 4.2 percent of the paycheck of most workers, but as you may have noticed by now, it is back to 6.2 percent after lawmakers let a cut in the payroll tax expire. Americans who make more than $106,800 don’t have to pay as much of their income, percentagewise, into the system.

The second source is investment income from Social Security’s reserves, which are invested in interest-bearing U.S. Treasury bonds; raising about 15 percent of total revenue, said Johnson’s spokesman, Andy Phelan. Social Security gets about 5 percent of its revenue from the taxes that beneficiaries pay on their Social Security benefits, Phelan added.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Hampshire recently looked at a claim that Social Security has not contributed to the debt and deficits and rated it Mostly False. They said that from 1984 to 2009, Social Security collected more money than it paid in benefits. Those surplus dollars, they reported, add to the Social Security trust funds, which currently hold about $2.7 trillion in assets.

The surplus funds are often invested in U.S. Treasury bonds.

Social Security, though, has been running deficits in recent years. The deficit was about $49 billion in 2010 and $45 billion in 2011, according to a 2012 Social Security trustees report. The average deficit will be about $66 billion between 2012 and 2018 as beneficiaries continue to grow at a faster rate than the number of covered workers, the report said. The cut in the payroll tax, by the way, cost the government about $100 billion in 2011 and likely the same amount in 2012, Social Security officials say.

So what happens when there is a gap in what Social Security collects and pays?

""When Social Security runs a deficit, the program draws on interest from the Social Security bonds, forcing government officials, already operating at a deficit, to borrow more money from other sources to make up the difference,"" PolitiFact New Hampshire wrote.

Boston University economics professor Laurence Kotnikoff told PolitiFact New Hampshire that Social Security is a part of the nation’s debt and deficit challenges.

""Nobody can claim Social Security isn’t part of the overall problem,"" he said. ""It’s all labeling games. … It absolutely contributes to the overall fiscal situation. It’s in terrible shape.""

The Washington Post’s Fact Checker has also looked into the impact of Social Security on the federal deficit. It noted that President Barack Obama had been more precise than others when talking about the issue, saying ""Social Security is not the primary driver of our long-term deficits and debt.""

The Post, too, reported that Social Security was providing more money than it was collecting in benefits in recent years.

To sum up, Johnson’s Twitter page said Social Security has nothing to do with the federal deficit. Until 2010, that was true. But the program has run a deficit each year since then and is taking money from its bonds to cover the gap. Federal officials are also worried about the long-term impact of future deficits on the program.

Johnson has a reasonable argument since Social Security is taking money from its bond interest to pay to cover the current gap. But these gaps do have an impact on other parts of the federal budget, and the projections are that the problem is going to get worse. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jan/22/hank-johnson/congressmans-claim-mostly-misses-mark/
