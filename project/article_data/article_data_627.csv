Joe Straus accurately says Texas growing twice as fast as rest of nation
","A campaign video put out by House Speaker Joe Straus, the San Antonio Republican, shows him talking up his re-election hopes and throwing out a claim about huge Texas growth. The video, posted Dec. 17, 2015, opens with Straus signing papers to run for re-election, where he’ll face off in the March 2016 Republican primary for the District 121 seat against former schoolteacher Sheila Bean and Jeff Judson, a former San Antonio tea party director. Straus, shown shaking hands with people, also says: ""Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country. This is a time for men and women who are ready to confront our challenges with humility and with purpose."" Hold on; Texas is growing two times as fast as the other 49 states combined? By email, Straus spokesman Jason Embry pointed toward U.S. Census Bureau data as the basis of the claim. Texas’s population growth According to the Census breakdown, from April 2010 to July 2014, the U.S. population grew 3.3 percent. According to the data, Texas’ population grew 7.2 percent, which breaks out, Embry noted, to Texas growing twice as fast as the nation. It didn’t take long for us to identify more recent Census data covering national and state population estimates through June 2015. Then again, that information was released Dec. 22, 2015, shortly after Straus unveiled his video -- so he wouldn’t have had access to it. Regardless, the latest figures show Texas more than doubling the nation’s growth rate from April 2010 to July 2015 when the population of Texas grew 9.2 percent while the U.S. population grew 4.1 percent. Not that Texas was the fastest-growing state in the period; that distinction goes to North Dakota, which saw 12.5  percent population growth, the bureau says. Texas compared to the rest of the country  We recognized, though, that the offered basis of the speaker’s claim compares Texas to the nation as a whole. That’s not what Straus said; he compared Texas to the rest of the nation not including Texas. So, does the growth of Texas double the growth of the rest of the country? You bet your boots, we confirmed, both if you look at growth from 2010 to 2014, the period singled out by Straus, and at shorter time periods. We got out our calculator and found that from mid-2013 to mid-2014, Texas grew by 1.8 percent; that rate was more than double the 0.7 population growth in the rest of the country. From April 2010 through July 2014, according to bureau data, the population of the rest of the country increased 2.9 percent (while Texas grew, as noted above, 7.2 percent). Throw in growth from mid-2014 to mid-2015, and the rest of the nation grew 3.6 percent over five-plus years (while Texas saw 9.2 percent population increase). Texas compared to other individual states There’s another way to make such comparisons -- state to state. And while North Dakota, not Texas, has lately been the fastest-growing state, Texas has ranked among the very fastest-growth states.From 2010 to 2014, year to year, Texas consistently ranked as one of the  fastest-growing states. From mid-2014 to mid- 2015, only North Dakota, Colorado, Nevada and Florida grew faster than the Lone Star State.     Year to Year Percentage Changes in Population, Fastest-Growing States 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 North Dakota 0.29 1.60 2.47 3.04 2.27 2.28 Colorado 0.38 1.41 1.41 1.53 1.60 1.89 Nevada 0.10 0.57 1.33 1.29 1.72 1.85 Florida 0.24 1.36 1.29 1.25 1.59 1.84 Texas 0.39 1.62 1.70 1.58 1.81 1.82 Source: U.S. Census Bureau (NST-EST2015-popchg2010_2015, Jan. 20, 2016) In this recent period, North Dakota was consistently the fastest-growing state; it grew more than 2 percent annually from mid-2012 to mid-2015 and spurted 3 percent from mid-2012 to mid-2013. Why is Texas growing?  It doesn’t bear on the accuracy of the speaker’s claim, but we wondered why Texas remains fast-growing. By phone, Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, said much of the state’s growth reflects net migration, the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the state in a given period of time. Potter also said migration to Texas had been driven by job opportunities in the state. ""People move to one place or another, usually because they’re looking for work,"" Potter said. ""There’s a small percentage of migration behavior that’s related to say retirement or maybe going to school, but the bulk of movement of people over space is a function of them seeking employment opportunities or leaving a place where there isn’t employment opportunities."" Another factor playing into the state’s relatively high population increases, Potter said, is a ""fairly healthy"" natural rate of increase, meaning births in Texas outnumbering deaths. Like Potter, William Frey, a Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program senior fellow, attributed the growth to fertility rates and domestic migration, as well as immigration. ""Texas is unusual because it’s one of the bigger attractions for immigrants in the United States but also has really stood out in term of domestic migration,"" Frey said. ""It’s one of the few states that have a large number of both."" Our Ruling Straus said: ""Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country."" Census Bureau statistics show that Texas, indeed, is growing faster than the United States as a whole. Experts explain that the rate of population growth is due to its birth rate, foreign immigration and migration from other states. Although Texas is growing faster that the country as a whole, it is not the fastest growing state. Although it ranked second behind North Dakota in 2014, it dropped behind North Dakota, Colorado, Nevada and Florida in 2015, according to data released after Straus published his video. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.",/factchecks/2016/jan/30/joe-straus/joe-straus-accurately-says-texas-growing-twice-fas/

John McCain on target about American reliance on Russian rocket engines
","The United States outsources the process of sending its military satellites into space, and to Russia no less, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said during a hearing on military space launches Jan. 27. ""Today Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground,"" said McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The context of McCain’s statements comes on the heels of legislation he introduced Thursday to repeal a provision that allows the government to use Russian-made rocket engines to send U.S. military satellites into space. The provision was reversed when Congress passed a $1.1 trillion spending bill, averting a government shutdown, in December. He noted that using the Russian engines, RD-180s, benefits Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ""gang of corrupt cronies."" NPO Energomash produces the RD-180s. According to Russian Embassy spokesman Yury Melnik, NPO Energomash is managed by RKK Energiya, whose major stockholder is the Russian government. Here are McCain’s full remarks: ""In stark contrast to the reviews under way for satellites already in space, the (Defense) Department appears less interested in rapidly addressing our most immediate threat: our reliance on Russian-made rocket engines. Today Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground. Yet the Department of Defense has actively sought to undermine – with the support of United Launch Alliance (ULA) and the parochial motivations of Sen. (Richard) Shelby, R-Ala., and Sen. (Dick) Durbin, D-Ill. – the direction of this committee to limit that risk and end the use of the Russian made RD-180 by the end of this decade."" We wondered whether American satellites really take flight using Russian engines. Cleared for takeoff McCain press aide Julie Tarallo said the United States has relied on Russian engines in recent years, which independent experts confirmed. Richard Bloom is the director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott. He said the United States has used the RD-180s since 2000. The first flight occurred that year, according to Melnik. ""He’s certainly correct, the U.S. has been dependent on the Russian Federation,"" Bloom said. While Bloom noted that ""national security"" can be defined in a multitude of ways, from 2000 to 2010 he said there were about 29 U.S. space launches using the RD-180. ""The Russian Federation has a valuable capability,"" he said. ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin that started in 2006, has a contract with the Air Force to launch the satellites. They also use the RD-180s on their Atlas V rocket. ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye told PolitiFact/ABC 15 in a prepared statement via email that a new, American engine is ""being developed."" McCain’s committee supported previous measures to prohibit the use of the engines. With the space race behind us, using Russia’s help in the outer world is nothing new. As we previously reported in a July 2011 fact-check of Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio, NASA has had a contract to pay the Russians to send someone to the International Space Station for more than a decade. While NASA announced in September 2014 that American companies Boeing and SpaceX would work on transporting American astronauts to the Space Station, NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said the agency still has a contract with the Russians from 2018 through June 2020. NASA astronauts have flown on Russian spacecrafts since the 1990s. What’s the risk? That’s a bit harder to define. In 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin threatened to ban the export of Russian rockets to help fuel the U.S. satellite program. That would leave the United States without a way to get many of its satellites into space. However, the Russians never followed through on that threat. Our ruling  McCain said, ""Today Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground."" That’s correct, though the level to which that represents a risk, as McCain said, is somewhat unknown. Russia did at one point threaten to stop exporting the Russian-made engines fueling the U.S. satellite program. But it didn’t follow through. The U.S. government’s goal is to eventually end this dependence on Russian-made engines, but, for now, that is not the case. McCain’s statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/30/john-mccain/john-mccain-right-about-american-reliance-russian-/

Paul Saldaña says Texas law requires high school registrars to make eligible students vote
","At a January 2016 ""civic summit"" hosted and aired by Austin’s KLRU-TV, Paul Saldaña, a member of Austin’s school board, responded to a question about improving voter turnout among Latino residents by saying participation starts within each family but also involves the schools. Saldaña made us wonder when he said: ""We actually have a state law that requires every public and private high school in the state of Texas to have an actual voter registrar"" on ""campus and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become 18 and become eligible to vote, that they vote."" The deadline to register to vote in the March 2016 party primaries is Feb. 1, 2016. Saldaña, asked about what he said, told us by phone he was reflecting on a 1980s-era law. However, the board vice president said by email, he’d meant to say only that each registrar’s responsibility was to make sure eligible students registered -- not that the students went on to vote. ""What's interesting is that even though this has been part of our Texas election code,"" he wrote, ""not too many folks seem to be aware of it."" 1983 law Mark us guilty on that count. But an online search brought us to section 13.046 of the Texas election code, ""High School Deputy Registrars,"" stating that each ""principal of a public or private high school or the principal's designee shall serve as a deputy registrar"" in the local county. Each registrar, the law says, ""may distribute registration application forms to and receive registration applications submitted to the deputy in person from students and employees of the school only."" The law goes on: ""At least twice each school year, a high school deputy registrar shall distribute an officially prescribed registration application form to each student who is or will be 18 years of age or older during that year."" So, there is a law requiring each high school to have a deputy voter registrar who makes voter registration applications available to eligible students. And, we learned, the law is unusual. Nationally, only North Carolina has a Texas-like statute, Michael Dolan of the National Conference of State Legislatures told us by email, though the organization knows of a dozen states that in some way regulate voter registration at high schools. Dolan said the North Carolina law requires every public high school to make voter registration forms available to students. We asked Sally Harlow of the Texas Legislative Reference Library about how the Texas law came to be. By email, she guided us to legislative records showing a Dallas Democrat, then-Rep. Paul Ragsdale, ushered the mandate into law in the 1983 legislative session. Few lawmakers voted against the deputy voter registrar requirement, the records show. At the time, Ragsdale described the action as necessary because ""difficulties have been experienced"" in some counties ""in going onto high school campuses to register eligible students to vote."" (Nationally, the voting age had been lowered from 21 to 18 by a constitutional amendment ratified by the states as of July 1971.) Texas rules The Texas law says each high school’s deputy registrar shall distribute the registration applications ""subject to rules prescribed by the secretary of state,"" the state’s chief elections officer, ""who shall prescribe any other needed procedures."" We turned to the relevant rules, last amended in July 1998, which state that each principal may designate an employee to be the deputy voter registrar. In the last month of each semester, the rules say, each school’s deputy voter registrar shall distribute voter registration applications and instructions to those students who are or will be 18 years old that semester and on request, applications and instructions may be distributed at any time. Also, the rules say, the deputy registrar must deliver completed applications to the county’s voter registrar or elections administrator ""as soon as possible after they are received."" The rules say that if the deputy registrar fails to fulfill the mandate, the principal shall relieve him or her and the principal ""shall resume the duties of high school deputy registrar until a new representative is designated."" 2016 letter to principals To our inquiry, Alicia Pierce, spokeswoman for the secretary of state’s office, said by email the agency doesn’t know how many students end up registering because the agency categorizes such registrations in a way that folds in other originating locations such as libraries. Generally, she said that twice a year, the agency sends each high school principal a letter reminding them of the registration mandate. Pierce emailed us the agency’s latest letter, sent to principals Jan. 4, 2016. The letter said: ""As a high school principal, it is your duty to register eligible high school students"" under the law ""as a high school deputy voter registrar, by distributing voter registration forms at least twice during the school year."" The  letter also noted the expectation that principals do so at the end of each semester. But with the March primaries looming, the letter went on, ""we also encourage you to distribute and collect voter registration applications in time for the students to register before"" Feb. 1. Also noted in the letter: A student may register if she or he is 17 years, 10 months of age, though the student must be 18 on or before election day to cast a ballot. We asked Pierce if the law goes so far as to require the deputy voter registrars to register eligible students. By phone, Pierce said a registrar isn’t expected to press students into registering though if a student returns a filled-in application, she said, the registrar must ferry the application along. Our ruling Saldaña said a Texas law requires every high school to have a voter registrar ""and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become 18 and become eligible to vote, that they vote."" A 1983 law requires every high school to have a deputy voter registrar tasked with giving eligible students voter registration applications. Each registrar also must make sure submitted applications are appropriately handled. However, the law doesn’t require registrars to make every eligible student register; it's up to each student to act or not. Also, as Saldaña acknowledged, registrars aren’t required to ensure that students vote. We rate this statement Half True.

"['Environment', 'New Hampshire', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Jobs', 'Labor', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton claims more U.S. jobs in solar than oil
","Hillary Clinton is bullish on clean energy as an economic opportunity for the United States. In a meeting last month with the Concord Monitor’s editorial board, she held out the burgeoning production of wind turbines in Iowa as evidence of the country’s potential future as the ""clean energy superpower of the 21st century."" And what’s more, the fall of fossil fuels in favor of renewables is already happening, she said. ""We now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil,"" the former Democratic secretary of state told the newspaper on Dec. 8, 2015. We’ve heard that the renewable energy market has been heating up. And sure, some of our neighbors are putting up solar panels, and these shrunken gas prices can’t be good for the oil industry. But could the total number of jobs in the field of solar power truly have surpassed the long-established and machinery-heavy oil industry? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to have a look at the numbers. Labor statistics Clinton’s campaign cited two sources: the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics and The Solar Foundation. First, we’ll shine some light on the state of America’s solar industry. The Solar Foundation estimated last year that there were roughly 174,000 people who spend at least half their working hours ""on solar-related work,"" a term that goes undefined in the nonprofit’s 67-page annual report. It notes that 90 percent or more of those workers spent 100 percent of their time on ""solar-related work."" Of the total, 97,000 are employed by installation companies, 32,000 are in manufacturing, 20,000 are in sales and distribution, 15,000 are in project development and 9,000 are classified as ""other,"" including research and development firms, nonprofits, government agencies and academic researchers. A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, Caila Pinkleton, pointed by email to one specific solar-related current employment statistic. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed 5,170 solar photovoltaic installers employed in May 2014, a small fraction of the 97,000 people that The Solar Foundation said are employed by installation companies, of which the vast majority (92 percent) were installing photovoltaics. So there’s some discrepancy in the total number of jobs. The Solar Foundation, which describes on its website that its mission ""is to increase understanding of solar energy through strategic research and education that transforms markets,"" didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics left open the possibility that the total number of jobs could be higher, noting that some solar thermal installers are classified under ""plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters"" and some solar photovoltaic electricians are listed under ""electricians."" What’s clear, according to the Solar Foundation’s numbers, is that the industry is growing quickly: from 93,502 in 2010 to 173,807 in 2014. The nonprofit recently released its updated census for this year, which showed 208,859 solar workers as of November 2015, only slightly below the 210,600 projection from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industries have been falling in employment, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. While Clinton specifically mentioned the oil industry, not gas, her campaign only furnished data combining the two industries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t keep individual data for each. Clinton’s campaign referenced total employment in oil and gas extraction in December 2015, which was 185,000, compared with the 209,000 solar workers that The Solar Foundation reported in November 2015. If that was the whole story, she’d be right. But just as the solar industry has installers, manufacturers, salespeople and researchers, so does the oil and gas industry. Besides oil and gas extraction, there’s also support activities for oil and gas operations: 266,000 jobs. Oil and gas pipeline production: 124,000 jobs. Mining and oil and gas field machinery: 73,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You might even want to include the 912,000 people who work at gas stations. We aren’t going to be that pedantic. But the American Petroleum Institute is. It found that in 2007 the oil and natural gas industry directly provided 2.1 million jobs. Including the indirect impacts, API claims the industry supports more than 9 million American jobs. While this type of study is undoubtedly commissioned to promote the industry, a critic could say the same of The Solar Foundation’s work. Using only Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers, and discounting gas station employees, we’re still left with about 648,000 jobs in oil and gas spread over extraction, support activities, pipeline production and field machinery, compared to 210,000 for solar. In other words, for Clinton’s claim to be true, two out of three Americans employed by the oil and gas industries would have to be working solely with gas. Even then – comparing conservative Bureau of Labor Statistics data against generous figures from The Solar Foundation – oil would come out slightly ahead. Our ruling Clinton said ""we now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil."" But the numbers don’t support that claim. For the oil industry, she didn’t look at the whole picture. And self-reported calculations by both the solar and oil and gas industry aren’t close. Oil and gas reports 10 times more jobs.   Independent data from the federal government also shows more jobs in oil and gas compared to solar.   Maybe someday Clinton’s claim will be true, but for now we rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claims-more-jobs-solar-oil/

Ron Johnson wants 100,000 troops in Iraq, Syria to fight ISIS, Senate challenger Russ Feingold says
","With the 2016 campaign getting more contentious, Democrat Russ Feingold responded to a question about President Barack Obama's performance on foreign policy by pivoting to his opponent, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson. The question was posed by host Mike Gousha at a Jan. 26, 2016 forum at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee. Feingold, who lost the Senate seat to Johnson in 2010, commented on Obama’s record in the international arena. Then he turned to terrorism, saying ""no one in Washington has taken"" threats from foreign extremists ""as seriously as they should, and now we have to deal with it. ""But those who say the way to handle it is to go put 100,000 troops into the area where ISIS is -- which is what Senator Johnson wants to do -- how does this work?"" Gousha interjected, saying Johnson has talked about only 25,000 of the troops being American, with the rest coming from an international coalition. Feingold responded by asserting that Johnson said there should be 100,000 troops total, including 25,000 Americans. So let’s sort out what Johnson has called for. Johnson’s general position As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, Johnson is among the most aggressive voices in his party in proposing a ground invasion to drive the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria out of those two countries. As early as October 2014, he called for ""boots on the ground,"" a position in line with that of most of the 2016 GOP candidates for president. But Johnson has not been so clear about the numbers of troops. Feingold’s evidence In backing Feingold’s claim, his campaign spokesman said the former senator was referring to comments Johnson made to Gousha during a television interview in November 2015. The campaign also cited a Huffington Post article about that interview that carried this headline: ""GOP senator wants a coalition of 100,000 troops in Iraq and Syria."" But the headline goes further than what Johnson actually said. Here’s the exchange, with Gousha pressing Johnson for a number of American troops: Gousha: Senator, you've said on a number of occasions that you favor U.S. troops as part of this coalition going in to these countries to help move ISIS out of its safe areas. How many American     troops would you support sending overseas to accomplish this mission? Johnson: Well, I'm not a military expert. The model I use is what George H.W. Bush did when Saddam Hussein went into Kuwait …. Gousha: And I know you're not a military guy, but is it 10,000? Is it 20,000? Give us some idea of what you're talking about in terms of an American presence overseas. Johnson: I've been told by military experts that ISIS -- in terms, militarily -- is not particularly capable … militarily, it really would not be that difficult. Probably it wouldn't take anywhere near the effort that the first Gulf War did. I've been hearing 25,000 troops, a total coalition of maybe 100,000. I really don't know the exact numbers, but we have to be committed to the goal …. So, Johnson didn’t commit to a number. And he hasn’t in other interviews. The previous month, Johnson said he didn’t know how many U.S. troops would be needed in Syria, although that was in reference to responding to a refugee crisis. And the following month, Johnson indicated to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he was open to the numbers of American troops that were being discussed. Asked if it would take more than 20,000 to 25,000 U.S. troops to retake and hold the territory now held by ISIS, he responded: ""What’s the alternative? … This is a real and growing threat."" But also in December 2015, Johnson said experts have talked about the need for 10,000 American troops, something he said he would support if Obama committed to an effective strategy. In contrast, Republican U.S. senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina called specifically for 100,000 foreign troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Graham also called for 10,000 American troops. Our rating Feingold said Johnson wants to put 100,000 troops, including 25,000 Americans, ""into the area where ISIS is."" Johnson favors sending foreign and American troops to Iraq and Syria in an effort to defeat ISIS there. He’s said he has heard experts say the effort would require 100,000 troops, including 25,000 from the United States. He indicated he might support those levels, or perhaps 10,000 American troops, but didn’t go so far as to call for any particular numbers.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz's Pants on Fire claim that health care law is nation's 'biggest job-killer'
","To a man, the seven candidates on the stage at the Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, oppose Obamacare. When Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was asked what he would do for the millions of people who have gained health insurance thanks to the program, Cruz was quick to describe his take on the health care law’s failings. ""First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster,"" Cruz said. ""It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket."" Virtually from the moment the Affordable Care Act was first debated, its critics have warned that it would wreck the economy. Those predictions, we found at least five times, were based on faulty evidence. Now Cruz is claiming that the critics were right, and it all has come to pass. Only that’s not true, either. At least in any way that the national data picks up. The government’s labor surveys give us a pretty good window into the number of people working in any given month. They also count the number of people who are working part-time but would rather have full-time work. We looked at those tallies at several points in the life of Obamacare: When it passed, when its earliest changes took effect, when people first got insured under the law, and today. The numbers run against Cruz’s statement. Not only has the number of jobs gone up, but the number of unwilling part-timers has gone down. We used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to build this table: April 2010 September 2010 January 2014 December 2015 Unemployment rate 9.9 9.5 6.6 5 Number of jobs (thousands) 139,297 139,396 145,092 149,929 Unwilling part-timers (thousands) 9,178 9,246 7,250 6,022   All of the job numbers have moved in a positive direction since April 2010, the first full month after President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. The unemployment rate has moved steadily from 9.9 percent to 5 percent. The economy has added about 10.7 million jobs. And the number of working people who have part-time work but would rather have full-time work has fallen by nearly 3 million. There was a brief rise in that number between April and September 2010, but the longer term trend is clearly one of decline. That’s not to say the Affordable Care Act deserves all the credit. The fact is many factors drive the labor market and the overall recovery from the Great Recession is the dominant player in this regard. Still, economist Gary Burtless at the Brookings Institution said job growth has been steady and nearly all of it has been in full-time positions. The pattern, he said contradicts ""the prediction that the law would push employers to reduce the hours of their employees in order to avoid the law's penalties on employers who do not provide insurance to the full-time employees."" ""In the face of this evidence, critics of the Affordable Care Act keep telling us their predictions of the ‘job killing’ impacts of Obamacare have been borne out by experience,"" Burtless said. ""So far as I can see, this is flatly untrue."" Maxim Pinkovskiy, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, compared states that had very different starting points when Obamacare was passed. Pinkovskiy looked at Minnesota, a state with a low uninsurance rate, and Texas, where the uninsurance rate was relatively high. In his study, Texas was considered more exposed to the impacts of the Affordable Care Act because the law’s primary effect was to increase the number of insured people (despite Texas’ decision against expanding Medicaid). Pinkovskiy found that in terms of jobs, Texas grew at a faster clip than Minnesota. ""More exposed states and counties have, if anything, experienced a rise in employment, salaries and output relative to less exposed areas with the implementation or the enactment of the ACA,"" Pinkovskiy wrote. Bowen Garrett, an economist at the Urban Institute, co-authored a study with colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago that compared states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare and those that didn’t. The researchers found no predictable effect on labor market trends. Garrett told us that based on some economic models, it’s possible that the Affordable Care Act could have increased the number of part-time jobs by about 250,000. ""But that’s far from the millions some have claimed, and it’s not clear that the ACA is responsible,"" Garrett said. A study in Health Affairs found no evidence that the law has led to more part-time work overall, but within certain groups -- people with little education and those 60-64 years old -- there might be a modest rise. We reached out to the Cruz campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Cruz said that Obamacare cost the country millions of jobs and had forced millions into working part-time. The government’s employment surveys show no sign of that occurring. By every measure, millions more people are working and millions fewer are stuck unwillingly in part-time work since the time the Affordable Care Act became law. The law might have affected part-time work for certain kinds of people, but that didn’t change the improvement in the overall numbers. Many of these numbers, especially the well-reported unemployment rate, are readily available and independent economic studies uncovered no sign that job growth has suffered at all under the new health care law.",/factchecks/2016/jan/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-pants-fire-claim-health-care-law-nations/

Rubio says he has 'never supported cap and trade,' despite energy deal as Florida speaker
","Sen. Marco Rubio defended past support of a cap-and-trade bill in the Florida House by saying it was an attempt to protect the state from future federal regulations. Fox News moderator Bret Baier asked Rubio about the issue at a Republican presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28, 2016. Baier said Rubio had ""wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap-and-trade system"" while he was House speaker in 2008, and asked why Rubio had changed his mind. Rubio denied he backed a popular plan supported by then-Gov. Charlie Crist, claiming he was looking to insulate Florida from restrictions a future president might impose. ""I have never supported cap and trade, and I never thought it was a good idea, and I was clear about that at the time,"" Rubio said. Rubio has been very outspoken during this campaign about his opposition to cap and trade, which lets businesses trade pollution credits if they don't meet emission caps. But is his retelling of what happened in 2008 accurate? Cap and trade mission We literally went to the tape to find out, because the key evidence in this claim is a snippet from a March 13, 2008, appearance Rubio made on WFSU’s Florida Face to Face. Rubio was discussing HB 7135, an energy and climate change bill championed by Crist that included the Florida Climate Protection Act. That part of the law allowed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to formulate a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse emissions from electric utilities. ""Florida should position itself for what I believe is inevitable, and that is a federal cap-and-trade program. Florida should do everything it can to be an early complier so it can access early compliance funds and so that it can help influence what that cap-and-trade looks like at the federal level,"" Rubio said on the show, which ran during the legislative session. ""And so I’m in favor of giving the Department of Environmental Protection a mandate that they go out and design a cap-and-trade or a carbon-tax program and bring it back to the Legislature for ratification some time in the next two years."" Crist used a portion of this clip during his 2010 Senate primary campaign against Rubio in an attempt to show Rubio favored a cap-and-trade program. WFSU, which operates The Florida Channel covering state government, demanded Crist stop using footage of the show because of a law barring use of its footage in political campaigns. This limited portion of the show has been resurrected online during the presidential primary, leading some conservative sites to question Rubio’s stance on the issue. But wait, as they say, there’s more. Rubio’s campaign had complained the clip was out of context, and it appears it really was. They have pointed to a longer edit of the footage that shows Rubio going on to say: ""I’m in favor of them designing it. I’m not in favor of them designing it and implementing it. I’m in favor of them designing it and then bringing it back to the Legislature. The way we’re going toclean up our environment, the way we’re going to lower carbon emissions, is not through government mandates."" That certainly changes the context of his statement. Rubio’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s questions about his potential support of cap and trade, but they have addressed this issue before. In 2007, Rubio wrote an op-ed for the Miami Herald that said Crist should be applauded for his efforts, but ""the government mandates he has proposed will not only fail to achieve their desired result, they carry actual negative consequences."" Rubio did cite proposals from his book 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future to increase ethanol production, develop bio-fuels and provide tax incentives for better fuel efficiency. But he concluded that ""instead of adopting measures that will have little if any impact on our environment and make life in Florida more expensive, we need a strategy that encourages environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity, while continuing to stimulate our economy."" Rubio also said in a March 2007 speech that Florida was ripe to change energy policy because it was both environmentally sound and potentially lucrative. ""This nation, and ultimately the world, is headed towards emission caps and energy diversification,"" he said. ""Those changes will require technological advances that make those measures cost effective. The demand toward such advances will create an industry to meet it. Florida should become the Silicon Valley of that industry."" Rubio did seem to change his tune a bit by 2009, when he was being criticized for his full-throated opposition of cap and trade after presiding over the passage of HB 7135. Environmentalists and scientists noted Rubio had shepherded the entire process as House speaker. ""The legislation was passed to move forward on cap-and-trade policy, and certainly Marco Rubio didn't stand in the way of that legislation passing and my understanding was that he was supportive of the process,"" John Reilly, a leading climate change expert from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hired by Rubio to advise lawmakers, told the Miami Herald. ""He certainly seemed to accept the science of climate change."" Rubio argued then that he wanted to take executive authority away from Crist, although the DEP countered they would have always needed legislative approval. Cap and trade planning fell by the wayside as Crist waged a losing Senate primary battle against Rubio. ""It has worked out as it was designed to work out, which was to stop a cap-and-trade system in Florida,"" Rubio said in 2009. Some critics at the time doubted that was Rubio's true plan, as it was a big gamble that the Legislature would shut down any proposed DEP cap and trade proposal. But a 2015 article in the National Journal said that while the bill passed (and it passed the House and Senate unanimously), Rubio did add wording that prevented the plan from being implemented. The final bill indeed only allowed DEP to develop a potential plan, and required legislative approval to become practice. The National Journal quoted former House minority leader and state Rep. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach, who said, ""I fully credit him with the gutting of the bill."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""I have never supported cap and trade."" As House speaker in Florida, Rubio did preside over the unanimous passage of an energy bill that allowed the state to develop a cap-and-trade plan for electric utility emissions. But it appears his comments on the bill have been taken out of context, and that there may have been some legislative craftiness afoot. Rubio said he wanted Florida to cook up a plan of its own before federal regulations were imposed on the state. He also voiced opposition to government mandates and inserted a roadblock to letting any plan actually be implemented, details that get left out when Rubio is accused of supporting the measure. He now is much more vocal in his opposition of cap and trade, but it looks as if he has always favored a largely hands-off approach from government.

Jennifer Granholm says Americans would rather elect an atheist than a socialist
","Is Democrat Bernie Sanders going to suffer in the polls because he calls himself a socialist? Jennifer Granholm, the former Democratic governor of Michigan and a Hillary Clinton backer, thinks so. During the Jan. 24 edition of ABC's This Week, she said ""the word socialist is a really hard word"" for voters. ""Now, I love Bernie Sanders, really, I appreciate the fact that he's bringing out young people. But when you look at that word ‘socialist,’ the Gallup poll did an analysis of what are the characteristics that people would vote for in a president. 'Would you vote for a Mormon?' 'Would you vote for a Jew?' 'Would you vote for a Catholic?' When they get to the question on would you vote for an atheist, it is -- or, excuse me, a socialist, it is even less popular than voting for atheists,"" Granholm said. ""That is why it's an issue."" Because the polls say that Sanders is giving Clinton a run for her money, we wondered whether calling yourself a socialist really carries the type of stigma that Granholm described. We contacted Granholm's office but didn't hear back. The Gallup poll in question is a survey of 1,527 adults in June 2015. The survey found 47 percent of respondents would vote for a socialist presidential candidate nominated by their party even if the candidate was ""generally well-qualified."" Fifty percent would not. An atheist candidate would be tolerable to only 58 percent, with 40 percent saying they would not vote for any atheist candidate. Here's the list: Willingness to vote for a qualified candidate who is . . .  a Catholic 93% Jewish 91% a Muslim 60% a woman 92% a Mormon 81% an atheist 58% black 92% gay or lesbian 74% a socialist 47% Hispanic 91% an evangelical Christian 73% Survey taken June 2-7, 2015 In a similar vein, a 2010 Fox News survey found that while only 39 percent of Americans would be comfortable with having an atheist on the Supreme Court, support for a socialist was even lower — 31 percent. Yet if Americans have such antipathy to socialists, why is Sanders, a self-declared socialist, doing so well? For one thing, Sanders makes it clear that he's not a socialist in the old Soviet Union sense. He often calls himself a democratic socialist who talks about the type of socialism seen in the Scandinavian countries, where the political system is democratic. His socialism is often in line with what would be considered strong liberal beliefs. PolitiFact explored the issue in detail in August 2015. Scott Clifford, a political scientist as the University of Houston, said it's important to remember that each person surveyed was ""asked not about support for atheists/socialists in general, but in the context of their own party nominating one."" So Democrats will be more open to socialist ideas because the party tends to be liberal, ""home to secular Americans,"" he said. The Republican Party tends to be home to more evangelicals and other religious traditionalists, Clifford said by email, so Republicans would be naturally wary of a nominee who is a socialist. ""After all, a Republican socialist is effectively an oxymoron in modern American politics,"" he said. That was clear when Gallup broke the results into party lines. Willingness to vote for Democrats Republicans Difference An evangelical Christian 66% 84% 18 points An atheist 64% 45% 19 points A gay or lesbian 85% 61% 24 points A Muslim 73% 45% 28 points A socialist 59% 26% 33 points John Geer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, said there are a lot of misunderstandings about the term socialist, ""so the survey questions you have in Gallup are probably not very indicative of the amount of support socialists might have."" The term ""socialist"" may lose some of its sting because Sanders offers it as a solution to voters’ concerns, such as income inequality, he said. He is also highlighting the idea that other industrialized countries that have embraced socialism are doing better on matters such as health care, ""and people are giving him high marks for dealing with the (socialist) question directly and not trying to hedge,"" Geer said. Whether Sanders can change the country's aversion to actually voting for a socialist remains to be seen. Our ruling Granholm said a Gallup survey found that the idea of voting for a socialist for president is even less popular than voting for an atheist. That's precisely what was found in the poll, the first time Gallup has asked about socialist presidential candidates. We rate the claim as True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/29/jennifer-granholm/jennifer-granholm-says-americans-would-rather-elec/

Obama administration admits cash from Iran deal will go directly to terrorism, Sen. Ron Johnson says
","In a 2016 U.S. Senate race that’s going negative, Russ Feingold has ripped Ron Johnson for opposing virtually any federal minimum wage (Our rating: True) and for saying he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the Veterans Administration (Our rating: Half True). But the target of the latest political missiles are Feingold, the Democrat who lost the Wisconsin Senate seat to Johnson, the Republican incumbent, in 2010. One of the attacks, which also targets President Barack Obama, was made by Johnson on Jan. 22, 2016. A Johnson campaign email, signed by a campaign staffer, starts this way, with a reference to a statement from the day before: Hey all, In light of the Obama administration admitting Thursday that money from its reckless Iran deal would go directly to terrorism, below are five crucial moments in Senator Feingold’s blind support for the deal. Johnson’s assertion -- that the administration has admitted that money from the Iran nuclear deal would go directly to terrorism -- doesn’t come out of thin air. But is it air tight? Iran nuclear deal The Iran deal was made with the United States, China and three other world powers. Iran, which was within three months of getting a nuclear bomb, committed to not pursue nuclear weapons. The deal contains other elements, but a key one is that all of the European Union and most American sanctions against Iran were lifted. Critics say that effectively amounts to a $150 billion check (though some say it’s more like $100 billion) to Iran -- a reference to the amount of Iran’s assets frozen in foreign banks. The Washington Post reported that Iran has more than $100 billion in available frozen assets — most of it in banks in China, Japan and South Korea — but that slightly less than half will more or less automatically go to preexisting debts. ""How the rest is spent will reveal the direction of internal power struggles between Iranian hard-liners and pragmatists,"" the article said. John Kerry To back the claim about the Obama administration and funds going directly to terrorism, the Johnson campaign email links to a January 2016 news article in The Hill about comments made by Secretary of State John Kerry. Kerry had told CNBC’s ""Squawk Box"" that Iran would get only $55 billion of the $150 billion referenced, saying the rest is committed to China and other countries: I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. To some degree, I’m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented. But I can tell you this: Right now, we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. I’m sure at some point, some of it will. To be clear, Iran is one of only three countries (Sudan and Syria are the others) that the U.S. State Department has designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.   The IRGC, as Iran’s premier security institution, fields an army, navy and air force and ""presides over a vast power structure with influence over almost every aspect of Iranian life,"" according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the IRGC’s elite Quds Force a terrorist supporter for aiding the Taliban and other terrorist organizations. So, Kerry was saying some of the money ultimately will end up with organizations involved in terrorism. But that’s not the same as funds going directly to terrorism, as Johnson claimed. Kerry did tell reporters the same day, according to the Associated Press, that he understands the IRGC is ""already complaining that they are not getting the money."" But Kerry also said the Obama administration believes the amount of money that might flow to terrorist groups will be limited because ""the demands of Iran and of the Rouhani administration and of the supreme leader for development in their country are such that there is no way they can succeed in doing what they want to do if they are very busy funding a lot of terrorism and if they are putting money into that kind of enterprise and not into things they need to do to fund their economy."" It’s worth noting that Kerry’s comments weren’t the first of their kind. Johnson’s campaign cited to us statements made in August 2015 by senior administration officials to a U.S. Senate committee. The officials said, according to U.S. News & World Report, they were ""nearly certain"" Iran would continue funding terrorism with the tens of billions of dollars it stands to gain from the nuclear deal. The White House did not respond to our requests for comment. Our rating Johnson said Obama's administration has admitted that money from its Iran nuclear deal ""would go directly to terrorism."" Administration officials have said they expect some portion of money from the deal with Iran, which is aimed at preventing Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, will end up with groups that are labeled as terrorists. For a claim that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/29/ron-johnson/obama-administration-admits-cash-iran-deal-will-go/

Donald Trump falsely claims he 'never once asked' for Megyn Kelly's removal from debate
","If you read the news, Donald Trump’s boycott of the Fox News/Google debate is the result of his ongoing war with anchor Megyn Kelly. Trump, however, says that’s not true. He says a biting Fox News release is why he pulled the plug. ""Well, I’m not a person that respects Megyn Kelly very much. I think she’s highly overrated. Other than that, I don’t care,"" he told CNN an hour before the debate. ""I never once asked that she be removed. I don’t care about her being removed. What I didn’t like was that public relations statement where they were sort of taunting. I didn’t think it was appropriate. I didn’t think it was nice."" His assertion that he ""never once"" asked for Kelly’s removal piqued our interest. We took a look at Trump’s public comments over the past couple of days. Contrary to what Trump said on CNN, he had been calling for Kelly’s exclusion for days before the debate and the ""taunting"" Fox statement. Here’s the timeline: Jan. 23: This latest chapter of the Trump-Kelly spat started when Trump voiced his disapproval a few days before the debate on Twitter. ""Based on @MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 23 and made similar comments in a campaign rally in Iowa the same day, Fox responded, ""Megyn Kelly has no conflict of interest. Donald Trump is just trying to build up the audience for Thursday's debate, for which we thank him."" Trump repeated his position that Kelly ""should recuse herself from the upcoming Fox News debate,"" according to Boston Globe reporter James Pindell. Jan. 24: According to New York, Trump began to threaten a boycott a day later and toy with the idea of holding his own event. ""Let’s see what happens,"" Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the magazine. ""It’s fair to say Mr. Trump is a significant ratings driver for these debates. If we aren’t on stage for some reason, they wouldn’t have the record 24 million viewers and would be back with 1-2 million people."" Jan. 25: CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump if he’ll show up given his beef with Kelly. Trump gave conflicting responses but doubled down in his Kelly criticism. ""I’ll see. If I think I’ll be treated unfairly, I’ll do something else,"" he said. ""I think she’s very biased and I don’t think she can treat me fairly, but that doesn’t mean I don’t do the debate. I like doing the debates."" Fox responded, ""Sooner or later Donald Trump, even if he's president, is going to have to learn that he doesn't get to pick the journalists — we're very surprised he's willing to show that much fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly."" Trump’s indecision was echoed by Lewandowski, who told New York, ""We haven't said he'll be there, and we haven't said he won't be there. The bottom line is Megyn Kelly shouldn't be rewarded for her media bias."" Jan. 26: Two days before the debate, Trump polled his Twitter followers, asking,""Should I do the #GOPDebate?"" (Of over 150,000 responses, 56 percent were ""Yes."") In the tweet, Trump posted a link to an Instagram video, in which he said, ""Megyn Kelly is really biased against me. She knows that, I know that., everybody knows. Do you really think she can be unbiased in a debate?"" Trump also retweeted several attacks on Kelly including one that claimed, ""Fox will drop Kelly if it means no Trump."" Fox News released two statements in response. ""We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president — a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings,"" the network wrote. ""Megyn Kelly is an excellent journalist, and the entire network stands behind her — she will absolutely be on the debate stage on Thursday night,"" Fox News CEO Roger Ailes told Mediaite. Later that night, Trump hosted a press conference announcing that his boycott and veterans rally as a response to to the network ""playing games."" ""See, the point is with me they’re dealing with somebody that is a little different. They can’t toy with me like they toy with everybody else. So let them have their debate and let’s see how they do with their ratings,"" he said. ""I came here to do the debate. When they sent out the wise guy press releases done a little while ago, done by some PR person along with Roger Ailes, I said ‘bye bye,’ okay?"" Trump denied that he was afraid to debate, pointing out his participation and past performance, and reiterated his distaste for Kelly.   ""This to me isn’t a reporter. This to me is just a lightweight. Megyn Kelly shouldn’t be in the debate. I don’t care about Megyn -- when Megyn Kelly didn’t ask me a question, she made a statement last time, I thought it was inappropriate,"" he said. Fox, in turn, responded with another statement emphasizing Trump’s agenda against Kelly and alleging that Lewandowski had personally threatened the anchor: ""We’re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing – Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage."" Jan. 27: Trump took to Twitter to rebut claims that Kelly was why he pulled out: ""It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly."" He emphasized to Fox’s Bill O’Reilly that it was ultimately the network’s disrespectful statements that led to his decision: ""I was not treated well by Fox. They came out with this ridiculous P.R. statement, it was like drawn up by a child. And there was a taunt. And I said, you know, ""How much of this do you take?"" I have zero respect for Megyn Kelly. I don't think she's very good at what she does. I think she's highly overrated. And, frankly, she's the moderator, I thought her question last time was ridiculous."" Our ruling Trump said, ""I never once asked that (Megyn Kelly) be removed"" as a debate moderator. This statement greatly downplays Trump’s comments ahead of the debate, even if his absence really had more to do with a mocking Fox News release in the end. Trump mused about skipping the debate because of Kelly for a couple days before that news release. He went so far as to say Kelly ""should not be allowed"" to moderate, that she ""should recuse herself,"" and she ""shouldn’t be in the debate.""

Ben Carson: Stacked up, total pages of regulations from 2015 are 3 stories high
","There are too many government rules stifling small businesses, said neurosurgeon-turned-Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson at a Fox News debate in Des Moines, Iowa. ""Last year, there were an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations,"" he said at the Jan. 28 debate. ""If you stack that up, it would be a three-story building."" A few readers asked us if Carson’s claim was accurate, both the number of pages and subsequent height, so we decided to take a crack at it. Ream by ream Carson’s 81,000 pages figure refers to the number of pages that were published in the Federal Register, a daily journal of the U.S. government that contains agency rules, proposed rules and public notices. In each edition, the Register posts a running tally of the pages printed so far the year. The final total at the end of December is often used as a gauge of regulatory activity during the year. The Federal Register’s final tally for 2015 was 82,036 new pages of regulations, just over the figure Carson cited. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free market-focused policy group, this is a record. So far in Obama’s term, the government has published 555,882 pages of new regulations total. During the comparable period of former President George W. Bush’s term, the Register published 533,593 pages. Carson is right that 82,036 pages stacked up would, in fact, just about reach the height of a three-story building. Using standard printer paper as our gauge — 250 pages per inch — 82,036 pages would be about 330 inches tall, or 27 feet. Carson’s campaign sent us the same arithmetic. But there’s a big catch to these numbers: A large percentage of these pages don’t actually contain regulations or final rules. Deeper meaning The Register also includes notices about agency meetings and public comment periods, presidential documents and other items that are not considered rules. From 2010 through 2014, just 31 percent of pages actually contained rules, according to Federal Register data. Overall Register page counts ""may not be an accurate proxy for regulatory activity or measure of regulatory burden for several reasons,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in November 2014 report. The report noted that many of the pages ""typically have little, if anything to do with federal regulations,"" and many pages dealing with final rules don’t contain any regulatory language but rather explanations about public comments on the rule. The CRS noted, for example, that a 2013 rule enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act filled 137 pages, but only 16 pages detailed the rule itself. The Register page count is often cited because it’s easy to find, Cary Coglianese, a law professor and director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, told PolitiFact Virginia for a similar fact-check. ""I wouldn’t use it as an indication of the level of regulation because it’s so prone to having so much else in it,"" Coglianese said. ""The other thing to keep in mind is, just because you know something about the number of pages, (that) doesn’t tell you the wisdom of having those pages. It might be those pages are helping to save people’s lives or keeping banks from failing or airplanes from crashing."" Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, was also leery of citing the page count, telling PolitiFact Virginia that it’s his ""least favorite"" way to measure regulation. Other analysts have said the overall page count gives a general idea of the country’s regulatory environment, including one from the conservative American Enterprise Institute and another from the libertarian Cato Institute. James Gattuso, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact Virginia for a 2011 article that the annual page count ""as a very broad measure"" indicates more regulatory activity now compared to past years. Our ruling Carson said, ""Last year, there were an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up, it would be a three-story building."" The Federal Register published a little over 81,000 pages in 2015, and this many pages stacked on top of each other would reach about three stories high. However, many of these pages do not contain regulations. In recent years, only about 31 percent of Register pages contain final rules. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/29/ben-carson/ben-carson-stacked-total-pages-regulations-2015-ar/

Did Marco Rubio flip flop on amnesty?
","Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Marco Rubio to explain what sounded like different positions on granting legal status to people living in the country illegally, often described as amnesty, during the Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28. ""When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants,"" Kelly said during the Republican debate in Des Moines on Jan. 28. ""You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. senator as well."" She then played a series of video clips in which he spoke against ""amnesty"" in the past. Kelly then asked Rubio, ""Within two years of getting elected, you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?"" Rubio countered: ""No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty … ."" The back and forth between Rubio and Kelly continued. We decided to put Rubio’s past statements on amnesty on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures to what extent -- if any -- a politician has flipped on an issue. We don’t make a judgment on the change of position, only whether the candidate actually changed position or not. Rubio’s statements about amnesty in 2010 race Immigration reform was a hot topic in the 2010 Florida Senate race when Rubio ran against Charlie Crist, who ultimately ran as an independent, and Democrat Kendrick Meek. The conservative Shark Tank blogger, Javier Manjarres, asked Rubio in 2009: ""Are you pro-amnesty for illegal immigration?"" ""No, no. Never have been. In fact, I'm strongly against amnesty for a number of different reasons. The first is, I always use the example of the speed limit. If you say the speed limit is 70, but you don’t ticket people until they reach 80, well then the speed limit is really 80, it’s not 70. Amnesty is the same thing. The most important thing we need to do is enforce our existing laws. We have existing immigration laws that are not being adequately enforced. Nothing will make it harder to enforce your existing laws if you reward people who broke them."" Rubio also said: ""I will never support – never have and never will support – any effort to grant blanket, legalization, amnesty to folks who have entered or stayed in this country illegally."" In October 2009, Rubio said in an interview on WSRE in Pensacola: ""You cannot grant amnesty. If you grant amnesty, you will send a message that all you have to do is come into America illegally, stay here long enough, and we will let you stay. No. 2, you will destroy any hopes you have of having a legal immigration system that works. If the American people see us grant amnesty, they will never again believe in legal immigration, they will never again support it. And that’s wrong for our country, bad for our future."" ""In fact in ’86 when Reagan created an amnesty program, about 3 million people were granted amnesty. The result was that you had a bunch of people standing in line to enter legally who all claimed to be illegal because it was easier to get through the amnesty program. So we can’t have amnesty. ""And I think if you have a guest worker program in place that functions, the illegal folks that are here now will go back home through attrition."" In a Senate debate on Univision in September 2010, Rubio spoke against the DREAM Act, which Senate Democrats planned to debate the following week. Dreamers are young people brought to the United States illegally as children. ""What they're offering now is a bill that would in essence grant amnesty to 2 million people,"" Rubio said. ""It’s a cynical way to play politics with the lives of real people . . . This is what always happens with Hispanic voters in this country, they manipulate them come election time."" (The DREAM Act didn’t pass. In 2012, President Barack Obama announced Deferred Status for Childhood Arrivals to give temporary status, without a path to citizenship.) In an October 2010 debate, CNN’s Candy Crowley asked Rubio what he would do with the nation's 12 million undocumented immigrants: Rubio replied: ""Well, first, I don't believe we can grant amnesty, because I think it's unfair to the people who have entered this country legally. And I also think it will undermine ... Crowley: ""So you would send them all out of the country?"" Rubio: ""Well, it's not that simple. We all know -- I've never advocated that we round people up. I don't know anyone who is seriously talking about that. What I have said needs to have happen is we have to have a legal immigration system that functions."" Later in the debate, Rubio said: ""First of all, (an) earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It's what they call it. And the reality of it is this: This has to do with the bottom line that America cannot be the only country in the world that does not enforce its immigration laws. ""It is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally and knowingly did so. And all I'm saying is that if you do that ... you will never have a legal immigration system that works. No one is going to follow the law if there is an easier way to do it."" So in 2010, Rubio spoke against amnesty. In the CNN debate, Rubio opposed amnesty and linked it to an earned path to citizenship. This is a contrast to how he would later talk about the 2013 bill. What Rubio said about amnesty in 2011 and 2012 In May 2011, Rubio told Politico with respect to the DREAM Act, the solution ""can't be part of some broader effort to grant blanket amnesty."" ""I've said repeatedly I want to help these kids. I think these were kids who were brought to this country by their parents when they were very young; they were high academic achievers and want to go to college and contribute to America's future or serve in the armed forces,"" Rubio said. ""And I think helping them would be good for America. I do want to help them; I just don't think the DREAM Act is the right or best way to do it."" What Rubio said about amnesty in 2013 While a senator, Rubio co-authored the Gang of Eight bill in 2013 that included a pathway to citizenship. Ahead of the release of the bill, Rubio said that the proposal ""is not amnesty."" Rubio argued that the legislation outlining a 13-year pathway to legal status and eventually citizenship is not amnesty. He was right that the bill does not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods, and it was tougher than its 1986 predecessor. But it also offered a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries. We rated his statement that the proposal ""is not amnesty"" Half True. In April 2013, Rubio went on Meet the Press to defend the bill. Host David Gregory asked Rubio about his past and current positions on amnesty: Gregory: ""Three years ago in a debate you were clear on this. You said, ‘To earn a pathway to citizenship, you have to leave this country if you are here illegally -- go back home. And then you could come back in.’ You said an earned pathway was amnesty. Yet you've changed your mind here -- why?"" Rubio: ""Well, first of all, what I said throughout my campaign was that I was against a blanket amnesty, and this is not blanket amnesty. On the contrary, this is not blanket anything. And, secondly, it's not amnesty because you pay serious consequences for having violated the law. ""Third, we need to understand the existing law. The existing law does not prohibit someone -- the law today does not prohibit someone who violated the immigration laws from getting a green card. It simply says you have to leave the United States, and you have to wait 10 years."" He then recapped the provisions of the bill that include the waiting period. The bill never reached a vote in the House and died. Rubio now favors a piecemeal approach rather than one comprehensive bill. Our rating Rubio opposed amnesty while running for Senate in 2010. He flatly said that he would oppose granting ""blanket, legalization, amnesty"" in an interview with a conservative blogger. In a CNN debate that year, he again opposed amnesty and linked it to a path to citizenship when he said that an ""earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty"" and that it would be unfair to ""create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally and knowingly did so."" But in 2013, he was one of eight authors of a Senate bill that included a path to citizenship and declared that it was not amnesty. Rubio can argue that the bill -- which died in the House -- was not ""blanket amnesty,"" because it included significant hurdles including fines and a waiting period. That’s a partial change of position, so we rate it a Half Flip.  ",/factchecks/2016/jan/29/marco-rubio/did-marco-rubio-flip-flip-amnesty/

Budgets from Ferguson, Mo., don't support Rand Paul's claim on the city's reliance on civil fines
","How to relieve the tension between police officers and the communities they serve was a topic during the Jan. 28, 2016, Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa. The question specifically focused on Ferguson, Mo., the site of protests and riots after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown in August 2014. When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was asked to address the issue, he said, ""I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem. One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death."" ""Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job,"" Paul said. We wondered whether fines actually represented a third of Ferguson's budget. The short answer: No. Ferguson's annual operating budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, lists actual revenue and expenditures for 2012, forecasted revenues and expenditures for 2013, and budgeted estimates for 2014. In 2012, revenue from ""fines and public safety"" was $2.2 million out of a budget of $19.5 million. That's 11 percent. That revenue was expected to go up to $2.6 million on a $25.9 million budget, or 10 percent. And for the 2014 fiscal year, Ferguson was expecting fines and public safety revenue to jump even higher, to $2.7 million in a budget of $26.4 million. That means that that line item would be bringing in, once again, 10 percent of the revenue needed to run the city. Even if you look at income from the ""fines and public safety"" line item and only compare it to revenue -- and not the total budget -- you don't come close to the 33 percent or so Rand is talking about. It's 13 percent for 2012, 13 percent for 2013 and 14 percent for 2014. When Paul's spokesman got back to us, she directed us to the probe of the Ferguson Police Department by the U.S. Justice Department. Released in March 2015, it reports on efforts by the city to use Municipal Court fees and fines to increase revenue, particularly on missed court appearances and missed payments. The report notes, ""The court’s practices also impose unnecessary harm, overwhelmingly on African-American individuals."" The Justice Department report says that for the 2015 fiscal year, the city was expecting to collect $3.09 million in fees, fines and costs, with all revenues expected to total $13.26 million. That's 23 percent of revenue from fees and fines. However, that didn't happen. The city's latest budget, submitted June 24, 2015, specifically declares, ""It is not the city's policy to maximize its government finances through the use of the judicial process. Therefore, court fines are not considered a targeted revenue source that the City strives to achieve."" That's reflected in the numbers. While the city said it actually collected $2.1 million for its $13.2 million budget in 2014, it was expecting to get just $1 million in fines and public safety revenue in 2015 on a $14.4 million budget. That's 16 percent and 7 percent respectively. Our ruling Paul asserted during the Republican debate that, ""A third of the budget for the city of Ferguson (Mo.) was being reaped by civil fines."" The evidence is clear that the city was heavily dependent on fines and fees for its revenue, and Paul's comments about the effect on residents is noted. But we found that Paul seriously overstated that reliance. It went as high as 16 percent in 2014 and was expected to drop to 7 percent the following year in reaction to public outrage. Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/29/rand-paul/budgets-ferguson-mo-dont-support-rand-pauls-claim-/

Congress didn't stiff retirees and give itself a raise
","A Facebook post gives the impression that Congress is sticking it to ordinary folks when it comes to Social Security and disability benefits, while handsomely taking care of itself. ""Congress rejects $336 month increase in SS/SSDI but approves $8,872 month increase for themselves,"" the post says. ""Vote them out!!!"" The claim is a head turner, partly because Social Security is so big. The $1 trillion-a-year program helps more than 63 million retirees, the disabled and their families.  But it’s wrong on both counts. FactCheck.org checked the same claim in June, saying it was made in a viral post on Facebook, and found it false. Our friends pointed out that: 1. Annual cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits are determined not by Congress but by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which is calculated by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.  We found that the cost-of-living increase for 2020, which was announced nearly two months before the post we’re checking, is 1.6%.  For a worker retiring at full retirement age, the maximum Social Security benefit in 2020 is $3,011 per month, up $150 from 2019. 2. At the time of the FactCheck.org check, Congress had not decided whether to allow an automatic increase in pay for its members of 2.6% for 2020. That would have meant an additional $4,500 annually — not ""$8,872 monthly.""  A deal for the $4,500 pay raise fell apart after a group of freshmen Democrats facing tough re-election campaigns asked their leader not to move forward, the New York Times reported. That means the annual salary for members of the House and Senate remains at $174,000. (Leaders earn more.) As we’ve reported, under federal law, congressional pay raises are fixed to the Employment Cost Index, which measures changes in wages. The raises are automatic each year unless Congress votes it down — which it has done every year since 2009. A Facebook posts says ""Congress rejects $336 (per) month increase in"" Social Security and disability benefits ""but approves $8,872 (per) month increase for themselves."" Cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security are determined by a federal agency using a consumer price index measure, not by Congress. And Congress hasn’t allowed itself a pay raise since 2009.

Social media post recycles debunked quotes by Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, other Democrats
","Fabricated or misreported quotes by Democratic politicians continue to circulate on social media. A simple black-and-white text post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post includes the following purported remarks by politicians: By Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee: ""Homicide is the leading cause of murder."" By former Vice President Joe Biden: ""No ordinary American cares about Constitutional rights."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: ""Having an abortion is no different than having one’s tonsils removed."" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.: ""Owning guns is not a right. If it were a right, it would be in the Constitution."" Let’s scrutinize these quotes one by one. The quote attributed to Jackson Lee appears to come from a now-defunct blog called the Habanero of Texas. That post, or excerpts of it, was widely shared by other conservatives and pro-gun advocates on social media and in forums. According to one blog that quoted the original Habanero of Texas post, Jackson Lee ""held an informal press conference today announcing that her administration, through great efforts and much expense, had completed a decade-old study that focused on the cause of murders in the United States. She was reported as saying that the results were predominantly leaning towards ‘homicide’ as being the primary cause for the murders."" The original post appears to have been an attempt at satire, since the direct ""quote"" attributed by the blog to Jackson Lee is nearly unintelligible: ""Datas (sic) uncover (sic) today give us a clearer portrait of a couple of possible cause (sic) for murder, but let’s be clear.. Changes in the atmospheres (sic) and combustibles (sic) also play a roles (sic) in how peoples (sic) are behave (sic). By continuing homicide (sic) and climate changes (sic) we are ascend (sic) ourselves to vulnables (sic), and we cannot deny that, Nor shall we, Nor shall I, Nor shall we all, So say we all (sic). End homicide and end climate change, and we end murder. THIS, we know."" The apparent satire may have been inspired by remarks posted by the Blaze, a conservative website, that Jackson made in 2013. She said in part, ""Homicide is the leading cause of death — second-leading cause of death — for young people ages 15 to 24. In my community, African Americans, it is the leading cause of death for those 10 to 24."" The statement is not authentic and has circulated the internet for years. We have rated it False. This quote spiraled out of a comment Biden made during a weapons control forum in 2013, but it has been altered and taken out of context. A YouTube video posted in 2015 and titled ""Biden: no ordinary American cares about his constitutional rights"" has more than 33,000 views. The YouTube video tracks back to a February 2013 address Biden gave during a forum held at Western Connecticut State University, about two months after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. At no point during the video does Biden say the words cited in the social media posts. In the clip, he talks about the ""roadblocks"" that are put up by those who oppose gun control: ""They say all you’re going to do is deny law-abiding citizens their rights under the Second Amendment. Not true. They say guns like the AR-15 are needed for self-protection and recreation. They are not. There are plenty of ways you can protect yourself and recreate without an AR-15. They say it isn’t about guns. They’re wrong; it is about guns. Let me say at the outset to all the press: No law abiding citizen in the United States of America has any fear that their Constitutional rights will be infringed in any way. None, zero. Look, common sense facts are these assault weapons are unnecessary and dangerous weapons that put our law enforcement personnel at risk…"" Warren did make a comparison between abortion and tonsil removal procedures, but the quote shared in the post is heavily edited and is not something Warren said or wrote. We have rated it Mostly False. In a Jan. 21, 2018, opinion column in Time magazine, she wrote: ""On the 45th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, I think about what has changed since abortions became legal.

Schmitt rates Mostly True on claim about opioid deaths
","As cases of opioid use disorder continue to wreak havoc across the U.S., many states have taken steps to address the issue. Missouri is one of more than 30 states that brought a lawsuit against opioid manufacturers, alleging the companies misrepresented the dangerous and addictive nature of the drugs. Speaking at a roundtable discussion about the opioid epidemic Nov. 25, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who inherited Missouri’s lawsuit when he took office, said, ""You have literally 140 people dying every day of opioid-related overdoses. That’s like a passenger plane going down every day of every week of every month of every year of every decade."" Stating that 140 deaths per day are caused by opioid-related overdoses emphasizes the high stakes of the opioid crisis, so we wanted to see if Schmitt’s number was correct. Here’s what we found: He’s off by about 10. Preliminary data for last year shows fewer deaths. When asked about where Schmitt found the statistic, Chris Nuelle, the attorney general’s press secretary, said that opioid-related research can fluctuate, so it can be hard to get exact numbers. He also noted that Schmitt has often attributed 130 deaths per day to opioids, though Nuelle believes the 140 number is still accurate. Nuelle pointed to a National Institute on Drug Abuse article that attributed more than 130 deaths per day and provided the link to a U.S. News & World Report story that analyzed opioid data, but did not indicate the number of deaths due to opioid overdoses each day at all. The most reliable and most recent data available on drug and opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s most recent data was released in 2018 and analyzes 2017 drug and opioid overdose deaths. In 2017, there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States. Of those deaths, 47,600 — or 67.8% of all drug overdose deaths — involved some type of opioids whether natural, synthetic or semisynthetic. When you break these statistics down into deaths per day, there were approximately 192 drug overdose deaths each day on average in 2017. Of those 192 deaths, about 130 each day involved an opioid. This statistic does not match up exactly with Schmitt’s claim that there are 140 opioid-related deaths daily in the U.S. Jasmine Reed, a public affairs specialist at the CDC, said in an email that the 130 daily deaths from opioid overdoses is an average calculated by dividing the total number of opioid overdoses in the year by the number of days in a year. She said this means the number is not an absolute figure, but that it is more accurate to say there are 130 opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. each day than it is to say there are 140. The CDC estimates that between 1999 and 2017, more than 702,000 people have died from a drug overdose, and about 399,000 of those deaths were due to opioid overdoses. Overall, the number of opioid overdose deaths each day and drug overdose deaths each day have both been steadily increasing within that time period. If the number of opioid overdose deaths continued growing steadily, as it has in past years, the number of deaths each day in 2019 might, in fact, be 140 or even exceed 140. However, this is not yet known because the final counts of overdose deaths for 2018 and 2019 have not been released. The CDC has released provisional data for 2018 that indicates the number of drug overdose deaths dropped from 70,237 in 2017 to 68,110 in 2018. The CDC warns that this number is likely ""underreported due to incomplete data,"" but the overall drop suggests that opioid-related overdoses also decreased in 2018. This could mean the number of opioid overdose deaths is actually less than 130 per day. Aaron Williams, senior director for training and technical assistance for substance abuse at the National Council For Behavioral Health, explained there are a number of reasons why opioid overdose deaths constitute such a large portion of drug overdose deaths. ""Over the last decade and a half, there has been a significant increase in the prescription of and use of opioid-based medications for pain, in particular,"" Williams said. He said many people developed substance use problems due to this uptick, which increased overdose deaths because high doses of opioids can cause respiratory depression that leads to death. Williams also said in recent years illegal opioids have become easier to get, with heroin getting ""cheaper and purer"" as one example. He said potent synthetic opioids (tramadol, fentanyl, etc.) have moved into the pipeline as well. ""You have literally 140 people dying every day of opioid-related overdoses,"" Attorney General Eric Schmitt said at a public discussion about the opioid epidemic. The most recent data available from 2017 indicates that it’s actually about 130 people who die every day from overdoses involving opioids. Schmitt was off by only about 10 deaths.

Jensen rates Half True on St. Louis office recidivism rate
","Jeff Jensen, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, believes his district’s probation office has the lowest recidivism rate in the country. In a Nov. 20 interview with St. Louis Public Radio, Jensen expressed frustration over St. Louis’ crime rate. His one positive note, however, was about the recidivism rate for the Eastern District of Missouri probation office, which includes St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri. ""It’s nothing I do, but the probation office here in the Eastern District of Missouri is the best in the country,"" he said. ""They have about a 7.5% recidivism rate, compared to national averages of 70 or 80%."" We’ve had a similar check in Wisconsin, but we haven’t delved into Missouri’s Eastern District. Does it really outperform the rest of the country? Here’s what we found. Jensen is making an apples-to-oranges comparison between district and national numbers. It’s impossible to check whether the Eastern District is the best in the nation because the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics doesn’t study recidivism at state and county levels. The numbers are difficult to compare. Scott Anders, chief U.S. probation officer for the Eastern District, responded to PolitiFact’s request for the source of Jensen’s statistics. The district’s numbers match Jensen’s claim. In 2019, 7.5% of people under supervision — prisoners on parole, supervised release or probation — were rearrested, Anders said. Additionally, the rearrest rate from 2012 to 2016 averaged 7.76%, according to the Eastern District’s rearrest reports. It’s not as easy as Jensen made it seem to compare those rates to national averages. In a report that studied recidivism rates of state prisoners from 2005 to 2014, the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics broke up the rates into one-year, three-year, six-year and nine-year periods. Here’s what the study found: 44% of state prisoners were arrested within one year after release, 68% were arrested within three years, 79% within six years and 83% within nine years. So, while the statistics match Jensen’s ballpark estimate of a 70 or 80% national recidivism rate, he is making an apples-to-oranges comparison when weighing them against the Eastern District’s rate. The first part of Jensen’s claim — that the Eastern District is the best in the country — is more difficult to check. Bureau of Justice Statistics spokesperson Tannyr Watkins wrote in an email that the bureau has not studied recidivism rates for individual states or counties. There’s no other governmental group that tracks the rates by district across the country. U.S. attorney Jeff Jensen said his district’s probation office is the best in the nation. He noted the office’s recidivism rate — 7.5% — and compared it to the nation’s rate of 70% or 80%. Jensen had both his numbers for the Eastern district’s rate and the national averages straight, but he was making a comparison across different time periods. The Bureau of Justice Statistics also hasn’t studied recidivism rates at a state or county level, so there’s nothing to say it’s the best in the nation. Because Jensen had the right idea in promoting his district’s recidivism rate, but the numbers don’t exactly line up, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2019/dec/31/jeff-jensen/jensen-half-true-st-louis-office-recidivism-rate/

Evers flips on whether he can release emails
","While running for the state’s highest office, Tony Evers’ campaign website criticized his Republican predecessor for undermining ""our state’s rich tradition of transparency and accountability."" It’s particularly relevant since the Republican Legislature and Gov. Scott Walker were lambasted in 2015 for attempting to remove key portions of the public records law, keeping many more records — including emails — from public view. But in his first year in office, the Democratic governor has drawn fire on a number of transparency-related issues. He initially refused to release a letter that had been given to him by the departing Walker. He was sued by the conservative MacIver Institute, which alleged Evers’ office excluded the group from email distribution of news releases and barred the organization from a news briefing. He scrapped a public website created under Gov. Scott Walker that tracked compliance on public records requests. Most recently, Evers drew criticism from open records advocates and journalists after his office refused to release a day’s worth of emails. The governor said state law doesn’t allow it. Amid criticism, Evers later decided to release the emails as requested. That makes this a good time to break out our Flip-O-Meter. We use this to rate whether officials have been consistent on an issue — without making a value judgment on whether that change is good or bad. Let’s get to it. Evers’ first position The controversy started in September 2019 when FOX6-TV’s Amanda St. Hilaire requested more than four weeks of emails from Evers and his chief of staff. That was denied, as were follow-up requests for one week of emails and one day of emails. The denial letters cited a section of state statute that says a records request is insufficient if it does not have ""a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record."" Evers’ team interpreted that to mean every request must be limited as to both time and subject matter. ""Wisconsin public records law provides that any request for a record may be deemed insufficient for lacking ‘a reasonable limitation as to subject matter,’ just as it may be deemed insufficient for lacking a length of time,"" the second denial letter to FOX6 said. But open records advocates objected to that interpretation. ""It turns public records requests into a guessing game,"" April Barker, an open records attorney, told FOX6. ""You don’t know what you don’t know, so you don’t know what to ask for."" And other top officials in state government made no such argument in response to identical requests from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, both Republicans, provided the requested emails within days. So did two top Democrats: Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling and Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz. Evers said his position on releasing his emails was based on how Walker handled such requests and on advice from Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, and his predecessor, Attorney General Brad Schimel, a Republican. An Associated Press request for a week of emails in March 2016 was denied by Walker’s office. A letter from Assistant Legal Counsel David J. Rabe said the law ""requires that a request must include limitations as to subject matter and length of time."" Rabe said the office interpreted the ""or"" in statute to mean both items are required. With Evers, the email saga dragged out nearly two months before FOX6 spoke to Evers directly on the matter. Evers told FOX6 on Nov. 1, 2019, he wasn’t aware of the request. He then said, ""yeah"" when asked if the public should be able to see a day’s worth of his emails. But a few days later he spoke as if his hands were tied by the open records law. ""We have to obey the law — that's the problem,"" Evers told reporters on Nov. 13 after a bill signing ceremony. ""We have people who are willing to help folks that need that information to do it in a way that's consistent with state law but we're not going to go in a different direction than state law — it's important to follow the law."" It's a position open records advocates decried as legally dubious. But it’s the position Evers staked out. Until he didn’t. Evers’ second position On Nov. 27, 2019, Evers’ staff granted an open records request for his emails filed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Molly Beck. Similar to FOX6, she had asked for all emails sent and received by Evers on one day — Nov. 12, 2019. A letter to Beck offered a one-paragraph explanation for the change, treating the decision as an exception rather than a new interpretation of statute. ""Your request lacks a subject matter. See Wis. Stat. § 19.35(1)(h),"" reads the unsigned letter from Evers’ Office of Legal Counsel. ""Despite this, we are making an exception to this requirement, and are providing the responsive records."" The only emails released for that day were copies of two news releases and Evers’ daily schedule. The letter also noted the emails had been redacted to withhold security information, phone numbers and the governor’s direct email address. Our ruling Responding to requests for one day of his emails, Evers first said he would not release them. Then he released them. Evers’ team attempts to have it both ways in the release letter. They say their interpretation hasn’t changed that a request without subject matter isn’t sufficient, but they then release the records as an ""exception"" (leaving the door open for future denials on these grounds). But that doesn’t line up with how Evers himself described the matter. Evers’ statement on Nov. 13 was not simply that he wouldn’t release the records, but that he couldn’t — ""We have to obey the law — that's the problem."" Based on his later action, that’s clearly not the case. That makes Evers’ later decision to release the records a change in position, or what we call a Full Flop.  ",/factchecks/2019/dec/27/tony-evers/evers-flips-whether-he-can-release-emails/

Sen. Ron Johnson hits bulls-eye with claim on U.S. leading in granting legal permanent residency
","There is no doubt the United States is a magnet for immigrants, but with a crackdown on both illegal and legal immigration under President Donald Trump, how does it compare with other countries when it comes to providing residency? According to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, the U.S. continues to outpace other nations when it comes to granting permanent residency to people entering the country. ""There is not another nation on Earth, other than the United States of America, that grants legal permanent residency to more than a million people per year,"" Johnson tweeted Nov. 13, 2019.  The tweet featured a clip of Johnson speaking at a Senate hearing that day discussing migration rates over the past year. Is Johnson right? The language  Johnson uses the term ""legal permanent residency,"" which the Department of Homeland Security defines as non-citizens lawfully authorized to permanently live in the U.S. They can also be referred to as ""green card"" holders. Legal permanent residents, or LPRs, are allowed to work without special restrictions, own property, receive financial aid for higher education and join the military.  Though they have the majority of the same rights as a U.S. citizen, green card holders can’t vote in any federal elections and typically are barred from voting in state and local elections as well.  When traveling out of the country, authorities may also scrutinize green card holders more than citizens, especially if they intend to be out of the country for a significant length of time. Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration rates, said the ""legal permanent residency"" pathway to citizenship is not used in most other countries outside the United States. ""LPRs, if they live in the U.S. for 5 years, 3 years if (they’re) spouses of citizens, can get U.S. citizenship -- assuming they do not commit a serious crime,"" Camarota told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email. ""Other countries admit foreigners for long-term temporary work or study or they even grant them asylum, etc.  ""But, in most cases, they do not offer them a clear path to citizenship. In that sense, the U.S. is different."" Limiting entry We asked Johnson’s office for backup on this claim, but they did not respond. According to the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank, hardline rhetoric and policies under Trump may be having an impact on the declining rate of immigrants into the U.S.  In 2018, the foreign-born population in the U.S. rose by 203,000, the lowest level since the first year of the Great Recession in 2007. Over the past decade, the annual increase has ranged between 400,000 and 1 million.  The total number of foreign-born people residing in the U.S. in 2018 was 45 million. Of that number, roughly 22.6 million were naturalized citizens and 22.1 were noncitizens -- with half that number estimated to be residing illegally, according to Brookings. According to Department of Homeland Security data from 2017, the most recent year available, the number of people who were given legal permanent residence in the U.S. was still over 1.1 million. How does that compare with other nations? Global comparison  Camarota said Canada, Australia and New Zealand are the closest to the U.S. when it comes to granting legal permanent residencies that could lead to eventual citizenship.  The Canadian government set out a three-year plan that aims to provide residency to 1 million new immigrants between 2018 and 2020. In 2018, Canada exceeded its goal of accepting 310,000 permanent residents by about 10,000. The target for 2019 was set at about 313,000, while 2020 is set at 340,000. Earlier this year, Australia limited its migration cap to accepting only 160,000 permanent new residents a year over the next four years, with its government emphasizing border protection. New Zealand accepted 142,900 migrants in 2018, which their government considered a high number. Through May 2019, roughly 144,900 migrants arrived in the country this year. Regardless, those numbers all fall short of the U.S. What about European countries that have dealt with an influx of refugees from war-torn Syria? A record 1.3 million migrants applied for asylum across the 28 member states of the European Union, plus Norway and Switzerland in 2015. Though asylum is often temporary, these numbers do show an increase in the number of people being taken in across Europe. Even at the height of admitting asylum seekers, though, no country topped 1 million. In 2015, Germany admitted around 890,000 refugees, according to the English-language German news site, the Local.  Robert Warren, a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, said despite immigration upticks from other nations, the U.S. is still in the lead.  ""No other country admits nearly as many immigrants as the United States over long periods,"" Warren said.  Our rating Johnson said the United States is the only nation ""that grants legal permanent residency to more than a million people per year."" Though other countries have undertaken initiatives to grant permanent residency to more immigrants in recent years, those totals remain below the U.S.   The U.S. is still the top country in number of permanent residencies it grants, topping 1.1 million in 2017, the most recent year available.

NC Democrat makes claim about Insurance Commissioner's campaign history
","One of North Carolina’s more obscure political races will feature familiar opponents. Wayne Goodwin, the chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, plans to challenge Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey. They faced off in 2016.  On Twitter this weekend, Goodwin cast himself as the more serious and experienced candidate, having held the office from 2009 to 2017. Causey was the first Republican to be elected to the office this century, when he won election in 2016. In a tweet, Goodwin referred to Causey as a ""30 (year) perennial candidate for (the) same office."" It takes a lot of money and energy to run one campaign, much less multiple campaigns over the course of three decades. That level of commitment is uncommon. So we wondered: how many times has Causey run for insurance commissioner over the last 30 years? There have been seven elections for Insurance Commissioner since 1990. Causey, who has a background in the insurance industry, ran in many of them -- but not all of them. Race history Here’s a look back each race for Insurance Commissioner over the last 30 years, and whether Causey participated. Note: Goodwin should’ve known a little about the Republican in the 2008 election, since he won the seat by beating a different candidate -- John Odom. If Causey follows through with his plan to run for re-election in 2020 (he already filed to run), he’ll have run in six of the last eight elections, or 75 percent of them. Other campaigns Goodwin specifically noted Causey’s history of running for the ""same"" office. This could be interpreted to mean Causey has only ever run for one office. That’s not the case.  In 2014, Causey ran for Congress in the 6th Congressional District. But he didn’t make the November ballot, having placed seventh in the Republican primary that May. He also ran for state Senate in 2002, the race in District 28 to Democrat Katie Dorsett. Goodwin has some other races on his record, too. In 2004, he lost a bid to unseat Republican Cherie Berry as Labor Commissioner. Two years before that, he won an NC House race. And in 1996, Goodwin was elected to the NC House after running unopposed. Another meaning Finally, let’s look at the term ""perennial candidate."" The word can be a bit squishy, as an Ohio newspaper columnist once pointed out. Goodwin told us he used the term only to communicate that Causey has run frequently, and in that sense he’s right. He also pointed out that, if had intended to say Causey ran in every election since 1990, he would’ve used the word ""quadrennial"" -- meaning someone who runs every four years. However, used in the context of politics, the term ""perennial candidate"" often refers to candidates who don’t have much of a shot at winning.  Major media outlets have used the term not only to describe someone who runs frequently -- but someone who almost always loses, and runs despite having questionable qualifications and/or low odds of winning.  NPR in 2011 used the term to describe frequent presidential candidates U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, Ralph Nader, and Alan Keyes. The Associated Press has used the term to describe a Reform Party gubernatorial candidate in Mississippi who once promised to establish a series of snow-cone stands to fund state services. The AP used the term again in 2019 to describe a ""cult-like figure"" and conspiracy theorist who ran one of his several presidential campaigns from prison. Causey’s different from most candidates because he’s won elected office, represented a major political party in the five elections he didn’t win, and has a background in the insurance industry. Our ruling Goodwin referred to Causey as a 30-year ""perennial candidate"" for the ""same office."" He’s got a point: Causey has run for insurance commissioner a lot since 1992. Those familiar with the term’s use in political circles may find the description off-base when applied to Causey.  But Goodwin’s claim is mostly accurate. It just needs a little clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/dec/23/wayne-goodwin/nc-democrat-makes-claim-about-insurance-commission/
"['Health Care', 'Illinois', 'Sean Casten']","
Casten partly right about federal contribution to new drugs
","The day before the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to lower prescription drug prices, Illinois Democratic Rep. Sean Casten countered critics who argue the plan limits funding for research and development of new life-saving medications. PolitiFact has already evaluated a version of that critique made by a drug manufacturers’ group, rating it Mostly False. During a recent Facebook livestream, Casten of Downers Grove struck back at the plan’s critics with an entirely different claim on the subject that also caught our attention. ""From 2000 to 2016, every major drug that was introduced came out of NIH funding,"" Casten said. ""That is your taxpayer dollars. And so what we’ve done with the savings from this bill, which are huge, is to funnel a significant chunk of that back to NIH."" Casten was referring to the National Institutes of Health, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and serves as the nation’s medical research agency. A peer-reviewed study found that NIH funding contributed to scientific findings underpinning every one of the more than 200 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration over the timeframe it covered. But the study only dated back to 2010 — not 2000, as Casten claimed. In response to our inquiry, Casten’s office updated his Facebook video post with a correction. ""At minute 4:17, Congressman Casten stated from ‘2000 to 2016, every major drug that was introduced came out of NIH funding.’ The correct date range is 2010-2016,’"" the post now reads. Still, we wanted to set the record straight for those who haven’t seen the update, and provide some additional context about the overall issue. Casten raised the public funding for new drug research issue while advocating for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s plan to rein in prescription drug prices. The plan would direct Medicare to negotiate the cost of a limited number of drugs, cap what Medicare patients pay out-of-pocket at $2,000 per year and require companies that raise prices beyond inflation to give rebates back to the government. The bill — House Resolution 3 — passed the House on Dec. 12 with a mostly party-line vote. While not expected to gain approval in the Republican-run U.S. Senate, it is the latest foray by Democrats in a political battle over prescription drugs that has existed for years. It also represents a framework for how Democrats propose tackling the perennial issue of rising prescription drug prices. In 2017, researchers analyzed the contribution NIH funding has made to research associated with all 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016. Collectively, they found, the grant funding for this research totaled more than $100 billion. Because 95% of those funds went toward the kind of foundational biomedical research that can contribute to the creation of multiple drugs rather than a specific drug product, the report concludes, NIH ""complements industry research and development, which focuses predominantly on applied research."" The study’s lead author, data analyst Ekaterina Cleary of Bentley University in Massachusetts, told us she wasn’t aware of any similar studies dating further back. She said Casten’s broader take that every new drug introduced within her study’s time frame ""came out of NIH funding"" checks out. ""I would say that’s true,"" she said. ""Government funding contributes to basic science that enables successful development. Obviously, without that basic research, you can’t develop the drug."" However, Cleary added, the costly clinical trials that manufacturers conduct are also crucial to creating new medications. ""I know our study is frequently interpreted as, ‘the public sector developed these drugs,’ but they didn’t do it single-handedly,"" she said. ""So it’s an important distinction to make to acknowledge pharmaceutical companies’ role in the trials that they develop."" Casten said that ""from 2000 to 2016, every major drug that was introduced came out of NIH funding."" A 2018 study found NIH funding contributed to the science that underlies every one of the 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 — not 2000 to 2016, as Casten claimed.
