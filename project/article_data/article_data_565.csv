Checking Beasley votes on 'armed kidnapper' and 'double murderer' cases
","The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently released its third installment in a series of ads attacking Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former chief justice on the North Carolina Supreme Court, who is running for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat against Republican U.S. Rep. Ted Budd. In the ad, ""Discovery,"" a narrator says: ""In stopping crime and holding criminals accountable, Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley has failed us. ""A teen murderer? She vacated the death sentence.  ""An armed kidnapper? Beasley voted to reverse the conviction. ""An armed double-murderer? She voted for an early release. ""Time after time and case after case, Cheri Beasley protected criminals not victims.  ""How can we trust her to protect our families?"" In a press release, NRSC spokesman T.W. Arrighi said the ad offers a glimpse of Beasley’s record ""without sugarcoating the facts.""   ""The ad released today gives more examples of the violent criminals who Beasley protected.  We hope voters will remember the victims when they vote in November,"" he said. PolitiFact North Carolina already checked the claim about the vacated death sentence of a teen murderer, and rated it Half True because it left out key context. Another NRSC ad included misleading claims against Beasley that we rated Mostly False. Some television stations took it off the air, citing false or misleading claims. ""The fact is that as a judge and chief justice of the Supreme Court, Cheri held dangerous offenders accountable and worked with law enforcement to keep communities safe,"" Beasley spokeswoman Dory MacMillan said. What about the NRSC’s latest claims about Beasley’s opinions regarding an armed kidnapping and a double murder?  The language in the ad provides some literal accuracy about Beasley’s actions on these two cases, while also omitting some details about the cases and process that led to her votes.  The NRSC said Beasley ""voted to reverse the conviction"" of an armed kidnapper. This refers to State of North Carolina v. Ramar Dion Benjamin Crump, which the state Supreme Court addressed in 2020. This case wasn’t about the defendant’s actions, but whether a Superior Court judge granted him a fair trial. Crump was sentenced in 2016 to serve at least 72 years in prison for his role in a 2013 shoot-out with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police. His arrest that September connected him to a poker game that had been robbed a few days prior. He was convicted on two counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, nine counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon, 10 counts of second-degree kidnapping and two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, WCNC reported.  On appeal, Crump’s team argued that the trial court violated the defendant’s rights when it prevented the defense from questioning prospective jurors about their possible racial biases. The state argued that the defense wasn’t categorically prohibited from asking jurors about racial bias — just from asking the specific questions that defense attorneys were posing.  Writing for the majority, Justice Anita Earls wrote: ""The fact that the trial court rejected three questions in a row that related to the topic of racial bias is strong evidence that ‘the trial court would have prohibited … further questions to the jurors’ about racial bias, even if defense counsel did not return to the subject again after being repeatedly denied."" The jurors’ biases were relevant to the case because Crump and police offered conflicting testimony over who opened fire first. Beasley sided with the majority in the 4-3 ruling that ordered a new trial. State prison records show Crump, 32, was released from prison last August. His new trial is pending, a spokeswoman for the Mecklenburg County District Attorney’s office told PolitiFact on June 22. In the ad’s last claim about a specific ruling, the NRSC ad narrator says Beasley ""voted for an early release"" of an ""armed double-murderer."" This refers to State of North Carolina v. Bobby E. Bowden, which was heard by the state Supreme Court in 2014. Bowden was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of armed robbery on Dec. 15, 1975, and was sentenced to life in prison. In 2005, the year Bowden turned 56, his attorneys offered a two-pronged argument for why he should be released early: First, they said, state law defined a life sentence as 80 years in prison. Secondly, they said, he had earned enough ""credits"" for good behavior while in the prison system to be released in 2012. The state Supreme Court ruled 4-2 that Bowden wasn’t eligible to have his sentence reduced, and could only use credits for extra benefits behind bars or to move up his parole eligibility, WRAL reported. Beasley disagreed with the majority along with Associate Justice Robin Hudson, who pointed out in the dissent that the credits had already been applied and the lower courts supported the early release. ""The State is under no obligation to create or to award credits that reduce a prisoner’s sentence for a crime for which he was lawfully convicted,"" Hudson wrote. ""But once it does so, it cannot then arbitrarily and with no process take those credits back.""  State prison records show Bowden died in 2019 at age 69. The NRSC ad says Beasley helped reverse the conviction of an armed kidnapper and, separately, voted to grant early release to a convicted double-murderer. Beasley did vote to release a man convicted of armed robbery. The ad leaves out her reasoning: that the trial court erred in blocking the defense from questioning potential jurors about their possible racial biases. The ad says Beasley voted to grant early release to a double-murderer. It omits that he had already served more than 30 years in prison and had accumulated credit for good behavior that lower courts believed could be used for early release. The statements are accurate but need clarification or additional information. That’s our definition for Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC775100>],/factchecks/2022/jul/07/national-republican-senatorial-committee/checking-beasley-votes-armed-kidnapper-and-double-/

No evidence ties Highland Park shooter to antifa
","Authorities have identified Robert Crimo III as a suspect in a July 4 shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, that left seven people dead and more than two dozen injured.   With that news came a flurry of unverified and false images misleadingly suggesting that Crimo is associated with a number of social or political ideologies. A July 4 Facebook post that published several images from Crimo’s supposed Instagram account includes a screenshot of Crimo’s page bearing a flag associated with antifa, a broad left-wing coalition of anti-fascist activists. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although Crimo did have a larger online presence than the suspects in recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, most of the 21-year-old’s social media accounts have been deleted.  None of the images supposedly pulled from his social media accounts have been verified, and the evidence supporting their authenticity is thin.  First, the screenshot with the antifa flag was cropped to exclude a username. It also lacks timeline indicators; there are no dates or times shown in the photos.  Further, the account in the screenshot had little engagement. It had one follower and followed no other users — a sign that the Instagram account may have been recently created.  Instagram did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. The Lake County Sheriff’s Office could also not be reached for comment, but spokesperson Chris Covelli said in a July 5 briefing that Crimos’s online activity was still being reviewed.  The suggestion that Crimo had antifa ties also appeared in an article published by The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website that has spread misinformation in the past. Most of the article’s proof relies on screenshots of unverified accounts — including screenshots used in the Facebook post — and speculation.  For example, one image in The Gateway Pundit’s evidence collage depicts Crimo wearing a black beanie with the letter ""A"" on it, which the article claimed was short for antifa.   However, it’s well documented that Crimo referred to himself by the pseudonym Awake the Rapper, which also starts with ""A."" The article also made unsubstantiated assumptions about Crimo’s tattoos and their meaning.  We found no evidence from credible sources to corroborate claims that Crimo posted an antifa flag or that he has ties to the group. Information about Crimo’s political affiliation is also scarce.  Videos from Crimo’s now-deleted YouTube channel showed him cheering for former President Donald Trump’s motorcade, according to NBC. A Facebook post claimed that Crimo, the man apprehended for the mass shooting in Highland Park, had posted an antifa flag on Instagram. The photo is unverified. And PolitiFact found no credible evidence to suggest that the account in the Facebook post belonged to Crimo or he had any ties to antifa.  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB900880>],/factchecks/2022/jul/07/facebook-posts/no-evidence-ties-highland-park-shooter-antifa/

Other people were injured, and reporters have talked to witnesses who survived the attack.  Dr. David Baum, who was at the parade and helped treat people who were injured in the shooting, told NBC Chicago that he saw several people shot.  ""The bodies that I saw, it was not an image that anyone who’s not a physician would have an easy time processing,"" Baum said.  Gabriella Martinez, who said she saw the gunman on a rooftop, initially thought the gunshots were fireworks.  ""Then literally one second (later) we all started getting into a panic mode,"" she said.

"['Michigan', 'John Gibbs']","
John Gibbs falsely claims Peter Meijer voted to create Jan. 6 committee
","The latest attack from John Gibbs against his GOP primary opponent Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Grand Rapids, misrepresents the freshman congressman’s vote on the congressional committee currently investigating the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. In a fundraising email from his campaign, Gibbs claimed that Meijer voted to ""create the Adam Schiff-led January 6th Commission."" To back up its claim, Gibbs’ campaign pointed to Meijer’s vote for a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol attack that was never created because Senate Republicans blocked the proposal. But Meijer voted against creating the committee that is carrying out the probe and whose members were selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. A spokesperson for Gibbs’ campaign called U.S. Rep. Schiff, D-Calif., ""a central voice"" on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. But the group’s chair is Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., not Schiff. The closely watched primary in Michigan between Gibbs and Meijer is one of a handful in which an incumbent Republican faces a Trump-endorsed candidate. Meijer was among the 10 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection on the day members of Congress convened to certify Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. Gibbs — who worked in the Trump administration at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development — has made Meijer’s vote to impeach the former president following the Jan. 6 insurrection a key talking point against his GOP opponent. Meijer was also among a small group of Republicans who voted to establish a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol. ""Let us be clear: the imperative to have a public, objective, fact-based investigation of the Capitol attack is not a partisan issue, and it should never be treated as such,"" Meijer said during a speech on the House floor outlining his support for a bipartisan commission. But after Senate Republicans blocked the proposal, Meijer subsequently voted against creating the Select Committee currently undertaking the congressional probe into the Jan. 6 attack. In a series of tweets explaining his vote, Meijer once more stated his support for an investigation into the insurrection but raised concerns about the format of the proposed committee. ""I believe it is essential we have a thorough, credible Jan. 6 investigation in order to produce an objective report to get at the truth and clear away fictions and lies,"" Meijer wrote. ""I fear the structure of this partisan select committee will not produce that critical outcome."" The bipartisan commission initially proposed and supported by Meijer would have entitled Democratic and Republican legislative leaders to the same number of appointments. But the resolution that created today’s select committee entitled Pelosi to select its chair and appoint 13 members, including five selected following consultation with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Pelosi appointed the committee’s two Republican members: Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. But Pelosi rejected two GOP lawmakers nominated by McCarthy, stating they would undermine the committee’s work because of their previous claims about the Jan. 6 attack. McCarthy pulled his remaining picks from the committee in protest. Gibbs claimed that Meijer voted to ""create the Adam Schiff-led January 6th Commission."" Meijer voted against establishing the select committee currently investigating the Capitol attack. Prior to that, he did vote for a bipartisan commission. But that commission was never created, and the committee that was established is not led by Schiff, who serves as a member but not its chair. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD95D80>],/factchecks/2022/jul/07/john-gibbs/john-gibbs-falsely-claims-peter-meijer-voted-creat/

Facebook video shows an actual fly, not a ‘polymer drone’
","A video circulating on social media claims to show a new piece of technology from the United States military: a miniature drone made to look and act like a large fly. The video was shared in a June 13 Facebook post and shows a person holding a fly between their fingers. The fly buzzes and wiggles its legs before flying away. A caption with the post includes several hash tagged words, ""#drones #flies #military,"" and a tweet superimposed on the video says ""polymer drone flies, used by the U.S. military."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Although the military does use miniature drones, there is no evidence the fly being shown in the video is one of them. The video includes no audio that would imply that what the person is holding is a mechanical drone and features only the sounds of rushing wind and the fly buzzing away. The thing the person is holding looks similar to Cuterebra ruficus, a type of botfly (which, in this case, is not short for ""robot"") found primarily in the southwestern U.S. Pictures of the fly online show the fly is similar in appearance and size to what’s being held in the video. A drone that the military does use, however, is known as the ""Black Hornet."" Made by Teledyne FLIR, it weighs less than 1.6 ounces and is about 7 inches long. It’s considered the world’s smallest military drone. Rather than having flapping wings like the insect seen in this video, the drone uses rotor blades similar to a helicopter to fly. Separately, a British biomechanical company is developing a drone that uses flapping wings, but it’s only in the prototype stage. Alex Caccia, chief executive of Animal Dynamics, told the BBC in 2020 that his company is developing a drone that's inspired by a dragonfly. Called the Skeeter, the drone uses four wings to fly. However, the drone's prototype is about 8 inches long — not nearly as small as the fly in the video.   Caccia also said ""making devices with flapping wings is very, very hard"" and it'll be some time before a production version of the Skeeter is ready. A video shared to Facebook claims to show a person handling one of the ""polymer drone flies"" used by the U.S. military. No proof in the video or post is offered to show that the person is holding something other than a type of botfly. The U.S. military does use an insect-like drone called the ""Black Hornet,"" but it is several inches long and uses rotor blades to fly.

Marjorie Taylor Greene shared edited image of Highland Park shooting suspect
","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., shared a doctored image that she falsely claimed showed the suspect in the Highland Park, Illinois, mass shooting was in a ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before he opened fire on the Chicago suburb’s July 4 parade. Police took into custody Robert Crimo III of Highwood, Illinois, after they said he positioned himself on a nearby roof and fired the shots that killed seven people and injured dozens more.  Crimo had not been charged with a crime by midafternoon July 5, and much remained unknown about his life leading up to the shooting, including details regarding his mental health or arrest history. Our fact-checks disrupt the agendas of politicians across the ideological spectrum. Support the truth today.  Here’s some of what we have learned from police as of July 5: Crimo attempted suicide in 2019. That same year, law enforcement officials also seized dozens of knives and a sword from him after a family member reported that he threatened to ""kill everyone,"" but Crimo was not arrested over the incident. The 21-year-old had posted violent imagery and discourse online. He was living at the time of the attack in an apartment behind a house owned by his father, according to reports, and he purchased the firearm police said he used to carry out the attack legally.  But before many of those details had been revealed, Greene had already posted the altered image of Crimo twice, using it to make a political point about guns and mental health. In the image, which Greene first tweeted July 4 alongside other photos of Crimo, Crimo looks as if he’s seated in a compact, windowless cell and holding a Bible. The second time Greene shared the image was on July 5, when she posted a Twitter thread arguing that the attack and other recent mass shootings should not be blamed on lax gun laws.  ""The public should not allow this to continue,"" Greene wrote. ""People are not stupid. Is he in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center in this photo? That’s not his bedroom. 22 yrs old and 5’11 and 120 lbs is not normal or healthy. What drugs or psychiatric drugs or both does he use?"" Greene framed the image as evidence of Crimo’s ""very dark"" history.  ""Until we are willing to rip open the ugly truth about the dark and destructive path these young men are on that lead them to mass shootings, then they will continue,"" she said. ""No matter how many gun control laws are passed. Even with no guns at all, evil will find a way until it’s fixed."" The image is noticeably edited. There’s no evidence that it actually shows Crimo ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" prior to his July 4 parade attack, as Greene claimed. ""This is an obvious fake,"" said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert on image analysis and digital forensics. ""There are clear signs of manipulation around his head and hair, the resolution on his face is inconsistent with the background, and the lighting and shading on his face is inconsistent with the rest of the scene."" PolitiFact could not pinpoint where the image originated, but we found the same image posted on several since-suspended Twitter accounts that appear to have been affiliated with Crimo or the stage name he adopted as an amateur rapper, ""Awake the Rapper."" A Twitter spokesperson confirmed that the company suspended accounts that ""may belong to the alleged perpetrator,"" per its rules around perpetrators of violent attacks.  Shortly after sharing the image for the second time to her nearly 1 million Twitter followers,  Greene retweeted it again and said, ""This is supposedly photoshopped.""  Greene’s office did not respond to a request for comment.  We rate Greene’s claim that the image shows Crimo ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before the shooting False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB29A00>],/factchecks/2022/jul/05/marjorie-taylor-greene/marjorie-taylor-greene-shared-edited-image-highlan/

Nikki Fried’s ad misleads on Crist’s position on abortion access
","With less than two months until Florida’s Democratic primary, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried has ramped up her criticism of her opponent, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist.   Most of Fried’s criticism has zeroed in on Crist’s past as a Republican, namely his inconsistent view on abortion access and reproductive freedom. ""Charlie Crist is pro-life and his opponent is pro-choice,"" read the words that appear across an ad that Fried shared on Twitter June 28. The video spliced together archival and recent footage of Crist juxtaposed with images of Fried. Throughout the ad, Crist is heard repeatedly saying, ""Charlie Crist is pro-life. My opponent is pro-choice.""  The campaign ad has been viewed more than 94,000 times. Fried also retweeted a user who, after seeing the video, described Crist as an ""anti-abortion Democrat."" PolitiFact has fact-checked claims related to Crist’s stance on abortion more than six times.  We couldn’t pinpoint the precise origin of the audio used in this ad, but we do know that his attitude toward abortion is complicated and difficult to summarize. And this 30-second video misrepresents his current stance. When we asked Fried’s campaign about the ad, a spokesperson said Crist has described himself as ""pro-life"" as recently as April. ""Nikki Fried takes him at his word, and the word he uses is pro-life,"" Caroline Korba, Fried’s press secretary, told PolitiFact. Here’s what Crist said about seven and a half minutes into the April 12 interview Korba was referencing:  ""When I say I am pro-life, I mean I am for life, and I am for a woman’s right to choose and make her own decisions about her body."" Crist’s campaign also rejects the definition of ""pro-life"" that is used in most political debate. When asked about Crist’s past use of the term, spokesperson Joshua Karp differentiated Crist from those who typically describe themselves as ""pro-life."" ""Those individuals clearly aren't interested in the life of women,"" Karp said. Crist’s history on the issue provides more insight. His early career as a Republican state senator was marked by his belief that the decision to have an abortion should rest with women, not the government.  At the time, Crist defended his position by saying it fell in line with Republican support of small-government involvement. Even so, his stance on reproductive freedom had its limits.  He told the Miami Herald that he did not support state-funded abortion. He voted for a ban on abortion later in pregnancy, which critics call ""late-term abortion."" Crist also told the Tampa Bay Times in 1998 that he was ""pro-choice, but not pro-abortion.""  As he geared up to run for Florida governor in 2006, Crist began using anti-abortion rhetoric. He won that race and became governor of Florida for four years. However, Crist’s remarks on abortion continued to puzzle ""activists on both sides of the abortion debate,"" according to the Miami Herald. Even as a Republican, Crist said he wouldn't support repealing the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that made abortion legal. Further, Crist said politicians shouldn’t put ""themselves in the place of physicians."" During an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2010, Crist left the Republican party. In 2012, he said in an op-ed published by the Tampa Bay Times that his decision was fueled by the party’s tendency to pitch ""so far to the extreme right on issues important to women."" Before he left the governor’s office, Crist vetoed legislation that would have required women to get an ultrasound before opting to have an abortion. Crist’s view on abortion before he registered as a Democrat in 2012 was murky, but Fried’s ad suggested that his stance had not changed. Crist has been a Democrat for almost 10 years, and he has routinely expressed his support for reproductive rights.  In 2017, for example, Crist voted against federal legislation that would have banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.  He also voted against a bill that sought to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization that provides health care services, including abortion. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund gave Crist a 100% rating for the 117th Congress, which convened in 2021 and goes through January 2023. The rating is based on Crist’s votes on legislation related to sexual and reproductive health. Conversely, Crist has a 0% rating from the National Right to Life.  Laura Goodhue, the executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, meanwhile, said on June 29 that her organization will not endorse either candidate over the other in the Aug. 23 primary because both are ""pro-reproductive health care."" Fried said, ""Charlie Crist is pro-life."" That’s misleading. While Crist has made conflicting statements regarding reproductive freedom throughout his decades in politics, even using the term ""pro-life"" to describe his stance, he does support a woman’s right to choose.  The ad omitted Crist’s record over the last decade, in which he has voted in support of legal abortion access for women. Fried’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBECC1C0>],/factchecks/2022/jul/05/nikki-fried/nikki-frieds-ad-misleads-crists-position-abortion-/

Since then, where people can access the service in the United States has been severely curtailed.  And some social media posts are suggesting that Planned Parenthood hasn’t been frank about how much the organization relies on abortions for its own financial stability.  ""Why are Planned Parenthood clinics closing all across the country if abortion is only ‘3%’ of their business model?"" a June 27 Facebook post said.  Other Facebook users are sharing a screenshot of a tweet that says: ""Why are Planned Parenthood clinics closing all over the country? I thought abortion was only 3% of their business."" These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We asked Planned Parenthood about the claim, and Lauren Kokum, director of affiliate communications for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told us that ""no Planned Parenthood health centers have closed since the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe.""  Providers that offer abortion services are not limited to Planned Parenthood. And there’s no doubt that the Supreme Court’s ruling is leading to the closure of abortion clinics around the country as the residents of some states come under new restrictions and abortion bans.  While there have been news reports of Planned Parenthood clinics suspending or ceasing abortion services in some places, we didn’t find evidence to support the claim that clinics themselves have closed since the ruling.  We did find news reports of some locations closing this year before the ruling was released, and the reasons for these closures varied.  Earlier in June, before the official ruling was released, a Planned Parenthood location in Boise, Idaho, closed. A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky told the Idaho Statesman that the Boise clinic was one of five clinic closures in that region following ""a comprehensive review of all our health centers and patient needs across all six of our states.""  The review was prompted by the ""likely overturning of Roe v. Wade,"" the spokesperson said, referencing the May 3 leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that indicated the court’s action was imminent. The Idaho Press reported the Boise clinic was merging with another Planned Parenthood health center, and that the organization would shift its resources partly to expand telemedicine services.  In May, Vermont news organizations reported that five Planned Parenthood locations in Vermont and New Hampshire would be closing following the news of the likely ruling, and that the hours would be expanded at seven other health centers that were remaining open. A spokesperson said the changes were due to staffing shortages, political divisiveness and underfunding, and they were necessary to protect the organization’s long term sustainability, according to Burlington, Vermont, TV news station WCAX.  Another Planned Parenthood health center in Vermont closed in February. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England said then that it ""faced challenges delivering care at our Newport health center and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues."" Elsewhere, Planned Parenthood is opening clinics. After the court’s decision came down, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette announced a new clinic would be opening in east Oregon, near the border the state shares with Idaho, where abortions will soon be illegal.  Recent news reports about Planned Parenthood are overwhelmingly about abortion services ceasing in states where abortion is — or soon will be — illegal, and clinics in other states bracing for an influx of patients coming from places where they can’t access abortions.  Our ruling A Facebook post said that Planned Parenthood clinics are ""closing down all over the country"" because Roe v. Wade was overturned.
Planned Parenthood says it has more than 600 health centers. We found some examples of Planned Parenthood clinics shuttering before the ruling. In some cases, news reports noted that the closures were in anticipation of the ruling and that Planned Parenthood was shifting resources to prepare for a post-Roe reality — merging some clinics and opening at least one near the border of a state where abortion will be illegal. But the suggestion that there’s a widespread closure of Planned Parenthood clinics across the country because they can no longer perform abortions in some states is wrong. And none have closed since the Supreme Court’s ruling. We rate this claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBC49C0>],/factchecks/2022/jul/05/facebook-posts/no-planned-parenthood-clinics-have-closed-abortion/

Fact-checking Nikki Haley’s inflation math on July 4 cookout costs
","Nikki Haley, President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations and a possible future Republican presidential candidate, roused passions on Twitter over July 4 weekend when she took a shot at inflation on President Joe Biden’s watch. A tweet from Haley’s personal account said, ""Remember last summer when Biden bragged about a $0.16 savings on your July 4th cookout? Well, this is what you’re spending on this 4th of July."" The tweet referenced a graphic about Biden’s ""inconvenience store"" that was attributed to her political action committee, Stand for America. The graphic offered what it said was the one-year increase in price for six July 4 cookout staples. The graphic said the price of hot dogs had increased by 15.6%, soda by 13.2%, condiments by 11.9%, ice cream by 9.6%, bread by 8.7% and watermelon by 8.2%. After these six items, the graphic summed everything up by saying that the total increase was 67.2%. Inflation has increased the cost of the typical July 4 barbecue — but not by that much. As many Twitter followers quickly pointed out, basic mathematical principles say you can’t add six percentage increases together to yield a total percentage increase. In this case, you’d have to divide that total by six (i.e., the number of items being averaged) to find the overall increase. Assuming you were weighting the six items equally, that would be an average increase of 11.2%.  That’s not an insignificant increase, but it’s also far less than 67.2%. Realizing its mistake, Haley’s staff deleted the tweet within an hour or so. But screenshots continued to circulate through the holiday and into the following week. Users mocked Haley for making such a basic mistake when she graduated from Clemson University with an accounting degree.  She has an ACCOUNTING degree 😭 pic.twitter.com/69gX6kGJJX ""This was a staff error that should not have been published,"" Haley’s office said to PolitiFact in a statement. ""We realized the calculation error and immediately removed the graphic."" There’s no question that the graphic’s final calculation was wrong. But the individual increases  for the six items are close to accurate. For a comparison, we looked at data from the U.S. Agriculture Department’s Economic Research Service, which at the time of Haley’s tweet was current through May 2022. We found that five of the six items Haley cited fell under categories tracked by the department, although with a somewhat broader definition. (The only one we couldn’t find data for was ""condiments."")  Here’s a summary of one-year cost increases for categories tracked by the USDA: Beef: 10.2% Nonalcoholic beverages: 12% Dairy products: 11.8% Cereals and bakery products: 11.6% Fresh fruits: 8.5% So, Haley’s graphic overstated inflation’s effect on some products and understated it on others. We also found another price comparison: an analysis of July 4 barbecue costs published every year by the American Farm Bureau Federation. (When the Biden White House trumpeted a savings of 16 cents for July 4 cookout prices a year ago — the inspiration for Haley’s tweet — this was the source.) The Farm Bureau’s list of items mostly don’t overlap with Haley’s, but two do. The Farm Bureau found a 16% increase for hamburger buns (which was higher than Haley said) and a 10% increase for ice cream (which was in line with Haley’s figure). However, the Farm Bureau’s increases for several types of meat exceeded 30%, which is about double Haley’s estimate for hot dogs. All told, the Farm Bureau found that the overall cost for a sample cookout ""is up 17%, or about $10, from last year, a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions, inflation and the war in Ukraine."" Haley said that this July 4, the cost of six American cookout staples had jumped for a total increase of 67.2% Haley’s attempt to slam Biden over inflation overstated the burden of these items when it added the percentage increases into one large total. Instead, Haley should have calculated the average increase for the six items by adding the percentages together and dividing by six.  Were it not for this error, Haley’s cookout claim would have been more accurate: The granular percentage increases in the graphic were either similar to what independent estimates had found or understated them. But the eyeball-catching total missed the mark. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDDF00C0>],/factchecks/2022/jul/05/nikki-haley/fact-checking-nikki-haley-july-4-cookout-costs/

No, Trump didn't sign orders for the 82nd Airborne Division
","Sometimes a hoax can morph into something of reality. As a large caravan of migrants marches for the United States, we have seen our share of unfounded claims about the events. In one Facebook post on Oct. 22, a user announced that ""minutes ago, prior to taking the stage in Houston, TX: President Donald Trump signed DEPLOYMENT ORDERS for the 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army, instructing them to deploy from Ft. Bragg, NC, to the U.S. southern border at Mexico."" This particular story is a hoax. But it turns out, Trump has decided to send some troops to the border. More on that in a second. The poster went on to say that 1st Armored Division of the Army stationed in Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, was given 72-hour ready-standby orders to start shipping armored vehicles to the border and that ""covert intelligence"" had confirmed the caravan had grown to more than 10,000. An additional 40,000 Mexicans were staging to join them in northern Mexico. ""The OPEN PLAN THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING is for more than 50,000 of these so-called ‘migrants’ to physically storm the U.S. border to gain entry into our country,"" according to the post. ""Our President Trump is not going to allow that. Article 4, Section 4 of the US Constitution REQUIRES the federal government to protect each of the states from invasion. The ‘migrant caravan’ is now classified as ‘an invasion force’ against which the US government will take action."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what really did happen: Trump was in Houston; he spoke at a ""Make America Great Again"" rally in support of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is up for re-election. And a few days before the rally, the president threatened to deploy the military to shut down the border to stop the migrants march north. ""I must, in the strongest terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught,"" Trump tweeted, ""and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!"" On Oct. 22, Trump told a USA Today reporter that he would send as many troops as necessary to block the caravan. He called their trek ""an assault on our country,"" according to the newspaper. But there’s no evidence that Trump deployed the 82nd Airborne or that troops in Kentucky were put on notice. While we were writing this fact-check, credible reports did surface that the president is preparing to send to the border at least 800 U.S. Army troops, including engineers to help construct tents and fencing, doctors for medical support and ""potentially some personnel to operate drones along the border,"" the New York Times reported.   Still, none of what was said about deploying specific troops to respond to an ""invasion,"" as the Facebook post described, has been reported by legitimate media. Next, the migrant caravan was growing. It’s the largest caravan of it’s kind in recent years, according to The Washington Post, which put the number of migrants at ""more than 5,000."" On Oct. 22, the United Nations estimated that about 7,200 people are currently walking north. One of the caravan’s organizers told CNN that 7,500 people are now participating, according to the news organization. Wired called a number listed for an anti-immigration militia on a similar post. ""The militia member who answered said that the 42,000 number was bogus, and that government officials have told the group that the caravan consists of around 7,000 people,"" the magazine said. One newspaper, El Universal in Mexico, reported on Oct. 22 that more than 14,000 Hondurans were at the Mexico-Guatemala border. The paper attributed the figure to municipal authorities, a regional diocese and the National Migration Institute. There doesn’t appear to be evidence that the group will merge with 40,000 Mexicans, though. Elements of this Facebook post contain granules of factual information: The caravan is large and has been growing, though size estimates vary and there are now reports that weary walkers are turning back. Trump has also threatened to deploy troops to the border. Reports indicate he may send about 800 troops there to offer support. But Trump has not signed deployment orders for the 82nd Airborne Division, as this post specifically claims.

Leah Vukmir's attack on Tammy Baldwin ignores that Medicare for All would replace, enhance Medicare
","Would the Bernie Sanders Medicare for All plan, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., really mean no more Medicare for senior citizens? It’s an attack on Baldwin made by Leah Vukmir, her Republican challenger  — who even goes so far as to say the bill would ""literally throw grandma off the cliff."" That’s a reference to PolitiFact National’s Lie of the Year for 2011 — a false claim that Republicans had -- via a plan from Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan -- to end Medicare. (A web video produced by a liberal group showed a Ryan look-alike pushing an old woman in a wheelchair off a cliff.) Vukmir is essentially repeating a claim President Donald Trump made in an opinion article he wrote for USA Today.   Let’s dig into what she said. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. In the third and final debate before the Nov. 6, 2018 election, Vukmir turned a discussion about pre-existing medical conditions to Medicare for All. In the Oct. 19, 2018 debate in Milwaukee, she said: Senator Baldwin wants to talk about going backwards. Going backwards is telling seniors that you no longer have your Medicare and your Medicare Advantage. I can’t believe that Senator Baldwin wants to literally throw grandma off the cliff. That’s exactly what she’s doing. This would create chaos of epic proportions. She doesn’t understand her own bill. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. So, what Vukmir is claiming is that the Medicare for All plan supported by Baldwin means senior citizens would ""no longer have"" Medicare. Medicare is the federal government’s health insurance program that is primarily for people age 65 and over older, but also for some younger people with disabilities. As PolitiFact National reported in a recent explainer about Medicare, the financially stressed $600 billion-a-year program serves 58 million people -- almost one out of six Americans. Sanders, the independent U.S. Senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat in 2016, introduced his Medicare for All bill in September 2017. It’s been referred to a Senate committee, but nothing more has been done with it. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. As New York Times news articles reported at the time that the bill would expand Medicare so that every American would eventually get insurance from Medicare instead of from private companies or other public programs. In other words, a ""single payer"" -- the government -- would pay everyone’s medical bills. To be clear, Medicare for All would replace Medicare and Medicare Advantage. (Medicare Advantage, which is run by private companies and is optional, offers the services Medicare does as well as other servicess, such as dental or vision coverage.) But, after a four-year transition period, it would replace the current Medicare program with a new and more comprehensive one. Indeed, under the plan, those currently with Medicare would get more generous coverage -- something that has been noted by PolitiFact National and the Washington Post Fact Checker. According to the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation, a top source on health care, Medicare for All would cover not only all medically necessary services, but also dental and vision services. There would be no premiums or cost-sharing requirements, other than limited cost sharing (up to $200 per year) on prescription drugs. Patients would be allowed to go to any provider, not be limited by a network. So, that’s enhanced coverage for seniors -- not taking coverage away. To back Vukmir’s claim, her campaign cited an opinion column in the New York Post published three days before the debate. The column is by Betsy McCaughey, a senior fellow at the conservative London Center for Policy Research and a former lieutenant governor of New York state. (She earned a Pants on Fire for making a statement that was part of PolitiFact’s 2009 Lie of the Year on ""death panels."") McCaughey writes that Sanders’ Medicare for All ""abolishes Medicare,"" a point Vukmir has trumpeted. She argues that the program would not be financially viable, saying: On paper, the new program guarantees hospital care, doctors’ visits, even dental, vision and long-term care, all paid for by Uncle Sam. Here’s the hitch: Hospitals will be forced to operate under conditions of extreme scarcity, with too little revenue and more patients than ever.

Right now, Medicare shortchanges hospitals, paying them less than the full cost of caring for seniors. But hospitals accept the low payments, because they can shift the unmet costs to younger patients who have private insurance that pays more.

But in the new scheme, hospitals will be paid at Medicare rates for all their patients, not just seniors (Sec. 611). With everyone on Medicare for All, no cost-shifting will be possible. What would ultimately happen if Medicare for All ever became law, of course, is unknown, though there are plenty of questions. For example, health care policy expert Robert Moffit at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that with Medicare, ""the addition of new benefits, procedures and the availability of new medical technologies has traditionally lagged behind private (insurance) plans."" But as proposed -- as even the expert cited by Vukmir acknowledges -- Medicare for All would offer senior citizens more coverage. Vukmir says Baldwin’s ""Medicare for All"" means senior citizens would ""no longer have"" Medicare. Medicare, along with other government and private health insurance programs, would be replaced if Medicare for All ever became law. But it’s not as though senior citizens would lose Medicare and be left with nothing. In fact, as proposed, Medicare for All would provide them more benefits than they get with current Medicare. Vukmir’s statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression — our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA29400>],/factchecks/2018/oct/26/leah-vukmir/leah-vukmirs-attack-tammy-baldwin-ignores-medicare/

Don Bacon's comment on tax revenues increasing needs clarification
","In Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, claims about the nation’s finances flew back and forth in a recent debate between Democratic challenger Kara Eastman and incumbent Republican Don Bacon. One in particular caught our attention. In a discussion about the economy and tax policy, Eastman criticized Bacon’s support of the 2017 Republican-backed tax cuts and said it won’t benefit those in poverty or in the middle class and will add $1.9 trillion to the federal deficit. Bacon countered, claiming that wasn’t the case. ""The revenues are actually up after tax reform,"" he said. ""Revenues are up. We have to work on spending."" The Congressional Budget Office projected that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in December, would increase the total deficit over the next 11 years by about $1.9 trillion. According to a recent report by the the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the budget climbed to $779 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, increasing 17 percent from $666 billion in 2017. Bacon has a technical point. Tax collection data shows that overall revenues are slightly up. But the significance of this small increase is undermined once you factor in inflation — and there is strong evidence that tax revenues increased despite the new tax law, not because of it. The data does show that, without adjusting for inflation, tax revenues rose between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 — but only by 0.4 percent. PolitiFact has previously reported this rise is smaller than almost every previous year since World War II, except for a few years in which tax revenues declined, largely due to recessions. But even this small increase disappears once you consider other context — such as the flourishing economy and an adjustment for inflation. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors shrinking the federal deficit, found that after adjusting for inflation, tax revenues actually fell by 1.6 percent. (The calculation is for the first 11 months of fiscal 2018, compared to the first 11 months of 2017) Even more important, the role of the new tax law in boosting revenues is diminished once you look at the month-by-month data for tax collections. Three months in fiscal year 2018 were governed by the old law — October, November and December. Another two months — March and April — were governed by the new law, but were dominated by tax payments for income generated in 2017, and thus was predominantly shaped by the old law. A final month, September, had not produced final data by the time of our article. That leaves six months in which it was the new law that shaped tax payments to the government — January, February, May, June, July and August. And if you compare the cumulative collections for those six months in 2017 and 2018, tax collections actually declined by 3.8 percent between 2017 (when the old law was in force) and 2018 (when the new law was in force). The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation, told us the key idea is that tax revenues naturally grow with a growing economy. ""The economy has been doing well. Revenues, however, haven’t grown as much,"" said Donald Marron, an institute fellow at the Tax Policy Center. ""So the tax cuts reduced revenues relative to what they would have been, just as every serious analyst predicted."" The Bacon campaign said the congressman was, in fact, referring to the increased individual income tax receipts when he made the statement, not corporate revenues. Broken down, individual tax revenues have gone up, while corporate tax revenues have declined. Bacon defended the tax law by dismissing projections that it will add to the deficit, saying that revenues ""are actually up after tax reform."" Revenues did increase by 0.4 percent, but this historically small increase disappears once inflation is factored in. In addition, any causal link between this small revenue growth and the new tax law is dubious, since during the months in which the new law predominated, revenues were actually down. The Bacon campaign told us he meant to say that individual tax revenues have gone up, not revenues overall. Still, he didn’t specify that to viewers. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA227C0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/25/don-bacon/don-bacons-comment-tax-revenues-increasing-needs-c/

Marsha Blackburn falsely says Phil Bredesen lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee
","In the open race for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, Republican candidate Rep. Marsha Blackburn has repeatedly tied Democrat Phil Bredesen, former Tennessee governor, to loose immigration policies. A recent Blackburn campaign ad told voters that Bredesen ""won’t stop illegal immigration, because he lured it."" The ad flashes black and white images of Bredesen’s face against a backdrop of a highway packed with cars. ""It was Phil Bredesen who, quote, lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee,"" a man’s voice says in the Oct. 11 ad. ""Bredesen lured illegal immigrants hundreds of miles by offering them driver certificates. ""Now, Bredesen opposes President Trump’s immigration ban. And Bredesen admits, ‘I don’t believe the wall is the right answer.’ ""Phil Bredesen. He won’t stop illegal immigration, because he lured it."" The voiceover closes with shadowy images of young men ascending a ladder or a wall, presumably an illegal border crossing. We took a closer look at whether Bredesen ""lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee."" • Between 2001 and 2006, Tennessee went from giving immigrants in the country illegally full driver's licenses, to giving them driver's certificates, to giving them nothing. •  Under a 2004 law, illegal immigrants came from as far away as New Jersey to get certificates — before returning to their home states. •  In the face of abuses, Bredesen ended the certificate program in 2006. The arc of the state's laws on driving privileges for the undocumented goes from granting them regular driver's licenses to granting them nothing. Blackburn's issue with Bredesen deals with a policy adjustment in the middle. In 2001, Tennessee passed a law that allowed a person without a Social Security number to get a typical driver’s license. The bill had support from most Democratic lawmakers and a bit under half of the Republican ones. Republican Gov. Don Sundquist signed it. Blackburn was a state senator and voted against it. Bredesen took office in 2003. In 2004, in the middle of a growing demand for tighter identification standards in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks, Bredesen proposed creating a driver’s certificate. Anyone without a Social Security number who met the ordinary requirements for a license, such as passing a driver's test and proof of Tennessee residence, could get one. It was billed as a compromise between traffic safety and national security needs. ""Its purpose is to make sure people understand the law and the rules of the road,"" said Melissa McDonald, the spokeswoman for the Department of Safety in a 2005 New York Times article. ""You can't buy beer with it. You shouldn't be able to board a plane with it."" The driver’s certificate card bore the words, ""For driving purposes only — not valid for identification."" Unlike a regular driver’s license, a certificate expired after one year. The 2004 bill passed muster overwhelmingly with both Republicans and Democrats. The vote in the state Senate was 32-0, including 15 Republican senators, and in the House, with 45 Republicans, the vote was 96-2. (By then, Blackburn was in the U.S. Congress.) The law took effect in June 2004. By October, people began gaming the system. In one case, according to court papers, a woman in Tennessee ""transported illegal aliens from New Jersey to Tennessee in order to procure certificates for driving."" She provided them with ""hotel rooms while in Tennessee, and documents purporting to show that the aliens had addresses in the state."" The judge in the case wrote that the aliens said ""they wanted the licenses so that they could drive to their jobs in New Jersey."" Where the immigrants went after they had their certificates has some bearing here. Watching Blackburn’s ad, you might think that the program attracted them to Tennessee to live. That doesn’t seem to be what happened. Attorney Mike Whalen represented the women who brought in immigrants from New Jersey. ""To the best of my understanding, none of these folks stayed in Tennessee,"" Whalen said. ""I speak Spanish, so I represent lots of folks who are undocumented. Never saw it."" A larger scam operated out of a private driving school in Winchester, Tenn. Investigators discovered a scheme where people at the driving school bribed state workers to provide both licenses and certificates for undocumented immigrants. Officials said hundreds of illegal immigrants were directed to the school. The word ""lure"" comes from an Associated Press headline about the investigation. As federal and state law enforcement began arresting and charging people in late 2005 and early 2006, Bredesen shut down the certificate program. ""It’s clear from talks with law enforcement authorities that there are issues with this program that need to be addressed,"" Bredesen said in March 2006. ""The only responsible course of action is to suspend the program while we determine the next steps."" Stephen Fotopulos was policy director with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition in 2006. Fotopulos said his advocacy group tried to preserve the program by making it more rigorous. ""For months we worked with Department of Safety to change the process of getting a driver's certificate to make sure that only people in Tennessee would get it,"" Fotopulos told us. But in 2007, the Legislature passed and Bredesen signed the full termination of the program. With about 10 Democrats dissenting, the measure passed by wide majorities in both the House and Senate. Blackburn said that Bredesen ""lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee"" by offering a driver’s certificate for the undocumented. The one accurate part of the claim is that people came from out of state and fraudulently applied for both certificates and full driver's licenses. After that, the claim begins to break down. Bredesen swapped a more lenient licensing law signed by his Republican predecessor for a less useful certificate that could not serve as official identification and lasted for only a year. To pin the law to Bredesen ignores that nearly every Republican lawmaker approved that change. When problems surfaced, Bredesen preempted the Legislature and ended the program by executive action. The next year, Republicans and most Democrats voted to affirm that move. Lastly, the ad strongly implies that Bredesent sought to have illegal immigrants stay in Tennessee. There is no evidence for that. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC93DD40>],/factchecks/2018/oct/25/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-falsely-says-phil-bredesen-lured-/

Mostly False: Donald Trump claim that Beto O'Rourke voted to shield MS-13 members from deportation
","President Donald Trump, stirring Texas supporters, charged Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O’Rourke with voting to shield violent gang members from deportation. Trump, urging voters at an Oct. 22, 2018, Houston rally to re-elect his onetime nemesis, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said that O’Rourke, the third-term congressman from El Paso who opposes Trump’s avowed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, ""even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation."" Trump went on: ""He doesn’t want to deport them. He says they’re people, they’re people. They carve you up with a knife but they’re people."" So, did O’Rourke vote to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation? We didn’t get a White House reply to our request for Trump’s factual backup. But we identified a 2017 House vote on a proposal related to deporting or not admitting criminal gang members to the United States. O’Rourke and an outside expert subsequently told us the Texan’s vote didn’t shield MS-13 members from deportation, which happens regularly under current law. What’s MS-13? It’s a misconception that MS-13 members hail entirely from abroad in that the violent group started in Los Angeles where many refugees from civil strife in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua fled in the 1980s. In 2017, the Justice Department said there are an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members operating in at least 40 states. Members are concentrated in Los Angeles, Long Island in New York and the region outside Washington, D.C., the New York Times reported in March 2018. The Times, citing federal authorities, said the gang’s 30,000 other members live in Central America or Mexico. MS-13 stands for Mara Salvatrucha, which comes from the words ""mara,"" a Spanish term for gang, ""salva,"" for El Salvador, and ""trucha,"" slang for cunning. The ""13"" refers to the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, or ""M,"" which denotes the gang’s allegiance to the Mexican Mafia, a prison gang, DOJ said. In 2012, MS-13 became the first street gang to be designated by the government as a transnational criminal organization when President Barack Obama did so. Our October 2018 search of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website yielded more than 270 web pages detailing actions against MS-13 members----including arrests, criminal convictions and removals. A 2017 House vote Another web search led us to see that the House in September 2017 voted mostly along party lines to send the Senate the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act. As of October 2018, it still hadn’t received Senate consideration. In a news story at the time, The Washington Post said that the proposal ""would allow officials to take action against suspected gang members, regardless of whether they've been convicted of a crime."" Advocates said the move would enhance public safety. Before the vote, the White House issued a statement saying advisers would urge Trump to sign the measure into law should the House version reach his desk. That statement credited the proposal with giving ""law enforcement needed tools to help ensure that criminal alien gang members are deported quickly and never again allowed to enter the United States."" Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union said the measure ""would promote racial profiling, erode due process and unintentionally affect others, such as clergy who try to help gang members,"" the Post story said. Immigrant advocates maintained ""it would give law enforcement wide latitude in designating groups of people as gangs and seeking to deport, detain or block their asylum before a crime has been committed,"" the story said. By our read, the legislation would enable federal officials to designate criminal gangs, defined as five members or more bent on criminal activity, and permit a consular or law enforcement official not to admit a person to the U.S. if the official knows or has reason to believe the individual is or has been in a criminal gang--with no requirement that the individual have criminal convictions. Also, the legislation permits immigration authorities to start deportation proceedings against anyone in the U.S. believed to be or have been in a criminal gang. O’Rourke’s nay Next, we confirmed from a roll call vote that O’Rourke was among 174 Democrats to vote against the measure, which won House approval by 233-175. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan was the sole Republican to vote ""no."" In floor debate, a co-sponsor of the proposal, Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said that without the legislation, MS-13 members could legally stay in the U.S. unless they were convicted of deportable offenses, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record. If the legislation became law, Labrador told members, ICE would newly ""be permitted to place alien gang members into removal proceedings on the grounds of being criminal gang members"" as determined by specifications in the measure of crimes considered to be gang related, Labrador said. Labrador also said: ""I have heard some uneasiness that ICE will use these provisions to charge any alien they encounter with gang activity. Our bill does not allow that."" Under the measure, he said, ICE would have the burden of proof when charging an immigrant with a deportable offense. ""The government must convince an immigration judge of its case,"" Labrador said. Democratic members countered that the proposal would enable the Department of Homeland Security to deny admission to or deport any immigrant, including one who has no criminal history or gang affiliation, so long as DHS believes the person is associated with such a group. Under the proposal, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said, there ""is no need for conviction or even an arrest. All DHS needs is a belief that the individual has assisted any group of five or more people that DHS believes has committed one of these long list of offenses,"" Lofgren said. Zofgren also suggested the legislation could lead to a religious group that aids immigrants facing charges. ""This isn't just theoretical,"" Lofgren said, going on: ""During the 1980s, members of the faith community were repeatedly criminally prosecuted for providing transportation to undocumented immigrants."" There was a related vote. By 220-184, members rejected a Democrat’s motion to have the proposal amended to bar the deportation of any person ""for action taken on behalf of a religious organization whose primary purpose is the provision of humanitarian assistance or aid."" O’Rourke voted in favor of the motion. O’Rourke campaign disputes characterization By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign responded to our inquiry about Trump’s claim by disputing the president’s characterization of O’Rourke. Existing law, Evans said, ""makes immigrants who commit crimes related to gang activity deportable."" O’Rourke, Evans wrote, ""believes in ensuring MS-13 members are held responsible for their crimes under our justice system and he believes in enforcing our current immigration law."" We also heard back from David Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the libertarian-rooted Cato Institute. Bier, a former staff adviser to Labrador, called Trump’s claim about O’Rourke incorrect. Calling the legislation a ""political effort,"" Bier told us by phone that significantly, neither the White House nor other supporters of the measure had identified examples of MS-13 members the government couldn’t deport without the House-approved changes in law. ""If there were any examples,"" Bier said, ""they’d be displaying them."" Does existing law shield gang members? Stepping away from the legislation, we wondered whether existing law shields MS-13 gang members from deportation. Early this year, PolitiFact looked into whether MS-13 members detained in the U.S. were being let go by authorities. To the contrary, Steve Yale-Loehr, who teaches at Cornell Law School, responded that the government by law must detain individuals who have committed certain crimes while going through deportation proceedings. He pointed out provisions in federal code requiring the government to take into custody any individual convicted of a range of offenses including those involving firearms, illegal drugs or aggravated assault. Yet individuals can seek asylum if they have suffered persecution or fear they will suffer persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Yale-Loehr said: ""If an individual caught along the border claims asylum, he or she will have their claim reviewed by an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If they can show they have a credible fear, the individual goes through the immigration court process. If they don’t have a credible fear, or if an immigration judge denies their asylum claim,"" they will be deported, Yale-Loehr said. But immigration experts said that it’s difficult for gang members to receive asylum. Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law, said: ""If the gang member persecuted others or committed a serious crime in the United States or his country of origin, he would likely be barred from asylum."" If a gang member or criminal can somehow make a substantive case that their asylum argument should be heard, the immigrant would be allowed to stay in the United States until their hearing. They would typically post a bond to do so. Critics call this wrinkle ""catch and release."" Yale-Loehr said Border Patrol agents and ICE officials can release people in this way, under what is known as prosecutorial discretion. In addition, immigration judges can allow immigrants in deportation proceedings to be released after they pay a bond, if they meet certain conditions. ""But that is happening less and less often under the current administration, and the government is certainly not required to release people who may be deportable, Yale-Loehr said in February 2018. He cited a Department of Homeland Security memo that drastically cut back on the practice in February 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated. Our ruling Trump said O’Rourke ""voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation."" We see an element of truth to this claim because O’Rourke did not vote for a Trump-backed measure pitched as easing deportations of suspected criminal gang members. But we spotted no evidence that O’Rourke’s ""no"" was a vote to shield violent gang members from deportation. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Donald Trump said many presidents don't get to appoint a justice. He's wrong
","One of President Donald Trump’s most significant achievements in office has been the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Trump took a victory lap during an Oct. 24 rally in Mosinee, Wis., reminiscing about the two justices he had nominated for the court, Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. ""A lot of people say that's the most important decision a president can make,"" Trump said (at about the 25-minute mark in this video). ""Now, I would say war and peace. ... But it is a very, very important decision. And they are two great people and I'm very honored. You know, many presidents don't get a chance to put a Supreme Court justice on. Here we are less than two years and we put two of them on."" We wondered if Trump is right that ""many presidents don't get a chance to put a Supreme Court justice on."" He’s not. We looked at the full list of Supreme Court justices and found that only four presidents failed to nominate a justice during their tenure in the White House. Put another way, more than 90 percent of presidents have sent at least one justice to the court. And during the last 150 years, there has been only one such unlucky president. Here’s the rundown of presidents who didn’t get one of their nominations on the Supreme Court: • William Henry Harrison, the ninth president. Harrison died after serving only 31 days in office. • Zachary Taylor, the 12th president. Taylor died after serving a year and four months in office. • Andrew Johnson, the 17th president. Johnson succeeded the assassinated Abraham Lincoln and spent less than a full term in office. • Jimmy Carter, the 39th president. Carter served one term before losing reelection. Putting at least one justice on ""is not at all uncommon"" for a president, said Rutgers University presidential historian David Greenberg. Here’s a list of post-World War II presidents and the number of successful Supreme Court appointments each had.   President Number of Supreme Court justices placed Harry Truman 4 Dwight Eisenhower 5 John F. Kennedy 2 Lyndon B. Johnson 2 Richard Nixon 4 Gerald Ford 1 Jimmy Carter 0 Ronald Reagan 3 George H.W. Bush 2 Bill Clinton 2 George W.

Only four presidents out of 45 have failed to place a justice on the high court, which doesn’t come close to the description ""many."" In the past 150 years, only one president has missed a chance, Jimmy Carter.

Democrats fail to mention that things have changed in Kansas
","That was then. This is now. If ever there was a time for that cliche, it is in the context of a new ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, attacking Republican candidate Steve Watkins in Kansas. Watkins is running in the Kansas 2nd Congressional District, which either he or Democratic opponent Paul Davis will serve, pending the Nov. 6 election outcome, because incumbent U.S. Rep. Lynn Jenkins is retiring after five terms. It is a heated, insult-slinging, competitive race, requiring campaigning up and down the state’s eastern border, but things were testy just among Republicans in the early August primary, too. Seven Republicans vied for their party’s nomination, and Watkins beat his nearest competitor, Caryn Tyson, by only 2,255 votes. Watkins’ opponents and the news media had a number of questions about the man who would go on to win, and since politics can be a blood sport, some of those questions have been revived in advance of November. Thus, a claim in a new DCCC ad, which says that ""over 40 Republican leaders denounced Watkins’ campaign."" Yes, 40 Republican leaders collectively announced concerns about Watkins in late July, as did some others individually. As we said, that was then. What the ad fails to mention is that all or most of those 40 support him now. A number of them are working to elect him. Here’s why they criticized him, and why they came around later. Watkins came to the race as a West Point graduate and former Army ranger, an engineer, an adventurer and an outsider. His father put more than $587,000 into a super PAC that supported his campaign with TV ads, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. (The sum has since grown to nearly $766,000, Federal Election Commission reports show.) His first time voting in Kansas was in a 2017 Topeka city council race, and it was unclear if he had ever voted anywhere before then, McClatchy and the Kansas City Star said. As Watkins decided on running for office, he discussed possibilities with Democrats, too, the Kansas City Star reported in yet another story. It was all a bit too much for some Kansans. And so on July 31, a group of 40 ""grassroots leaders"" in the district issued a news release expressing ""concerns"" about Watkins. They said: ""Based on reports published in the Kansas City Star, a search of voter records, and the candidate’s own words, Watkins has never voted in a partisan election in Kansas – or any other state. He was not registered in Kansas until recently, when he registered in preparation for filing his candidacy for the open congressional seat."" They noted ""additional questions about the significant funding the candidate is receiving from out-of-state sources. His residency is also unclear since he returned to Kansas shortly before running for office. His wife does not live in Kansas."" Finally, they said, Watkins ""used the likeness and the words of President Trump without permission suggesting he had been endorsed by the man he didn’t vote for. Reliable sources have confirmed that there have been no candidate endorsements for this race and that no permission was given for Watkins to suggest otherwise."" In short, they viewed him as someone who hadn’t done the work or paid his dues, a newcomer taking shortcuts and liberties. Then he won the primary. Watkins still faces questions from reporters and from Democrats concerning his role in starting or building a company, a result of another Kansas City Star story. PolitiFact addressed that earlier this month after the DCCC brought it up in a different ad. The DCCC continues those questions in its newest ad, too. But the new ad’s claim about being denounced by 40-plus Republican leaders stood out to us as odd, considering that President Trump was in Topeka on Oct. 6, praising Watkins. And Vice President Mike Pence campaigned for Watkins just last week. ""I’m here for one reason and one reason only,"" Pence told nearly 200 people at the Oct. 19 rally, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. ""Kansas and America needs Steve Watkins in the Congress of the United States of America. So what about those Republican denouncements cited in the DCCC ad? Every one of the 40 expressing concerns has changed his or her mind, said Cheryl Reynolds, a member of the Kansas Republican executive committee and chair of the party’s 2nd Congressional District organization. Reynolds, it should be noted, was at the top of the list of those expressing concerns about Watkins in July. She was the person who sent out the list in the first place. She told us she has spoken with nearly every on the list, and was told by intermediaries that those she had not reached share her support now for Watkins. Asked what changed, Reynolds told us that after the primary, she set up two meetings between the nominee and district Republican leaders, including county chairmen and women, to hear one another out. ""We care about the positions"" that elected leaders will go to Washington to work on, she said. ""And we are confident that we have a candidate who supports the positions of the 2nd District."" Those include a strong border, opposition to abortion and support for the Second Amendment. In an earlier statement, Reynolds and three others on that list — the entirety of the Kansas Republicans’ 2nd District officers — said, ""We are confident Steve Watkins will represent the conservative values of Kansans — and continue to contribute to Making America Great Again and helping to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda."" Ed O'Brien, the district's Republican vice chair and one of the 40 who signed the earlier letter of concern, affirmed the sentiment in an email to PolitiFact.  ""Steve Watkins more than satisfied our curiosity,"" O'Brien said. ""His positions on the issues closely mirrored our own and those of the majority of 2nd District voters. Once we got to know Steve better we were more than happy to throw our support behind Steve Watkins, the people's choice."" Is it all peace, harmony and kumbaya? PolitiFact attempted to reach three of Watkins’ primary opponents who were outspoken during their race, but did not get calls back. One of them had called Watkins ""a charlatan, a fraud and an opportunist."" Another Republican, Kris Marple, chairman of the Wilson County Republican Party, told us in an email that he backed a different candidate in the primary but did not sign the letter. ""However, I'm supporting Steve in the general, and I feel that most of those that did sign the letter are supporting him as well, but I don't know who nor how many,"" Marple said. This is not unconditional support. Marple told reporters from McClatchy in early October that while he’s willing to give Watkins his nod, ""if we come to find out that stuff’s true and he’s really not what he says he is, we’ll replace him in two years, I guess."" Another sign of ambivalence came through during the Kansas Farm Bureau PAC’s statewide endorsement process. The PAC announced its endorsements Oct. 10 but declined to back a candidate in the 2nd Congressional District. Asked why, Cory Saunders, the bureau’s public policy manager, told us that when members were polled, ""there just weren’t a lot of recommendations for either Watkins or Davis,"" the Democratic opponent. The DCCC said that ""over 40 Republican leaders denounced"" the Watkins campaign. The big group of 40 that stated concerns did so in late July. Reynolds, the district official who made those concerns public, says the Republicans are now behind the candidate. It may be conditional love, and there may be holdouts among others in the district. When something was true months ago but the actors have changed their minds, and when the context needs to be explained this fully, we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA502C0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/25/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-fail-mention-things-have-changed-kansas/

Bloggers mistake flag burners in Honduras for migrant caravan members
","An estimated 7,000 people are making their way through Mexico in hopes of entering the United States in an exodus that is causing concern in some corners of the U.S., where President Donald Trump's signature promise has been to secure the Mexican border. Some bloggers have been promoting the idea that the group, which originated from Honduras, hates America. Among their sources of evidence: an Associated Press photograph showing two people holding up a burning U.S. flag that has been defaced with a swastika. Breitbart included the photo at the top of its Oct. 22 story headlined, ""Protesters in Support of Caravan Paint Swastika on American Flag, Burn It in the Street."" The story has now been shared more than 20,000 times on Facebook. Soon after Breitbart posted its story, Pamela Geller president of the conservative American Freedom Defense Initiative, embedded the Breitbart story into her own blog with a different headline, ""'Caravan' Migrant Army Paint Swastika on American Flag, Burn It in the Street."" These stories were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Geller, who describes herself as a practitioner of ""independent, investigative journalism,"" then shared her blog post on Twitter and Facebook, writing, ""Is it any wonder the Democrat (sic) party of treason is fighting to bring this horror into the country?"" But her characterization of the photo being a picture of caravan participants is wrong. The AP photo was taken at a protest in Honduras at a time when the caravan had already passed through Guatemala and was stalled at its border with Mexico. The caption that accompanied Associated Press photographer Fernando Antonio's image said, ""Two people burn a United States flag during a protest in favor of the caravan of migrants that is currently stuck on the Guatemala-Mexico border, in front of the American embassy, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Friday, Oct. 19, 2018."" Contacted by email about the photo on Thursday, Anita Baca, AP photo editor for Latin America & the Caribbean, again confirmed that the photo did not depict migrants participating in the caravan. The photo was made, Baca wrote, ""in front of the U. S embassy during a Friday night, Oct. 19th protest against Trump’s response to the caravan and also as a show of solidarity for the caravan."" Geller did not respond to an email or a Facebook message. So, while Breitbart accurately characterized the flag-burning as being the work of protesters, that didn’t stop other bloggers from mischaracterizing its origin. Like Geller, conservative Christian blogger Bob Williamson posted the AP photo and, referring to the caravan, said, ""The worst thing I've seen is them painting a swastika on our American flag and then burning it. What the heck are these people thinking?""  A poster at conservativeunderground.com gave the photograph this headline: ""Honduran 'Refugees' Paint Swastika On Our Flag Then Burn It."" This photograph was taken by an AP photographer during a protest in Honduras that was staged in support of migrants caravanning to the U.S. border. It does not show members of the ""caravan migrant army"" burning a defaced U.S. flag.

","Are Central American refugees hoping to relocate to the United States desecrating the stars and stripes as they head north?

But the photos aren’t from Mexico, where the migrants are now walking toward the southern border. The first image is the thumbnail used on Fox News TV reports on an anti-Trump protest  in New Mexico that turned violent in May 2016. And the flag isn’t an American flag but a Trump flag. ""Trump for president 2016,"" it says. ""Make America Great Again!"" The second photo was taken by Dan Kitwood, a Getty Images photographer who took a picture of a flag burning outside the American embassy in London during a protest in September 2010. As a stock image, it has been repurposed in subsequent stories, like one about Judge John Bates and a Deadspin article about ""movies that made us feel crappy about America."" The third photo is care of Reuters, and shows protesters burning the American flag outside the Republican National Convention in 2016. On Oct. 19, two people burned an American flag ""during a protest in favor of the caravan of migrants,"" according to a caption to an Associated Press photo that shows two men holding the corners of a burning flag with a swastika scrawled on it. But that happened in front of the American embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, when the caravan was stuck at the Guatemala-Mexico border. We haven’t found credible reports of other instances of flag-burnings connected to the caravan, and no stories of migrants making the march north burning the American flag themselves. As some Americans fret about the growing group en route to the U.S.-Mexico border, this post misuses old, unrelated photos of flag-burnings and wrongly feeds fears of an invasion.

McCaskill is correct: Hawley is endorsed by the Citizens United group
","Sen. Claire McCaskill and Attorney General Josh Hawley have traded allegations of being cozy with dark money — political money with an unknown source — during their Senate contest. McCaskill has tied Hawley to Citizens United, the group behind the famous Supreme Court case that redefined rules for campaign finance. ""The people who got unlimited anonymous money from corporations into elections is a group called Citizens United,"" McCaskill said during a Q&A on Sept. 10 at Truman State University. ""My opponent is endorsed by Citizens United. He is all down for the dark money."" We decided to investigate the claim. Citizens United is an interest group for conservative causes. According to its website, Citizens United performs a number of functions — including production of documentaries pushing conservative ideas, advocacy campaigns for issues and contributions to candidates. The 2010 Citizens United vs. Federal Election CommissionSupreme Court decision established corporations as people and money as speech. PolitiFact wrote in 2010: ""While corporations are still barred from giving directly to federal candidates, they are no longer forced to create political action committees in order to spend money on electioneering. A corporation, the justices held, may simply spend funds from its own accounts."" The Citizens United Political Victory Fund has donated $10,000 to Hawley’s Senate campaign (two $5,000 donations), per its website and FEC data. David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, wrote an op-ed favoring Hawley’s 2016 attorney general bid in USA Today entitled ""Josh Hawley for Attorney General."" ""I was proud to be an early supporter of Josh Hawley for Attorney General and will support him again in his race for the Senate,"" Bossie wrote in a Fox News story published Oct. 23, 2017. The story detailed his support for a variety of conservative Senate candidates. Bossie was adamant that he hoped Hawley, someone he sees as outside the Republican establishment, would triumph over McCaskill, and he was particularly impressed with Hawley’s ""fine work fighting for religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case at the U.S. Supreme Court."" Hawley campaign spokeswoman Kelli Ford pointed out that McCaskill has benefitted from the dark money that she decried. In another fact-check, we found that dark money group Majority Forward has spent nearly $3 million opposing Hawley. McCaskill said, ""My opponent is endorsed by Citizens United.""

Schumer PAC has spent 'dark money' on McCaskill, but not as much as Hawley claims
","Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., railed against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing Kavanaugh’s opinions that restrictions on the flow of ""dark money"" issue ads are unconstitutional. McCaskill called Kavanaugh’s views on dark money ""the determining factor"" in voting no on his confirmation. But has she benefited from dark money more than any U.S. senator? Her opponent in Missouri’s U.S. Senate race, Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley, claimed in a tweet on Sept. 25 that McCaskill ""has had Chuck Schumer spend more dark money for her than for any senator in America."" Hawley claimed that the amount was ""$16 million and counting!"" ""Dark money,"" or political spending by unknown donors, is hard to track. Dark money groups don’t have to report their expenditures, and often, they don’t. It’s hard to know how much dark money influences election cycles. That ambiguity made Hawley’s claim that McCaskill has received more than $16 million intriguing to us. We decided to investigate further. Although these two PACs are considered to be controlled by Senate Minority Leader Schumer, D-N.Y., only one is considered by experts to be a dark money group. Senate Majority PAC, established in 2010 to support Democratic U.S. Senate candidates, is considered a super PAC, with the ability to raise unlimited sums of money. The third biggest super PAC in the nation, Senate Majority PAC is required to report its donors, who include George Soros, Bill Maher and Seth MacFarlane, to the Federal Election Commission monthly during election years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. As a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, Majority Forward does not disclose donors, which is why some call it a dark money group, said Brendan Glavin, data and systems manager of the Campaign Finance Institute, in an Oct. 10 email. As of Oct. 22, Majority Forward has spent over $35 million in total during the 2018 election cycle, according to data calculated by the FEC and gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics. It’s mostly spending against Republican candidates; barely over $3 million of this goes in support of Democrats. In Missouri, Majority Forward has spent no money in support of McCaskill but has spent just under $3 million against Hawley. Hawley is Majority Forward’s fifth-highest spending target, and the top seven are all against Republicans. Senate Majority PAC has spent more money against Hawley than for or against any candidate, with $10,793,478 against the Missouri attorney general, as of Oct. 22. McCaskill’s receipt of $3,296,351 ranks her third among Democratic candidates. Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward do share ""office space, staff members and even a president."" But that doesn’t mean that Senate Majority PAC is spending dark money, and we cannot count its considerable expenditures in the Missouri race as evidence of dark money per Hawley’s claim. Dark money groups don’t always promptly disclose their spending, Anna Massoglia of the Center for Responsive Politics said in an email on Oct. 9. Some dark money spending isn’t reported at all, especially when dark money groups run ""issue ads"" that don’t explicitly endorse or speak out against one specific candidate. These ads don’t have to be reported to the FEC. Though his numbers were based on reported expenditures, Hawley may be more correct than he thought. Massoglia noted that grassroots organizing, voter mobilization campaigns and digital ads are hard to track and ""may be unaccounted for until long after the election is over."" This makes extra dark money spent for McCaskill or against Hawley difficult, if not impossible, to account for. Glavin pointed out Majority Forward’s unreported expenditures in Missouri. ""According to media reports Majority Forward has been spending money in Missouri since 2017 on get out the vote activities and ads that do not require reporting to the FEC,"" Glavin said. Both Massoglia and Glavin told PolitiFact they couldn’t verify Hawley’s claim of $16 million in dark money spent by Schumer on behalf of McCaskill. ""The most outside spending reported in FEC disclosures for McCaskill or against Hawley that could be loosely attributed to Schumer as of this date totals just under $15 million at this date,"" Massoglia said. But she clarified that those contributions included not just Majority Forward but also Senate Majority PAC, which has to disclose its donors. Attorney General Hawley claimed that dark money spent on McCaskill’s campaign totals $16 million and counting, the most of any U.S. senator. Hawley is correct that Missouri’s Senate race has been the target of the most spending by Senate Majority PAC on one candidate, as well as the most between Senate Majority and Majority Forward, the two PACs attributable to Schumer. But when we look at just the dark money group, Majority Forward, the numbers tell a different story. Majority Forward hasn’t actually contributed to McCaskill, although it has spent about $3 million opposing Hawley. It is hard to account for all of the dark money spent in an election, and more continues to flow in. But Hawley’s claim was based on reported spending numbers. He’s off by roughly $13 million, considerably inaccurate in assessing the amount of dark money spent on McCaskill’s behalf. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDC6E40>],/factchecks/2018/oct/25/josh-hawley/schumer-pac-has-spent-dark-money-mccaskill-not-muc/

Donuts were not in short supply after Canada legalized marijuana
","Canadian donut sales were unlikely hurt by the legalization of marijuana. However, one blog’s claim that a Mary Jane-induced donut shortage caused Tim Hortons stores across the country to close early is laughable. Still, the story has been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook, so we thought we’d clear the air, just in case. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Oct. 17, 2018, Canada became the second country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana. The first was Uruguay. In the days that followed, several false news stories surfaced on social media speculating about repercussions of the legalization. The donut shortage story was published on World Daily News Report, and relied on quotes from a spokesman for Tim Hortons named James Dyke. There is no evidence that such a spokesman exists — Dyke has not been quoted in any other article and is not listed as an author on any Tim Hortons press releases. The World Daily News Report site includes a disclaimer that says all of its stories are fictional and that ""all characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle."" The first day of marijuana sales did result in shortages — of cannabis, not donuts. Customers in Quebec waited in lines for hours. Cannabis-selling websites glitched, sold out of product and crashed. We can’t say the same for the Canadian donut industry. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB55E40>],/factchecks/2018/oct/25/worldnewsdailyreportcom/donuts-were-not-short-supply-after-canada-legalize/

Did Stacey Abrams burn Georgia's flag?
","With Democrat Stacey Abrams in a deadlocked race with Republican Brian Kemp for Georgia governor, some of her opponents are casting doubt on her loyalty to the southern state. ""Stacey Abrams burning the flag of the state she seeks,"" reads a Oct. 21 post shared on Facebook. ""Do we really want someone who would desecrate the flag of our beloved Georgia in our Governor’s mansion? I don’t think so. This should disqualify her from consideration by anyone who loves Georgia."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post shows what appears to be a black-and-white newspaper photo of four people. ""Burning Georgia’s ‘racist past’ is how Lawrence Jeffries (right) described the flag-burning Sunday at the capitol,"" the caption says. ""From left are Ina Solomon, Jeffrey Harris and Stacy Abrams."" The woman identified as Abrams is standing in the background with her arms crossed, though her face is obscured. The post also includes an apparent news article clipping with the headline: ""AUC students burn state flag in protest at Capitol."" The story describes 10 students from the Atlanta University Center—members of its Students for African American Empowerment student group—who wanted the Confederate symbol removed from the state flag. Speakers said that ""the Georgia flag symbolizes a brutal time in the history of African Americans, and they demanded that the Legislature restore the original Georgia flag: the state seal superimposed on a field of blue,"" the story says. ""The current state flag — the Confederate battle flag alongside the state seal — was adopted in 1956 by defiant Georgia lawmakers who were angered by court-ordered integration."" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has claimed the article and photo as its own; they appeared in the newspaper in June 1992. (Abrams’s name is misspelled in the story.) Another story that ran in the paper that month identifies Abrams as one of three students who helped lead the Atlanta University Center’s protests after the Rodney King verdict. She was an 18-year-old freshman who was working on a congressional campaign, according to the article. The story also quotes Abrams and her father, a United Methodist minister named Robert Abrams. ""‘Stacey is not going to stop what she’s doing because of other people,’ Mr. Abrams said, just days after his daughter received abusive phone calls because she helped lead the rally where Georgia’s flag was burned."" ""It’s been unsettling,"" Stacey Abrams is quoted as saying. ""I got a call from one woman who said her family died in the Civil War, and the flag was a symbol of Southern heritage. She said if black people didn’t like the flag, get the hell out. It’s really strange to have someone call your house, ask for you by name, and call you a nigger. I’m used to stuff like that. When I was in the 10th grade, I had a police escort because my dad spoke out against the KKK. But I have to tell my parents what we’re [SAAE] going to do beforehand. I told them we were going to a demonstration, and we were going to have a rally. I kind of left out the flag burning part."" In a statement sent to PolitiFact from Abigail Collazo, director of strategic communications for Abrams’s campaign, the spokesperson describes Georgia at a crossroads during the candidate’s college years. The state was ""struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues, including symbols of the Confederacy, the sharpest of which was inclusion of the confederate symbol in the Georgia state flag,"" the statement says. ""Stacey was involved with a permitted, peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag. This conversation was sweeping across Georgia as numerous organizations, prominent leaders, and students engaged in the ultimately successful effort to change the flag."" While it’s true that Abrams was at a protest where Georgia’s state flag was burned, context matters. It wasn’t the flag that the state flies today, because the Confederate symbol that Abrams was protesting has been removed.

Bloggers poison truth in claim about flu shot dangers
","The push to get people vaccinated against influenza is in full swing, and so are efforts to scare people away from getting their shots. In a Facebook post, Nicole LeCrone Estep, who claims to have ""worked in healthcare for years,"" offers a photograph of a sign about flu shots that asks people to ""Research side effects & ingredients before poisoning yourself!"" The word ""poisoning"" is in bright red letters. The post states that the flu shot includes ingredients such as mercury, antifreeze, phenol, animal blood, animal viruses and formaldehyde. The meme offers no evidence and cites no source. She did not respond to a Facebook message. The Oct. 11, 2018 post has been shared more than 27,800 times. It was flagged by Facebook members as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Medical experts say the evidence is overwhelming that flu shots are safe and effective, although they routinely acknowledge that the shots are far from completely protective. The degree of protection depends, in part, on how well the experts predict which strains of influenza will be making the rounds during the coming flu season. Last year, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the shots were only 40% effective (57% for ages 6 months to 8 years and adults 50 to 64). Of the 183 children killed during the flu last season, about 80% were not vaccinated. So what about the ""poisons"" cited in the Facebook post? ""Almost everything in there is false,"" said Dr. Neal A. Halsey, after reading the post. Halsey is director emeritus of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. Let's go through the list. MERCURY - This is a reference to thimerosal, a preservative that inactivates any contaminants that might have escaped the production process. Thimerosal contains ethyl mercury, which decomposes rapidly, quickly passes through the body and is widely considered safe, unlike its poisonous cousin, methyl mercury, which is found in certain kinds of fish. Most flu vaccines no longer contain thimerosal and the ones that do -- packaged for multiple doses -- contain an amount too minuscule to cause harm. Vaccine opponents say thimerosal contains poisonous mercury and may cause autism. There is no evidence that the thimerosal in vaccines is harmful and numerous studies have disproven the claim that it causes autism. ANTIFREEZE - The meme isn't specific here. After all, common table salt is an antifreeze, lowering the freezing point of water. In addition, various creatures use natural antifreeze chemicals such as glycerol or dimethyl sulfoxide to survive freezing temperatures. Automotive antifreeze products contain ethylene glycol or propylene glycol. Neither are found in flu vaccines. ""No influenza vaccine contains an antifreeze,"" said Dr. Halsey. PHENOL - It's not used in the flu vaccine. (Though it is used in some over-the-counter products like mouthwashes, throat lozenges and throat sprays!) ANIMAL BLOOD - Chicken eggs have been used to make the flu vaccine but ""there is no animal blood in the influenza vaccine and any residual animal proteins or products from the eggs are not harmful to people,"" Dr. Halsey said. (In the past, people with a sensitivity to chicken eggs were excluded but new filtration rules have removed so much egg protein that it no longer poses a serious risk. Some flu vaccines aren't made with eggs at all.) ANIMAL VIRUSES - They have not been found in any flu vaccine. FORMALDEHYDE - This is present in tiny amounts of some flu vaccines. It has been used for years in vaccine development, often to kill live virus particles so they can be used in the vaccine to safely immunize a recipient. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, formaldehyde is also used ""to kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production."" If it is used, most is removed before the vaccine is packaged, the CDC reports. The human body, in fact, makes its own formaldehyde and is continuously processing the chemical. A healthy newborn weighing 6 to 8 pounds has 50 to 70 times more formaldehyde in their body than what they would get from all their vaccines, according to the Food and Drug Administration. In short, the claim that you are poisoning yourself when you get the flu vaccine is false. The fact that the vaccine could save you days of misery; prevent you from spreading the virus to family, friends and coworkers; and might even save your life or, indirectly, the lives of others, makes the claim irresponsible. We rate it Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF0E0C0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/25/blog-posting/bloggers-poison-truth-claim-about-flu-shot-dangers/

Fact-checking Gillum's claim about DeSantis $145,000 travel receipts
","Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and former Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis asked each other for receipts during a Florida gubernatorial debate: DeSantis asked who paid for Gillum's ticket to a Hamilton show, and Gillum called out DeSantis for travel paid by taxpayers. ""I would ask him, what happened to the $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money that he has yet to reveal?"" Gillum asked Oct. 24 during a WPBF 25 News debate. Here are the facts: DeSantis hasn’t released detailed receipts on $145,000 spent on travels, but he broadly reported the travel charges. Gillum’s campaign linked his claim to an Oct. 18 Naples Daily News article headlined, ""Candidate DeSantis won't disclose details of taxpayer-funded travel while in Congress."" The story says that DeSantis spent more than $145,000 in taxpayer money for travel as a congressman, including at least two trips to New York City to appear on Fox News shows. DeSantis was sworn into Congress in January 2013 and resigned in September to focus on his gubernatorial campaign. The story did not say DeSantis traveled to New York City to talk about his campaign — the known trips happened before he officially announced his candidacy in January 2018, although he had been expected to enter the race for months and President Donald Trump in December 2017 tweeted that DeSantis ""would make a great governor of Florida."" The story also doesn’t say that his spending broke House rules or laws. The crux of the story is that DeSantis hasn’t disclosed detailed travel receipts and that lack of information leads to uncertainty over how exactly he spent taxpayer money. ""Without receipts, it remains unclear how many trips DeSantis took at taxpayer expense to make media appearances. It's also difficult without those records to know how often he traveled at taxpayer expense to locations other than his Florida district or Washington office,"" the Naples Daily News story said. The money at issue comes from the Members' Representational Allowance, an annual allowance members of congress get to support their official and representational duties. The amount appropriated can vary per year. During his time in office, DeSantis’ allowance was more than $1 million but not more than $1.4 million. Authorized spending includes personnel salaries and benefits, travel, and office expenses. The funds cannot be used to pay for expenses ""related to activities or events that are primarily social in nature, personal expenses, campaign or political expenses, or House committee expenses,"" and members may be held personally liable for misspent funds or excess spending, said a September 2017 Congressional Research Service report. House members’ spending is published in a quarterly public report called Statements of Disbursements. The Naples Daily News analyzed reports submitted by DeSantis and found more than $1,000 spent on seven hotel stays since 2013, and 71 commercial transportation expenses totaling about $143,000. DeSantis did not provide to the news outlet details on where and how long he stayed in the hotels; nor receipts on the commercial transportation that would detail where, when, why or with whom he traveled, how many trips were by plane or train, and whether he traveled first-class or coach. DeSantis’ campaign did not respond to multiple PolitiFact queries. The Naples Daily News identified travel expenses listed in DeSantis’ spending reports that matched the dates of at least two appearances on Fox News TV and radio shows, in July and October of 2017. DeSantis discussed issues of the day, including Trump’s policies. DeSantis by that point had not officially entered the race but was expected to join. DeSantis’ appearances on Fox News and Fox Business propelled him into the national spotlight and helped him win Trump’s endorsement. ""The once little-known congressman spent so much time broadcasting Fox News TV hits from Washington this year that he learned to apply his own powder so he could look as polished as he sounded,"" Politico reported. Stephen Lawson, DeSantis’ campaign spokesman, told the Naples Daily News that the trips to New York were ""official office travel that included official media appearances."" If a member of congress is invited in his or her official capacity to do an interview with any media organization, then use of the Members' Representational Allowance would be considered permissible if that was the member’s primary purpose for travel, said Courtney Parella, spokeswoman for the Committee on House Administration. DeSantis could voluntarily release records detailing his travels, but without itemized receipts there isn’t a way of knowing exactly how he spent taxpayers’ money, said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at the government watchdog group Public Citizen. The level of transparency as it relates to the release of detailed receipts varies among lawmakers, and they are not legally required to provide itemized receipts to the public, Gilbert said. Gillum claimed DeSantis has not revealed $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money. DeSantis like other members of Congress received an allowance to cover expenses related to official duties. DeSantis has not disclosed — in detail — how he spent more than $145,000 in travel. But DeSantis has disclosed broad description for the expenses. Some reported expenses are listed as ""commercial transportation,"" but do not specify when or where the trip was taken. At least two travel expenses reported by DeSantis match the dates of 2017 appearances on Fox News shows. DeSantis’ campaign said those were official media appearances, because he was answering questions as a House member and had not yet entered the governor’s race. DeSantis is not legally required to disclose detailed reports of his travel. But a watchdog group said that without itemized it’s not entirely clear how DeSantis spent taxpayers’ money. Gillum’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Tony Evers is open to raising gas tax, but Scott Walker is the one saying it would be $1 per gallon
","In a video ad that appears on screens mounted on 3,000 gas pumps across Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker attacks his Democratic challenger, state schools superintendent Tony Evers, over the state gas tax. Wearing a Milwaukee Brewers jacket, Walker says in the 15-second spot released Oct. 9, 2018: ""Hi, it’s Scott Walker. Good thing you’re filling up, because if Tony Evers wins, he’ll raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon."" Walker has focused on the gas tax for months ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election. A week after the gas pump ad came out, he repeated the $1 claim about Evers in a TV ad. And the $1 claim is also made in a previous TV ad by Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. We’ve already been down this road. And what Walker says at the pump goes too far. When Walkers claimed Evers will ""raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon,"" our rating was Half True. The claim was more accurate on some taxes and less on others. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. What we found regarding the gas tax: On Aug. 15, 2018, the day after Evers won the primary election, Walker said Evers might be willing to quadruple the state’s 32.9 cents-per-gallon state gas tax because Evers hadn't said how much he would be willing to increase it. Later that morning, a reporter asked Evers about Walker’s comment and whether he would raise the gas tax by $1. Evers responded more generally by saying: ""I would support looking at anything, whether it’s removing tax credits, whether it’s slimming down state government, whether it’s gas taxes. Everything is on the table."" But by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. ""The only thing I ever said about that,"" Evers declared, ""is that every possible revenue source is on the table."" Evers has also said, in speaking about road funding, he ""has no range""  in terms of how high of an increase in the gas tax he would consider. And he has said that a $1 increase is ""ridiculous."" So, saying Evers will raise gas taxes by up to $1 per gallon, when he has only said he would consider raising the tax some amount, goes too far. And when we asked Walker’s campaign to back Walker’s gas-pump statement, the campaign didn’t cite anything new Evers has said since our earlier fact check. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Walker says Evers will ""raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon.""
  Evers has said he is open to raising the tax, which is now 32.9 cents per gallon, but the $1 figure comes from Walker. While Evers has said he ""has no range"" of how large an increase he would consider, he has called a $1 increase ""ridiculous."" For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF54CC0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/24/scott-walker/tony-evers-open-raising-gas-tax-scott-walker-one-s/
