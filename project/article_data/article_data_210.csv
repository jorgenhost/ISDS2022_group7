Jamie Radtke says Sen. Jim Webb is “a reliable vote” for Barack Obama and Harry Reid
","
Jamie Radtke did not join the list of politicians lauding U.S. Sen Jim Webb last week after the Democrat announced he would not seek reelection in 2012.

Instead, she blistered him. Radtke, a Tea Party activist who is seeking next year’s GOP Senate nomination, called Webb’s retirement ""a great opportunity to change the direction of our country.""

""Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid and their ruinous agenda,"" Radtke said in a written statement released on Feb. 11, the day Webb made announcement.

Webb, a former Republican turned Democrat, has always had a reputation for charting his own course. We wondered how much he was in sync with Obama and Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is Senate majority leader.

We turned to the voting records.

According to data compiled by non-partisan OpenCongress, Webb and Reid have voted together 1,325 times since Jan. 2007, when Webb joined the Senate. They have a ""voting similarity"" of 85 percent, according to the web site. Democratic senators average an 89 percent voting similarity.

The Washington Post also maintains an exhaustive congressional database. It shows Webb voted with a majority of Democratic senators 87 percent of the time during last Congress from 2009-11. Reid, during the same span, voted with his party 95 percent of the time.

The Post’s review of the 111th Congress includes 689 votes. Many were not controversial and supported by both sides of the aisle.

We looked at Webb’s record on President Barack Obama’s key initiatives. Webb and Reid were always in his corner. They voted for: 
It is worth noting that Webb, despite supporting the president and his party on a very consistent basis, has been scored as one of the more contrarian Democrats by Congressional Quarterly. In the 111th Congress only five other senators went against the party’s majority more often than Webb did. But voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us. 
But voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us. And on the highest-profile issues, Webb and Reid have backed the president.

"['National', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'National Rifle Association']","
Wayne LaPierre said that violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the 'right to carry' is lower than in areas that prevent it.
","
Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association delivered a stirring defense of gun ownership at the Conservative Political Action Conference in the wake of the mass shooting in Arizona.

""It's time to acknowledge what we know in our hearts to be true -- that the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he said. ""Just knowing there's a good guy with a gun around -- a cop, a guard, a soldier … and, yes, a law-abiding citizen with a gun -- makes us feel safer … because we are safer.""

LaPierre said it was time for a national ""right to carry"" law, a measure that many states already have adopted. Generally speaking, it means that law-abiding citizens have the ""right to carry"" guns as they go about their daily business. (There are typically a few exceptions, such as in government buildings and schools.)

""Right now, in the United States, 7 million law-abiding Americans legally carry a concealed firearm, 7 million in almost every state in the country,"" he said. ""And across the board, violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it. The whole flock is safer when the wolves can't tell the difference between the lions and the lambs.""

It's a matter of opinion whether a national ""right to carry"" law is a good idea, but we were interested in his statement that ""violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it."" So we decided to check it out.

We contacted the NRA and asked them about the statement, but we didn't hear back. We decided to begin with information from the NRA website, which claims that 40 states have ""right to carry"" laws, while 10 restrict it.

We should note that opinions may differ on whether a state has a ""right to carry"" law or not. The NRA says a state has a ""right to carry"" law if permits to carry are issued to applicants who meet uniform standards established by the state legislature. If state officials have the discretion to refuse individual applicants, then in the NRA's view, they're not ""right to carry"" states. The NRA identifies 10 states as lacking ""right to carry"" laws: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.

We next turned to the FBI's crime statistics, looking particularly at the violent crime rate. This is a statistic that counts violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. We should note that the FBI warns people not to create ratings from these statistics, saying that rankings ""provide no insight into the numerous variables that mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state, or region."" We went ahead and created a state ranking anyway, knowing that it wouldn't necessarily establish a causal link between ""right to carry"" laws and a lower crime rate. At this point, we simply wanted to see if the statistics were consistent with what LaPierre said.

We found the the states without ""right to carry"" were spread out across the list, not bunched together at the top. The District of Columbia, which has strict gun control laws, ranked highest for violent crime. The other states ranked as follows: Delaware, No. 5; Maryland, No. 10; Illinois, No. 13; California, No. 17; Massachusetts, No. 18; New York, No. 24; New Jersey, No. 30; Hawaii, No. 36; Wisconsin, No. 39, and Rhode Island, No. 42.

We also couldn't help noticing that some states with laws that favor gun ownership placed at different points along the list. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence rates state gun laws, so we looked at the 14 states that had the weakest gun laws. Here, we also saw a wide variation in where the states ranked in terms of violent crime: Alaska, No. 6; Louisiana, No. 7; New Mexico, No. 8; Arkansas, No. 11; Oklahoma, No. 12; Missouri, No. 15; Arizona, No. 21; West Virginia, No. 32; Kentucky, No. 38; Montana, No. 41; Idaho, No. 44; Utah, No. 47; North Dakota, No. 48, and South Dakota, No. 49.

So using the 2009 data, we don't see any evidence that state gun laws correlate with violent crime rates one way or the other, at least not ""across the board"" as LaPierre suggested in his speech.

Still, there's a more in-depth way to study violent crime rates, using many sets of data over multiple years and controlling for external factors. The book More Guns, Less Crime, by John R. Lott, first published in 1998, makes a case that by using extensive data sets, one can see clear reductions in crime over many years in states and counties that have ""right to carry"" laws, and he has continued to make that case in new editions of the book. But Lott's work has also been critiqued as flawed by other academics, who say that relatively small adjustments to the data sets yield different results or that Lott doesn't account for other factors that could be affecting crime rates.

The National Academies of Sciences concluded in 2005 that current data do not allow for firm conclusions about how ""right to carry"" laws affect crime. We think it's worth quoting the conclusion from Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review:

""The literature on right-to-carry laws summarized in this chapter has obtained conflicting estimates of their effects on crime ... No link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample; it is only once numerous covariates are included that the negative results in the early data emerge. While the trend models show a reduction in the crime growth rate following the adoption of right-to-carry laws, these trend reductions occur long after law adoption, casting serious doubt on the proposition that the trend models estimated in the literature reflect effects of the law change. Finally, some of the point estimates are imprecise. Thus, the committee concludes that with the current evidence it is not possible to determine that there is a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates.""

Getting back to our rating. LaPierre said, ""Across the board, violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it."" LaPierre could have used a qualifier here about studies that control for various effects, but he didn't: He said flat out that violent crime is lower in areas with ""right to carry."" We do not find that current crime statistics support this point. Some academics have said trends over time show that ""right to carry"" laws lower crime rates, but that argument is contested. There's certainly not straight-line correlation between states with ""right to carry"" laws and crime rates. LaPierre made it sound like the data clearly supported his view. They don't. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097005A40>],/factchecks/2011/feb/16/national-rifle-association/wayne-lapierre-said-violent-crime-jurisdictions-re/
"['Polls and Public Opinion', 'Texas', 'Tom DeLay']","
Tom DeLay calls Travis County, home to Austin, the most liberal county in the land
","
Questioning his Travis County conviction for laundering corporate money to help GOP Texas House candidates, Tom DeLay reminded NBC-TV’s ""Today"" show Jan. 13 that his  trial took place on Republican-unfriendly turf.

Asked by NBC’s Matt Lauer about the jury’s motivation, DeLay replied: ""Well, first of all, I was tried in the most liberal county in the state of Texas, indeed in the United States.""

No question, Travis County, where Democratic candidates thrive, where Ann Richards bloomed, where Barack Obama has been welcomed by roaring crowds, is a liberal haven.

But most liberal in the land?

Seeking back-up information, we reached DeLay’s daughter, Dani DeLay Garcia, who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman. Garcia said by e-mail that the county’s liberal pre-eminence is a fact reported many times.

Indeed, a Nexis search delivered numerous articles linking Travis County"" and ""most liberal,"" including about 50 stories mentioning DeLay. A closer look showed Travis County routinely described as the state’s most liberal county, but we didn’t spot anyone but DeLay calling it the most liberal in the nation.

Typical: A Nov. 25 news report by The Associated Press on DeLay’s conviction: ""DeLay had unsuccessfully tried to get the trial moved out of Austin, the most liberal city in one of the most Republican states.""

A February 2005 column by the since-deceased conservative commentator Robert Novak refers to then-Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle as an ""intense partisan Democrat who is routinely re-elected in Texas's most liberal county."" Likewise, a June 2005 article in Congressional Quarterly Weekly quotes Steve Bickerstaff, adjunct professor in the University of Texas School of Law, calling Earle ""part of the Democratic mainstream of this county, which is more liberal than elsewhere in the state."" 
We found one instance of a commentator airing doubts about the county’s liberal-ness compared to others nationally. On MSNBC Jan. 13, actor-comedian Sam Seder, a guest host on its left-leaning and now-defunct ""Countdown"" program, said: ""Travis County, where Austin is located, is bluer than most of the state; 64 percent of the residents voted"" for Obama for president ""in 2008. But calling it the most liberal county in the country might be just a stretch."" 
In a similar vein, we learned that FactCheck.org, a respected fact-checking unit at the University of Pennsylvania, recently weighed DeLay’s characterization. In a Jan. 14 post headlined ""DeLay’s Spin Cycle,"" the group noted that greater shares of voters voted for Obama in more than a dozen Texas counties, including Hidalgo (69 percent for Obama), Webb (72 percent), Presidio (71 percent), Zavala (84 percent) and Jim Hogg (74 percent). Nationally, FactCheck.org said, a greater share of voters in many other counties cast ballots for Obama. 
Next, we noticed a August 2005 study rating the nation’s most liberal and conservative cities based on results of the 2004 presidential election. Detroit was the most liberal, followed by Gary, Indiana, and Berkeley, California, according to the study by the California-based Bay Area Center for Voting Research. Austin ranked as the 93rd-most liberal city. Dallas, the study said, was more liberal, placing 32nd nationally.

A Google search brought us to an April 2010 post by The Daily Caller, a conservative Washington-based website that touts its reporting and commentary. The site designated the nation’s 100 counties deemed most friendly to liberals based on factors including the share of votes carried by Democrats John Kerry and Obama, respectively, in 2004 and 2008; percentages of adults with a bachelor’s degree or more as well as in management/professional jobs; the status of same-sex partnerships; strictness of smoking bans; and the number of local Whole Foods stores, referring to the natural-foods’ grocery chain headquartered in Austin.

The No. 1 most liberal-friendly county, the Caller said, is California’s San Francisco County; followed by Montgomery County, Md., a suburb of the nation’s capital; Northern California’s Marin County; Colorado’s Boulder County; and New York County, where Obama carried 85 percent of the 2008 vote. Travis County was the 57th most liberal-friendly county.

We wondered how Obama fared in the Caller’s 20 most liberal-friendly counties. According to 2008 results posted online by the New York Times, he won greater shares of the vote (ranging from 70 to 90 percent) in 18 counties than he did in Travis County.

Finally, we talked to Dick DeGuerin, DeLay’s lawyer, who shared part of an August 2010 poll of Travis County voters by GOP pollster Mike Baselice. According to the results, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points, about one-third identified themselves as liberals and the same portion identified themselves as conservatives. Also, some 60 percent of the 400 respondents had a positive impression of Barack Obama, compared to 35 percent for George W. Bush and 16 percent for DeLay.

We wondered how Travis County’s voters compared ideologically to voters in San Francisco County. Benjamin Meyers, a research associate at David Binder Research in San Francisco, shared part of a November poll in the county, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Of 500 respondents, 60 percent said they were registered Democrats, 10 percent said they were registered Republicans and others declined to say or indicated affiliation with another party. Fifty percent of the voters identified themselves as progressive or liberal, 25 percent said they were moderate and 14 percent said they were conservative.

Travis County, liberal? Certainly, especially by Texas standards. Most liberal in the country? Not by a long shot. 
The statement is more than wrong -- it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A404080>],/factchecks/2011/feb/16/tom-delay/tom-delays-calls-travis-count-home-austin-most-lib/
"['Ohio', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Trade', 'Jim Jordan']","
Rep. Jim Jordan compares U.S. debt to troubled European nations
","
As the newly-elected chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan of Urbana has become one of the most vocal budget cutters in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Just before he introduced ""Spending Reduction Act"" legislation to cut the federal budget by $2.5 trillion over ten years, Jordan delivered a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation that focused on fiscal discipline.

""Our debt to GDP ratios, our deficit to GDP ratios are quickly approaching the countries we have been reading about for the last year and a half,"" he warned. ""We are not far behind Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain and all these countries we have been reading about.""

Everyone knows the United States government is in debt, but is the situation really as bleak as it is for countries that teeter on the brink of insolvency? Politifact Ohio decided to take a look.

The Central Intelligence Agency has compiled a table that compares the ratio of public debt to the gross national product of more than 130 countries, including all those cited by Jordan.

According to the CIA, in 2010, Zimbabwe had the world’s highest public debt as a percentage of its annual gross domestic product: a whopping 241.6 percent. Japan was next at 196.4 percent. Greece was fourth on the list, at 144 percent, Ireland was 11th, at 98.5 percent, Portugal was 15th, at 83.2 percent, and Spain was 27th at 63.4 percent.

The United States clocked in at 37th, with a debt to GDP ratio of 58.9 percent, slightly higher than the world average of 58.3 percent. Countries including Canada, France and Germany – which aren’t generally listed among the globe’s festering fiscal fiascos – all have debt to GDP ratios that exceed the United States’.

Federal bean counters at the White House’s Office of Management and Budget and at the Congressional Budget Office predict the nation’s public debt to GDP ratio will climb to about 77 percent in the next 10 years, which exceed’s Spain’s current ratio and approaches Portugal’s.

""With such a large increase in debt, plus an expected increase in interest rates as the economic recovery strengthens, interest payments on the debt are poised to skyrocket over the next decade,"" the CBO said in a recent report on the federal deficit.

Is that level of debt likely to cause problems along the lines of those experienced by Greece, Ireland and other countries deemed fiscally unsound? Economists are divided on that question, although a study released last year suggests problems are most likely to arise after public debt reaches around 90 percent of gross domestic product.

University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith notes that many countries with higher debt to GDP ratios than the United States, like Japan, Italy and Belgium, aren’t in a financial crisis. He says Jordan’s numbers are correct, but the comparisons he makes are ""meaningless and therefore misleading.""

He says Japan and the United States are insulated from the default issues that plague other countries because they control the currencies in which they issue debt. Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal all have their debt in euros, so they need euro balances on hand to pay their debts.

""Greece has to draw on a euro account at a bank in order to make payments,"" Galbraith explained in an email. ""If the euros are not in the account, Greek government checks could bounce. In this respect, Greece is much more like, say, the state of Illinois; the European Central Bank is not obliged to honor its checks.""

On the other hand, he said the United States government makes all payments by marking up numbers in a computer -- the electronic equivalent of printing money. It doesn't get the dollars from anywhere -- it just sends a signal to the bank. He says U.S. Treasury Department checks can’t bounce, so there’s no default danger.

""As should be obvious, the markets know this, and so made the U.S. into a major beneficiary of the crisis of Greece et al.,"" Galbraith said. ""As Mediterranean eurozone bond yields rose, U.S. treasury yields fell. Why? Because investors sold Greece (and the others) and bought U.S. The markets thus recognize what Mr. Jordan does not: the U.S. public debt position is large and invulnerable, and actually opposite to that of the small, vulnerable eurozone nations.""

Boston University’s Laurence J. Kotlikoff is among those who predict dire consequences if the nation doesn’t get its fiscal house in order. He envisions massive benefit cuts for retired baby boomers, ""astronomical tax increases that leave the young with little incentive to work and save,"" and the government ""simply printing vast quantities of money to cover its bills."" Poverty and inflation are other problems he foresees.

""You print a lot of money, prices go up and people get hurt because money they had before you did this goes down in value in terms of what it can buy,"" Kotlikoff said in a TV interview.

So what to make of Jordan’s statement?

While the United States hasn’t yet reached the debt-to-GDP levels of the countries he cited,  it’s on on its way there. But it’s not clear that attaining those debt levels would cause the catastrophic economic damage he implies.

Other countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios haven’t imploded, but specifically citing nations like Ireland and Greece implies that disaster is near for the United States economy. In reality, the United States, with its ability to control its own monetary supply, has lots more going for it than Ireland or Greece.

Those are important details needed to put Jordan’s statement in proper context. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Jordan’s claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C61A00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/16/jim-jordan/rep-jim-jordan-compares-us-debt-troubled-european-/
"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Libertarian Party of Georgia']","
Libertarians claim get-tough immigration bill will 'bankrupt' Georgia
","
The war of words on immigration has grown high-pitched, and a recent warning from Georgia Libertarians is no exception.

""The Libertarian Party of Georgia Says Immigration Bill Will Bankrupt Georgia,"" began a news release condemning the ""Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011,"" or House Bill 87, which broadens the role state and local government play policing illegal immigration.

The cost to enforce it would be ""huge,"" the release said. Its economic effects ""catastrophic.""

Would it?

State Rep. Matt Ramsey, a Republican from Peachtree City, is lead sponsor of the wide-ranging legislation. It would allow legal residents to sue if they think an agency is not adequately enforcing state immigration law; ban transporting, harboring or enticing an illegal immigrant to enter the state; authorize an officer to check a suspect’s legal status if there is ""reasonable suspicion"" that he is here illegally; and require businesses with more than five employees to use the federal E-Verify system to ensure their workers are legal residents.

Some portions resemble Arizona’s HB 1070, which critics say encourages racial profiling and infringes on federal authority. The U.S. Department of Justice and civil rights groups are suing Arizona over the 2010 legislation, and major cities and organizations boycotted the state.  

We asked Brett Bittner, executive director of the Libertarian Party of Georgia, for evidence to back his claim about Georgia’s legislation. He did not have specific costs but said Ramsey’s bill ""grows the size of government.""

Lawsuits challenging its constitutionality could be costly, Bittner said. Plus, the provision that would allow individuals to sue agencies over enforcement could spawn frivolous suits.

""We’re not sure of the costs, and Representative Ramsey hasn’t provided any of the costs,"" Bittner said.

Indeed, Ramsey didn’t have an estimate. So PolitiFact Georgia dug up cost estimates for Arizona and states considering similar legislation and looked at an existing program for guidance.  

We found that estimates are extremely limited. Arizona’s costs for certain HB 1070 provisions are unknown because a federal judge temporarily blocked their implementation.

We also found that the impact is so complex that it is difficult to predict.

For instance, if illegal immigrants and their families leave Georgia because of the legislation, state government would no longer have to subsidize their children’s health care or education, advocates for lower immigration levels noted.  

But illegal immigrants would no longer buy goods or services or work here, which could lower tax revenue and weaken the economy, critics of the legislation told PolitiFact.

Most research, though limited, concludes tax revenue generated by all immigrants exceeds the cost of the services they use, the Congressional Budget Office said in 2007.

HB 87 could save money. Gwinnett County is part of the federal 287(g) program, which allows state or local law enforcement agencies to enforce certain immigration laws. Its sheriff said this program lowered its foreign-born jail population in its first year, saving between $386,010 and $2.1 million. Program staffing cost $1.2 million.

A January study on 287(g) said those local costs shift to the federal government.  

If one cost is almost certain, it’s legal bills.

Arizona’s total is $1.5 million as of early this month, and its governor is using donations to pay them. The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia plans to sue if HB 87 passes as written.

Another potential cost is from lost convention business from boycotts. Roughly three months after HB 1070’s passage, Arizona’s Hotel and Lodging Association said at least 40 group meetings were canceled, costing $12 million in revenue, excluding restaurant, retailer or rental car company losses. The progressive Center for American Progress estimated a total loss of about $141 million. This translates to $9.4 million in lost tax revenue.   

Estimates by other states for their own Arizona-style legislation also hint at potential Georgia costs.

The Kentucky Legislature is considering a bill that could cost $40 million a year despite savings on services for illegal immigrants who leave. A Utah bill could cost local governments between $5.3 million and $11.3 million yearly.

Ramsey argued that those bills are so different their estimates may not apply to HB 87. Indeed, Kentucky’s bill, unlike HB 87, makes crossing state lines as an illegal immigrant a crime. Arrests, and therefore costs, could be higher.

Still, Georgia’s bill contains provisions that on their face appear pricey. The provision that would allow local law enforcement agencies to check immigration status would likely cost money to transport illegal immigrants to federal facilities and train officers.

The bill would let residents sue state and local agencies for inadequate enforcement, which could result in big legal bills. Ramsey said he is revising the bill to address this.

To sum up:

While there’s no evidence to show the legislation would have ""huge"" and ""catastrophic"" effects, there is enough to be concerned that HB 87 could have significant costs. Whether the bill would save money down the road is unclear.

Regardless, Georgia’s budget is about $18 billion. And while the potential costs could strain the state’s already tight budget, it’s extremely unlikely they would bankrupt the state.

Georgia Libertarians’ alarmist statement that the bill ""will bankrupt Georgia"" is therefore False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973B7AC0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/16/libertarian-party-georgia/libertarians-claim-get-tough-immigration-bill-will/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Workers', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner says 200,000 new federal jobs have sprouted since start of Obama's term
","
In a Feb. 15, 2011, press conference, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said that ""over the last two years since President Barack Obama has taken office, the federal government has added 200,000 new federal jobs. And if some of those jobs are lost in this, so be it. We're broke. It's time for us to get serious about how we're spending the nation's money.""

A few readers asked us whether Boehner was right about the number of new federal jobs, so we checked into it.

We turned, as we always do, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official statistician for the United States labor force.

BLS calculates two categories that illuminate Boehner’s comment.

The first is the overall rise in federal employees between January 2009 and January 2011. The net increase was 58,000.

The second is the number of federal employees without counting U.S. Postal Service workers. Over that same two-year period, the increase was 140,800.

Both of those numbers are lower than the 200,000 figure Boehner cited.

We also checked with John M. Palguta, vice president for policy with the Partnership for Public Service, a non-profit that promotes government service, and he confirmed our general conclusion using numbers from a different database.

He dug into the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s on-line federal workforce data source, ""FedScope."" He found that in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, respectively, the federal government filled a net 59,995 and 47,062 new permanent, full-time, non-seasonal, non-postal jobs. Combined, that means that federal employment rose by 107,057 jobs -- well short of 200,000.

We checked with Boehner’s office to see what his statement was based on. Aides said they had used figures from December 2008 to January 2011, which produced an increase of 153,000 federal, non-postal jobs. Then they factored in, on a discounted basis, the temporary jobs required to carry out the 2010 Census. According to the Census Bureau, such temporary employment peaked at 585,729 in early May 2010.

""We think 200,000 is probably generous to the White House,"" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.

In previous fact checks, we have rejected the idea of adding temporary Census workers to federal job totals. While the statements we rated previously aren’t structured in exactly the same way as Boehner’s, we think the general principle remains valid -- that when you’re counting the rise or fall in the number of federal workers over a long period of time, it’s cherry picking to count the creation of temporary jobs but not their elimination.

All told, we find that Boehner’s 200,000 number is way off. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFCB4A80>],/factchecks/2011/feb/15/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-200000-new-federal-jobs-have-spr/

Barack Obama says White House budget would not add to the debt within a few years
","
During a Feb. 15, 2011, press conference, President Barack Obama responded to a question from Ben Feller of the Associated Press about the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget, which had been released one day earlier.

Obama said, ""What my budget does is to put forward some tough choices, some significant spending cuts so that by the middle of this decade our annual spending will match our annual revenues. We will not be adding more to the national debt. It's -- so, to use a -- sort of, an analogy that families are familiar with, we're not going to be running up the credit card anymore.""

It wasn’t the first time the administration had made the argument that the U.S. would ""not be adding more to the national debt"" within a few years if the budget were enacted. On Feb. 13, 2011, Jack Lew, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, appeared on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley and said, ""Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.""

Would the president’s budget really mean that within a couple years, the U.S. will ""not be adding more to the national debt""?

First, a bit of background about the budget. Every year in early February, the president releases a budget with detailed proposals for federal spending, laid out department by department and program by program. It is not a binding document. Rather, it is traditionally the opening proposal in the annual fight over federal spending, with Congress ultimately charged with passing spending bills that the president is asked to sign.

The administration’s budget document includes 10 years of future projections for federal outlays, revenues, deficits and accumulated debt. These are the tables we turned to first.

We’ll also remind readers that a deficit occurs when a given year’s worth of revenues is smaller than that same year’s spending. By contrast, the term ""debt"" refers to the accumulated total of past deficits, minus any surpluses.

Over the next 10 years, according to the president’s budget, there will be projected deficits every year. Here’s a rundown:

Year   Deficit
2010: $1.293 trillion
2011: $1.645 trillion
2012: $1.101 trillion
2013: $768 billion
2014: $645 billion
2015: $607 billion
2016: $649 billion
2017: $627 billion
2018: $619 billion
2019: $681 billion
2020: $735 billion
2021: $774 billion

So, with deficits every year for the next 10 -- and no surpluses -- the nation’s accumulated debt will rise every year for the next decade. Here’s the rundown by year of the projections for publicly held debt every year:

Year   Public debt
2010: $9.019 trillion
2011: $10.856 trillion
2012: $11.881 trillion
2013: $12,784 trillion
2014: $13,562 trillion
2015: $14.301 trillion
2016: $15.064 trillion
2017: $15.795 trillion
2018: $16.513 trillion
2019: $17.284 trillion
2020: $18.103 trillion
2021: $18.967 trillion

These numbers show that the publicly held debt rises each year. Two other measures of debt also go up every year from 2011 to 2021 -- gross federal debt (which includes public debt plus debt held by other parts of the government) and public debt adjusted for financial assets held by the government.

So the contention that  ""we will not be adding more to the national debt"" after the middle of the decade seems incorrect on its face.

So what is the administration thinking? The president gave a pretty good idea of his thought process during the press conference.

Obama responded in a follow-up question by Chip Reid of CBS News by saying, ""We still have all this accumulated debt as a consequence of the recession and as a consequence of a series of decisions that were made over the last decade. We've piled up -- we've racked up a whole bunch of debt. And there's a lot of interest on that debt. So in the same way that if you've got a credit card and you've got a big balance, you may not be adding to principal; you've still got all that interest that you've got to pay. Well, we've got a big problem in terms of accumulated interest that we're paying and that's why we're going to have to whittle down further the debt that's already been accumulated.""

In other words, Obama argued that new outlays stemming from his fiscal 2012 budget plan -- discretionary spending, military-related spending and entitlements -- wouldn’t be adding to the debt. Only interest payments stemming from past budgets would be adding to the debt.

First, we checked to see if he was right.

Here’s a rundown of the net interest totals for each of the 10 years. (Net interest is interest paid to the government minus interest paid out by the government.)

Year   Net interest
2010: $196 billion
2011: $207 billion
2012: $242 billion
2013: $321 billion
2014: $418 billion
2015: $494 billion
2016: $562 billion
2017: $627 billion
2018: $685 billion
2019: $741 billion
2020: $793 billion
2021: $844 billion

If you compare these totals to the projected annual deficits, the net interest begins to match or exceed the size of the deficit in 2017. The two numbers are exactly equal in 2017. Then, net interest begins to exceed the deficit by $66 billion in 2018, by $60 billion in 2019, $58 billion in 2020 and $70 billion in 2021.

The president has a point that current spending -- exclusive of net interest -- won’t be adding to the debt beginning in 2017, as it has for more than a decade. It is a little like getting to the point where you are covering monthly expenses with your income, rather than putting them on your credit card. But to extend the analogy, this ignores the big credit card debt hanging over you. That debt isn’t shrinking. In fact, the longer you take to pay down that debt, additional interest costs accrue, and the debt grows.

""This is what public finance economists refer to as ‘primary spending’ or ‘primary balance,’"" said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""But the White House is using these technical concepts in a very misleading way. Very misleading.""

If the president can somehow work with Congress to get his budget enacted, he’d have reason to boast that his plan would make annual spending -- minus interest -- equal annual revenues for the first time in years in 2017. That would be an accomplishment, but it doesn't equal ""not adding to the debt anymore."" Because of interest costs -- which amount to $884 billion in 2021 alone -- the debt is projected to grow during every year of the president’s budget. (It's also a bit of an exaggeration to call 2017 ""the middle of this decade."")

We think the president’s statement is likely to mislead a lot of Americans about what his budget would do. So we rate Obama’s statement False. 
UPDATE: Shortly after we posted this article, the White House responded to an earlier request for comment, arguing that Obama was not referring to actual dollars but to the fact that the budget will not increase the debt as a share of the economy. While it’s true that the debt as a proportion of GDP – at least when adjusted for financial assets held by the government – would fall slightly between 2013 and 2017 (from 67.7 percent to 66.8 percent), that's not the explanation Obama gave in the news conference. Our rating is unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2E77C0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-white-house-budget-would-not-add/
"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says an alternative to state employee health and pension changes is bumping 200,000 children out of Medicaid
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has rocked the state Capitol with a host of proposals that would affect state employees, including requiring them to pay more toward their pensions and health care.

Those two moves, part of a budget repair bill introduced Feb. 14, 2011, would raise nearly $30 million. The Republican-controlled Legislature has the measure on the fastest of tracks, and could approve it in under a week.

Raising $30 million would be a big step toward meeting a $137 million budget shortfall before the 2010-2011 budget year ends June 30, 2011 -- and help reduce a larger gap in the next two-year budget.

In pitching his proposal for the higher pension and health care payments at a Feb. 11, 2011, news conference, Walker presented a stark picture of the options he has:

""The alternative in this budget alone, in fiscal year 2011, is to look at 1,500 layoffs of state employees or close to 200,000 children who would be bumped off Medicaid-related programs.""

As governor, Walker certainly has the power to lay off state workers.

But can he remove children from Medicaid, the state-federal program that pays medical bills for low-income individuals and families?

To back up the statement, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie provided a Feb. 8 memo from the state Department of Health Services. It says spending $30 million over three months provides BadgerCare, a Medicaid program, to 194,539 Wisconsin children.  

That supports the numbers. But the memo says nothing about whether the state has the authority to cut kids from the Medicaid program.

We asked Walker directly whether the state has such power.

""Well, that’s what the equivalent would be,"" the governor replied. ""That’s just one option. The more immediate one -- if I had to, I don’t want to do any of them -- would be the 1,500 layoffs. But that’s what the equivalent cost is.""

OK, we understand that removing nearly 200,000 kids from Medicaid would save $30 million over three months, but could the state do that?

""Again, we just picked out numbers in terms of equivalent dollar amounts,"" Walker said. ""I literally did not even go through the mechanics of that because I’m planning on doing what’s in this bill, not the alternatives.""  

We looked at the mechanics by consulting several experts: 
They all agreed: The federal health care reform law that took effect in March 2010 prohibits states, until at least 2019, from changing their Medicaid eligibility requirements for children.

In other words, states can’t take Medicaid away from kids who are receiving it.

In fact, if a state did cut kids, it would forgo all federal Medicaid funding, according to a Center for Children and Families memo. That would be significant, as Wisconsin  spent $6.7 billion last year in federal and state money on Medicaid for children and adults.

""I think when you’re discussing how to balance your (budget) choices that you ought to make comparisons of actual options,"" Peacock said.

Let’s review.

Walker said that if his proposal for state employees to pay more for their benefits is not adopted, alternatives such as removing nearly 200,000 children from Medicaid would have to be considered. But that’s a phony alternative. Legally, the state does not have the option to remove kids from Medicaid; Walker acknowledged he did not check before making the statement.

We rate Walker’s statement on Medicaid and kids False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771F500>],/factchecks/2011/feb/15/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-alternative-state-/

Glenn Beck says Muslim Brotherhood wants to declare war on Israel
","One of the thorniest questions to emerge from the tumult in Egypt has been what to make of the Muslim Brotherhood. Western observers have characterized the enigmatic group -- also called Al-Ikhwān -- as everything from democratic reformers to Islamic Socialists bent on global dominion.   On his Fox News Channel program for Feb. 4, 2011, Glenn Beck wrapped up five days of frightening Egypt forecasts with this blunt assessment:

""We told you this week how if (President Hosni) Mubarak does step down, however, the Muslim Brotherhood would be the most likely group to seize power. They've openly stated they want to declare war on Israel and they would end the peace agreement with Israel and they would work towards instituting something we told you about, a caliphate.""

That’s a lot to unpack. We decided to check Beck’s claim that the Brotherhood has ""openly stated they want to declare war on Israel,"" because so much of the debate in the United States revolves around the Muslim Brotherhood's intentions toward the main U.S. ally in the region.

Beck neglected to name a source in that Feb. 4 broadcast, so we took a look through the rest of his transcripts for the week. Sure enough, three days earlier he informed viewers that ""a top official in the Muslim Brotherhood has just said that … ‘The people should be prepared for war against Israel.’""

Who was that top official? Beck’s website pointed to a Feb. 1, 2011, item in the Jerusalem Post that had a ""leading member"" of the Brotherhood, Muhammad Ghannem, declaring that ""the people should be prepared for war against Israel."" The next day a Washington Times editorial picked up the quote, saying it ""succinctly summed up"" the Muslim Brotherhood's foreign policy. Then Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., repeated the fiery words in a floor speech.

The Jerusalem Post piece cited an interview Ghannem gave to an Arabic-language Iranian network, Al-Alam. With deft use of Google Translate we were able to verify that Ghannem was quoted saying something along those lines in a Jan. 31, 2011, piece on Al-Alam’s website. The key question then becomes whether Ghannem can speak for the sprawling Muslim Brotherhood.

""I have never heard of him,"" said Dr. Jason Brownlee, an associate professor in the Department of Government at the University of Texas and a scholar with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. ""It’s a big organization, and there may be people who say things like that, but that doesn’t mean it’s policy. It doesn’t jibe with my experience visiting Egypt and doing research on the Muslim Brotherhood for over a decade.""

Three other experts on the Muslim Brotherhood all agreed. ""The MB is a massive organization with many different ideological trends within it,"" explained Dr. Joshua Stacher, a political scientist at Kent State. ""I have never heard anyone on or off the record say they ‘wish to declare war on Israel.’ "" None were familiar with Ghannem, who we confirmed is not among the the Brotherhood’s policy elite, the 16-member Guidance Bureau.

Still, there’s no doubt that the Brotherhood officially condemns Israel, its neighbor across the Sinai Peninsula. According to a report on the group’s own website, a controversy erupted in 2007 when spokesman Essam El-Erian was quoted in London-based paper Al-Hayat saying that the Brotherhood would recognize Israel if it came to power.

In response, then-Supreme Guide Mohamed Mahdy Akef clarified that ""the Brotherhood does not and will never recognize Israel. ... Israel does not exist in the Brotherhood’s dictionary.""

El-Erian maintained that he had been misquoted and was only calling for a referendum on the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. That’s still the official line since the protests in Tahrir Square began.

At a press conference in Cairo on Feb. 9, 2011, El-Erian and Mohammed Musri -- both of whom do sit on the Brotherhood’s Guidance Bureau -- declared that the group respects the treaty and any changes would be up to a democratically elected government.

Brownlee pointed out that many Egyptians believe the 1979 treaty lacks legitimacy; it passed with nearly unanimous approval in what was seen as a fraudulent vote. Opinions vary as to how it would fare today, but, as George Washington University professor Nathan Brown pointed out, revoking a peace treaty is a far cry from declaring war.

In a Feb. 2 interview on NPR’s All Things Considered, El-Erian confirmed that view. He called again for revising the terms of the treaty but, asked what that would mean, dismissed fears of armed conflict.

""Oh, no threat of war,"" El-Erian told Robert Siegel. ""The people are not pushing for war. But it is not our duty to protect Israel from Palestinians. We are not guards for Israel.""

So some members of the Muslim Brotherhood may be calling for war. But the ones who say that don’t speak for the group; and the ones who do speak for the group, don’t say that. We rate Beck’s claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809735DB00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/15/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-muslim-brotherhood-wants-declare-w/

Milwaukee Ald. Milele Coggs says bill would give Wisconsin the most restrictive voter ID law in the nation
","
Republicans in Madison waited a decade for their chance to get a photo ID requirement in place for Wisconsin elections.

Now in power, they have crafted a bill that critics say is so tight it will limit voter access.

Opponents include some members of the Milwaukee Common Council. Ald. Milele Coggs issued a news release Feb. 3, 2011 criticizing the measure as toughest in the country.

""In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation,"" Coggs said in a release commemorating passage of the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed voting rights regardless of race. ""It will disproportionately impact people of color, students and the elderly.""

The arguments surrounding photo IDs are fierce, including claims about how much such a requirement would reduce voting. We’re not ruling on those projections here -- or GOP arguments that the bill is needed to curb fraud.

We are simply testing Coggs’ contention that the bills is the toughest.

Asked about her claim, Coggs pointed to data assembled by the National Conference of State Legislatures on the eight states that currently ask voters for photo ID: Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan and South Dakota.

Another 18 states require an ID, but not necessarily a photo. Oklahoma will make 19 as of July 2011.

For now, Wisconsin is among the remaining that require no ID.

Coggs says the heart of the issue is which IDs are deemed acceptable. We think that makes sense, because the pending legislation is all about proof of identity. As a secondary test, we will touch on how states treat voters who forget to bring an ID to the polls.

As things currently stand in the bill, Wisconsin would accept three sorts of identification: military ID, a driver’s license or a state-issued ID.

That’s a much shorter list than in other photo ID states, based on our interviews with state elections officials and the study by the state legislatures group.

In contrast, Florida takes 12 different forms, including employee badges, buyer’s club cards, retirement center IDs, entertainment cards and public assistance IDs.

Hawaii is open-ended, requiring a signed picture ID but not limiting what is accepted.

A key point in the debate over the measure is whether Wisconsin should accept student IDs. Many students lack Wisconsin driver’s licenses and critics question whether they will be motivated enough to go to a state office to get a state ID before  voting.

All the other photo ID states accept student IDs -- at least from public institutions of higher education. Michigan even takes a high school ID.

Republicans in Wisconsin so far have resisted calls to allow student IDs, saying there is too much potential for fraud and administrative headaches.

Passports are another difference.

The Wisconsin bill would not allow them. All the other photo ID states accept them.

Additionally, tribal IDs are allowed in several states but not in the Wisconsin proposal.

What do others think?

David Canon, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who has studied election administration nationally, said Coggs’ claim was right on target.

Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin’s elections chief, also said the bill as proposed was the most restrictive in the country.

And Michael Pyritz, considered a leading GOP staff expert on voter ID, agreed that Wisconsin’s proposed ID list is narrower than other states.

At least it stands right now.

Pyritz, an aide to Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale), predicted that GOP lawmakers will move to expand the list of IDs -- something Democratic critics and state elections officials have called for.

Lawmaker almost certainly will allow the use of passports, Pyritz said. Similarly, he said, tribal IDs will ""most likely"" will be added in.

Student IDs are under discussion, but Pyritz said the current conventional wisdom was that would not be added to the bill.

The Wisconsin bill is comparable to -- though still more restrictive than -- a proposal moving swiftly through the Texas Legislature. That plan would allow five forms of ID -- including concealed handgun licenses, passports and state-issued IDs.

That covers the IDs themselves. What about those who forget them on election day?

The Wisconsin bill is as restrictive -- if not more so -- than the other photo ID states.

The bill would allow a voter to cast a provisional ballot that will count if they show up at their clerk’s office within 24 hours of the election with proper ID.

Georgia uses provisional balloting but gives the forgetful voters until the Friday after election day. Indiana allows 10 days.

Some states, such as Michigan, allow voters to simply sign an affidavit and vote like any other voter.

Pyritz said lawmakers are considering a change in the bill to give voters more time to make their provisional ballot count.

This item is clear.

As introduced, the Republican photo ID bill takes a tougher line than the other photo ID states. The number and type of IDs allowed is narrower and the deadlines for alternative voting procedure are tighter.  Some of that may change in coming weeks, but Coggs was careful to describe the bill in ""its current state.""

We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973B7C00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/15/milele-coggs/milwaukee-ald-milele-coggs-says-bill-would-give-wi/
"['Georgia', 'Corporations', 'Taxes', 'Herman Cain']","
Obama should cut corporate tax rate, potential GOP foe says
","
The next presidential election is just 21 months away, and one potential candidate from Georgia was recently on national television to make an interesting case against incumbent Barack Obama.

Herman Cain, a conservative businessman, motivational speaker, author and former radio talk show host, said on CNN that the president does not fully understand how to help the private sector prosper. Case in point, Cain said, the high corporate tax rates the federal government levies on businesses.

""We need to lower the top corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent,"" Cain said Friday on CNN’s ""American Morning"" program. ""We are the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate.""

Cain, a Henry County resident who unsuccessfully campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat in 2004, recently started an exploratory presidential committee, the customary first step toward a White House bid. Cain concedes he would be a ""dark-horse"" candidate, but we’re certain he would get his message out if he runs for president.

So we were curious about Cain’s claim on CNN. Is the United States the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate, the percentage that businesses are taxed by the government?

The best information on the subject comes from the Doing Business Project, which was started in 2002 to examine business regulations across the globe. Its partners include the World Bank.

Each year, the project completes a report that looks at the world’s business climate. AJC PolitiFact Georgia read each one of the project’s Paying Taxes reports, which date back to 2007. During that time frame, we found 48 nations that have cut back their corporate tax rates. The reports do not specify whether the cuts were to statutory rates, which is the taxable income of corporations, or effective rates, which measure the taxes a corporation pays as a percentage of its economic profit.

The larger countries that cut their rates included Canada, China, Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. The list included small nations, such as Albania, Colombia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Morocco and New Zealand. The United States was not among those countries.

During the period covered by the reports, Iceland was the only developed country that raised its corporate tax rate, which increased from 15 percent to 18 percent.

The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has a chart of America’s corporate tax rate that dates back to 1909. It shows the top rate was at its highest, 52.8 percent, in 1968 and 1969. It was last cut between 1987 and 1988, when Ronald Reagan was president, from 40 percent to 34 percent. The top rate last rose in 1993, to its current rate of 35 percent. Some research shows corporate tax revenue typically increases when the rates are lowered because more businesses pay the rates.

Cain is not the only conservative to call for a lower corporate tax rate. U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., proposed lowering the top rate from 35 percent to 25 percent during his failed bid for president in 2008. McCain and others complain that the U.S. has among the highest corporate tax rates in the world. PolitiFact rated a claim by U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that America has the world’s highest corporate tax rate as Mostly True.

Obama, by the way, said in last month’s State of the Union address he is open to cutting the top corporate tax rate. The president said in that speech that the U.S. had among the world’s highest corporate tax rates, earning him a True by PolitiFact on the Truth-O-Meter.

Emory University law school professor Dorothy Brown contends this point stressed by Cain and others is a red herring. She and others argue that the federal tax code contains many loopholes for businesses that allow them to pay less in corporate taxes.

""I quarrel whether there is any meaning,"" Brown said. ""The question is so what?""

The big question for us is what time frame was Cain talking about on CNN when he said the U.S. is the only developed country that has notcut its corporate tax rate? The Tax Policy Center chart tells a different story. Efforts to contact Cain via telephone and e-mail were unsuccessful Monday.

It has been a while since the United States cut its corporate tax rate.

But to say the U.S. is the ""only developed country"" that has not cut its corporate tax rate is not completely accurate. At least one other one -- Iceland -- has raised the rates. Arguments can be made, however, that Iceland is an anomaly when its economy is compared to major players like the U.S.

We believe Cain is trying to make a larger point that many developed countries have lowered their corporate taxes. He argues they should be lowered here in order for America to be competitive with the rest of the world.

There is ample evidence that the U.S. is behind the curve on this front, but not everyone is cutting their rates. We find Cain’s statement, and the larger point he is trying to make, is on-point. But he omits important details in the quest to make that point.

We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097336CC0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/15/herman-cain/obama-should-cut-corporate-tax-rate-potential-gop-/

Gov. Rick Perry says Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state
","
During his State of the State address, Gov. Rick Perry countered those ""painting a pretty grim picture"" of Texas finances ""with the good news that continues to flow from our comparatively strong economy."" 
""Have the doomsayers forgotten that Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state?"" he said in the Feb. 8 speech.  
We’ve checked other claims about Texas’ job growth, including Perry’s statement in June that Texas had added more jobs than the other states combined. We rated that True; from January 2001 to June 2010, Texas had a net gain of 853,400 jobs.  
Earlier, we rated another statement False: In January, Perry claimed that approximately 70 percent of jobs created in the United States in November 2007-08 were in Texas, based on data from the Texas Workforce Commission, where number-crunchers said they added the total jobs created in the 13 job-gaining states during the one-year period. But the calculation behind his statement discounted jobs created in states that had an overall job loss.  
We wondered if Perry accurately recapped how many jobs Texas gained in 2010.  
Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a Jan. 25 federal report detailing states’ employment and unemployment during the last year. According to the report, ""the largest statistically significant"" net job gain was in Texas,"" with 230,800 jobs, ahead of Pennsylvania (65,600) and Illinois (46,300). The report says the ""only statistically significant decrease in employment occurred in New Jersey,"" which had a net job loss of 30,700 jobs. 
It’s worth noting that even states that had a net-job losses likely saw some new jobs — though not enough to offset the jobs they lost.  
But Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, agreed that based on preliminary December data, Perry accurately recapped how many jobs Texas added last year: ""We did have the largest over-the-year employment,"" she said, later adding that ""Texas would have certainly beaten any state with a loss."" She likewise pointed us to the January bureau report noted by Frazier. 
According to preliminary December 2010 data in the report, Texas had the largest employment increase that month, adding about 20,000 jobs, followed by South Carolina, which added some 9,000 jobs. 
Abbot also told us that among the states, Texas had a 2.3 percent increase in jobs in 2010. New Hampshire came in second with a 2.1 percent job increase. 
Finally, we wondered how well the new jobs pay. Abbot told us that while the bureau tracks average hourly earnings for most industry sectors, ""the data will only give you averages across all workers in the industry, nothing about ‘new’ versus ‘old’ jobs."" 
Regardless of how the new jobs paid, Texas added more of them —  based on net job gains — in 2010 than any other state. We rate Perry’s statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280966D9080>],/factchecks/2011/feb/15/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-texas-added-more-jobs-2010-any/

State Rep. Matt Lundy says state records laws already shield business records
","
New Gov. John Kasich has made it clear his top priority while in office is to bring jobs to Ohio and turn the economy around.

JobsOhio, a publicly funded, private nonprofit corporation, is Kasich’s big idea to attract businesses here and create jobs. The nonprofit corporation will act as a privatized version of the Department of Development’s economic development efforts. Yet the transition of this public agency, which Kasich has described as sluggish and ineffective, to the private sector has raised concerns about transparency and accountability.

Kasich, a Republican, wants JobsOhio to be exempt from Ohio’s public records and open meetings laws. The corporation would be audited annually to show the public its spending. But Democrats have loudly criticized the exemptions, saying they would keep the corporation’s operations under wraps and out of the public view, inviting scandal and a misuse of taxpayers’ dollars. Kasich and other Republicans say the exemptions are needed to help JobsOhio ""move at the speed of business."" Public disclosure could disrupt business negotiations, they argue.

State Rep. Matt Lundy, a Democrat from Elyria, is not convinced JobsOhio needs to be shielded from public records laws, and he has introduced legislation to subject the corporation to those rules.

""There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential,"" Lundy said in a Feb. 7 news release announcing his legislation, which he called the Taxpayer’s Right to Know Act.

Republicans control the Ohio House of Representatives, so Lundy’s bill is unlikely to get much attention. But since his effort highlights ongoing concerns about JobsOhio, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Lundy’s claim and examine how Ohio’s public records laws treat the state’s interactions with outside businesses.

Ohio’s public records law, section 149.43 of Ohio Revised Code, establishes the public availability of records kept by public offices, whether its a city hall or local school district or the governor. The law also includes numerous exceptions, which range from a police officer’s home address to adoption records.

These exceptions also apply to certain business records.

Sensitive business records often fall within the ""trade secrets"" exception to Ohio’s public records law, said David Marburger, an attorney for Baker Hostetler in Cleveland and counsel for the Ohio Coalition for Open Government. Marburger, who often represents The Plain Dealer on issues of public access to government, called the trade secrets exception ""extremely broad.""

Ohio Revised Code section 1333.61 defines a trade secret as any information, including business information, financial information, technical information, formulas, names addresses and telephone numbers, of actual or potential economic value.

Marburger said the trade secret exception is a nearly impenetrable shield when a government entity and a business share sensitive or confidential information.

Kent State University School of Journalism and Mass Communication professor Tim Smith agreed. He also cited the trade secrets exception when asked about Lundy’s statement. ""From my knowledge about the open records law, Lundy’s statement is accurate,"" said Smith, a former managing editor for the Akron Beacon Journal.

Kasich’s administration and Republicans in the House of Representatives, which already has approved the JobsOhio plan, have offered a cross-section of scenarios in which public disclosure would impede JobsOhio’s mission. (The Republican-controlled Ohio Senate is still reviewing the plan.) For example, if communication between JobsOhio and a sought-after company was public record, another states could use that information to trump Ohio’s offer.

PolitiFact Ohio is not rating whether JobsOhio should be exempted from public records laws. Regardless of the advantages or disadvantages, Lundy’s statement that Ohio’s public records law includes exceptions that protect sensitive and confidential business information is correct.

Several days later, the New York Times reported the existence of a memo Comey wrote after a meeting in which Trump reportedly asked Comey to drop an investigation into Michael Flynn. Flynn is Trump’s former national security adviser who allegedly has ties to the Russian government and also allegedly took more than $500,000 to advance the Turkish government's interests. Comey’s testimony During the June 2017 hearing, Comey admitted to being behind the leak of that memo last month. He said he authorized it after seeing Trump’s tweets about tapes. However, Comey also testified – while under oath – that the memo in question did not contain any classified information. And he said that was not by accident. ""My thinking was if I write in such a way that I don’t include anything that’ll trigger a classification, that will make it easier to discuss within FBI and government,"" he said. We’re unsure how Hayes could have gotten Comey’s testimony so wrong; the NC GOP did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  For the record, we don’t know exactly what’s in the memo. Neither does Hayes or almost anyone else in the world. That’s because the memo itself hasn’t been made public yet; just a description of it. But we do know Comey never testified that he was behind a leak of classified information, despite Hayes’ claim to the contrary. Legal to leak? Michael Kohn, an attorney who represents whistleblowers, said that as long as Comey is right that the memo didn’t contain classified information, he was well within his rights to release it. Kohn is a partner at the Washington, D.C., firm of Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto and is president of the National Whistleblowers Center. He has represented multiple government leakers, including Linda Tripp, who was fired from her government job after secretly recording and then publicizing tapes of Monica Lewinsky talking about her affair with then-President Bill Clinton. He said he would be shocked if Comey was so careless as to have authorized the leak of a memo with anything classified in it. ""Former director Comey would have the knowledge-base to know that he could leak non-classified information, and it's ludicrous to think he would have leaked classified information,"" Cohn said.  Writing for the Washington Post, University of Texas law professor and national security legal expert Stephen Vladeck had this to say after Comey’s testimony about his memo: ""Federal law proscribes certain unauthorized disclosures, including of ""information relating to the national defense"" or information that has pecuniary value to the United States. But it’s hard to see how Comey’s after-the-fact transcription of his relevant conversations with the president fall within either of these provisions. No one is making an argument that the material in Comey’s memos was classified …"" Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court have both given protections to government employees who leak non-classified information in the general interest of the country. Comey said that’s exactly what he did, since he was disturbed by Trump’s behavior. ""My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square,"" Comey testified. ""I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel."" Other Republicans have launched a less aggressive accusation than Hayes and the NC GOP, suggesting that Comey’s leaks might have violated something called executive privilege. PolitiFact has a separate explainer on that here. But on the topic of legal confidentiality, Cohn said the contents of a conversation with the president don’t automatically become classified just because the conversation was private or potentially damaging. ""In fact, that is what our constitution is aimed at protecting – the right to speak up against the government, for what is right or proper,"" Cohn said. ""Otherwise, we would have a king."" Our ruling Speaking for the North Carolina Republican Party, former U.S. Rep. Robin Hayes said former FBI Director James Comey admitted to leaking classified information. That’s wrong. Comey never admitted to leaking classified information, which would be a crime. In fact, he said he was careful to write the one memo that he did leak so that it would not contain any classified information. The accusation was incorrect and easily debunked. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F11040>],/factchecks/2017/jun/09/north-carolina-republican-party/james-comey-hearings-did-former-fbi-director-admit/
"['Labor', 'Women', 'New York', 'Kathy Hochul']","
New York is closer to pay equity than most states
","Women fare better in New York state than in other states when it comes to pay equity, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul said during a speech in late May. ""We have pay equity,"" said Hochul, who claimed women in New York state earn as much as twelve cents more on the dollar than the national average. ""When you think about that wage gap, we all know it’s 78 cents to the dollar. Well, in New York state it’s 90 cents to the dollar."" While New York state and most other states have laws mandating equal pay for employees, a wage gap between men and women persists. Is Hochul right about how narrow New York state’s gender wage gap is compared to the national average? What the data shows Hochul’s numbers are in the ballpark of what federal data shows. Women in New York state earn 86.9 percent as much as the median pay of men, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Women earn 81.1 percent as much as men overall in the U.S. The bureau tracked full-time, year-round workers in 2015, the most recent numbers. Only three other states and Washington, D.C., have smaller gaps. Women in Hawaii earn 87.9 percent as much as men, the highest level. Research from the National Women’s Law Center places New York state higher. The center compared data from the U.S. Census Bureau on the median salary of full-time, year-round male and female employees in each state from 2015. The census estimates show women in New York state earn 88.7 percent as much as men — more than any other state — compared with 79.6 percent overall in the U.S. ""The data sample sizes are larger using the [Census Bureau] community survey, which is why we and other organizations use it,"" said Maya Raghu, NWLC Director of Workplace Equality. Why New York state differs New York has exceeded the national average in pay equity since at least 1998, the earliest federal data available online. Some years are better than others. New York state was less than one percentage point above the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ national average in 2005, when women earned 81 percent as much as men in the U.S. Other states consistently rank near the bottom for pay equity. Why? Experts say no single reason explains it. Occupational segregation is one reason. The types of jobs women and men hold vary by state, Raghu said. North Dakota, where high-earning men dominate the oil industry, ranks low for pay equity. New York state’s higher minimum wage also makes a difference. The minimum wage in New York was $8.75 in 2015, above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Having a higher pay floor reduces the gender wage gap for lower-income workers, experts say. ""In places like New York that have a higher minimum wage, you’re going to see a smaller wage gap particularly at the lower end of the distribution,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Union membership also has an effect, Gould said. New York state ranks higher in union membership than any other state in the country with a 23.6 percent union membership rate. Wyoming, which has the widest gender wage gap in the country, has a 6.3 percent union membership rate. ""Your unions may be very strong in New York, including teachers unions and unions that support service workers,"" said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution. New York City also drives up the state’s pay equity ranking. Data from the American Association of University Women breaks down the wage gap by congressional district in New York state. Most districts in New York City rank above those upstate. ""I think the rural urban divide is definitely part of the story,"" said Kevin Miller, a senior researcher at AAUW. ""Cities tend to have smaller gaps, which is why we see the District of Columbia having a small gap."" Education is part of that. More women in New York state hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, according to census data. ""The educational advantage is increasingly shifting toward women away from men, and in a technologically advancing economy that’s going to favor toward women and raise their relative earnings,"" Sawhill said. The family choices some women make during their careers also explain the wage gap. Women are more likely to take time off work to care for a newborn child or a sick relative. A woman in that scenario may miss a significant chunk in pay during their leave from work. Without supplemental income during that time away from work, women are more likely to report lower pay than their male colleagues, experts say. Our ruling Hochul said the gender wage gap in New York state is ""90 cents to the dollar."" Hochul is close to what federal data and research groups report as the wage gap in New York state. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says women in New York make close to 87 percent of what men make. Researchers say it is closer to 89 percent. Hochul's numbers are slightly off. The data reveals a gender pay gap, but her point that New York state has a significantly smaller gap compared with the national average is correct. We rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CD9100>],/factchecks/2017/jun/09/kathy-hochul/new-york-closer-pay-equity-most-states/

Villaraigosa gets it wrong on California poverty figures
","When asked to list his top three priorities for California at a recent forum, Democratic candidate for governor Antonio Villaraigosa responded: ""I think we’ve got to start with the economy, the economy, the economy."" The former mayor of Los Angeles acknowledged strong economic growth ""in some places,"" but made it clear that not all of California is ""growing together."" Villaraigosa went on to make an eye-opening claim about how many California cities rank among the poorest in the nation. ""Seventy-seven of the top 300 cities with the highest poverty rate are in our state,"" Villaraigosa said at the forum, hosted on June 6, 2017 in San Francisco by the Public Policy Institute of California.  Villaraigosa makes his claim at about the 6:45 minute mark in this video by the Public Policy Institute of California. We know the state has struggled mightily with poverty. As an example, we rated True a claim by Republican Assembly Leader Chad Mayes in January that California has ""the highest poverty rate in the nation"" when comparing states and considering cost-of-living. At 20.6 percent, California’s poverty rate in 2015 was well above the national average of 15.1 percent, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report called the Supplemental Poverty Measure. Florida’s 19 percent poverty rate ranked second. For a two-adult, two-child family in California, the poverty threshold was an average of $30,000, depending on the region in the state, according to a 2014 analysis by Public Policy Institute of California. With this in mind, we decided to fact-check Villaraigosa’s assertion that California is also home to one-quarter of the nation’s poorest cities. Governor’s race Villaraigosa is among several prominent Democrats competing to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a former professional football player. PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in this race. See our ""Tracking The Truth"" governor’s race fact-checks here.  Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at [email protected], tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Our research Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman said his poverty claim draws on a 2015 report by the National Resource Network called Hidden in Plain Sight: Why California's Economically Challenged Cities Matter. The network was created by the Obama Administration to develop ""innovative solutions to American cities to help them address their toughest economic challenges."" Its study listed 77 ""economically challenged"" cities in California, ranging from big metros such as Los Angeles, Sacramento and Oakland to small ones like Lodi, Delano and Watsonville. It defines economically challenged as having at least one of the following characteristics:        -- More than 9 percent of residents remained unemployed as of 2013        -- More than 20 percent of adults are living in poverty        -- Population decline between 2000 and 2010 reached 5 percent Nationwide, it found nearly 300 such cities. California’s count equals about one-quarter of those. We wondered, however, whether cities listed as economically challenged (due at least partly to a 2013 jobless rate) could also be considered as currently having the ""highest poverty rate,"" as Villaraigosa described them this week. Had Villaraigosa stretched the truth or perhaps conflated two separate descriptions of economic hardship? Staff at the National Resource Network, including the study’s lead author, did not immediately return requests for comment. Experts weigh in Ann Stevens director of the Center for Poverty Research and a professor of economics at the University of California at Davis, reviewed the study and Villaraigosa’s claim at our request His statement is ""not accurate in terms of the poverty rate,"" Stevens told us. That’s because the study labeled many of these cities as economically challenged because of their 2013 jobless rate, ""which is different than the poverty rate in 2013 or the poverty rate on average today."" We found nearly half of the 77 cities described as economically challenged qualified for that label not because their poverty rate was above 20 percent, but because of their high jobless rate in 2013. In fact, the poverty level for at least some of these cities was closer to or below the national average. At that time, many cities in California were still struggling with high unemployment due to the Great Recession, Stevens added. But that’s a temporary measure of economic hardship, not a permanent one. Caroline Danielson, who researches poverty at the Public Policy Institute of California, said many of those cities are no longer struggling with unemployment. Los Angeles, for example, now has a jobless rate of 3.9 percent down from 9.7 percent in 2013, she said. Danielson said there’s no comparable ranking of every American city, large and small, by poverty rate. If there was, she said: ""I don’t believe that California would be quite so overrepresented as we found in this report. That’s not to say that California has no high poverty cities."" Along with pointing to the study, Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman said the candidate would still consider the 77 cities in the study ""to be among those nationally with the highest poverty rate - certainly well above the average - and that is what makes them economically challenged."" That’s not the same as Villaraigosa’s original statement that all 77 rank nationally among cities with ""the highest poverty rate."" Our ruling Candidate for California governor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed: ""Seventy-seven of the top 300 cities with the highest poverty rate are in our state."" He relied on a study that grouped  77 ""economically challenged"" cities in California among nearly 300 such cities in the nation. But it used data from four years ago, when many cities were still recovering from the Great Recession. Villaraigosa made it sound as if these cities are still experiencing the same level of hardship. Also, experts on poverty said the economically challenged label isn’t the same as Villaraigosa’s description of these cities as among the poorest in the nation. Nearly half the cities on the study’s list qualified for that label not because of their poverty level. Many, in fact, had poverty rates below the state average. Instead, they qualified because they had a high unemployment rate in 2013. The jobless rate in many of those cities has improved considerably since then. Villaraigosa touched on a real problem in California: Poverty remains widespread and entrenched. But he mischaracterized the results of a study and painted a darker picture of economic hardship in California than the facts bear out. We rate Villaraigosa’s claim False.

Warmest year on record a hoax because of margin of error? That’s wrong
","Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld says people who cite statistics about the hottest year ever or high temperatures are spreading ""B.S."" He says people who make such claims are not telling the full story about temperature statistics. ""If you asked them what the increase was, they wouldn't be able to tell you that every single year that there's an increase, it is within the margin of error, meaning it isn’t increasing,"" Gutfeld said June 2 on the show he co-hosts, The Five. ""So, those are called real truths,"" he continued. ""The poetic truth is the chaos and the hysteria, because that plays to the media. And it makes you feel so important. And you get to punish America for being so successful by doing these stupid deals. But if you read the facts about the high temperatures, about the reality of our past, it is all B.S."" Gutfeld made the statement on The Five as the panel discussed President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. We interviewed several scientists who said Gutfeld’s statement -- that temperature increases are within the margin of error and therefore not increasing --  is wrong. Rather than point to ""single year"" increases, experts said that long-term trends clearly show the temperature has been rising for decades. Robert Jackson, chair of the department of Earth System Science at Stanford, said Gutfeld’s statement, scientifically speaking, ""is rubbish."" There are two main sources of data cited to look at temperature trends: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the NASA Goddard institute for Space Studies. Both show a trend of rising temperatures. Rising temperatures should be measured over many years A Fox News spokeswoman sent us articles stating that 2016 data on rising temperatures was deceptive because of ""uncertainty in the statistics"" or because news reports hid information on the margin of error. Gutfeld focused on ""single year"" increases. Such comparisons don’t tell the full story about rising temperature, because there is natural variability year over year. It is more useful to look at long-term trends such as comparing decades, said University of Miami’s Ben Kirtman. The statement by Gutfeld ""indicates a profound misunderstanding of climate science and statistics,"" Kirtman said. ""Year over year you can’t be sure that one year is a statistically separate warming from the previous year, so you have to take a little bit longer view to remove some of the natural fluctuation,"" he said. But by looking at climate data over decades, it shows a clear rise in temperatures. NASA tracks the annual temperature anomaly which means a change, up or down, from a long-term average. NASA’s latest annual data released in January 2017 shows that temperatures have been rising upward since the 1960s:    In January 2017, NASA reported that the Earth’s 2016 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern recordkeeping began in 1880, according to independent analyses by NASA and NOAA. Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean -- making 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures, NASA concluded. NASA stated that even taking into account the uncertainties in the interpretation of year-to-year temperature differences, NASA estimated 2016 was the warmest year with greater than 95 percent certainty. NASA attributed the rising temperatures driven largely by ""increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere."" Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. According to NASA, for recent years the margin of error is about ±0.05 degrees Celsius. Uncertainties can arise in the data due to different methods in dealing with missing data and weighting the two hemispheres; however, the uncertainty is quite small, said Kevin Trenberth, a  Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Trenberth said that 2014 was the warmest on record at that point, but perhaps not outside uncertainty. But 2015 broke that record well outside the uncertainty, and then 2016 further broke that record, again well outside any uncertainty.  So 2014-16 are the warmest three years on record, he said. Reto A. Ruedy, an expert at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said Gutfeld’s statement ""lacks any logic."" ""It argues that anything that changes less than the margin of error within some arbitrarily selected time interval (here a year) necessarily does not change,"" he said. ""By the same logic you can argue that babies don’t grow in size, since within a day or even a week they grow less than the margin of error in determining their size."" The long-term trend which shows an overall rise in temperature since 1880, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. ""Gutfeld uses flawed logic to claim that there is no trend. But there is a trend,"" he said.  ""The lesson here?  Always look at the actual data."" Our ruling Gutfeld said, ""every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing."" While some years are within the margin, others definitely aren't, so Gutfeld is wrong when he says ""every single"" year is within the margin of error. Also, long-term trends over decades show that temperatures are clearly rising. So Gutfeld is wrong both on the details and and the big picture. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BA5980>],/factchecks/2017/jun/09/greg-gutfeld/fox-news-show-co-host-greg-gutfeld-denies-temperat/

Hillary Clinton's Mostly False claim on photo ID, voter suppression in Wisconsin in 2016 election
","While reflecting on the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton was asked why she didn’t campaign more in Wisconsin -- a state that hadn’t gone Republican since 1984, but one  she lost to Donald Trump. Appearing May 31, 2017 at a conference in California sponsored by the Vox Media site Recode, Clinton replied by saying ""we thought we were doing really well in Wisconsin,"" but that ""our information was not as reliable as I wished it had been."" Then the former Democratic nominee pivoted to another issue, contending that Wisconsin’s law requiring photo identification to vote caused voter suppression. ""The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote,"" she said. ""I don’t think we believed at the time, before the election, that it would be anything like that, anything as big as that."" Clinton’s claim is similar to one by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., that we rated Mostly False. (The Washington Post Fact Checker later gave Baldwin three Pinocchios for the claim.) Baldwin’s claim Baldwin flatly stated that turnout in Wisconsin ""was reduced by approximately 200,000 votes because of"" the photo ID requirement. The 2016 contest was the first presidential election in which the law was in effect. Baldwin cited a May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama. When we contacted a spokesman at the Democratic National Committee, asking for information to support Clinton’s claim, he referred us to the same report. Comparing the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report said that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin. Had Wisconsin’s photo ID law not been in effect, the report argues, Wisconsin’s turnout would have been 200,000 votes higher, based on the average increase of 1.3 percent. Experts told us the methodology is lacking. Put simply: The voter ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some individual people from voting. But the report attributes all of the lower turnout to the ID law, when there are many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump, or perhaps a belief that Trump couldn’t win Wisconsin. Clinton’s statement isn’t as bold as Baldwin’s, in that she refers to an estimate. But that doesn’t change the fact that the methodology used to make that estimate, as we detailed in the Baldwin fact check, has been widely criticized. A final note from Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump earned almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as did Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. ""Clinton, in contrast, earned 238,000 fewer voters than did Obama,"" he said. ""It would be a mistake to attribute essentially all of that decline to the voter ID requirement."" Our rating Clinton said: ""The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote"" in the 2016 presidential election. A report three weeks earlier from a group that supports Democratic candidates says a decline in voter turnout between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections in Wisconsin was entirely due to the state’s new photo identification requirement for voting.

But experts say that while photo ID requirements may reduce turnout to some extent, they question the methodology of the report and say there is no way to put a number on how many people in Wisconsin didn’t vote because of the ID requirement. We rate Clinton’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097748540>],/factchecks/2017/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-mostly-false-claim-photo-id-voter/

Republican Wisconsin lawmaker wrongly states that it's fact that the Earth is 6,000 years old
","During a May 11, 2017 hearing on his bill to create tougher penalties for college students who disrupt public speakers, Wisconsin state Rep. Jesse Kremer, R-Kewaskum, had this exchange with state Rep. Terese Berceau, D-Madison: Berceau: So, my question is, if a geology student says, ""I’m sorry, but the Earth is only 6,000 years old"" -- rejecting science that says that the Earth is considerably older than that -- is it not OK for a professor to tell that student that they’re wrong? Kremer: So, this bill stays out of the classroom. Yes, the Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact. But, we can discuss that outside of this room. (He chuckles.) Berceau: You said that it is a fact, you do believe it’s a fact? Kremer: Yeah, I do. While the idea that the Earth is 6,000 years old is an article of faith for some, in this context Kremer presented it as a knowable fact. Let’s take a look. Kremer and his bills Kremer, who represents a rural area northwest of Milwaukee, is known for proposing legislation that is, in his words, ""red meat for conservatives"". For example, to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; place gender restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms; and allow concealed carry permit-holders to carry guns on public school grounds and college campuses. Kremer introduced the speech bill six days before the hearing, which was held by a state Assembly committee. It would require the state’s Board of Regents to adopt a policy for Wisconsin’s public colleges that includes ""a range of disciplinary sanctions for anyone under an institution's jurisdiction who engages in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, obscene, unreasonably loud, or other disorderly conduct that interferes with the free expression of others."" A student violator could face a one-semester suspension or expulsion for a second offense. The bill, which is expected to be taken up by the Assembly in June 2017, comes as free speech issues have grown more contentious on college campuses across the country, fostering concerns among Republicans that conservative speakers aren’t treated equally. The Capital Times reported on Kremer’s 6,000 statement from the hearing on June 7, 2017, triggering national news stories. Coincidentally, the same day, scientists reported on the discovery of fossils in Morocco that date back roughly 300,000 years, indicating that mankind evolved earlier than had been known. The scientific consensus is that the Earth itself is much older than that. The Earth’s age The topic never seems to get old. 2014: Facebook posts about two Republican U.S. senators and former presidential candidates claimed in part that Marco Rubio of Florida believes the Earth is 9,000 years old and that Rand Paul of Kentucky believes it is 10,000 years old. Neither had made such statements, and PolitiFact National’s rating on the posts was Pants on Fire. 2015: A talk that then-GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson gave four years earlier made news. He had said in 2011: ""I am not a hard-and-fast person who says the Earth is only 6,000 years old,"" but, ""I do believe in the six-day creation."" 2017: The Washington Post’s Dear Science column answered the question: How do we know how old the Earth is? The answer: ""Scientists now know the Earth is actually 4.54 billion years old, an age built on many lines of evidence from the geologic record."" Smithsonian.com and the scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (based on very old rocks, of course) also say around 4.5 billion. But Kremer is far from alone in his belief. The 6,000 figure Many attribute the 6,000 figure to James Ussher (1581–1656), an Irish archbishop who concluded that Adam was created in 4004 B.C. He made his calculation, in part, by counting the number of generations in the Bible. An Institute for Creation Research article says, however, that the work in which Ussher made the estimate contains 12,000 footnotes from secular sources, as well as 2,000 references from the Bible, indicating, the article says, that most of his evidence was non-biblical. And the magazine Wired once observed: Ussher was far from the first person to wildly miscalculate the universe’s age ….Among others to try their hand were Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, both of whom arrived at estimates younger than Ussher’s.  All labored without a number of modern tools — not only for measuring radioactive decay or rates of the universal expansion, but an intellectual framework for conceiving of time on scales beyond the biblical.

That wouldn’t exist for another century, when a Scottish farmer and geological enthusiast named James Hutton, looking at riverbank stone formations, saw a record of sedimentary deposition that couldn’t be contained in 6,000 years. Or many times that. That was a radical idea, and it took another century to be widely accepted, even in the scientific community. Kremer told us his statement is based on his ""deeply held religious beliefs, and thus First Amendment freedom of religion and expression, can be found here based on sound biblical and historical evidence."" He pointed us to an AnswersInGenesis.org article that also cites Ussher and concludes in part: Cultures around the world give an age of the Earth that confirms what the Bible teaches. Radiometric dates, on the other hand, have been shown to be wildly in error. The age of the Earth ultimately comes down to a matter of trust — it’s a worldview issue. But geology and environmental science professor Nelson Ham at St. Norbert University, a Catholic college in De Pere, Wis., told us: ""Kremer's statement is certainly not a scientific fact,"" noting the many estimates of around 4.5 billion years. ""Determining that age has come from measurements that are testable and repeatable, following the scientific method."" Our rating Kremer says: ""The Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact."" Kremer states a biblical belief, but goes too far in describing it as a fact. It’s a matter of settled science that the Earth is much older, with the current consensus being that it is about 4.5 billion years of age. We rate the statement False.

","It’s clear that Sarah Palin hates the Paris climate agreement. What’s unclear is why she used a photo of Florida lawmakers to make her point in a Facebook meme. ""Don’t be fooled! The Paris climate accord is a scam,"" stated the headline at the top of Palin’s Facebook post June 6, 2017. (By June 7, the Facebook meme was no longer available but PolitiFact had taken a screenshot of her post, which had been shared at least 8,000 times.) Beneath the headline is a photo of an unidentified group of mostly men cheering. The Facebook post doesn’t identify the people in the photo, but they are Florida House members at the state Capitol in Tallahassee. Beneath the photo Palin shared is text that says: ""They pretend it’s about fixing our environment ... But it’s really about stealing billions from the American people and giving it to foreign countries, governments and lobbyists!""    The Facebook meme, posted after President Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement, could leave the impression that the people in the photo are rejoicing over using the agreement to steal billions from Americans. That's not the case. PolitiFact fact-checked Palin’s photo as part of our effort to debunk fake news on Facebook. Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, were unsuccessful. (Palin’s post was previously debunked by other news outlets including the Miami Herald, a partner along with the Tampa Bay Times in PolitiFact Florida, and Politico.) The photo is actually from the 2011 Florida legislative session. We interviewed four of the Republican politicians in the photo: state Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, and former House members Will Weatherford, a former speaker from Wesley Chapel; Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary, and Rachel Burgin of Riverview. We also interviewed a Democrat in the photo: Jeff Clemens, now a state senator of Lake Worth. Not all of the legislators recalled the particulars of the photo, but all of them said that their cheers had nothing to do with the Paris climate accord -- which was signed years later -- or about climate change. Plakon directed us to search the Florida House website to show the real reason behind the cheering. The website showed that the photo was taken by House photographer Mark Foley. The cutline states: ""From the left, Speaker-designate Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, signaled that session was coming to a close as members celebrate on the House floor, May 7, 2011.""    Plakon recalled some late night (which led to early morning) back-and-forth maneuvering between the House and the Senate in the final hours of that session. ""It was a famous night,"" Plakon said. The final hours of the 2011 legislative session on Saturday, May 7, were chaotic, according to a Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times timeline. As the hours stretched on, lawmakers played songs such as ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help"" by the Beatles and ""The Final Countdown"" on the public speaker. At 11:30 p.m. after the House unanimously rejected a Senate bill related to rules for the state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the chamber erupted into cheers and shouts of, ""It’s us versus the Senate."" At 1 a.m., senators went home. At 2 a.m., the House passed a bill that included tax cuts and adjourned as Handel's Hallelujah chorus played on the public address system. Minutes later the senators had to return -- looking tired. One member came in wearing no shoes, another with no socks and a third in jeans and a T-shirt. The session finally ended at 3:35 a.m. We were unable to confirm by deadline with House officials exactly what time Foley’s photo was taken during the conclusion of the session. But some of the members recalled the image from the conclusion of the session. ""We were all clapping because it was finally finished,"" Burgin said. She described the situation as ""humorous"" but said it was a bad choice for Palin to use a 2011 photo of the Florida House for a post about the 2015 climate accord. ""It's kind of bad taste to label Florida legislators as being involved in that, especially in 2011,"" she said. ""Everybody and their brother has been tagging me since it published, it’s kind of funny."" Many of the legislators got a chuckle about the use of the photo in Palin’s meme. Plakon, a publisher of a website used by insurance claims professionals, quipped, ""As a publisher I object to the use of low-resolution graphics."" For the record, Burgin said she has no opinion on the climate accord. Weatherford declined to express his opinion. Plakon called the accord a ""bad deal"" and sided with Trump’s position. Dorworth, who lost an election in 2012, said he didn’t support the Paris accord. ""Most of the persons in that picture probably would not have supported the Paris climate accord either,"" he said. Clemens, the Democrat, was the only lawmaker we interviewed who told us he supports the climate accord. ""Of course I support the world coming together to solve serious problems. Who wouldn’t?"" Palin posted a viral image that purportedly shows a group of people clapping as a result of the Paris agreement, presumably about the billions they will earn. Except, it’s not that at all. The photo is of Florida lawmakers elated at the long-awaited close of the 2011 legislative session. The text and photo pairing is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809773CA40>],/factchecks/2017/jun/07/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-facebook-meme-climate-accord-uses-unre/

Story that Donald Trump will split Marines from Navy is unfounded
","The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps have a long and intertwined history. While the Marines are considered a separate branch of the military, and while the Commandant of the Marine Corps is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Marine commandant formally answers to the Secretary of the Navy, and the corps has been considered part of the Department of the Navy since 1834. The United States Naval Academy commissions officers for both. So it would be a pretty big deal if President Donald Trump acted to officially separate the two military branches from each other. That’s what a widely shared item on the website Vet TV said. Is it true? The short answer: No. Facebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to fight fake news in users’ social media feeds. An article on the website is headlined, ""Trump Removing Marines From the Navy."" The article claims, ""President Trump will sign executive order 13801 this November 10th on the 242nd birthday of the Marine Corps, freeing the Marines from the Department of The Navy. The Marines will now fall under the newly created Department of Expeditionary Warfare."" Setting aside the tiny likelihood that the administration knows in detail what executive orders Trump will be signing on a specific date six months down the road, there is no evidence to support the notion that he will be splitting the two branches. ""We have not heard anything about that. Semper Fidelis,"" said Marine Capt. Ryan Elizabeth Alvis, a public-affairs official at the Marine Corps headquarters. The Navy referred PolitiFact to the office of the Secretary of Defense, which referred us to the White House. The White House declined to comment on the record. As it happens, there may be an explanation for why the article ran. Vet TV bills itself as an entertainment and humor site for veterans -- though it would be hard to know that from the web page in question. All the way down at the bottom of the article, past the lengthy reader comment section, is this description of Vet TV: ""The first television network created by and for post 9/11 veterans without civilian influence. Hollywood wouldn't make this for us, so we did it ourselves. Get ready to laugh at everything the DoD leadership doesn't want you to laugh at. This network is sure to offend p------, liberals, and probably our parents."" Vet TV was founded by Donny O’Malley, a humorist and YouTube celebrity. According to his bio, O’Malley was a Marine infantry officer for almost six years, serving in Asia and Afghanistan and reaching the rank of captain. Vet TV was launched as a Kickstarter campaign, setting a goal of $250,000 and securing a total of $296,331 from 3,609 donors. The idea is to create a app and a website for irreverent videos that can be streamed across all devices. ""Imagine the ‘Netflix of the military,’ but with all original content,"" as O’Malley describes it. The project is set to launch later this month and dubs itself ""the Comedy Central of the military."" However, the article about the Navy-Marines split does not include a prominent ""satire"" label, and much of the text of the article itself rather mundane. As a result, it would be easy for social media users to think that word of the inter-branch split was legitimate news. With the Navy-Marines article, ""the first part of the piece isn’t very humorous at all,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Only deeper in the article does the satire become more obvious, he said, such as this passage: "" ‘The Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that can’t get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia,’ Sgt. Major Garrett explained."" Janda said that the article does draw on a deep well of competition, and even tension, between the two branches. ""The U.S. Marines were modeled on the Royal Marines in the same way that the early U.S. Navy modeled itself on the Royal Navy,"" he said. ""Marines served on every ship, just like today. They fought as sharp-shooters or with bayonets in ship-to-ship encounters, made up landing parties, guarded the captain, and enforced discipline when needed. In mutinous situations they almost always stayed loyal to the captain, and for that reason, and because they enforced ship discipline such as executions and floggings, they were usually hated by sailors. Some of that mutual enmity, driven by rivalry and respect, endures today."" O’Malley did not reply to an inquiry sent through his website. We rate the Vet TV statement that Trump is removing the Marines from the Navy as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1883C0>],/factchecks/2017/jun/07/vet-tv/idea-donald-trump-will-split-marines-navy-unfounde/

Property taxes lower on a typical Wisconsin home under Scott Walker, though taxes collected not less
","For a while there, Gov. Scott Walker was coy about whether he would run for a third four-year term in 2018. But now his intentions are all but official, and he is repeatedly sounding themes that could show up as part of his campaign platform. On May 18, 2017, Walker was interviewed by Jeff Wagner, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. Wagner opened by asking about one of the governor’s favorite topics: property tax reform. Walker responded by declaring that property taxes on a median-value home ""are lower right now than they were"" in December 2010, the month before he took office.    He’s correct, though there’s a caveat. Prior fact checks There’s no question property taxes, though they might increase for some individual property owners and decrease for others, have generally been on the decline since Walker took office and his fellow Republicans took control of the Legislature in 2011. In 2015, we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that because of his actions, property taxes were lower than they were four years earlier. Walker’s actions to limit the ability of local governments and school districts to raise levies played a major role. But the lower property taxes to that point were also due in part to declines in housing values.   In January 2017, when Walker said that property taxes -- as a percentage of personal income -- were ""the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II,"" our rating was True. An analysis by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance showed that on the measure Walker cited, they were lowest since 1946. And on our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks Walker’s campaign promises, we’ve rated In the Works his pledge to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010. Current claim Walker’s new claim refers to a specific measure -- an estimate of the hypothetical property tax on a median-valued, or typical, Wisconsin home. The estimates are done by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. That tax was $2,963 for 2010-’11, just before Walker took office; and it’s $2,832 for 2017-’18. 2010-’11 2011-’12 2012-’13 2013’-14 2014-’15 2015-’16 2016-’17 2017-’18 2018-’19 $2,963 $2,953 $2,943 $2,926 $2,831 $2,849 $2,852 $2,832 $2,831 A caveat Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, told us it’s important to note that levies -- the total property taxes collected -- have risen in each year but one during Walker’s tenure, even though the the tax on a median-valued home is lower than before he took office. The reason is that compared to commercial and manufacturing properties, residential values have lagged. As a result, more of the property tax burden has shifted to commercial and manufacturing and away from residential, Berry said. Our rating Walker says ""property taxes are lower right now than they were"" in December 2010 on a median-valued home in Wisconsin. Estimates done regularly by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau show that the hypothetical property tax bill on a typical Wisconsin home is $2,832 for 2017-’18 -- $131 lower than the year before Walker took office. But it’s worth noting that the total amount of property taxes collected have risen in each year but one during Walker’s tenure. And that the drop in residential property taxes is due to commercial and manufacturing properties rising at a faster rate -- not due to collecting less taxes. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C19F500>],/factchecks/2017/jun/07/scott-walker/property-taxes-lower-typical-wisconsin-home-under-/

Ossoff’s Mostly True claim that Handel said she led efforts to defund breast cancer screenings
","The Democratic contender for Georgia’s open congressional seat, Jon Ossoff, accused his Republican opponent of spearheading a controversial decision to cut off funding for breast cancer screenings. Ossoff charged that Karen Handel, while working as a top official at Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation, worked to pull funding for screenings performed by Planned Parenthood. ""In 2012, you were discussing how you led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood,"" Ossoff said in a June 6 debate with Handel, adding that she had ""imposed her own views"" while at Komen. Ossoff, a former congressional aide, is running against Handel in the June 20 special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District in northern Atlanta, a historically Republican district. During the debate, Handel pushed back by saying she had been instructed to develop options for disengaging from Planned Parenthood. She downplayed her personal role in the controversial decision, adding that no single employee would have been authorized to unilaterally pull funding. The Komen foundation reversed the move after public criticism. ""I was directed to come up with options for how the organization could disengage,"" she said. ""It was a business decision ultimately decided by the board of Komen."" We decided to take a closer look at Ossoff’s claim that Handel said she had led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings. Handel did a media interview shortly after her February 2012 resignation as the Komen foundation’s vice president of public policy. Her departure came after the group’s decision to pull Planned Parenthood’s breast cancer screening funding caused a firestorm. First, Handel downplayed her personal role -- similarly to the way she pushed back in her debate with Ossoff. ""I was part of (the) decision-making process,"" Handel told the reporter, ""but I was not the sole decider.""   But then Handel pivoted to her feelings about the role she played, saying, ""I embrace the fact that I was involved in the project."" Finally, she said: ""I embrace the fact that I led the project."" Ossoff said, ""In 2012, you were discussing how you led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood."" Handel did say that she led efforts, but she also said at the time that the decision wasn’t entirely hers, and that Komen’s board ultimately approved the move, which was later reversed. We rate Ossoff’s statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097708500>],/factchecks/2017/jun/07/jon-ossoff/jon-ossoffs-mostly-true-claim-karen-handel-led-eff/

Fact-check: Handel claims Obama flew $2 billion to Iran, admitted it is being used to fund terrorism
","All politics might be local but foreign policy dominated the open of the televised debate in the Georgia congressional race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel. Asked about Iran and the Barack Obama-era deal that was designed to put the brakes on its nuclear program, Handel said, ""Nearly $2 billion in cash was flown over to Iran, money that the Obama administration has admitted is being used for terrorists and to support further activities there."" We decided to fact-check Handel’s claim. The Iran deal focused on reducing Iran’s stockpiles of nuclear-grade material, but a key provision unlocked Iranian assets that had been frozen for decades. How much money was there is a matter of debate. The U.S. Treasury Department estimated the value of Iran’s foreign currency reserves at $100 billion. An article in Foreign Policy magazine cited $120 billion. The Institute of International Finance, a trade association representing banks, insurance companies and other financial entities worldwide, ran its own numbers and settled on $100 billion. Handel’s staff pointed to a March 17, 2016, letter from the U.S. State Department saying Iran had received about $1.7 billion as part of the nuclear agreement. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but then the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered. In August 2016, many news organizations reported the delivery of $400 million of that $1.7 billion in cash. As part of that exchange, an unmarked cargo plane delivered the money after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran. Given the isolation of Iran’s banking system, it is possible that the payment was made in cash and flown to Iran, but neither we nor Handel’s staff could point to any report that said that definitely took place. The idea that the Obama administration admitted that the money is being spent on terrorists comes from something then-Secretary of State John Kerry said in an interview. Kerry told CNBC’s Squawk Box in January 2016 that Iran could spend the unfrozen assets however it wanted. ""I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists,"" Kerry said. ""To some degree, I’m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented."" The IRGC, as Iran’s premier security institution, fields an army, navy and air force and ""presides over a vast power structure with influence over almost every aspect of Iranian life,"" according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the IRGC’s elite Quds Force a terrorist supporter for aiding the Taliban and other terrorist organizations. So, Kerry was saying some of the money ultimately would end up with organizations involved in terrorism. That’s not quite the same as saying all of the money would go for terrorists and activities to support terrorism as Handel said. Iran has many needs, including rebuilding aging infrastructure. Kerry did tell reporters the same day, according to the Associated Press, that he understands the IRGC is ""already complaining that they are not getting the money."" Handel said the Obama administration admitted that nearly $2 billion flown to Iran is being used to fund terrorism and various supporting activities. She is more specific than the record supports. One way or another, the United States transferred $1.7 billion owed to Iran. As for what the administration admitted, Kerry said it was likely that some portion of any money Iran received would go to its top security organization and some of that money would end up advancing terrorism. Beyond that general statement, details are lacking.

Thousands more children and families could soon get access to free Pre-K, NC legislator says
","Thousands of North Carolina parents hoping to get their children into free preschool classes might have cause for hope during budget negotiations this month. Last year, nearly 5,000 children were on a waiting list for NC Pre-K, the state-run program that prepares 4-year-olds for school. The N.C. House and Senate have each passed budget proposals, and now they’re negotiating which provisions to keep and which to change or jettison. One of the main budget writers in the House said that if his chamber gets its way on Pre-K funding, that waiting list could go away entirely – giving thousands of needy children an educational head start that their parents might not otherwise be able to afford. ""The waiting list for Pre-K is over in the House budget,"" Rep. David Lewis, a Harnett County Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a tweet. So we started combing through the 356-page budget proposal to find out if he was right. Broad political agreement If Lewis is right – and if the final version of the budget ends up going in this direction – it would be a moment of bipartisan agreement. Expanding NC Pre-K was also one of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s campaign promises. We’re tracking about three dozen promises Cooper made on our Coop-O-Meter and have rated the Pre-K promise as In The Works. The state reported that for the current school year, NC Pre-K enrolled 27,019 children – with another 4,668 on the waiting list. State law caps Pre-K class sizes at 18 students, and there has to be one teacher for every nine students in a classroom. That means cutting down on the waiting list requires finding space for new classrooms, hiring more teachers or both. So how much will it cost to ensure that no eligible children are turned away? Budget proposals from the the state Senate and the governor’s office both estimated that each new seat costs around $5,200, and the program as a whole costs the state about $5,500 per seat. An initial look into Lewis’ claim, on the other hand, appeared to show the House relying on estimates that were only half that much. We sent an inquiry to Ellen Peisner-Feinberg, a Pre-K expert at UNC-Chapel Hill who is also the director of the National Pre-K and Early Learning Evaluation Center. She called that math ""curious."" So we wondered if the House discovered a way for the program to use funding more efficiently, or if perhaps something was amiss. That led us to get in touch with some state budget officials. They said there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation – and that Lewis was neither wrong nor using faulty accounting. Crunching the numbers The House, Senate and governor’s office all agree that North Carolina should use $6 million in federal grant money next school year and $12.2 million in 2018-19 to expand Pre-K funding. The Senate plan stops there. But Cooper would double it by matching that federal money with state funds. The House budget initially appears to follow the Senate plan, which led to the initial confusion. But in reality, the House – like Cooper – would require a state match. The average budget explorer might not realize that, however, because House budget writers omitted the additional state funds from some documents. ""The House says it in their narrative but it doesn't show it in their numbers,"" said Pam Kilpatrick, North Carolina’s senior assistant state budget officer. The House, Senate and Cooper all agree it will cost right around $5,200 for each new seat. And those estimates jibe with recent history. Last year the state spent an extra $1.325 million on NC Pre-K and created 260 new seats, for an average of $5,096 per seat. Kilpatrick, the state budget expert, agreed that using both the federal funds and matching state money ought to be enough to get rid of the existing waiting list – just like Lewis said. ""We're definitely in agreement,"" Kilpatrick said. ""It's right on the money."" Our ruling North Carolina Republican Rep. David Lewis, a top budget writer in the House of Representatives, said that chamber’s budget will eliminate the waiting list for NC Pre-K. The program, which serves needy children and military families, turned down 4,668 children this year due to a lack of seats, according to the state. And Lewis is right that the House’s version of the budget has enough money to create at least that many new seats if it becomes law. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DD0900>],/factchecks/2017/jun/06/david-lewis/thousands-more-children-and-families-could-soon-ge/

No, Trump's reported pick for USDA 'chief scientist' did not mock scientists
","A fake news site has taken creative license by saying that a man President Donald Trump is reportedly picking to lead a top science job actually mocked scientists, calling them ""dumb regular people that think dinosaurs existed."" A May 20 post by USPOLN.com headlined ""Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: ‘Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer’,"" takes aim at Sam Clovis. News reports have said that Trump plans to nominate Clovis as undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Research, Education and Economics division, a position that’s been held by scientists in past administrations. Clovis is the Department of Agriculture’s senior White House adviser, but reportedly lacks a science background. He has a doctorate in public administration, has taught business, management and public policy at Morningside College in Iowa, hosted a conservative radio show and was a Trump campaign policy adviser.  Has he disparaged scientists as USPOLN.com said? Facebook users flagged the post as potential fake news. We found that quotes attributed to Clovis are indeed fake. USPOLN.com calls itself a ""hybrid News/Satire platform,"" and we’ve included it in our list of websites that deliberately post false or fake stories. A disclaimer in its ""About Us"" page plainly tells readers its intentions and accuracy:   ""USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. These Articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" The USPOLN.com story about Clovis heavily borrows, almost verbatim, multiple paragraphs from a May 12 report from ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit, investigative journalism website.  USPOLN.com’s opening sentences:  ""The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the ‘chief scientist’ is supposed to be the leader ‘among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.’ President Donald Trump’s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn’t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter."" ProPublica’ first few sentences:  ""The USDA’s research section studies everything from climate change to nutrition. Under the 2008 Farm Bill, its leader is supposed to serve as the agency’s ‘chief scientist’ and be chosen ""from among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics.  ""But Sam Clovis — who, according to sources with knowledge of the appointment and members of the agriculture trade press, is President Trump’s pick to oversee the section — appears to have no such credentials.  ""Clovis has never taken a graduate course in science and is openly skeptical of climate change. While he has a doctorate in public administration and was a tenured professor of business and public policy at Morningside College for 10 years, he has published almost no academic work."" USPOLN.com’s post takes a satirical turn when it starts ""quoting"" Clovis on his comments about his credentials in an assumed interview with ""KYXL Radio"" (searches on the Federal Communications Commission website for a radio station with those call letters yielded zero results). The satirical website said Clovis ""argued that he was ‘proud’ he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because ‘scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead (sic) individuals anyway’.""  The post also falsely claims Clovis said he thanks God he did not make him a scientist and that he’s proud not to be one ""because they believe in things like evolution and the like."" USPOLN.com links as its ""source"" another ""hybrid News/Satire"" site that has the same article posted. We asked the USDA to confirm if Clovis was Trump’s pick for the chief scientist job. The department said it could not comment in advance on any nominations for Senate-confirmed positions. What about the quotes from USPOLN.com?

The Associated Press has also reported that the quotes are not real. Fake news website USPOLN.com said, ""Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: ‘Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer’.""

The item is circulating on at least two satirical websites whose stated mission is to lure unwitting readers, especially conservatives, into mistaking its inflammatory hoaxes for truth.    ""We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative,"" reads a disclaimer on Freedom Crossroads, one of the spoof sites. ""Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. ""Reality is often in the eye of the beholder,"" it continues. ""You won't find any of it here."" The website includes a fake quote from a police chief who names the Clintons as possible suspects, in an article penned by fictional Freedom Crossroads Correspondent Louis Leweigh (wink wink).      For her part, the real Lewinsky seemed to be having fun with her starring role in a fake news feature. Days after the stories first appeared online, she cheekily signalled proof of life in a Twitter post with a link to an article debunking the fake item.   👋🏻#stillhere. https://t.co/7VwWacDvwk Our ruling A number of fake news writers said former White House intern Monica Lewinsky had been tragically killed in a burglary and named the Clintons as possible suspects. The item is circulating on websites that make no secret of their irreverent mission to confuse readers, especially conservatives, into mistaking their satire for truth.

Donald Trump wrong on Paris accord, China and coal plants
","Even as President Donald Trump defiantly withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, he described it in contradictory terms. ""As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country,"" he said June 1. An agreement cannot be both nonbinding and draconian at the same time. It’s one or the other. Trump continued to blur the difference when he compared the obligations of China and the United States under the deal. ""China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants,"" Trump said. ""So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement."" We asked the White House to tell us what part of the Paris agreement gave China permission to build coal-fired plants and what part banned them for America. We did not hear back. The international declaration is big on the word ""should"" and light on the word ""shall."" As Boston College law professor David Wirth wrote in 2016, the distinction is crucial. ""Even the most cursory review of the text of the Paris Agreement discloses a careful, purposeful alternation between the mandatory 'shall' — indicating a binding obligation governed by international law — and the hortatory 'should' — nonbinding statements of strictly political intent without legal force,"" Wirth wrote. The agreement says nations shall say publicly how much they will aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and they shall report their progress. It’s up to each country to come up with its own plan, called a Nationally Determined Contribution, to meet the overall goal to limit the world’s temperature to 1.5 degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels. But then it says signatory countries ""should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies."" In other words, the public plan and reporting is a must-do, but the actual doing is optional. Of importance to Trump’s comparison, the agreement treats developed and developing countries differently: ""Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties."" Wirth told us that Trump’s words are technically inaccurate. ""Nobody is allowing China to do anything, and nobody is prohibiting China from doing anything,"" Wirth said. ""And the same is true for the United States."" The agreement never uses the word coal, much less spells out how many coal-fired plants any country can build. As for China’s blueprint for what it plans to do, it does give itself until 2030 for its greenhouse gas emissions to peak. In contrast, the U.S. blueprint says ""the United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below its 2005 level in 2025."" Critics of the arrangement point to China’s rising emissions as evidence of a fundamental unfairness. As Trump put it, the Chinese ""can do whatever they want for 13 years."" Again, Trump’s language gives more legal weight to the agreement than it actually has, but he also overlooks other parts of China’s plan that aim to ""control total coal consumption,"" and to increase the use of renewable energy supplies. China said it would reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 60 to 65 percent below 2005 levels, and increase the share of non-fossil energy to around 20 percent. And to get there, it would start changing its policies today. As a practical matter, China’s carbon dioxide emissions have held steady for the past three years. China just halted the construction of 103 new coal-fired power plants, and its energy agency at the start of the year announced plans to pour more than $360 billion into renewable energy by the end of the decade. Wirth said that regarding coal-fired power plants, the Paris agreement creates diplomatic pressure for countries to move away from coal, but doesn’t mandate it. ""Either China or the United States can build as many power plants as they want as long as they are offset in other sectors,"" he said. ""It was framed that way so as to give governments maximum flexibility to meet the goals they set for themselves."" Trump said that the Paris agreement allows China ""to build hundreds of additional coal plants,"" while the United States can’t. The White House offered no legal argument to back that up, and the text of the agreement fails to support it. The Paris agreement never mentions the word coal, and in Trump’s own words, it is nonbinding. It forces neither China nor the United States to do or not do anything. China’s voluntary plan to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions does allow emissions to rise until 2030, but it also moves the country away from reliance on coal, and the tangible results have been the cancellation of over 100 new coal-fired plants. Neither the law nor realities on the ground support Trump’s statement. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C614C0>],/factchecks/2017/jun/05/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-paris-accord-china-and-coal-pla/

Al Gore says '70 percent of Florida is in drought today'
","Former Vice President Al Gore said that the global community will have to continue to respond to climate change after President Donald Trump’s ""reckless"" decision to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. Gore said that evidence abounds that climate change is real (it is ), and people ""don’t have to rely on the virtually unanimous opinion of the scientific community anymore."" ""Mother nature is telling us every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the book of Revelation,"" Gore said on Fox News Sunday on June 4. ""People are noticing this, these downpours and historic floods. We’ve had 11 once-in-a-thousand-year downpours in the U.S. just in the last 10 years. We’ve got these wildfires that become mega fires now. Seventy percent of Florida is in drought today. Missouri declared an emergency just a couple of days ago because of another one of these. And they keep on coming."" Gore correctly cited a drought figure for Florida from a commonly used drought index. We will explain what that index shows and what the drought means in Florida. A spokeswoman for Gore said that he was citing the United States Drought Monitor, a weekly map published on Thursdays showing drought conditions. The monitor, established in 1999, is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. The monitor showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was in a moderate to extreme drought as of May 30. (The previous few weeks it had been between 65 and 66.) While that was the highest this year, there have been multiple other weeks that it reached similarly high levels since 2000. The last time the drought monitor showed Florida’s area of drought was as high as 71 percent was February 2013. As bad as this drought is, it’s been even worse. During two weeks in April 2012, 99.96 percent of Florida was in a drought. More than 72 percent of Florida was in a drought between late January and early June 2012. There was also an extended period of drought between December 2010 and July 2011 and between April and August 2007. There were also periods of drought in 2000-01. Florida’s dry season runs from about November through May and can leave Florida prone to drought conditions. If the dry season is drier than usual and the wet season is late to appear, a period of drought can run into summer, said Victor Murphy, climate service program manager for NOAA's National Weather Service-Southern Region. There is a small bit of good news: The return of the rainy season — under way this first week of June — should improve drought conditions. ""There have been at least three other instances in the past 10 years when this has occurred,"" Murphy said. ""Not coincidentally, all of these events began in the winter/spring (dry) season, and ended during the summer. This event will be similar. ""Since the Florida wet season has returned with a vengeance over the past week, and is forecast to continue over the next few weeks, the amount of Florida in drought two to four weeks from now should be substantially less than what it is today."" Gore tied in several weather events to illustrate the effects of climate change. Experts told us that Florida is prone to periodic droughts, but rising temperatures as a result of climate change can make droughts worse. ""It’s part of the climate -- part of natural cycles,"" said David Zierden, the state climatologist for Florida who works at the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. ""Our current drought is no worse or more prolonged than any other drought we go through periodically."" This year the Florida Peninsula only received half of its normal rainfall during the dry season, leading to the most active wildfire season since 2011. Temperatures have been rising in Florida -- the statewide average temperature for 26 of the last 27 months have all been warmer than normal, Zierden said. ""There is an increasing temperature trend, and warmer temperatures lead to greater evapotranspiration rates, which can exacerbate these periods of drought,"" Zierden said. (Gore’s spokeswoman pointed to an article by the Union of Concerned Scientists that makes a similar point.) While Gore’s numerical statement about the drought is correct, David Nolan, chair of the University of Miami’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences, cautioned against pointing to any particular weather event as proof of climate change. ""I am generally not comfortable with relating any local event, a drought in one place or a flood in another, to global warming,"" Nolan said. ""What matters most is global average temperature, because that drives sea level rise, which eventually will be the biggest problem."" Gore said ""70 percent of Florida is in drought today."" Gore correctly cited the United States Drought Monitor which showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was experiencing a drought for the week ending May 30. However, that drought percentage isn’t unheard of in Florida -- there have been other periods of drought since 2000 when the monitor began mapping drought data.
