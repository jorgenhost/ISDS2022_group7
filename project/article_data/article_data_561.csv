McMurray claims financial victories on Grand Island
","As Democrat Nathan McMurray looks for votes in a Republican-leaning congressional district, he points to his record as Grand Island town supervisor the last two and a half years. On Aug. 8, the day Republican incumbent Chris Collins was arrested on insider trading charges, McMurray held a news conference and prepared his supporters for the attacks he said will come in the race for New York’s 27th Congressional District.    ""The cheaters are still going to fight,"" McMurray said. ""They’re still going to try to cheat. They’re going to try to label me, someone who’s been a small-town supervisor, who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had, who is an Eagle Scout, who is a father and a husband and a dad, that I’m some type of radical because I have a D next to my name. When is this game of party affiliation going to end?"" We decided to evaluate the claims he made about his tenure as Grand Island supervisor. He began a four-year term in January 2016.   Local governments must adopt balanced budgets, according to the New York State Comptroller’s Office. Excluding capital projects which are funded by debt not included in balanced budget calculations, the town took in $19.9 million in 2016 and spent $18.6 million, according to the town’s financial statements.  In 2017, the town posted revenues of $20 million and spent $19.1 million.   Deducting spending on capital projects from the town's financial statements is the most accurate way to evaluate McMurray's balanced budget claim, said Pam Barton, Grand Island’s accountant. Is that the same as a surplus? The generally accepted definition of ""surplus"" in town government is the amount of money in ""unassigned fund balance"" in the town’s general fund, Barton said. For Grand Island, the unassigned fund balance was $5.9 million in 2015, the year before McMurray took office, $6.8 million in 2016 and $6.7 million in 2017. It dropped a bit last year but was still higher than the surplus from the year before he took office. Grand Island received its highest credit rating since at least 2001 in September 2016, Barton said.  When Barton became town accountant in 2001, the town’s bond rating was A2, she said, four notches below its current rating of Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service.  The town’s current rating is the second-highest on Moody’s scale. Barton said because of the town’s size and budget, it likely will never reach the highest rating. Barton said the town has always been rated by Moody’s, and has not received ratings from Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings. McMurray made three claims about his record of managing Grand Island’s finances. It’s fair to point out that Grand Island’s strong financial position is the result of years of sound management, not only changes made since McMurray took office in 2016, Barton said. ""He’s been continuing the things that have been in place from before,"" the town accountant said. Still, his claim about keeping a balanced budget is true. McMurray’s claim about increasing surpluses is mostly true. The town had more surplus funds at the end of 2017 than it did when he took office, though it decreased slightly in his second year in office. His claim that the town has the highest credit rating it has ever had is true, based on all available information. We rate his statement True.      ",/factchecks/2018/aug/29/nathan-mcmurray/mcmurray-claims-about-grand-island-record-are-true/

No, 96% of Google news stories on Trump aren't from left-wing outlets
","In a pair of early-morning tweets, President Donald Trump took aim at Google’s system of search results, saying it was biased against outlets that are friendly to him. In two successive tweets on Aug. 28 (later deleted and reposted to correct a spelling error) Trump wrote: ""Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of … results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!"" ....results on “Trump News” are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed! The part where Trump said that 96 percent of ""results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media"" caught our eye. A close look at the source of the statistic suggests that Trump’s figure is dubious. The White House didn’t respond to an inquiry. The 96 percent figure appears to come from a post on PJ Media, a conservative site. The Aug. 25 story had attracted some attention in conservative media circles before getting picked up by Trump. ""Is Google manipulating its algorithm to prioritize left-leaning news outlets in their coverage of President Trump?"" Paula Bolyard, PJ Media’s supervising editor, wrote in the article. ""It sure looks that way based on recent search results for news on the president."" To test the premise, Bolyard performed a Google search for ""Trump"" using the search engine's ""News"" tab and analyzed the results using a media bias chart. Of 76 total stories, most came from outlets such as CNN, the Washington Post and NBC. Only three came up from the Wall Street Journal, which is labeled right-leaning by the chart. Bolyard wrote that she repeated her search ""multiple times using different computers (registered to different users) and Google returned similar results."" Bolyard acknowledged that while the study is ""not scientific,"" though she did conclude that ""the results suggest a pattern of bias against right-leaning content."" But this conclusion is debatable, and Trump’s reporting of the results is more problematic still. There is broad agreement that the factors that go into Google’s algorithms for news searches are opaque. And the lack of transparency can allow theories about ideological bias to flourish. They ""depend on a lot of factors, including what other people are searching for, what they're clicking on, what sites link to a given search result, whether the website is optimized for mobile, and even whether the site supports encrypted HTTPS,"" said Jeremy Gillula, tech policy director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""But with all that said, Google's search algorithms are still a black box, and we'd prefer if Google gave users more information and control over the factors that influence search results."" In a statement, Google said that ideological factors do not play a role in its algorithms. ""When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds,"" the statement said. ""Search is not used to set a political agenda, and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment."" Even if one considers Google’s algorithmic factors to be ""biases,"" that doesn’t necessarily mean they are ideological biases. Searches, for instance, are widely believed to favor newer content and original sources rather than aggregations. At the very least, there should be a fair amount of variability in search results over time. A study made during one snapshot in time, such as the one published in PJ Media, will not produce the same results a few hours later, as new articles come online. Bolyard, in an email interview with PolitiFact, noted that she mentioned some of the caveats in her article. In the article, she cautioned that ""factors such as the relevance of the topic, the design of the website, internal and external links, and the way articles are written and formatted all can affect a site's Google traffic. Google is constantly tweaking their algorithm, and a website's traffic prospects can rise or fall depending on the changes."" However, Trump made no indication in his tweets that the findings could be chalked up to anything beyond ideological bias. A more problematic aspect of the study is the metric used to label websites. To determine ""left"" and ""right,"" Bolyard used a chart of media outlets assembled by Sharyl Attkisson, a former CBS correspondent who hosts the Sunday morning program ""Full Measure"" for Sinclair Broadcasting, a network of local stations that has taken a pro-Trump editorial stance. Here’s the version of the chart Bolyard linked to:   The chart is not neutral evidence supporting Trump’s point, and it labels anything not overtly conservative as ""left. In the ""left"" category are such rigorously mainstream outlets as the Associated Press and Reuters. The three big broadcast networks — ABC, NBC, CBS — are considered ""left,"" as are the Washington Post and the New York Times. Other media outlets that produce a large amount of content every day, including CNN, NPR, Politico, USA Today, and CNBC, are labeled ""left."" This means that most of media entities that produce large amounts of widely read and cited news content -- factors that might well give them a leg up in the Google algorithm -- are defined by the chart, and thus by the PJ Media study, as ""left-wing."" So, by its design, the study guarantees that an enormous percentage of Trump news coverage would falls into what the chart defines as ""left."" Full disclosure: PolitiFact and its owner, the Poynter Institute, are both listed on the chart as left of center. We actually consider ourselves not to have an ideological leaning. ""It’s a ‘study’ designed to come up with the outcome it came up with, and it did just that,"" Chip Stewart, a professor at Texas Christian University’s Bob Schieffer College of Communication. Moreover, the ""left"" category lumps these large-staffed, comprehensive news outlets in with genuinely liberal-to-left outlets, such as the Daily Kos, Salon, the Nation, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and Media Matters. A more revealing comparison would be to compare search results of truly left-wing sites vs. truly right-wing sites. In a written description of the chart, Attkisson acknowledged that the graphic is ""subjective"" and writes that ""position on the chart doesn’t necessarily imply credibility or lack thereof. Sources on far right and far left have, in many instances, produced excellent, factually correct information at times."" Bolyard agreed that ""any chart that attempts to quantify media bias is going to be inherently subjective."" But she added that ""while it may be fair to quibble with Attkisson's assertion about how far left-of-center some major media outlets are, I think it's entirely fair to say that outlets like NBC, the New York Times, and CNN skew to the left, especially in their coverage of the president."" Stewart, however, rejected the notion that the algorithm has ideological bias. ""A far more plausible explanation is that the items that drive the algorithm — links, shares, etc. — are more common among the so-called liberal publications, which have a long track record of credible journalism and try to cater to a wider audience,"" he said. Either way, Trump used the 96 percent figure without taking into account any of these methodological concerns. Trump tweeted that ""96 percent of (Google News) results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media."" This figure is based on a non-scientific study from a conservative website that categorized any media outlet not expressly conservative as being part of the ""left."" These outlets include wire services, broadcast networks and most major newspapers and collectively account for a large percentage of original news reports produced in the United States. The methodology essentially preordains that a large percentage of coverage captured by Google will be what the study defines as ""left,"" which is wrong. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2018/aug/29/donald-trump/no-96-google-news-stories-trump-arent-left-wing-ou/

Hitting back, group defends Dem governor candidate Tony Evers in handling of teacher porn case
","Who would have thought an 8-year-old case of a Madison-area teacher viewing pornography would become, prominently and repeatedly, a flashpoint in the 2018 campaign for governor? Three times, the state Republican Party has run attack ads against Tony Evers, the Democratic nominee, tying him to the teacher. (In fact, as we were preparing this fact check, the GOP released another, though broader attack ad, tying Evers to that case and two others.) None of the first three GOP ads fared well in our assessments. All of our fact checks in the governor’s race. Now, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee is coming to the defense of Evers, the state schools superintendent, in the Madison-area teacher case. Its TV ad, released Aug. 20, 2018, makes this two-part claim: When the law stopped Tony Evers from revoking a teacher's license for viewing pornography, Tony worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law so offenders could be kicked out of the classroom. On the first part of the claim, the ad’s use of the word stopped goes a bit too far. Meanwhile, the ad partially undercuts itself on the second part. While the narrator is saying Evers ""worked with lawmakers"" to change the law, which is a fair characterization, words on the screen go too far in declaring: ""Evers changed the law."" Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The case The ad alludes to the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. He was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. The arbitrator concluded that Harris’ behavior did not endanger any students  — a necessary factor under state law at the time. The decision to give Harris back his job was upheld by two courts. All our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. Evers’ role Evers did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged.

But Evers decided against seeking revocation after concluding, as the arbitrator did, that the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger kids, as defined by the law at that time.

In other words, in the view of Evers’ department, there was no legal basis to take away Harris’ license. The law At the time, state law defined immoral conduct in such cases as ""conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil."" After the Harris case, the law was changed so that immoral conduct includes ""the intentional use of an educational agency’s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material."" That is, the part about endangering students was removed, a change that was backed by Evers and signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who Evers will face in the general election. GOP state Rep. Steve Kestell, who authored the bill, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Evers’ Department of Public Instruction did not push the bill. The Greater Wisconsin Committee did not respond to our requests for information to back the statement in the ad. But emails provided to the Journal Sentinel, and to us, by Evers’ department show the department worked with lawmakers in the sense that the department’s legislative liaison discussed the legislation with Kestell as it was being drafted. And department officials testified at hearings in favor of the legislation. But while Evers played a supportive role he did not, despite the words on the screen in the ad, change the law himself or even take the lead in doing so. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee says: ""When the law stopped Tony Evers from revoking a teacher's license for viewing pornography, Tony worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law so offenders could be kicked out of the classroom."" On the first part of the claim, the state law in place at the time didn’t actually stop Evers from trying to revoke the license who viewed pornography at school. Evers could have initiated revocation proceedings, which the teacher could have challenged. But Evers concluded that the law didn’t allow for a revocation because the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger children. The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator. And two courts upheld the arbitrator’s decision. Moreover, the fact that Evers’ department backed, and Walker signed, a change in the law supports the idea that the law didn’t favor revocation at the time. On the second part of the claim, Evers did work with lawmakers to change the law, as the narrator states in the ad, but he didn’t change the law as words on the screen in the ad claim. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2018/aug/29/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/hitting-back-group-defends-dem-governor-candidate-/

Rush Limbaugh falsely claims Jacksonville shooter part of Trump ‘Resistance’
","In an attempt to find a motive behind a deadly shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Fla., some conservative commentators misidentified the assailant as part of a political opposition movement against President Donald Trump. Syndicated talk show radio host Rush Limbaugh went a step further, predicting the story would quickly vanish from headlines because the mainstream media is wary of publicizing stories in which ""the resistance is taking up arms"" ""I’m thinking you might not hear very much about this Jacksonville shooting after the preliminaries because it appears that the shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance',"" Limbaugh said Aug. 28, two days after two died and 10 others were injured in the incident. But Limbaugh’s claim is based on erroneous reporting, which has since been retracted. Limbaugh’s comments were posted on his website, which linked to a story on the conspiracy-minded site Gateway Pundit. The original headline on the Gateway Pundit article read, ""Jacksonville Shooter Was Member of Anti-Trump ‘Resistance’ – Referred to Trump Supporters at ‘Trumptards’ – Murdered 4 People."" Gateway Pundit identified the shooter as operating with the Reddit handle ""Ravenchamps,"" which posted comments critical of Trump and his supporters. However, the actual shooter’s video game handle was ""Ravens2012champs,"" according to NBC News. TMZ reported he also used the name ""RavensChamp"" — one letter off from the user identified by Gateway Pundit. Gateway Pundit has since removed references to the wrongly identified Reddit user, and issued an update that says, ""An anonymous Reddit user was mis-identified in an earlier post."" The Gateway Pundit article now carries a different headline that strikes any reference to the shooter’s political leanings: ""Jacksonville Shooter Had Strange Online Profile and Bizarre Playing Style – Murdered 3 People (UPDATE)."" We searched through articles about the perpetrator and found no evidence the shooting was politically motivated. At the time of this writing, the post on Limbaugh’s site remains uncorrected. Attempts to reach Limbaugh were unreturned. In an interview with NBC News, the wrongly identified Reddit user, who NBC referred to only as a Minnesota native named ""Pavel"" to protect his privacy, described his reaction to learning about the case of mistaken identity: ""I went on Reddit. I noticed I had 60, 70 unread messages. Usually I have two or something,"" he told NBC News. ""I look at the messages and it's a bunch of people using my username claiming I'm that Madden shooter person. Half of them are messages like 'I hope that person's dead.' Responding to a user who said ""ravenchamps was his profile, see for yourself,"" Ravenchamps wrote back. ""I'm alive you know?"" he wrote. Limbaugh said, ""It appears that the (Jacksonville) shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'."" Limbaugh’s comments were based on an article by the Gateway Pundit, which has since retracted its claim about the shooter’s anti-Trump political leanings. We searched through articles about the perpetrator and found no evidence the shooting was politically motivated. We rate this claim False.

Sen. McCain did not commit treason in Vietnam
","After Sen. John McCain passed away on Aug. 25, publications nationwide applauded his service, both in the Navy and in the Senate. But news of McCain’s death also dragged up old claims that McCain was not the war hero he claimed to be. A 2017 article posted on Revenge of the Herd claims, ""John McCain was pardoned for treason."" It alleges that, during his time as a prisoner of war, McCain gave information to the North Vietnamese in exchange for better treatment, and that he would have been executed if President Richard Nixon didn’t pardon him. The story resurfaced after McCain’s death and was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not true. While serving in the Navy in 1967, McCain’s plane was shot down over North Vietnam. His right leg and both of his arms were broken in the crash, and McCain was taken prisoner by  North Vietnamese soldiers. He was held captive for the next five and half years, often in solitary confinement. By McCain’s account, he was frequently denied medical attention and beaten in exchange for information. The Revenge of the Herd article focuses on two alleged acts of treason. The first surrounded an allegation that McCain said he would trade information in exchange for medical treatment. In his book, Faith of My Fathers, McCain recounts the grievous wounds he suffered when he was shot down and afterward at the hands of angry Vietnamese. As we have previously written at PolitiFact, McCain was taken to the Maison Centrale, known to POWs as the Hanoi Hilton, where he did lapse in and out of consciousness for four days and refuse his interrogators' demands for information. But then, McCain recounts, he tried a different approach with a prison officer nicknamed ""Bug.'' ""Desperate, I tried to bargain with him. 'Take me to the hospital and I'll give you the information you want.' I didn't intend to keep my word, reasoning that after my injuries had been treated, I would be strong enough to deal with the consequences of not holding up my end of the bargain,'' McCain wrote.
  It’s impossible to determine everything McCain told his captors -- interrogations took place one-on-one, in secluded prisons, more than 50 years ago. Based on his personal accounts, though, McCain was used mostly for propaganda: filmmakers would show him in the hospital, being treated by the North Vietnamese. Officials also encouraged him to say that he wanted the war to end, or that he was grateful to his captors and sorry for his participation in the fighting. McCain said he refused to do so. McCain admitted he eventually gave up information about his ship and Navy squadron. ""I regret very much having done so,'' he wrote. The second allegation of treason surround McCain’s signing of  a confession that he was a war criminal. He did sign such a statement -- after, he says, he was beaten routinely over the course of four days. Upon returning to the United States, McCain wrote, ""I reached the lowest point of my 5½ years in North Vietnam. I was at the point of suicide, because I saw that I was reaching the end of my rope."" McCain’s first-hand account is corroborated by Robert Timberg, author of John McCain: An American Odyssey. Timburg spoke to other POWs to write his biography of McCain. ""I've never known of any occasion in which Sen. McCain provided the North Vietnamese with anything of value,"" Timberg said. Even if you were to somehow buy the argument that McCain committed treason, the Revenge of the Herd article loses all credibility when it says McCain was pardoned. The article says that McCain and 33 other POWs faced a court martial for their crimes. President Richard Nixon issued a blanket pardon to all 34 POWs, including McCain. This part of the story seems to be entirely fabricated. There is no record of any legal proceedings against McCain. His name is also absent from a list of all the pardons granted by Nixon. P.S. Ruckman Jr., who studies presidential pardons and runs the website pardonpower.com, told our colleagues at Snopes there is no evidence McCain received a presidential pardon. ""I have developed a researchable data set of every individual grant of clemency from 1789 to present. I have been over the data (30,000 plus cases), dozens of times over the years. John McCain’s name simply does not appear in the data,"" Ruckman said. An article on Revenge of the Herd claims that ""John McCain was pardoned for treason."" During his time as a prisoner of war, McCain said he would trade information in exchange for medical treatment. He was also forced to sign a confession that he was a war criminal. But there is no evidence of legal proceedings against McCain when he returned to the United States. And records of presidential pardons do not include McCain’s name.

Coulter's strange claim that Dutch settlers preceded blacks in South Africa
","When President Donald Trump referred to land seizures and ""large scale killings"" of white farmers in South Africa, he set the stage for a classic Twitter storm. Kenya-born photographer Joseph Muhatia tweeted, ""The land in South Africa belongs to black people they are the native owner and not white people."" To which conservative pundit Ann Coulter replied, ""Actually, the Dutch (Afrikaners) were there first."" Actually, the Dutch (Afrikaners) we’re there first. https://t.co/2VXiZcpFMx Pause a second. Coulter claimed Dutch settlers who started showing up around 1650 were in South Africa before black people. We tweeted her to learn what she had in mind and didn’t hear back. The history of Southern Africa long before the Europeans (and yes, there is a long before) is a fascinating tale of competing kingdoms, shifting alliances, and territorial disputes. We spent some time with two volumes published by UNESCO in 1992. Wars among the people labeled black today played out before and after the Europeans arrived. As it turns out, the Dutch dropped down in a fairly peaceful area. The Dutch East India Company established a toehold in Cape Town on the southwestern tip of modern South Africa. There, they encountered a group called the Khoikhoi who used the land to graze their cattle. From the start, the Dutch treated the land as theirs. On May 10, 1656, the outpost’s commander Jan van Riebeeck described his dealings with a Khoikhoi leader. ""His claim to the ownership of the Cape lands could not be entertained by the Company, which had taken possession of them for its own purposes,"" van Riebeeck wrote in his diary (Hat tip to our colleagues at Africa Check). Cape Town’s original purpose was simply to resupply merchant ships headed to the East Indies, but over the decades, settlers turned to farming, which put them in conflict with the original inhabitants. By the end of the 1700s, a series of wars broke out with the Xhosa, a larger and more formidable foe than the Khoikhoi. Ultimately, under the British, the Xhosa were defeated in 1853. Clearly, the story of South Africa turns on the Dutch and the British taking land from the people who were there first. There is perhaps one possible thought Coulter had. When South Africa operated under a strict regime of racial categories – the apartheid period between 1948 and 1994 – it used both ""colored"" and ""black"" to classify different groups of people. The Khoikhoi, relatively few in number, were classified as colored. In that regard, Coulter might have seen Muhatia’s reference to blacks as broad. But that would play along with the discredited credo of apartheid in racist South Africa. As the authors of a 2000 study of historic migration in Africa noted, ""the biological reality of the race concept is bankrupt; the genetic and/or physical variations of hundreds of millions of people cannot be subsumed under a single term."" That said, focusing on the Khoikhoi would be excessively narrow because it ignores the conflict with the Xhosa. Under apartheid, people in the Xhosa ethnic group were classified as natives, or black, and restricted to communities called bantustans. The anti-apartheid leader and later president of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a member of a Xhosa clan. (Ethnic classification continues today. Groups called ""coloured"" under the old regime are now counted as ""black"" for economic empowerment and labor relations purposes.) Beyond the western areas of South Africa where the Dutch influence was greatest, other groups predated the colonizers by over 1,000 years. One analysis from an international group of archeologists found that farming by Bantu-speaking groups reached South Africa about 2,000 years ago. So Coulter’s focus on the Dutch ignored what was going on in the rest of the region. Coulter said that Dutch settlers were in South Africa before black people. This is plainly wrong. Bantu-speaking groups farmed in the eastern regions of modern South Africa perhaps as much as a millennium before the Dutch arrived. In the west where the Dutch settled, other indigenous group lived on the land that the Dutch then claimed. This claim defies logic and history.

Black business ownership didn’t increase 400 percent this year
","Conservative bloggers are championing a survey that they say indicates a 400 percent jump in the number of black-owned businesses in the United States in the past year — and they’re attributing that supposed increase to President Donald Trump. Trump has pointed to low African-American unemployment rates throughout his presidency, calling them ""the lowest ever recorded in our country."" While that’s true, we found African-American unemployment has been decreasing gradually since it peaked at 16.6 percent in 2010. This new claim of a skyrocketing number of black business owners originates from a 2017 client email survey conducted by two private companies and focused on small businesses. The aggregated findings, posted on the companies’ websites in January, do not reference Trump. However, bloggers then took the survey and linked the results to Trump. For example, the conservative website Think Americana published an article titled, ""MAGA: Black business ownership jumps 400% in one year under Trump."" ""On Monday President Trump’s approval rating with African Americans hit 31%,"" the article said. ""That’s not all. Black business ownership jumped 400% in one year."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The 31 percent approval rating comes from a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, which was updated a few days later as 36 percent. Rasmussen Reports consistently cites higher approval ratings for Trump than most pollsters. Gallup’s numbers hover in the 10 to 15 percent approval range for African-Americans, and Reuters monthly polling for July had black approval at 12.8 percent. In November 2017, small business financing company Guidant Financial and online credit marketplace LendingClub Corporation sent out an email survey to their clientele nationwide; they received responses from about 2,600 ""current and aspiring entrepreneurs."" The companies both posted general articles about the results of that survey on their websites in January without making any distinctions about race or ethnicity except that 47 percent of ""aspiring entrepreneurs"" surveyed were minorities. The 400 percent increase in black-owned businesses claim, however, was not made until a subsequent graphic was published on Guidant’s website on Aug. 8. It was not clear from the released results how the companies came up with the 400 percent jump. The percentage of African-American respondents who owned businesses was not published, nor was that figure from last year. The survey sample was not random, the response was voluntary, and the margin of error was not made public. This graphic said it relied on the same survey data, and it highlighted the African-American business owners in the pool. The methodology the companies provided did not break down respondents by race, only saying that minorities accounted for 47 percent of aspiring entrepreneurs who responded. PolitiFact contacted Guidant about the claim in the graphic on Aug. 21. Two days later, a new version of the graphic was posted, this time without any mention of a 400 percent increase. ""We have found that the 400% statistic is being misrepresented in its context and therefore we have decided to pull that statistic from our info graph,"" public relations consultant for Guidant Stacia Kirby said in an email. ""Our mission is to help people get started and funded in owning their own business."" When it comes to black-owned business numbers, we couldn’t find another source that supports this increase from 2017 to 2018. The Annual Business Survey data about Business Owner Characteristics for 2017 is not yet available, and most recent census data related to minority-owned businesses is from 2016. Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz, studies entrepreneurship and authored a book about its relationship with race in the United States.

Fairlie said there was no indication that African-American businesses had seen significant growth in the past year. ""That would be great if there was a 400 percent increase given that African-American rates are so low, but everything that I have seen from Census and BLS data does not show that kind of growth,"" Fairlie said.

No, Arpaio has not been appointed to replace Sen. John McCain
","Soon after Sen. John McCain’s death, false information spread claiming that former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio had been appointed to replace McCain in the U.S. Senate. McCain, who had brain cancer, died Aug. 25. McCain represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate from 1987 until his death at age 81. An Aug. 26 headline on the site trumpbetrayed.us claimed, ""BREAKING: Sheriff Joe Arpaio will take over McCain’s seat in the Senate."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As a result of McCain’s death, Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is now tasked with appointing someone to replace McCain in the U.S. Senate. But he has not done so yet. Ducey’s office said that ""out of respect for the life and legacy"" of McCain and his family, the governor will not name an appointment until after McCain is laid to rest. McCain’s burial is set for Sept. 2 at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Md. Under Arizona law, Ducey is to appoint someone of the same party — a Republican — and that person will serve at least until the 2020 general election. Whoever is elected in 2020 will finish the rest of McCain’s six-year-term that expires in January 2023, after the 2022 general election. Arpaio is seeking to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate, and will be on the Republican primary ballot Aug. 28. But that’s because he’s competing in the race to replace Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring at the end of his term January 2019. The story on trumpbetrayed.us includes a line that may help tip readers off that this story is false. It says, ""The good news for the GOP is that Governor Jaleel White, a Republican like Bobby Jindal, has decided to appoint a man who will vote with Donald Trump."" Jaleel White is the actor who played Steve Urkel in the sitcom Family Matters. The false story ropes in Hillary Clinton, claiming she ""filed in court to initiate a special election, with her facing Arpaio in a one-on-one showdown"" and said there’d be an update ""on this story that now involves the Clintons, meaning that inevitably — someone is going to die.""

Duckworth's background check claim checks out
","The so-called ""gun show loophole,"" which says private individuals can sell their guns without conducting a federal background check, has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Speaking at a community center on Chicago’s South Side following the city’s most violent weekend this year, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth added another wrinkle to that criticism by highlighting an implication of the law that hasn’t received as much attention. ""If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business—you retire, you don’t want to do this anymore for whatever reason—you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to ‘personal use,’"" Duckworth said. ""And once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks."" The first-term Illinois senator made the comment while expressing her support for federal legislation that would require universal background checks for gun purchases, a policy which polls show more than 80 percent of Americans support. The federal government places few restrictions on private sales by people who aren’t legally considered gun dealers. But could a former gun store owner really sell off the remainder of his or her inventory—a veritable arsenal, potentially—without running afoul of the law? The short answer: Yes, generally speaking. PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as True a similar claim in 2013. The more interesting question is why. Former gun dealers who no longer are licensed to sell guns have the same legal right to sell guns as any other private citizen. The federal rules for private sellers state they can’t give or sell a firearm to someone they know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun. They also can’t sell or transport firearms across state lines. But that’s pretty much it—although 19 states have instituted their own background check requirements beyond federal law. Illinois, for instance, requires all firearm purchasers to obtain a state permit, which can only be issued after a background check. But when a federally licensed gun dealer sells a gun in any state, the buyer must go through a background check. And the law says anyone who repeatedly buys and sells guns ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" must obtain such a license from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. That’s different than occasionally buying and selling guns to enhance or liquidate a collection. So how do guns from a retailer’s business inventory wind up in their personal collection? Federal rules permit licensed dealers to transfer firearms out of their business inventory and into their personal collection—whether they are planning on leaving the trade or not. If they maintain their license, those weapons must sit in their collection for a year before they can be sold in a private, potentially background check-free transaction. If they let their license lapse or it is revoked, they become just like any other private individual, meaning their property and sales no longer fall under the ATF’s purview—unless, of course, they cross the line by buying and selling in a way that resembles doing business. According to Mark Jones, project director for the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence and a former ATF agent, the burden of proof for that crime is high. ""It’s a pretty big mountain to climb to go after an FFL (federal firearm licensee) and prove that they’re actually criminally culpable or to go after someone who’s not an FFL but who’s dealing without a license,"" said Jones. A particularly striking case from 2006 illustrates that point. Sanford Abrams, a Maryland gun store owner and National Rifle Association board member, had his license revoked for a litany of violations, including that he couldn’t account for more than a quarter of his inventory. Between 1996 and 2000, 483 guns that were used in crimes were traced back to Abrams’ store, according to a report from the Brady Center. Yet Abrams maintained he could continue selling off his inventory as part of his personal collection. And in June 2006, the ATF affirmed that he could do so because he would only be acting as a dealer if he repeatedly purchased and resold firearms. Duckworth said former firearms dealers can transfer guns from their inventory into their personal collections, and then sell those guns without background checks. Federal law permits gun dealers to transfer inventory to their personal collections, and private gun sales under federal law do not require background checks. Many states, including Illinois, have added their own requirements, though. A former dealer—and any other private individual—could still get into trouble by continuing to buy and sell with profit as their main motive rather than enhancing or liquidating their collection. But there’s no definitive legal yardstick—such as the number of guns sold—for determining compliance. Duckworth’s statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. That’s our definition for a statement that’s True.",/factchecks/2018/aug/26/tammy-duckworth/duckworks-background-check-claim-checks-out/

Trump tweets incorrect on South African land seizures, farmer killings
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson and President Donald Trump are among a group of U.S. conservatives raising alarm bells about something happening half a world away in South Africa. ""The president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, has begun ... seizing land from his own citizens without compensation because they are the wrong skin color,"" Tucker began his show Aug. 22. ""That is literally the definition of racism."" Trump chimed in soon thereafter on Twitter, tagging accounts for both Carlson and Fox News and going even further to decry murders of farmers. Trump said that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate ""the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers."" I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Trump’s statement that the South African government is ""seizing land from white farmers"" is misleading. As for his claim that there is ""large scale killing of farmers"" in the country, that is flat-out wrong. South Africa is a country marred by its long history of racial discrimination. From 1948 until 1994, the country lived under apartheid rule; members of different races were forbidden from interacting, and black South Africans were forced under law to live in much worse conditions than white citizens. In 1959, the government required many black landowners to give up their property and rent homes with white landlords. Over the course of apartheid, non-white families lost their homes and lands. When apartheid ended in the mid 1990s, the government passed measures to help black South Africans to recover from decades of discrimination and abuse. The effects of apartheid still reverberate through the country, especially when it comes to a distribution of land: 72 percent of farmland in South Africa is owned by white people, while whites make up about 9 percent of the population. One of the reparations, first passed in 1994, is the Restitution of Land Rights Act. Under this law, black families and communities who had property taken from them before or during apartheid can file a claim for it. The government and current landowners negotiate for the area. If they cannot reach a compromise, the government can use expropriation -- the power of the state to take land for the public good. On Aug. 19, South Africa’s restitutions policy made headlines when the government moved ahead with plans to buy a hunting retreat. The current owners, the Akkerland Boerdery company, say that the government offered them only 10 percent of the market value for their property. In the Restitution of Land Rights Act, the land reform minister is given the right to expropriate land that rightfully belongs to another group. However, the act also says that the compensation for that land is to be determined ""either by agreement or by the Court."" The owners of Akkerland, who did not agree to the government’s offer, said they had been denied the opportunity to argue in court. The ruling party in South Africa, the African National Congress, has been working to make land expropriation easier for the government. Most notably, they plan to begin allowing the government to take land without offering compensation to speed up the restitution of land ownership to black South Africans. A leading ANC chairman also created controversy in July, when he said that farmers with more than 25,000 acres should have land taken from them. Trump’s framing about the South African government ""seizing land from white farmers"" omits critical context and leaves the wrong impression. The South African government is not seizing land of white farmers. Instead, they are negotiating with white farmers to buy back land that had been wrongfully taken from black communities during apartheid. The government is considering changing the constitution so they can acquire the land without paying the current owners. However, in every exchange made so far, they have paid current owners for their property loss. The government has not taken steps to limit farmers to 25,000 acres. Now to the second part of Trump’s tweet: the ""large-scale killing"" of South African farmers. The statistics on this are nebulous. Our partner Africa Check concluded in May that there were significant roadblocks to identifying the rate of farm murders. To calculate a rate, one would need the number of murders, and divide that by the total number of farmers. However, the murder rate could include anyone visiting or working on a farm, not just farm owners. Additionally, there are no accurate estimates of farms or farmers in the country. Africa Check determined that it is ""near impossible"" to determine an accurate murder rate for farmers. Calculated based solely on a 2007 commercial agriculture census, the rate is about 100 per 100,000 farmers. But when all farm-related personnel are accounted for, rather than just full-time commercial farmers, the rate is much lower: only 5.6 murders per 100,000 farmers. If you count every person involved in agriculture, even those who don’t live on farms, the rate would drop even further, to 0.4 murders per 100,000. That being said, the police in South Africa have been tracking the number of farm attacks and murders over the last two decades. According to their statistics, there were 47 farm murders in the 2017-18 financial year. According to Africa Check, the South African police did not collect statistics on attacks and murders on farms and smallholdings prior to 1997.   So, there is not conclusive evidence to say that farmers are more likely to be killed than anyone else in the country. There is also no way to determine how many recent murders were motivated by racial tensions. Dr. Johan Burger, a researcher for South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies, told the Australian Broadcasting Company fact-checkers that farm attacks may be partially motivated by the isolation of farmers; because their land is further away from neighbors and police stations, they may be easier to rob. It’s hard to say what Trump meant by ""large-scale killing."" However, based on the limited amount of information we have, it is inaccurate. Farm murders have been declining over time, according to police reports. Trump tweeted that the ""South African government is seizing land from white farmers"" and that there has been a ""large scale killing of farmers"" in the country. The government of South Africa is pursuing reparations more aggressively. When black communities file a claim for stolen land, the government has been offering fair market value to encourage white owners to sell. Now, the government is considering taking land without compensating current owners. Only land which had been unfairly taken from black communities through discriminatory laws is considered for redistribution. What’s more wrong in Trump’s observation is that South African farmers are not being killed systematically due to their race or profession. There is not enough data to say whether the rate of farmer deaths has increased significantly, and nothing tying that directly to government reparations initiatives. We rate this statement Mostly False. Correction (Aug. 28, 2018): The South African police did not collect statistics on attacks and murders on farms and smallholdings prior to 1997.

Asteroid headed toward Earth won't hit us, scientists say
","Articles trending on social media are hinting at an out-of-this-world claim: that Earth is about to be decimated by an incoming asteroid. ""NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth,"" the Wakefield Express reported. The meaning of that sentence — aside from the term ""football pitch,"" which is simply Britspeak for ""soccer field"" — seemed alarming to us. ""Dubbed ‘2016 NF23’, the gargantuan lump of space rock has been labelled ‘potentially hazardous’ by (NASA),"" the article continued.   Uh-oh. We began to wonder if Earth was on a collision course with a giant asteroid. Turns out, the answer is no. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory keeps a database that details all instances where objects in space have had a ""close approach"" to the Earth. The asteroid in question, 2016 NF23, is on that list.  According to that database, the asteroid is predicted to be closest to the Earth on Aug. 29, 2018. It will be travelling at 20,000 miles per hour, or about 5 and a half miles per second. The database also says the asteroid is estimated to be 70 meters to 160 meters in diameter, or about 75 to 175 yards. That’s roughly the size of a soccer field. But there’s actually no reason to worry about 2016 NF23. That’s because even at its point of closest approach to the Earth, the asteroid will be more than 3 million miles away (or, a lot of soccer fields). That’s more than 13 times the distance between the Earth and its moon. ""From an astronomical perspective, that may be close, but from a human perspective, it’s obviously not very close at all; the asteroid is certainly not ‘skimming’ past the Earth, as the story claims,"" said Paul Chados, the manager of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, in an interview.   He added, ""In no way is our prediction a ‘warning,' as the story intimates."" The Wakefield Express is also incorrect in saying that 2016 NF3 ""has been labelled 'potentially hazardous'"" by NASA. Alan Chamberlin, a senior engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told PolitiFact, ""The object is not classified as a PHA (Potentially Hazardous Asteroid) as defined in our CNEOS website."" That’s because the asteroid has too high of an absolute magnitude (a measurement for determining how bright asteroids appear) and is too small of an object to be considered a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid. Both Chados and Chamberlin suggested that the article was misleading and recommended that readers who are concerned about asteroids and other objects possibly striking the Earth look at NASA’s Sentry page. Unlike the close approach database, the Sentry page only lists asteroids ""that have even the slightest chance of colliding with our planet over the next century or two,"" as Chados put it. The Wakefield Express did not respond to a request for comment sent to the editorial email listed on its Contact Us page. A headline on the website Wakefield Express claimed that ""NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth."" NASA has indeed confirmed a large asteroid is heading in the direction of Earth. But the asteroid will not actually do any damage to us. It will stay far, far, far away.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett says that Donna Campbell has called for ending all fderal funding for education
","
Calling his opponent ""too extreme for Central Texas,"" U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, says in a mailer that Republican nominee Donna Campbell ""has called for ending all federal funding for education."" 
We won’t judge whether Campbell’s extreme for Doggett’s constituents. But has she proposed an end to federal education aid? 
Some perspective: Federal aid accounts for a sliver of overall U.S. public school funding. During the 2007-08 school year, such aid totaled $48 billion, which was 8.2 percent of total public school funding, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education. 
The federal slice was slightly bigger in Texas: about 10 percent of the public education budget, according to the center. According to the Texas Education Agency, during the 2007-08 school year, Texas public schools received $4.3 billion in federal aid, amounting to about 9.5 percent of public education funding in the state. 
We wondered if Campbell wants to stop the flow of those dollars. Mike Asmus, a spokesman for Campbell’s campaign, said: ""I’ve not heard her call for ending all federal funding for education."" 
We asked Doggett’s campaign for its back-up. Spokeswoman Amanda Tyler forwarded two video clips. The first, from a Nov. 23, 2009 episode of the Austin public-access cable TV show, ""The Trailer Park Show."" The clip shows Campbell looking slightly out of place in a suit sitting behind a table with a diverse cast of characters. 
""Would you vote to end federal funding for education?"" a man calling into the show asks. 
Campbell responds: ""Federal funding for education? Yes. Because ... it’s a job of the states. Choices need to be put back in the hands of the parents and state."" 
Another man sitting at the table says he thinks that it’s the federal government’s responsibility to educate citizens, which means helping students attend college if they otherwise couldn’t afford it. ""And I strongly believe through financial aid, government should step in there and support these students because they are working hard,"" he says. ""They want to be productive citizens of our society."" 
Campbell responds: ""But government is state also. The states can do it.""Later, she says: ""Do I support education? Absolutely. But it needs to go back in the choices of the parents and leave it with the state."" 
Doggett quotes the first part of that exchange — Campbell saying she would vote to end federal funding for education — in his mailer and shows it in an ad posted on YouTube Oct. 13. 
We e-mailed the video clip to Asmus. He replied: ""Thanks for running this clip past me — having now watched it, I still see the statement on Mr. Doggett’s mailer as inaccurate."" In a later e-mail, Asmus told us Campbell ""has not ‘called’ for anything; she is answering a question. Also, the question does not include the word ‘all,’ nor does her answer."" 
The other clip Doggett’s campaign sent us — also posted on Campbell’s campaign website — shows both candidates talking about federal education aid at an Oct. 19 Bastrop Chamber of Commerce candidates forum. 
According to the clip, Campbell was asked how she would fund education while cutting federal spending. She replied that too many strings are currently attached. ""Why not have money that is from Texas stay in Texas to fund Texas schools?"" she said. ""Why should any Texas money — when we have a good economy within Texas, relative to other states — why should Texas money go to other schools in the nation?"" 
We looked for other instances of Campbell explaining her position on federal education funding when her campaign e-mailed an Oct. 22 statement in which she stands against federal involvement in the schools, saying improvements happen ""best when driven at the local level."" It doesn’t say anything about stemming federal education aid. 
On her campaign website, Campbell also challenges the federal role in education, though we found no call to end federal aid. ""Federal bureaucrats have become too involved in our schools,"" an education issues page on the site says, ""preventing teachers from doing their jobs effectively... I will fight for local educators and stand up against the broken and unaccountable bureaucracy in Washington that is all too willing to experiment with our children’s education. 
In an interview aired Oct. 22 by Austin’s KXAN, Channel 36, Campbell responded to Doggett’s ad: ""Monies that arise from Texas from our taxes should stay in Texas to fund Texas schools, not be sent to Washington D.C. to redistribute that education money. Leave it in Texas."" 
We sought to interview Campbell; Asmus said she wasn’t available. 
And our grade? No question, Campbell said last year she would vote to end federal funding for education. She has not repeated that exact statement. In campaign materials, she advocates against federal involvement in Texas schools, but doesn’t explicitly call for ending federal aid. 
That said, Campbell also has not clarified or backed off on saying she’d vote to end such federal funding. We rate Doggett’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/28/lloyd-doggett/rep-lloyd-doggett-says-donna-campbell-has-called-e/

House candidate Loughlin claims 94 percent of climate-warming carbon emissions are natural
","We all know about the theory of climate change, the idea that the earth is gradually warming because of pollution. Whenever the weather turns particularly hot or cold, we joke about it, often in supportive or derisive terms depending on our opinion on the issue.

Unlike some other Republicans who dismiss global warming, John Loughlin, who is running for Congress in the 1st District, has acknowledged that the climate is changing. However, he said during a September press conference, ""I think the data is unclear as to the extent of man-caused climate change. When you look at the total percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, a good number of them, in fact, the vast majority of them, are naturally occurring.""

He made a similar statement Oct. 19 during a WPRI/Providence Journal debate when challenged on the topic by his Democratic rival, David Cicilline. ""I'm not a scientist but I did work for NASA and when I was at NASA we had a scientist who I actually did some of the press release work for by the name of Dr. James Hansen at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Hansen released a peer-reviewed paper in the '70s that talked about global cooling. And then it's only later that he's kind of gotten a conversion to global warming.""

He went on to tell Cicilline, ""I'm saying really the earth is warming, but it's not conclusively caused by man. It's not conclusive. I mean 94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature.""

When people talk about carbon emissions, they are mostly talking about carbon dioxide, the gas we exhale and the gas plants need to grow. Unfortunately, when levels in the air become too high, it traps heat coming from the sun as part of the so-called ""greenhouse effect."" (Other gases such as methane and ozone also play a role, as do tiny particles known as aerosols.) The warmer air melts polar caps, raises sea levels and shifts ecosystems toward the poles. Plants and animals that can't adapt risk extinction.

Loughlin's 94-percent figure sounds very authoritative and specific. So we emailed Loughlin's campaign on Oct. 21, and called his spokeswoman a day later, to ask for the source. They have not responded.

Meanwhile, we emailed a copy of Loughlin's debate comment to Hansen.

""I never had any global cooling paper or talk or comment,"" he wrote back to us. ""The change of carbon dioxide, the increase year to year is entirely human-made. There is an up-and-down flux caused by vegetation growing (sucking carbon dioxide from the air) and decaying in the winter (releasing carbon dioxide), which is large -- this fluctuation is natural and does not alter the annual mean increase due to humans. He is speaking nonsense.""

So Hansen is saying that 0 percent of the increase in climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions is coming from nature, not the 94 percent claimed by Loughlin.

We still wondered where Loughlin might have gotten his 94-percent figure. So we contacted William F. Ruddiman, author of a widely used climate textbook who is at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

He agreed with Hansen, saying that nature sends a lot of carbon in and out of the atmosphere every year and the sources can be pinpointed because fossil-fuel carbon has a slightly different composition than the carbon that is constantly recycled by nature.

Before the industrial revolution, the atmosphere had roughly 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to Ruddiman. Above-ground vegetation contains about 610 billion tons of carbon and the surface oceans contain about 1,000 billion tons. (There's another 1,550 billion tons or so hidden in the soil and more in the deep ocean, but that doesn't circulate fast enough to play a big role in changes over decades or centuries.)

Each year, the atmosphere and ocean exchange about 75 billion tons; another 100 billion tons go back and forth between the air and the vegetation.

""In those exchanges, the carbon is just moving back and forth in nature and in equal numbers, so there is no net gain to the atmosphere,"" Ruddiman said.

Now add in the pollution generated by humans.

""I think what humans are doing now is something like 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year,"" said Ruddiman. That amount is small compared with the amount shuttled back and forth between the air, ocean and vegetation, and perhaps half of that gets pulled out of the air.

So we did some math. When there's 175 billion tons going into the air from natural sources along with 30 billion tons of pollution (for a total of 205 billion tons), that's 85 percent from natural sources.

The only problem: the 175 billion tons comes back out every year, so when critics say humans are having only a small impact on the process, they are misunderstanding -- or misstating -- the process, Ruddiman said.

""The amount of carbon dioxide humans are putting into the atmosphere is smaller but it's not balanced, and so it builds up over time and it causes a sizable net gain,"" Ruddiman explained.

""It may be 10 billion tons a year but much of it builds up year after year after year,"" he said, and persists in the atmosphere, trapping heat like a chemical blanket.

Scientists who have used a variety of techniques to track earth's changing climate over hundreds of thousands of years have found data that show carbon dioxide levels during that period never grew faster than 30 parts per million per 1,000 years. Yet the level has risen by that amount in just the last 17 years, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international organization widely regarded by the scientific community as a leading authority on the topic.

The result is the warmer temperatures and melting icecaps widely documented around the globe.

And what about volcanoes? People think of them as sending lots of carbon dioxide in the air. It turns out that eruptions are a drop in the bucket, generating 0.2 billion tons annually, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

We also asked Ruddiman about the concept of global cooling, which critics also focus on. The fact is, in the 1970s, geologists were saying earth was coming out of a warm period and destined for another ice age. Core samples taken from the ocean floor combined with other data had allowed them to track the timing of past ice ages as changes in the earth's orbit exposed the planet to varying amounts of sunlight.

But even as scientists were tracking those cycles, which extend over thousands of years, other researchers in the '70s were warning that a carbon dioxide build-up was going to disrupt that cycle and overwhelm the natural cooling trend.

""I remember thinking that probably in one thousand to two thousand years, at most, we would see snow start accumulating in the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere,"" Ruddiman said. ""That was reasonable from what we knew from ice age cycles. What very few of us were aware of was the buildup of carbon dioxide. Most of us are geologists, not geochemists,"" he said, explaining that by the 1980s the problem had become obvious.

""The same people who said, 'If nature remains in control we're going into a glaciation in the next 1,000 or 2,000 years' turned around and said, 'Yeah, but nature's not in control. Humans are intervening much faster than nature can do the job and so we're going into a warmer time,' "" Ruddiman recalled.

""It's been made to sound like scientists are flip-flopping, but it's just the natural evolution of science,"" he said. ""You broaden your point of view as you gain information that changes your conclusions. And that's what happened.""

Ultimately, the Loughlin campaign did not provide any evidence that nature is responsible for the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is the key problem stoking the fears of global warming. And the NASA scientist he mentioned told us Loughlin's comments were ""nonsense.""

There's plenty of room to debate aspects of climate change, such as the best way to prevent climate-related problems, how much money should be spent on prevention, and whether it's worth the investment if other countries aren't willing to seriously limit their carbon emissions.

But Loughlin's suggestion that nature is largely responsible for the looming problem is wrong. We rate his claim as False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/28/john-loughlin/house-candidate-loughlin-claims-94-percent-carbon-/

Rubio claims that among more than 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications, more than half defaulted
","
Foreclosures are a rampant problem in Florida, and the next U.S. senator will be expected to help tackle the national crisis.

In the final debate Oct. 26, 2010, between Florida's U.S. Senate candidates on NBC, moderator David Gregory asked Republican Marco Rubio ""what would you do to solve the foreclosure problem?""

During his answer, Rubio bashed the efforts of the current administration.

""Over 1.3 million temporary work-outs, over half have now defaulted,'' he said.

Gregory clarified what Rubio meant by ""work-outs:"" ""Those are called mortgage modifications?""

Rubio: ""The temporary modifications. There have been 500,000 permanent (modifications). We just found out yesterday of the 500,000 permanent (modifications), 11 percent already defaulted.""

For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore, did Rubio get his numbers right on the larger figure -- have there been more than 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications of which more than half have defaulted?

An Oct. 25 Associated Press article provides some answers. The article focused on comments by Neil Barofsky, special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion Wall Street bailout in 2008 that includes a mortgage modification program launched in 2009. According to the AP, Barofsky concluded that the administration's ""foreclosure-prevention effort has been ineffective in tackling the foreclosure crisis.""

Barofsky issued a 338-page quarterly report about TARP to Congress on Oct. 26, the day of the debate.

The report states on Page 6: ""Finally, the most specific of TARP's Main Street goals, 'preserving homeownership,' has so far fallen woefully short with TARP's portion of the Administration's mortgage modification program yielding only approximately 207,000 ... ongoing permanent modifications since TARP's inception, a number that stands in stark contrast to the 5.5 million homes receiving foreclosure filings and more than 1.7 million homes that have been lost to foreclosure since January 2009.""

Funded through TARP, the Home Affordable Mortgage Modification Program is intended to help prevent foreclosure by modifying mortgages. By the end of September 2010, HAMP spent about $483 million in TARP money.

The report shows a chart on page 74 that 1,369,414 mortgage modification trials had started by the end of September 2010. The chart states that 699,924 trials had been cancelled -- so note that is slightly more than half. The chart doesn't use the word ""temporary"" for any of the trials -- but it is clear that the 699,924 figure refers to temporary because another line on the chart shows that nearly 500,000 trials were converted to ""permanent."" Of those permanent modifications, the majority survived while almost 29,000 were cancelled.

Rubio stated that the more than 1.3 million mortgage modifications were temporary. While all of the more than 1.3 million started out as temporary, about 500,000 became permanent.

Rubio also said that more than half of those 1.3 million had ""defaulted."" But the chart doesn't state that they defaulted -- it says cancelled.

We sent Rubio's claim to Matthew Anderson, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Treasury that oversees the mortgage modification program.

""It is not accurate, however, to say that all canceled trials are the result of 'default,'"" Anderson wrote in an e-mail. ""Trial plans may be canceled for a number of reasons, only one of which is failure to make payments.""

Anderson pointed us to the September 2010 HAMP report that contains data from the largest service providers, which indicates the top three reasons, in order, for cancellation. Anderson listed them for us: ""Borrowers not providing sufficient documentation to servicers, trial plan payment default, or a homeowner who is ineligible because their housing expense is already below the program's 31% threshold."" 

We called and e-mailed Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos on Oct. 27. He sent us back a link to an Oct. 18, 2010, Government Sponsored Enterprises report, a publication done by the Washington, D.C., consulting firm Canfield and Associates. The GSE report stated:

""As of August, only 449,000 borrowers have received permanent modifications through HAMP—34% of the 1.3 million borrowers who have enrolled in the program, while 680,000 borrowers have fallen out of the program (51%).""

That report also stated that through July, incomplete requests (28 percent) and trial plan default (21 percent) were the top two reasons that trial modifications failed to convert to permanent.

Rubio is familiar with the housing crisis personally. An Oct. 22 St. Petersburg Times article about his personal finances stated that Rubio's ""Tallahassee home, which he bought with fellow legislator David Rivera, nearly went into foreclosure before Rivera came up with $9,525 for missed payments and fees. Rubio said the delay was over a dispute with the mortgage company.""

In the final full week of the U.S. Senate race, how did Rubio fare on his numbers about the mortgage modification program? Rubio said ""over 1.3 million temporary work-outs, over half have now defaulted,'' referring to a temporary mortgage modification program. His claim requires some clarification -- of the more than 1.3 million mortgage modifications that started out as temporary, nearly 700,000 in the trial phase were cancelled -- or 51 percent. So Rubio is correct on ""over half"" but wrong to conclude that all of those had ""defaulted."" Defaulting was the second most common reason for cancellation, therefore we rate this claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-among-more-13-million-temporary-mortg/

DSCC claims Linda McMahon tipped off ringside physician about steroids investigation
","
U.S. Senate candidate Linda McMahon's experience as co-founder, along with her husband Vince, of World Wrestling Entertainment has proved to be a double-edged sword on the campaign trail in Connecticut.

While McMahon often touts her experience running the pro wrestling empire to boost her real-world business cred, it also has left her open to accusations that the WWE uses sexist story lines and that there is rampant steroid abuse by some wrestlers.

In the final week of the race -- which pits Republican McMahon against Democrat Richard Blumenthal -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has begun airing an attack ad that attempts to body-slam McMahon for tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into the illegal distribution of steroids to some of the WWE's wrestlers.

""Read this,"" a female narrator begins, as a legal document scrolls in the background. ""It's a memo Linda McMahon wrote. Evidence in a federal trial against her company. McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician who was later accused of hiding evidence. It didn't work. McMahon's ringside doctor was convicted of illegally distributing steroids to her workers. That's Linda McMahon. A bad CEO. A worse senator.""

The memo in question -- marked ""CONFIDENTIAL INTEROFFICE MEMO"" -- was sent on Dec. 1, 1989, by Linda McMahon to Pat Patterson, a fellow executive at Titan Sports, the parent company of what was then the World Wrestling Federation. It became part of the public record as an exhibit in a steroids-related case against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports in the early 1990s.

But the story actually goes back a little further, to an investigation into ringside doctor George T. Zahorian for distributing steroids to some of the WWF's wrestlers.

As the 1989 memo from Linda McMahon explains, a government official let slip at a fundraising event that ""the State of Pennsylvania is probably going to launch an investigation into the use of all illegal drugs including steroids.""

""In addition,"" McMahon wrote, ""this fellow mentioned that he was aware of Dr. Zahorian and his relationship with WWF.""

Zahorian was actually assigned throughout the 1980s to attend WWF exhibitions in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. But following deregulation in 1989, promoters like the WWF were required to hire their own licensed physicians to be present at events. Zahorian was scheduled to be the doctor on hand at an upcoming event in Hershey, Pa., but Linda McMahon's memo makes clear the WWF wanted to distance itself from him.

""Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea,"" McMahon wrote in the memo. ""Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.""

It's that last part, telling Patterson to ""clue him in"" about a possible steroids investigation, that forms the basis for the claim in the campaign ad.

In 1991, Zahorian was charged with distributing steroids to a number of WWF wrestlers (none of whom were charged because, at the time, it was not a federal crime to use steroids, only to distribute them). He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison.

But that wasn't the end of the matter. In the wake of the Zahorian indictment, federal investigators opened a wide-reaching steroids investigation into the WWF. And in 1992, the government filed an indictment against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports, alleging they conspired to ""unlawfully provide WWF wrestling performers with steroids to enhance their size and musculature, and thereby to increase the ticket sales for WWF exhibitions and the profits to Titan and McMahon.""

In its indictment, prosecutors alleged Titan officials learned of a federal investigation into Zahorian's activities and warned him about it. Linda McMahon's memo was entered in the case as Exhibit #2.

According to the indictment, shortly after the memo was sent, ""a Titan executive known to the Grand Jury had a telephone conversation with Zahorian and directed him to destroy any records of Zahorian's contact with WWF or WWF wrestling personnel."" It was later learned from one of Zahorian's attorneys that after Zahorian got the phone call warning him about the investigation, he shipped files on wrestlers to his attorney's office (so they were not part of the evidence seized when investigators raided his office). But according to longtime WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, the files were never destroyed and were later made available to prosecutors.

""Dr. Zahorian didn't destroy anything,"" McDevitt said. ""It was all given to the government.""

In any event, the government's case against Titan and Vince McMahon failed miserably. Several counts were tossed before the case even went to the jury -- including two counts alleging that Vince McMahon and the company distributed steroids to wrestlers such as Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan), because the judge said prosecutors failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York court where the case was filed.

And on the one remaining count, that they had distributed mislabeled anabolic steroids, both Vince McMahon and the company were acquitted. In other words, none of the charges ever stuck.

In an extensive story about the issue in Connecticut's The Day, reporter Ted Mann asked McMahon about the memo.

""I don't pretend to remember to go back, to revisit all the aspects of that case,"" McMahon told The Day. ""It has been tried, acquitted and done with, and WWE has evolved its total health and wellness policy over the years, and I'm sure will continue to evolve.""

According to the story:

When asked if her decision to notify Zahorian had led him to destroy records that might have more thoroughly documented his sale of steroids to WWF wrestlers — as prosecutors in 1994 alleged — McMahon's reply was curt.

""I can't speak to any of that,' she said. ""I have no idea.""

WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said he believes the DSCC ad is misleading, because it suggests by innuendo that Linda McMahon sought to obstruct the government's investigation.

""There were never any charges against Linda McMahon of any kind,"" McDevitt said. ""There was never any charge of obstruction of justice against anybody.""

An indictment is nothing more than an allegation, McDevitt said, and the case ended without a conviction against anyone on anything.

""You can only gain an acquittal in this country,"" McDevitt said. ""That's all you can do.""

Everyone agrees Linda McMahon was never charged with or convicted of anything, including obstruction of justice. But the ad from the DSCC doesn't say she was. The ad accuses McMahon of tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into distributing steroids to their wrestlers. How else could one interpret Linda McMahon's direction in the 1989 memo ""to also clue him (Zahorian) in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.""

It's also true that a government indictment later alleged that, after getting a call from a Titan employee tipping him off to the investigation, Zahorian tried to hide evidence at his attorney's office. But whether Zahhorian tried to ""hide"" evidence may or may not be true. Zahorian sent files to his attorney, but they were not destroyed, and according to WWE's attorney, they were later made available to investigators. Nothing in Linda McMahon's memo suggests she directed the employee to tell Zahorian to hide or destroy evidence. But again, the ad doesn't say she did. The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation. She did, according to her own memo. And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers. We rate the ad True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/dscc-claims-linda-mcmahon-tipped-ringside-physicia/

A chain e-mail attacks ""Vote No on 4"" backers as bulked up on bailout bucks
","
Fact-checking chain e-mails doesn’t often carry twists like a Carl Hiaasen novel. You could say PolitiFact Florida just got lucky.

We recently got our hands on an anonymous chain letter that landed in the in-box of Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact and Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg Times. It delved into the often dense worlds of campaign finance, congressional bailouts and tax policy — then beseeched voters to visit the campaign website of Florida Hometown Democracy.

That’s one of two of main political action committees wielding millions of dollars in their battle over Amendment 4, a Florida constitutional proposal on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot that would put certain land use decisions directly before voters. Most of those millions — $10.5 million, in fact — have been raised by the main ""Vote No on 4"" effort.

This e-mail purported to lift the veil on just whose cash had been flowing to ""Vote No on 4."" The biggest donor, it said, was the Florida Association of Realtors, followed by big home builders. Then came this claim, in all its bolded and underlined glory:  ""Here’s the killer: Many of the companies bankrolling the ad campaign against Amendment 4 are recipients of a congressional bailout, in the form of humongous tax refunds earlier this year."" It later added: ""So, when you see all those dire-sounding, fright-filled TV commercials, remember whose paying for them. You are.""

E-mail forwards are a notoriously unreliable form of campaign rhetoric, so with a big choice looming Nov. 2, we decided to run the ""humongous tax refunds"" claim through the Truth-O-Meter.

First we were curious about the source of the e-mail, since we want to give the person behind a claim the chance to support it. We asked Wayne Garcia, communications director for Florida Hometown Democracy, if it originated with the campaign.

It wasn’t a campaign e-mail, he said — he’d never seen it before. However, the idea was nothing new, and he pointed us to some evidence. The Hometown Democracy campaign made similar claims in a news release on Aug. 12, 2010. It listed major ""Vote No on 4"" campaign contributors such as Pulte Homes, Lennar Homes and KB Home that it said benefited from ""billions in federal bailout money."" Garcia also pointed us to news articles by the New York Times, Reuters and Builder Magazine that explained the tax refunds.

We got to work with a few key questions: Did companies actually get a ""bailout"" in the form of ""humongous tax refunds""? And did evidence about a handful of home builders support the claim that ""many of the companies"" behind ""Vote No on 4"" got a bailout?

A bailout by any other name

First, the bailout question. Any ""rescue from financial distress"" qualifies as a bailout to us. And last year, the National Association of Home Builders did indeed lobby Congress for — and win — a change in tax law that it argued was a ""critical stimulus measure for the U.S. economy"" that would provide ""an infusion of monetary resources for firms struggling to retain workers and undertake economic activity.""

Technically — skip forward a few sentences if this word makes your eyes glaze over — it supported an expansion of the net operating loss carryback period, allowing businesses with losses to carry back deductions for five years instead of just two. As a National Association of Home Builders report explained, ""The carryback option allows businesses to offset prior taxes paid, thereby generating tax refunds to finance ongoing expenses."" A two-year carryback was simply too short for builders, it argued, since many had suffered since late 2005. In a two-year period, it claimed, there wouldn’t necessarily be enough taxable income to offset builders’ financial trauma.

Small businesses had scored this benefit in the stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. But big companies wanted to get in the game. The home builders’ association projected the change was potentially worth billions.

President Barack Obama handed it to them Nov. 6, 2009, when he signed the Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act. A New York Times column proclaimed days later ""Home Builders (You Heard That Right) Get a Gift."" Builder Magazine added up the lucre in February 2010: Nearly $2 billion in total tax refunds for the last three months of 2009.

Not content to rely on secondhand sources, we spot-checked records ourselves, finding references to the new tax benefits in public filings. The general story held up. PulteGroup did indeed report an $800 million boost in fourth quarter 2009. KB Home reported an income tax benefit of $191.7 million, as reported in the Builder Magazine and Hometown Democracy charts. Meanwhile, the fourth-quarter Lennar Corp. number wasn't as easy to come by. While the charts said $251.1 million, Builder Magazine editor John Caulfield told us Oct. 27 that he was looking at the wrong report as he prepared his story. Lennar did say it expected a tax refund for the year of $320 million, though didn't appear to break out a fourth-quarter tax benefit.

We also confirmed ""Vote No on 4"" campaign contributions from builders named in the Florida Hometown Democracy news release. Many were heavy hitters: A query to a Florida Division of Elections database for contributors who’ve handed over more than $100,000 each to fight the direct democracy initiative shows Pulte Homes Corp., Lennar Family of Builders, KB Home and more.

(PulteGroup, for the record, said its commitment to oppose Amendment 4 ""was made in 2009 prior to the receipt of any tax refund."")

Beyond the builders

Florida Hometown Democracy’s August press release broke out just 12 builders as specific examples of companies that benefited from the tax change and contributed to ""Vote No on 4."" It pointed out that private companies wouldn’t have to reveal their tax records.

So we wondered: Would the word ""many"" in the claim hold up under scrutiny?

Well, here’s twist No. 1.

It wasn’t just builders that benefited from the 2009 tax change. We called Steven Friedman, national director of home building services for Ernst & Young, who explained that the carryback provision applied to nearly everyone, companies and individuals alike.

Other than industries with special rules such as finance or insurance — and companies that already benefited from TARP funds — anyone with the appropriate losses and prior taxable income could benefit, he said.

""The point is, this was a very broad-based change in the law,"" he said. ""This was not a rifle shot targeted to Wall Street, to home builders, take your pick.""

We had crunched the campaign contributor data, which showed more than 1,000 contributions to the main ""Vote No on 4"" political action committee, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy. When we pulled out individuals and industry and lobbying groups, such as leading donor Florida Association of Realtors Advocacy Fund, about 430 contributions were left, primarily from companies. The most common self-identified occupations included construction, development and real estate.

Did ""many"" of those companies benefit from the tax refund ""bailout?"" We would have to know whether they had suffered the appropriate losses in 2008 or 2009 and previously had taxable income to offset. We could make an educated guess that it was likely for builders, developers and real estate companies, given the recession, but without intensive research — and likely stonewalls in the case of private companies — we couldn’t know for sure.

The final twist
               
If we could only talk with the originator of the chain e-mail claim, perhaps we would discover a powerful act of database journalism that cross-linked every business that contributed to ""Vote No on 4"" with any refunds supercharged by the 2009 tax law change.

As it was, we were making some leaps — names weren’t usually an identical match. PulteGroup, for example, recorded the $800 million tax benefit. Pulte Homes Group made the $567,000 political donation.

Then we found the author. Well, sort of.

An Internet search on ""humongous tax refunds"" turned up the source, all right: novelist and Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen. But he had nothing to do with the chain e-mail.

Instead, someone had borrowed liberally from his Oct. 9, 2010, column, ""Running scared over Amendment 4."" Hiaasen, who takes shady Florida developers to task in his novels, used this column to shake a finger at special interests for their attacks on Amendment 4. He connected big-builder contributors to those tax refunds. He told his readers: ""These guys are using your money to keep your voice, and your vote, out of the neighborhood planning process.""

PolitiFact Florida got Hiaasen on the phone.

""The tax refunds these companies got were well documented,"" he said. True.

But could he confirm that ""many"" companies that contributed got the bailouts?

""It depends on your definition of many,"" he said.

It would be great if someone would cross-check those contributors with data on tax refunds, he offered. He could do it, just not immediately.

But he had been struck that builders, who contributed to the over-development that brought on the real estate collapse in the first place, had benefited from an act of Congress — and now opposed a measure that would give voters a say in their work.

""When you start taking handouts from the government and then suddenly have enough money to get politically involved at this level, with this much cash going in, I think you need to be accountable, and I think the public needs to know where their bailout dollars are going,"" he said.

But he didn’t have that dreamy database we’d been hoping for.

So what does the Truth-O-Meter make of all this?

First, what we can confirm: Some companies bankrolling the ad campaign against Amendment 4 are recipients of a congressional bailout in the form of tax refunds. 
What no one has yet proved, though it seems likely: ""Many."" 
What we won’t rule on: ""Humongous."" While hundreds of millions of dollars sounds large to us, that’s a value judgment best reserved for opinion columns and novels.

The statement we’re ruling on relies on finding companies that both got and gave, not on establishing a link between the cash flows. We don’t define ""many"" but we confirmed at least ""some"" — just 12 builders represent nearly $2 million for ""Vote No on 4,"" about 18 percent of the money raised. We find it valuable context that companies far beyond home builders, Realtors and developers also benefited from this tax change — even, say, newspaper companies. We rule this claim Half True. Though if Mr. Hiaasen comes up with that magical database, we’d be happy to reconsider. 
UPDATE: John Caulfield, who graciously acknowledged his mistake on a Lennar number, later showed us one of our own errors. Our original post of this item used a year-end tax figure, not a fourth-quarter one, for KB Home. That has now been corrected.",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/chain-email/chain-e-mail-attacks-vote-no-4-backers-bulked-bail/

Robert Dold targets Dan Seals in Illinois race using a talking sea lion
","It's not every day that a campaign ad lands in our inbox and makes us laugh out loud -- especially in the midst of a campaign cycle with commercials featuring Viagra-fueled sex offenders, puppy mass-murderers and roving psychopaths. But the ad aired by Republican Robert Dold targeting Democrat Dan Seals had us at ""broheim.""

It features a charming if foul-mouthed sea lion hired to film an ""endorsement"" for Dan Seals. Seals (not the sea lion) is running for the Chicago-area seat being vacated by Rep. Mark Kirk, the Republican nominee for Senate. With a slight Democratic edge and a moderate, suburban vibe, the 10th District is one of the rare GOP-held seats that's actually in play for the Democrats this year. In fact, political handicapper Charlie Cook rates it Lean Democratic, meaning that Dold, even though he's a Republican running in a Republican year, is airing the ad as a slight underdog.

Perhaps that's why the Dold campaign went for an ad with potential for buzz. In any case, the script is so priceless that we'll reprint it in its entirety here:

Narrator: ""And now, a very special political endorsement.""

Sea lion: ""Dan Seals is a proud resident of the 10th District.""

Director (voice off-screen): ""Actually, he's not.""

Sea lion: ""What, he's not?""

Director: ""Cut!""

Sea lion: ""Dan Seals is a tax fighter.""

Director: ""No, he's all about raising your taxes and increasing government spending.""

Sea lion: ""Aaargh! For real, broheim?""

Sea lion: ""Dan Seals is a fresh new candidate.""

Director: ""Nah, he's run like two times already and lost. I think he was running since before there were, like, iPods.""

Sea lion: ""What the -- ?"" (Bleep)

Sea lion: ""Look, if you want common-sense leadership in Congress, lower taxes and more jobs, just vote for Robert Dold.""

Sea lion (to director): ""All righty, arf-arf. Where's my fish treat?""

Closing jingle: ""It's Dold with a 'd,' not an 'e.'""

We like the ad so much that we feel a bit guilty subjecting it to the Truth-O-Meter. But subject it we must.

We could have looked at the question of whether Seals lives in the district or not. (A local media outlet in the district reported that Seals lives ""a block and a half outside the district boundary."" Meanwhile, the same article notes questions about Dold's own history of residing in the district. The Constitution only requires that a candidate live in the state where the election is being held.)

But we didn't. Instead, we're looking at the burning question of whether the spokesmammal was correct when he said that Dan Seals was running for office ""before there were, like, iPods.""

We first looked at Seals' biography. He has indeed run (and lost) for Congress twice before -- in 2006 and 2008. Prior to that, he worked in a variety of corporate and policy jobs, including a position in the U.S. Commerce Department and as an economics fellow in the U.S. Senate. Seals was clearly a policy-wonk in training, but none of these positions involved electoral politics, so we won't count them as positions in which he was ""running."" Even assuming that Seals started campaigning actively a year or more before the 2006 election, that would only peg the beginning of his career as a candidate to 2005.

What about the iPod? Well, we located a Newsweek cover featuring Apple co-founder Steve Jobs holding the music player that's dated July 26, 2004. (Doesn't it look bulky?) So the iPod clearly existed well before Seals began to run for office. We found the original news release for Apple's initial unveiling of the iPod on Oct. 23, 2001. And units were on sale beginning on Nov. 10, 2001, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. So, versions of the iPod were on sale for three to four years before Seals began running for office.

When we ran our findings by the Dold campaign, spokesman John McGovern replied, ""This ad is intended to be light-hearted and a tongue-in-cheek response to the relentlessly negative tone of the Seals campaign. All cultural references are intended to be humorous and casual.""

Having waded through so much muck while reviewing this year's campaign commercials, we're all for light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek. And as you have probably picked up, we love this ad. But sometimes the Truth-O-Meter has to exercise tough love. So, as much as we love the pinniped, the ad got it wrong about the iPod, so we rate it, like,  False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/robert-dold/robert-dold-targets-dan-seals-illinois-race-using-/
"['Federal Budget', 'History', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Eric Cantor tells Jon Stewart that U.S. spent more in past two years than previous 200
","
During an Oct. 12, 2010, visit to Comedy Central's Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., made a striking statement.

""What you've seen (in Washington),"" he said, ""is a crowd that has taken advantage of a crisis back in late '08, early '09 and spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined, in the two years since.""

On the show, Stewart didn't challenge Cantor's claim, but we will.

We first turned to historical tables from the Office of Management and Budget. One table, conveniently enough, details federal government spending since the birth of the modern Republic in 1789.

We first looked at federal spending for 2009 and the estimate of spending for 2010. Combined, federal spending in those two years amounted to a little more than $7.2 trillion.

We didn't have to add up all 200 years -- you only have to add together 2006, 2007 and 2008 to reach $8.3 trillion, which exceeds the $7.2 trillion of 2009 and 2010. So by that measure, Cantor is wrong.

Want to use the data for 2010 and 2011 instead, under the assumption President Barack Obama was completely in charge for those budget years? Fine. Using those two years ups the total to a bit under $7.6 trillion. The three years before that by themselves total $9.2 trillion. So Cantor is wrong that way, too.

What about using projected spending based on the course set by the Obama Administration and the Democratic Congress? Not even bending the rules to include the period 2009 to 2015 would do it. Outlays for the 2009-2015 period increases the cumulative amount of federal spending to about $27.3 trillion. Exceeding that amount only requires combining the federal spending from 1995 to 2008 -- a period of 14 years, not 200. So he's still wrong.

What if Cantor misspoke, substituting ""spent more money"" for ""created more debt""? We did that calculation with the help of a different OMB table.

The increase in public federal debt between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010 has been almost $3.5 trillion. But the debt from the nation's birth through the end of 2008 was $5.8 trillion. So Cantor isn't right that way, either.

When we asked Cantor's staff about it, they tried to move the goalposts. They told us Cantor was actually referring to the debt that will be added by 2015. That would be $8.2 trillion, which exceeds the $5.8 trillion debt accumulated between the birth of the republic and the end of 2008. (Actually, to make the numbers work, they only need to go as far as 2013, which would be the last budget assembled during President Barack Obama's first term.) But even though this number ""works,"" it's not what Cantor said on the show. He didn't say debt, he said spending. And he said ""in the two years since,"" when his staff later claimed he was actually referring to a seven-year period.

Economists we spoke to on the left and the right agreed with our analysis and pointed out a few other problems with Cantor's claim.

• Inflation. We used raw dollars, not inflation-adjusted dollars. But since a dollar is worth far less today than it was in the early 1800s, you can't genuinely compare dollar amounts from then to dollar amounts from today without making a mathematical adjustment. But if you did make that adjustment, it would take Cantor's claim even farther from the truth.

• How do you assign responsibility for spending increases? As much as Republicans like to blame Obama and the Democratic Congress for the boom in federal spending, a sizable chunk of current spending was set on its course because of actions taken under President George W. Bush and the Republican Congress (such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit). This doesn't mean Obama and the Democratic Congress bear no responsibility for the rise in spending. They just don't deserve all the blame.

• Does the comparison actually mean anything? From year to year, the economy grows, and so does population. It's only natural that as the size of the population grows and more money is available to spend, more money will be spent in an absolute sense. A more relevant comparison would be whether spending has grown disproportionately compared to the size of the economy. And as it happens, that would have provided Cantor with a striking statistic. According to OMB, the public debt will have risen from about 40 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2008 to about 64 percent at the end of 2010 -- an increase by more than half over just a two-year span.

But back to his words. He said that in the past two years, Democrats ""spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined."" That's wrong no matter how you slice it. And it's not just wrong -- it's ridiculously false. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

Cicilline ""argued against Megan's Law and voted against mandatory registration of sex offenders""
","
A new round of attack ads in the race to replace U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy is not a product of one campaign or the other; it comes from a little-known political organization known as Americans For Common Sense Solutions.

On its website, the group describes itself as a local operation run out of downtown Providence.

Christopher Stenberg, named on the website as the group's executive director, did not return multiple calls, nor could we find any office affiliated with his name at several Westminster Street addresses.

The group registered in July with the Internal Revenue Service as a 527 non-profit organization. It has not registered with the Federal Election Commission which would be required if it were supporting a particular candidate.

But its strongly worded advertisements on TV and radio leave no doubt about the organization's disdain for Democrat David Cicilline, who is running for the seat against Republican John Loughlin.

In the radio spot, a woman's voice says:

""Even though Republicans and Democrats fight about almost everything, they didn't fight about this. Except David Cicilline. As a state representative, David Cicilline argued against Megan’s Law and voted against mandatory registration of sex offenders.

""We don't know why David Cicilline took a position to protect sexual predators and we don't know if he will argue or vote against other common sense legislation if he becomes a congressman.""

Megan's Law is the colloquial name for state laws that require the police to provide information to the public about sex offenders. That includes mandatory registration of sex offenders and notification to residents when a sex offender moves into the neighborhood.

The law was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old who was raped and murdered in 1994 in New Jersey by a convicted sex offender who moved to her neighborhood after being released from prison.

The statutes governing Megan's Law differ from state to state.

In 1996, Rhode Island lawmakers took the existing sex offender registration law, which required convicted offenders to register with local police departments, and added language requiring police to notify the community. That vote took place while Cicilline, now the mayor of Providence, was still a state representative.

So how did he vote? The short answer is, he was one of three representatives who voted against it.

But Cicilline's campaign now says the candidate opposed the bill because it applied to teenagers as well as adults.

In other words, ""if a 13-year-old touches another 13-year-old, he could be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life,"" Eric Hyers, a Cicilline spokesman told us.

To say Cicilline ""argued against Megan's Law"" is ""a disgusting and vile claim"" if you don't explain that his objections were limited to one particular section, Hyers said.

It's difficult to verify what prompted Cicilline's no vote nearly 15 years ago.

A Providence Journal story on the issue indicated that Cicilline indeed spoke up about his concerns that adolescent offenders would face long-term consequences. He was quoted as saying ""I don't know that it will do anything to protect our children"" from molesters.

The General Assembly did not start videotaping its sessions until several years later and the legislative Journal from that day merely says Rep. Cicilline engaged in a debate about the bill, without providing details.

The bill's journey did not end there. Three years later, in 1999, Megan's Law was amended to limit community notification to adult offenders, thereby carving out an exception for teenage offenders, the group Cicilline had concerns about.

This time, the Providence representative voted in favor of it.

When the law was further altered in small ways two more times during Cicilline's tenure in the legislature, in 2000 and 2002, he again voted in the affirmative.

The record shows that Cicilline voted against Megan's Law when it first passed. But his later votes suggest that he either had a change of heart, or, as his spokesman tells us, he found the bill more palatable once teenagers were excluded.

The ad from Americans for Common Sense Solutions is misleading. It doesn't mention what Cicilline's objections were to the original law, nor that he subsequently voted in favor of it three times.

PolitiFact's definition of a Barely True statement says it ""contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""

That sounds right to us. Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/americans-commonsense-solutions/cicilline-argued-against-megans-law-and-voted-agai/
"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Reid Ribble']","
Republican House candidate Reid Ribble says he lost his health insurance and doctor because of federal health care reform
","
When it comes to federal health care reform, for many the biggest concern is the most personal one: Can they keep their doctor?

During the fierce debate over the proposal, President Barack Obama repeatedly assured voters they could keep their doctors. Now comes Reid Ribble, a Republican challenging two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen (D-Appleton) in a swing seat in northeastern Wisconsin.

He’s got a bone to pick with the president.

This was the headline on a recent news release: ""Reid Ribble losing doctor, health insurance provider because of Obamacare.""

""I lost my health insurance and doctor because of Obamacare,"" Ribble says in the release. ""If I am elected to Congress, I will go to Washington to make sure no one else loses their doctor because of Obamacare.""

That’s a powerful claim.

And it could be potent, because Kagen -- who voted for the health care reforms -- is an allergist, prefers to be addressed as ""Doctor"" and includes ""M.D."" after his name on his official Congressional website.

Let’s take a look at what happened.

Ribble is chairman of The Ribble Group, which owns two Fox Valley roofing companies. Ribble says he sold the business last year to a relative, but an earlier PolitiFact Wisconsin item  could not fully establish that was a fact. In any case, he remains chairman and a paid consultant.

And he is covered by its health insurance carrier, Principal Financial Group.

In September of 2010, Principal -- a Des Moines-based Fortune 500 company -- announced it was getting out of the health insurance business.

Over the next 36 months, Principal will turn over coverage to UnitedHealth Group Co., one of the country’s largest health insurance providers. The change affects some 14,000 employers who provide coverage to 830,000 employees.

For more than a decade, Ribble’s doctor has been N. Carter Noble, an Appleton-based family care physician who is part of the Affinity Medical Group. Principal has a coverage agreement with Affinity; UnitedHealth does not have an agreement with Affinity.

Ribble’s coverage with Principal ends Dec. 31, 2010.

That means Noble will be out of network if Ribble is covered by UnitedHealth. This is the central point cited in the campaign’s news release.

So is Reid Ribble -- and presumably thousands of other Principal customers -- an early victim of health care reform?

Hardly.

Officials with Principal Financial told PolitiFact Wisconsin the decision was made because the company is primarily involved in retirement and asset management -- not health care.

The company has $284.7 billion in assets under management, serves 18.9 million customers worldwide, and employs some 14,000 people. Health insurance generates about 3 percent of the company’s revenues, a percentage that is shrinking as other areas grow.

""The medical business continues to be one that undergoes rapid change, which would mean investing additional capital into the business to be able to offer competitive products,"" Principal’s chairman and CEO Larry D. Zimpleman said at the time of the announcement. ""For us, that just does not make sense.""

A Principal spokeswoman, Susan Houser, said Ribble should not blame health care reform for the company’s decision: ""In addition to strategic fit going forward, we considered a number of other factors (including the regulatory environment), but our strategy and ability to invest in our growing businesses was the real driver. Our decision certainly did not hinge on (health care) reform, but it was among many factors.""

In fact, Susan Voss, the Iowa State Insurance Commissioner, said, ""The issue of their leaving the health insurance market has been under review for almost a decade.""

Congress gave final approval to health care reform and Obama signed it into law last spring. Some provisions have kicked in already, while others are years away from taking effect. The provision that requires employer-provided insurers to spend at least 80 percent to 85 percent of their premiums on coverage takes effect in January 2011.

The company’s decision got pulled into the national health care discussion after comments from another executive, Dan Houston, president of Principal’s retirement, insurance and financial services businesses. He told the Wall Street Journal that health care reform will make it more difficult for small insurers to compete.

Here’s what the Journal wrote:

""In the past, scale hasn’t mattered,"" said Mr. Houston. ""But with administrative costs getting the focus,"" the company would have to grow significantly to stay in the business.

The New York Times called Principal’s decision ""another sign of upheaval emerging among insurers as the new federal health law starts to take effect."" The story quoted two health care experts -- Len Nichols from George Mason University and Robert Laszewski, a consultant in Alexandria, Va. -- as saying more small insurers are likely to take similar steps.

That may play out.

But nowhere did it say that Principal was getting out of the business solely because of health reform, as Ribble suggests.

So where does this leave Ribble?

After all, he certainly isn’t the first consumer to have to figure out his medical care because companies changed coverage.

The Ribble Group -- or Ribble on his own --  could choose another insurance carrier, one that includes Affinity in its network. Affinity has its own insurance company, Network Health Plan, and also accepts patients covered by Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield.

Ribble could continue to see his doctor, but presumably pay more because he is out of network.

Or, once the changeover is completed, Ribble could change doctors.

Where does that leave us?

Ribble says he lost his insurance and his doctor because of federal health care reforms -- a great line for voters. But a line just the same. Principal Financial Group says it made a decision to get out of the insurance business, which made up 3 percent of its revenues -- a share growing ever smaller as other aspects grew. What’s more, the decision was under consideration for years before Obama and his health reform plan came along.

Ribble isn’t losing his insurance, his ability to get insurance or even, to be technical about it, his doctor. He and The Ribble Group have choices available -- including an insurance carrier run by his favored health care system.

His statement forces us to call for the burn unit: Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/reid-ribble/republican-house-candidate-reid-ribble-says-he-los/

Back to Basics group says Rick Perry is diverting hurricane aid to remodel the Governor's Mansion
","
Back to Basics, the political committee that's poured money into ads critical of GOP Gov. Rick Perry, reminds Texans of Hurricane Ike in a TV spot linking hurricane aid to the reconstruction of the Governor's Mansion, which was heavily damaged in a 2008 arson fire.

Perry, the narrator says, ""doesn't want to explain why he took money away from hurricane victims.""

Say what? ""Here's what he did,"" the narrator says in the ad that debuted online Oct. 13. ""After begging for federal hurricane aid, Perry is taking millions of it to remodel the Governor's Mansion so he can move in faster. Diverting disaster funds for himself.""

In an online post, Back to Basics says the claim that Perry's taking millions in hurricane aid is based in part on a May 2009 news article in The Houston Chronicle and an Oct. 2, 2010, column by humorist John Kelso of the Austin American-Statesman.

The Chronicle article said state lawmakers at that time were poised to spend $11 million in federal stimulus funds on mansion repairs.

But stimulus money did not get allocated to the mansion project after all. Rather, as Kelso's recent column says, about ""half of the money for the mansion project originated as money that the feds provided to Texas to reimburse the state for its upfront emergency expenses for Hurricane Ike. Follow the money: $11 million from the feds was shuffled from the Department of Public Safety to the State Preservation Board to help pay for the $22 million mansion remodel.""

The spending directive, House Bill 4586, was unanimously approved by the 2009 Legislature and signed into law by Perry. It authorizes up to $11 million in ""reimbursements received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency"" to be spent on ""costs associated with the restoration of the Governor's Mansion.""

Separately, a Sept. 24 American-Statesman news article -- which Back to Basics refers to at the start of its ad -- quotes John Sneed, executive director of the State Preservation Board, saying that because the $11 million earmarked for mansion repair was federal aid, the mansion repair project wasn't hit by the 5 percent budget reduction state leaders (including Perry) have sought  from agencies. (Sneed told us in an interview that he never termed the money federal aid; rather, he said, he said it was reimbursement money.)

Takeaway: Legislators and Perry agreed to spend $11 million in federal reimbursements for hurricane assistance on mansion repairs.

But is that Perry taking aid away from hurricane victims to hurry the mansion work? 
To gauge that, we followed the money.

For starters, we learned, the Texas Department of Public Safety spent state dollars responding to Hurricane Ike, which lashed Texas in September 2008. It appears that its spending was later covered by a transfer of $145 million from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. In a February 2009 letter, leaders including Perry authorized the transfer of HHSC funds to the DPS ""for the purpose of reimbursing emergency preparedness and response expenses incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike."" The letter says the funds were available because the federal government failed to approve the state's waiver request for an effort to help low-income working Texans obtain private health coverage.

DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange told us via e-mail that the DPS has spent nearly $106 million reimbursing vendors, cities and counties for Hurricane Ike expenses, while also returning $25 million to the HHSC. Mange said about $112 million has been set aside by FEMA to cover expenses the federal agency decides are eligible for reimbursement.

Big picture: State spends more than $100 million in state money on hurricane. Federal government covers eligible expenditures--and state lawmakers earmark some of that reimbursement money for the mansion work.

As we explored this history, we realized the ticklish issue for the Republican-led Legislature and Perry may have been the spectre of spending federal aid appropriated by the Democratic-controlled Congress with the support of the Democratic president, Barack Obama, on the mansion occupied by the Republican governor. Hence, Texas legislators dropped the idea of spending stimulus aid on the mansion project.

State Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, recently acknowledged as much. In an Oct. 5 interview with the American-Statesman editorial board, Ogden said: ""We didn't want to basically hard-wire (the mansion funding) in such a way that critics could say you used federal funds to rebuild the mansion. So we moved the money around.""

Allen Spelce, spokesman for the Texas state comptroller's office, told us the $11 million is considered state revenue because it made up for state-originated expenditures. Spelce pointed out too that the 2010-11 state budget shows no federal money going to the preservation board; its budget has two entries referring to the $11 million for the mansion work as general revenue, meaning state money.

""It's different,"" Spelce told us, ""than if this was some kind of federal grant, which is typically what you think of when you talk about federal funds.""

Katherine Cesinger, Perry's deputy press secretary, echoed Spelce, saying: ""It's not being utilized for disasters, it's a reimbursement. You're splitting hairs here.""

We ran these interpretations past Back to Basics, whose executive director, Cliff Walker, insisted that the federal aid being used on the mansion was ""originally intended to go toward reimbursement of those local communities and the public-assistance first responders"" who helped victims of the hurricane. He also sent an e-mail stressing Sneed's September reference to the $11 million as federal aid.

""As federal hurricane public assistance funds, then why have these dollars been used for the mansion? FEMA makes it clear that public assistance dollars are to be used to rebuild communities,"" Walker said. He referred us to a FEMA web page on the agency's Public Assistance Grant Program, which it says ""provides supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities and the facilities of certain Private Non-Profit (PNP) organizations.""

Our attempts to explore this with FEMA didn't yield an immediate interview.

Our take: Whether the FEMA reimbursements to Texas amount to federal aid or not, the statement that Perry is ""taking money away from hurricane victims"" and diverting it to the mansion project is wrong on two fronts. First, FEMA set aside the money to cover agency costs already incurred in response to the hurricane; no victims are bereft as a result, far as we can tell. Secondly, the assignment of the funds to the mansion work was made by state lawmakers; Perry didn't earmark any money alone.

We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/back-basics/back-basics-group-says-rick-perry-diverting-hurric/

State Rep. Matt Patten, Democrats tout pay cut vote, fiscal responsibility
","
Pigs can fly, and politicians can vote to cut their own pay.

That's the message from House Democrats. They’re using a vote on a bill that purported to cut salaries of General Assembly members by 5 percent to bolster a number of their Statehouse candidates. Holding onto those House seats is critical for Democrats this election as they cling to a 53-46 edge over Republicans.

Typical of the advertisements is a mailer sent out by Rep. Matt Patten, a Strongsville Democrat locked in a tight re-election battle with Republican Mike Dovilla. The mailer announces in large lettering, ""Why I voted to cut my own pay.""

Patten explains in the mailer that he voted to cut the pay of state employees, but also took a hit in his own wallet.

""Unfortunately everyone needs to cut back in these tough economic times,"" he says in the mailer. ""That's why I voted to cut my own pay along with the pay of our state employees.""

House Democrats around the state are citing this vote in a number of races, so we decided to take a closer look at this claim.

The pay cut was actually a Republican idea before Democrats seized it. Rep. Seth Morgan, a Dayton-area Republican, included the 5-percent pay cut bill idea as stand-alone measure in House Bill 210, which was introduced on June 9, 2009.

That bill went nowhere for months. Democrats latched onto the idea in October 2009 and inserted the 5-percent pay cut plan into a measure that delayed a 4.2 percent state income tax cut for all Ohioans.

The so-called freeze on the income tax cut provided $844 million the state needed to shore up its budget, which had a hole in it after legal wranglings halted a plan to raise revenue by allowing slot machines at Ohio's horse tracks.

Republicans saw the freeze as a tax increase, so the bill containing the freeze and the pay cut passed on a mostly partisan vote. Only two Republicans joined all 53 Democrats in voting for it. Later, the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate stripped the provision from the legislation, so it never actually became law.

So Patten and the other House Democrats did vote to cut their own pay, right? Not so fast, dear reader.

A section of the the Ohio Constitution actually prohibits members of the General Assembly from changing their own pay.

The bill analysis done by the non-partisan Legislative Service Commission spells this out very clearly. ""Because, however, Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section 31 prohibits changing the compensation of General Assembly members during their terms of office, the 5-percent reduction in salary and supplements will not affect officers and members who are currently holding office,"" reads the analysis.  

""This portion of the bill goes into effect on the 91st day after the bill is filed with the Secretary of State and the pay changes apply only to those members whose terms of office commence on or after January 1, 2011,"" it concludes.

House Democrats argue that the lawmakers making this claim intend to be back in the next legislature session -- if they are re-elected.

""No one is claiming this who doesn't intend to come back to the legislature and serve,"" said House Democratic Caucus spokesman Keary McCarthy.

Maybe so, but the fact remains that the pay cut was for the members of the next legislature. Patten and the others didn't actually vote to cut their own pay, but instead cut the pay of whomever holds their seats in 2011.

PolitiFact Ohio has rated as False claims that accuse lawmakers of raising their own salaries when the pay increases didn’t take effect until the next term of office. The rationale was that if a legislator has be re-elected before being eligible for the pay raise, there is no guarantee that they would ever see the money. We ruled in those cases that voters actually granted the pay raise when they sent them back for another term.

That same rationale applies here. Patten and other House Democrats are making an issue out of a vote that purported to cut lawmakers’ pay by 5 percent. 
Therefore, we find this claim to be false.",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/matt-patten/state-rep-matt-patten-democrats-tout-pay-cut-vote-/

Deal said Barnes opposed bill against child abusers
","
This year's gubernatorial rivals are spending the campaign's precious last days accusing each other of abetting evildoers.

Democrat Roy Barnes said in a TV commercial that in 1991, Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal fought to weaken laws that protect rape victims. We ruled the accusation Half True.

In response, Deal fired off a press release that said in 1995,Barnes opposed a bill that would have helped put child abusers behind bars.

The release, ""Barnes ads tell despicable lies,"" said ""Barnes voted against a bill in the state Senate that would have made it easier to gain convictions in child abuse cases.""

Election Day is Tuesday, when Barnes and Deal face off against Libertarian John Monds.

So, did Barnes side with villains?

Deal spokesman Brian Robinson pointed to failed state Senate Bill 124, which would have allowed types of hearsay evidence to be used during trial in cases of child ""sexual conduct or physical abuse.""

Barnes spokesman Emil Runge said his candidate opposed the bill in 1995 because he thought it was unconstitutional.

Barnes was in the state House of Representatives when it came up for vote. Deal was serving in the U.S. Congress.

Hearsay evidence is often not allowed in court. But in 1995, state law had an exception for child abuse cases.

Then, if a child under 14 were to confide in another person about being sexually or physically abused, that other person could testify about what the child said to him.

SB 124 would have let hearsay enter into evidence in a new situation: if a child told another person he witnessed a third party being sexually or physically abused.

State Legislature records confirm Barnes voted against SB 124. Versions passed both the House and Senate, but it died after the two chambers failed to agree on its final language.

That's when things get cloudy.

Although SB 124 never became law, the change it pushed for did. The bill's language was added to that year's successful House Bill 155, which created a central registry of the state's suspected and confirmed child abusers.

Although Barnes opposed the change HB 155 made to hearsay evidence rules, he supported the bill because he thought creating the registry was important, Runge said.

In March 1998, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that the change in hearsay evidence rules was unconstitutional.

There was no rational reason for the law to treat defendants whose cases included hearsay evidence from children under 14 differently than those with hearsay evidence from older children, it decided.

The court ruled there was no rational reason for the difference, which meant the law violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection before the law.

(Ironically, that same month, the state Supreme Court also struck down the child abuse registry. They decided it violated due process rights because it included the names of people who had never been charged with a crime.)

Barnes' current explanation for his 1995 vote is consistent with statements he made during his successful 1998 bid for governor.

During that primary, fellow Democrat Lewis Massey issued a press statement that said the vote was evidence Barnes ""has repeatedly sided with criminals against law-abiding Georgia citizens,"" according to a July 1998 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

""To say you voted against something because you thought it was unconstitutional, that's not a legitimate excuse in my opinion,"" Massey added.

Barnes replied that the bill would have created more problems in the future.

""When you pass an unconstitutional act, then those who are convicted under that law go free. That law was unconstitutional, and it was the politics of grandstanding rather than governing,"" Barnes was quoted as saying.

Robinson argued that the judges in the state Supreme Court cases were partisan. Plus, whether or not SB 124 was unconstitutional was a matter of speculation during the General Assembly vote.

Furthermore, Barnes should have supported a law that's tough on crime to send a message to criminals that their actions won't be tolerated, Robinson argued.

Indeed, the law's constitutionality was not a sure thing in 1995, but if you agree with Robinson, it doesn't necessarily follow that Barnes opposed a bill that would have made it easier to convict child abusers.

Because the bill's language did become law, we got to see what would have happened if SB 124 had succeeded. And what happened is that the bill made things harder for prosecutors down the road. The state Supreme Court declared those changes unconstitutional, which means that prosecutors had to handle appeals from criminals convicted under that law.

Since the constitutionality of the bill was not certain in 1995 and Barnes did vote against it, there is a sliver of truth to Deal's accusation. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Therefore Deal's claim meets our definition of Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/27/nathan-deal/deal-said-barnes-opposed-bill-against-child-abuser/
"['Oregon', 'Campaign Finance', 'Jeff Merkley']","
Jeff Merkley accuses Scott Bruun of supporting secret corporate financing of attack ads.
","
As anyone watching all the television ads knows, freshman U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., faces Republican Scott Bruun in Oregon’s 5th Congressional District. In a fundraising letter on behalf of Schrader last month, U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley describes Bruun -- without naming him -- as a big-bank-loving, middle-class-hating Republican. The letter contains this line: ""No wonder Kurt’s opponent has said he supports allowing corporations to secretly funnel millions of dollars to front groups to finance attack ads.""  

Secretly funnel millions? Front groups? Attack ads? It all sounded so very Dr. Evil. PolitiFact Oregon was all over it.

Bruun, in line with most other Republicans, supports the U.S. Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (January 2010). The ruling loosened restrictions, allowing corporations and unions to spend as much money as they want directly from their treasuries to support or oppose a candidate. Before, donations had to come from employees or union members through a political action committee. Also before the ruling, corporations couldn’t spend any money on campaign ads -- the ones that urge a vote for or against a candidate -- within 60 days of a general election.

In general, Democrats call the Citizens United ruling a slap to grass-roots democracy.
Republicans, who get lots of contributions from corporate interests, say there should be no limits on speech. (The majority held that First Amendment protections should apply to corporations as well.)

Asked for evidence that Bruun ever said such a thing, the Merkley campaign offered his response to a question about the Citizens United decision from the League of Women Voters of Oregon guide: ""Free speech is messy, noisy and uncomfortable for some. Of course the alternative to free speech is much worse. Political ‘speech’ is the most important form of speech for a free, open and tolerant society. The Supreme Court has ruled and Congress should leave it alone.""

Nothing there about ""secret"" millions or ""front groups."" In fact, Bruun never said any such thing. But we wanted to know if the sentiment behind Merkley’s statement was accurate.

In other words, is it fair to say that you favor secret donations to front groups to pay for attack ads if you think Congress should leave Citizens United alone?

Citizens United expanded the amount of money allowed and how it can be used, but it was the final nail in a bout of hammering. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court started allowing corporate money into elections by letting groups, including corporations, spend money to run ""issue advocacy"" commercials. The decision in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life struck down a portion of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.

And let’s not discount the roles of federal tax law and federal enforcement of elections communications in allowing donations to remain secret. First, the IRS tax code allows 501(c) nonprofit groups to shield donor names even as it allows politically minded nonprofits to engage in political speech. (To compare, political groups identified under IRS tax code 527 must disclose regularly.) Second, the FEC requires disclosure only of corporate money earmarked for ""electioneering"" -- which few companies do.  

It’s true there’s been much more money dumped into elections this year, with a lot less disclosure. A Washington Post analysis found that less than half of the total third-party spending this election was disclosed with donors’ identities.  

""Nothing is greater than the Citizens United decision in opening the floodgates,"" said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. The nonprofit consumer advocacy group,  based in D.C., has urged Congress to pass a disclosure law to fix the ruling.

In fact, a host of nonpartisan groups interested in open government called for the same. The national League of Women Voters issued a call earlier this month for television stations to reject ads paid for with secret money.

Marge Easley, president of the League of Women Voters of Oregon, wanted to make clear that the nonpartisan group favors neither candidate in the 5th District. But she added that if a candidate is ""not in favor of disclosure of campaign funding, then that means they are in favor of keeping things secret.""

So is Bruun in favor of secrecy or disclosure when it comes to campaign spending? Significantly, Bruun does oppose the Disclose Act, which would have required groups to name donors behind commercial ads.

Bruun’s campaign spokeswoman Alee Lockman wrote in e-mails that Bruun supports ""transparency & reporting in campaign finance"" but disagrees with the way the Disclose Act ""is set up.""

""He is, of course, open to bipartisan discussions about campaign finance regulations, but as he is not in Congress yet, he can’t speculate on what hypothetical legislation he may or may not be presented with,"" she wrote.

Bruun has said he favors Oregon's system, which has no limits on contributions but requires full disclosure of donor information. 
In sum, as over the top as Merkley’s statement may be, PolitiFact Oregon finds it to be Half  True.

Alex Sink claims Rick Scott said he wants to do away with state DCA
","
The Florida Department of Community Affairs, the state's growth management agency hated by developers, is one of the smallest state agencies. But the DCA became a big point of contention in the Oct. 25, 2010, gubernatorial debate between Democrat Alex Sink and Republican Rick Scott.

During the debate at the University of South Florida televised on CNN, Sink said, according to the transcript:

""Well my opponent has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs. It’s the one state agency that holds local governments accountable for the dealings they have with developers. That’s why we have Amendment 4 on the ballot because people were so frustrated about these out-of-control developments. I oppose Amendment 4 because I think it would be a job killer. But we cannot do away with our Department of Community Affairs, which is the only organization that handles growth management in Florida. He would just hand Florida over to development, to just go wild and that’s not what Floridians want.""

(Amendment 4, which is also on the ballot Nov. 2, would give voters the right to vote on adopting or amending local land-use plans.)

Scott responded: ""Let’s go back to the last question on DCA. I have not said that I would eliminate DCA. What I would do is go back to the original purpose of DCA. My opponent is an Obama liberal. She thinks people in Tallahassee can tell local communities exactly what they ought to do. Let’s look at what’s happened across our state. You can go all across the state and developments have been killed by all the regulation, all the paperwork. In fact you have to go to three or four agencies. I’ll give you an example. Down close where I live (in Naples), Ave Maria University was recently built. Just in permits, just — not any building — just for the land, 78 permits, took years to do. DCA has killed jobs all across this state. We need to go back to the original purpose.""

In this Truth-O-Meter we will explore, has Scott said ""he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs?""

First, some background on DCA that we found in an Oct. 8, 2010, St. Petersburg Times article about Scott's criticism of the state agency, and from our Oct. 26 interview with DCA secretary Tom Pelham.

Created in 1969, the agency reviews growth management decisions by cities and counties and distributes federal grants for neighborhood revitalization and other programs. DCA has a budget of about $315 million -- about $27 million is state money and the rest is federal -- and about 220 employees. About 57 employees work in the growth management section.

""The next governor will be forced to slash costs to cover an estimated $2.5 billion shortfall, but wiping out the DCA won't help much,'' stated the Oct. 8 article. ""That's because about 10 cents of every dollar it spends comes from state taxes.""

The article paraphrased Pelham saying that the agency is necessary to mediate growth disputes between adjoining local governments and to review large development projects for their impacts on roads and other services.

Proposals to eliminate DCA have surfaced frequently, but the agency has survived. But does Scott want to wipe it out entirely?

We looked for comments Scott had made about the DCA in the campaign.

• In a Sept. 18 Pensacola News Journal article about Scott campaigning alongside Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Scott was quoted as saying: ""Amendment 4 would kill jobs, and like the DCA (Department of Community Affairs), it would slow down everything.""

• In the Oct. 8 St. Petersburg Times article, Scott didn't say if he would get rid of DCA or how he would change it -- he was only quoted as criticizing it: ""On the campaign trail, I'll tell you the one that everybody's fed up with. It's DCA. It's really impacted people that want to build things. Their attitude is, 'How can somebody in Tallahassee tell my local community what we want, and DCA sits there and tells us we can't do it?' … I'll tell you, it's really killing jobs.""

• A columnist wrote in the Florida Times-Union Oct. 12: Scott ""wants to do away with the Department of Community Affairs, the state agency that at least provides some review of land use changes."" But columnist Ron Littlepage didn't attribute or explain his claim. He told us in an e-mail that he based his column on the Oct. 8 St. Petersburg Times article.

• Charles Pattison, president of the environmental group 1000 Friends of Florida, wrote in a column Oct. 13 in the Gainesville Sun that ""According to recent news reports, gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott would support eliminating the state's land planning agency, the Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA). He claims, 'It's really impacted people that want to build things.... It's really killing jobs.' "" Again, no details showing Scott said he would eliminate it.

We also looked at Scott's campaign website. Under a headline ""Reduce Government Spending"" Scott wrote: ""A 5% reduction in the state workforce will save almost $300 million"" -- but again, no specifics about the DCA.

We asked Pelham directly if he had heard Scott say that he wants to eliminate DCA.

""What we've heard is what was indicated in the ... St. Pete Times article in which he says DCA is really killing jobs, and everybody is fed up with DCA, etc.,'' said Pelham, who served as DCA secretary between 1987 and 1991 and was appointed again in 2007. ""I don't recall reading anything where he used the words we should eliminate DCA.""

We also asked Pelham whether the ""original purpose"" of DCA had changed, since Scott said he wanted to return to that original purpose.

The agency changed dramatically over the years -- at one point it also encompassed Veteran Affairs and programs dealing with juvenile justice, Pelham said. Florida didn't have the growth management act until 1985, which led to DCA overseeing the growth management office. Pelham was brought in to do that when he served as secretary from 1987 to 1991. Prior to that act, there was a division of state planning that oversaw a much weaker act that didn't give the state authority to reject comprehensive plan amendments but only give recommendations, Pelham said.

If Scott wins the election, he can't simply shut down DCA. Eliminating the agency would require a vote by the Legislature and eliminating its functions or assigning them to other agencies, said Pelham.

Pelham disputes Scott's claim that DCA is ""killing jobs"".

DCA reviews proposed amendments to comprehensive plans. Since 2007, DCA has approved more than 90 percent of those amendments for 700,000 acres in land allowing an increase in residential development potential of more than a half-million units and an increase in non-residential development capacity of 1.4 billion square feet, Pelham said.

""How anyone could say DCA is killing jobs is beyond me,"" Pelham said. ""It's an irresponsible statement -- not supported by facts. I challenge anyone to show me one job the department has killed. When we say 'no,' none of our decisions are final. They are subject to appeal.""

Rejected applicants can appeal to an administrative law judge, then the governor and cabinet and then the district court of appeal.

""We don't have final decision-making authority on anything,"" he said.

He said his department may reject land-use amendments, for example, when people propose large developments in the middle of wetlands or that pose safety concerns.

""It's not DCA that killed jobs,"" Pelham said. ""It's the national and international global economy that has crashed.""

On Oct. 26, the morning after the debate, we contacted Sink's campaign by e-mail and asked for evidence that Scott said ""he would do away with"" the DCA. The Sink campaign sent us back quotes from the same newspaper articles or columns that we had already found.

We interviewed Sink campaign spokesman Dan McLaughlin who did not point us to any proof that Scott ""has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs."" But McLaughlin said in an interview that Scott has sent a ""clear signal"" that the department should be returned to its ""original purpose"" which wasn't about growth management. Scott's comments, McLaughlin said, ""set against the background of a very extremely conservative Legislature and sunsetting of the department that would come up in the first year of the next governor's administration, it is our belief it is totally accurate with Rick Scott as governor the DCA would go away. He has said he does not want it existing in its current form.""

(The ""sunsetting"" refers to a review by the Legislature -- earlier this year the Senate voted to let the DCA survive but the House failed to act, leaving it in limbo for now. The St. Petersburg Times article stated that Rep. Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, the incoming House speaker, says he wouldn't mind seeing the DCA disappear.)

We also contacted Scott's campaign and asked for his plans for the state agency.

Scott consultant Donna Arduin said that Scott has said he will ""put all regulations to a freeze and review plan so he could determine whether or not the benefits are worth the cost,"" but he hasn't said he would get rid of DCA.

By returning DCA to its ""original purpose,"" Scott meant ""we need to make sure development meets environmental standards rather than killing jobs.""

We also asked Arduin to explain what Scott meant about the DCA ""killing jobs."" She said that some potential investors decide not to come to Florida because they determine the ""length and expense of the process they must go through in Florida that other states don't have. They have to pay for consultants, lawyers, lobbyists. They have a time delay to go through the process. Even if they have a 90 percent chance of getting approved, they have now added a huge expense and delay to the potential of investing in Florida."" And for investors who do proceed with development here, if they didn't have to spend money to go through the DCA process, they could use that money for other jobs, she said. She didn't have any examples of investors who turned away.

Was Sink correct to claim that Scott ""has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs?"" Sink's campaign has not produced evidence that Scott made that statement and the burden of proof is on her to back up her attack made in the final full week of the campaign. Scott has clearly criticized the agency, saying it has been ""killing jobs,"" but during the debate he denied saying he wanted to eliminate it. Scott's campaign repeated his denial but didn't provide specifics for his plans for the DCA. So other than a review, Scott's plan for the agency, if he wins, remains a mystery. Still, without evidence that Scott said it, we rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2010/oct/26/alex-sink/sink-claims-scott-said-he-wants-do-away-state-dca/

Ed Perlmutter voted for Viagra for sex offenders, paid for by health care bill? Nope
","
A new campaign ad makes the startling claim that the new health care law will pay for Viagra for rapists -- and that Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., voted for the measure.

The ad shows two young women chatting online about the new health care bill. Here's how their conversation goes:

""Hey, you have to check out the article I just sent you. Apparently convicted rapists can get Viagra paid for by the new health care bill.""

""Are you serious?""

""Yes. I mean, Viagra for rapists? With my tax dollars? And Congressman Perlmutter voted for it.""

""Perlmutter voted for it?""

""Yup. I mean, what is going on in Washington?""

""In November, we need to tell Perlmutter to repeal it.""

The ad is from American Action Network, a conservative advocacy group organized as a 501(c)4, which means it does not have to disclose its donors. Its chief executive officer is Norm Coleman, a former Republican Senator from Minnesota. Its president is Rob Collins, a former chief of staff to House Minority Whip Eric Cantor.

Perlmutter did vote in favor of final passage of the health care law. But did Perlmutter vote for Viagra for rapists? The short answer is no.

Here's the long version:

The health care law affects nearly every part of the health care system. It increases regulations for health insurance companies, reins in future costs in the Medicare program for seniors, expands the Medicaid program for the poor and creates new tax breaks so that individuals and small businesses can purchase insurance with partial government subsidies.

It's this last measure that health care opponents have connected back to Viagra for sex offenders. Starting in 2014, some people will get tax credits to help them buy insurance policies. The credits are available to anyone who qualifies by having an income of between 133 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four in 2010, that ranges from $29,327 to $88,200, and for a single person, it's $14,403 to $43,320. They'll have to buy their policies through government-sponsored exchanges, which will set rules so that insurers offer standardized policies.

During the final negotiations for the health care law in the Senate, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., pointed out that because anyone can qualify for the tax breaks, it's possible that sex offenders will buy insurance policies with government subsidies. And they might ask for and be prescribed Viagra. That means tax dollars will be subsidizing Viagra for sex offenders, Coburn concluded.

It's actually an issue that's come up before, though in a different context. In 2005, the federal government had to direct states to make sure that sex offenders were not being prescribed Viagra while on Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor. (Press reports indicated it was happening.) During the 2010  debate, Coburn asked the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service about whether the health care law had any specific clause to prevent similar problems. The service issued a memo concluding that it did not. 

So Coburn offered an amendment that would ""reduce the cost of providing federally funded prescription drugs by eliminating fraudulent payments and prohibiting coverage of Viagra for child molesters and rapists and for drugs intended to induce abortion."" 
But by the time the Senate took up the amendment on March 24, 2010, it was late in the process. The bill's sponsors said any changes, no matter how small, could effectively kill the bill, so they opposed Coburn's amendment for procedural reasons. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., urged his colleagues to reject the amendment, saying, ""This is a serious bill. This is a serious debate. The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of the Senate, the debate and the American people... It is a crass political stunt aimed at making 30-second commercials, not public policy."" The amendment failed, 57-42, and the president signed the law six days later. Now, nearly seven months later, the commercial has turned up. 
We want to emphasize that the Viagra amendment came up in the Senate. Perlmutter is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. He never got the chance to vote one way or the other on the amendment.  
The Perlmutter campaign was not amused by the ad's claims, calling them ""blatant lies."" 
""It's so illogical it would be like saying the bill allows Martians masquerading as humans to see a proctologist,"" said spokeswoman Leslie Oliver in a statement.  
American Action Campaign e-mailed a factsheet that says by virtue of voting for final passage for the health care bill that did not include the anti-Viagra amendment, he was voting for Viagra. The ad itself flashes an editorial from the Washington Times, headlined ""Obamacare's Viagra giveaway."" The editorial said the Senate should have voted for the Viagra amendment and questioned whether Democrats were sincere in their procedural objections. 
We should note that the use of taxpayer dollars for sex-offender Viagra remains a hypothetical. While CRS concluded that there was nothing in the current law to stop it from happening, the earliest it could start is in 2014 -- so there's time for lawmakers to act or for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to write regulations to stop it from happening. 
Finally, whatever taxpayer subsidies for sex offenders might materialize after 2014, they would not go to all sex offenders -- only to sex offenders who get health care through the exchanges and who also qualify for subsidies.

We've looked at similar claims made against U.S. senators and rated the claims Barely True. But this claim is different. The House never voted on the sex offenders amendment. Perlmutter never voted on it either. So we rate the statement the statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/oct/26/american-action-network/viagra-sex-offenders-paid-health-care-bill-nope/

Alex Sink faces her own fraud charges at CNN/St. Petersburg Times gubernatorial debate
","
One of the most heated exchanges between Rick Scott and Alex Sink at their third and final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 25, 2010, centered on fraud.

But it was Sink, not Scott, in the hot seat.

After Sink brought up Scott's time running Columbia/HCA and the hospital company's convictions and $1.7 billion in fines for defrauding Medicare and Medicaid, Scott turned the tables on the former bank executive.

""Look, you want to talk about fraud. Let's talk about your job at NationsBank,"" Scott said. ""Your tellers were paid kickbacks, your tellers in your bank were paid kickbacks for directing elderly consumers from ...""

Scott stopped in mid-thought because he saw Sink smiling.

""You want to smile about it?"" Scott asked.

""Am I going to have an opportunity to respond?"" Sink turned and asked the moderators, CNN's John King and the St. Petersburg Times' Adam C. Smith. But before King or Smith could answer, Scott pressed on.

""Let me finish and make sure you understand what the issue is. Your tellers were paid kickbacks -- OK. Your tellers were paid kickbacks for -- OK, you think it's funny for these seniors that you sent from safe deposits to risky ones,"" Scott said. ""All right, you were sued -- your bank was sued and you paid fines. That's called fraud. So I have a whole list -- you want to talk about fraud, I can give you a list of them.""

We've examined in detail Scott's time and role in the fraud investigation at Columbia/HCA, so we thought it fair to delve into Sink's banking background, and the allegations of fraud at NationsBank -- which is now Bank of America.

Sink, the state chief financial officer, is a banker by profession. She came to Florida in 1989 and became president of NationsBank Florida in November 1993. She served in that role until early 1998, when she became president of the bank's private client group. In 2000, NationsBank merged with Bank of America. Sink left Bank of America that same year in an executive shake-up.

The roots of the allegations Scott is talking about stretch back to 1994 and originate in Florida.

That year, a stockbroker with a NationsBank subsidiary, NationsSecurities, went public with what he described as an orchestrated nationwide scheme to get bank customers to move investments from safe, federally insured accounts to more risky brokerage and mutual funds.

Florida-based NationsSecurities broker David Cray said the bank and its securities arm intentionally blurred the lines between its traditional banking business and its securities business and misled customers into thinking those securities investments were protected by the bank or the federal government. The scheme permeated the entire bank, Cray, and later others, said. Brokers were given sales scripts to try to convince bank customers to move their money into more risky securities.

A NationsSecurities senior manager said employees should use the phrase ""SPR"" which stood for ""safety, predictability and return"" when discussing the mutual funds, according to the findings of a subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. A sales script the company used said the investments provided ""certainty in an uncertain world,"" and NationsSecurities branch managers also encouraged employees to ""use fear to sell"" securities. In one orientation sales meeting, a manager suggested that a broker could ask customers: ""Is this your risky money or safe money? If this is risky, I know a guy at Merrill or Dean Witter.""

NationsBank helped NationsSecurities by providing brokers lists of customers with Certificates of Deposit about to mature, according to the SEC's findings.

Why was the bank pushing the mutual fund investments and its securities side business? According to Cray and others, NationsBank received lucrative fees for the mutual funds its subsidiary managed.

The allegations led to a class-action lawsuit against NationsBank of Florida, NationsSecurities and others, from investors who lost money by unknowingly making the risky investments, which in the end lost money. Along with the SEC, the Department of Justice also opened an investigation. 
The results of those investigations support Scott's claim that bank tellers were being paid for referring customers to the securities side of the business.

The SEC concluded that NationsBank tellers were provided incentives to refer customers to NationsSecurities stock brokers. If the NationsSecurities broker got a customer to buy into the mutual fund, the teller who made the referral would receive a 5 percent commission. ""In some instances, bank employees substantially increased their monthly compensation during this period by making referrals to NationsSecurities,"" the SEC found.

The SEC fined NationsSecurities $4 million in 1998 for its role in misleading bank customers.

NationsBank ended up paying civil fines of $6.4 million and $6.75 million to the federal government in 2000 and 2002, and another $8.1 million to 2,230 investors nationwide. No criminal charges in the case were filed, according to the St. Petersburg Times.

We should note, that despite Scott's suggestion, the scheme wasn't crafted solely for elderly customers. The investments were sold as being safe for anyone, including the elderly, brokers were told to say. The Securities and Exchange Commission did find, however, that more than half of the eventual investors were over 60.

Sink said she had nothing to do with the mutual fund scheme. The companies NationsBank and NationsSecurities were managed separately, though NationsBank allowed NationsSecurities representatives to sit in desks at bank lobbies where they would appear to look like bank employees. Sink also says the lawyer who brought the class-action lawsuit would back up her story. We explored that claim in another item, which you can read here.

But in this case, we're drilling down on what Scott said.

He said that Sink's ""tellers were paid kickbacks for directing elderly consumers from ... safe deposits to risky ones."" While Sink was state president of NationsBank, bank tellers in Florida were being paid a 5 percent commission for directing bank customers to bank-related stock brokers. The stock brokers were then selling riskier investments under the guise that they were protected either by the bank or the federal government. We rate this claim is True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/26/rick-scott/alex-sink-faces-her-own-fraud-charges-cnnst-peters/

Alex Sink says lawyer backs up claims she didn't know about NationsBank investment scheme
","
In their third and final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 25, 2010, Rick Scott and Alex Sink traded accusations that each has been party to fraud.

Sink again hammered Scott for his time running Columbia/HCA and the hospital company's convictions and $1.7 billion in fines for defrauding Medicare and Medicaid. But this time Scott countered with allegations that Sink was the president of NationsBank operations in Florida when that company was accused of fraud and forced to pay government fines and settle a class-action lawsuit.

Unlike Scott, Sink said she had what amounts to a get-out-of-jail-free card.

""That case, the lawyer that brought that case -- it was a class-action case against another company -- he even has said publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didn't know about the problems,"" Sink told CNN's John King and the St. Petersburg Times' Adam C. Smith, the debate's moderators. ""What more can I say?""

In a separate item, we dealt with Scott's accusations. You can read that item, here. In this fact check, we'll explore Sink's rebuttal.

Some quick background about the case. In 1994, while Sink was president of NationsBank's Florida operations, a stock broker with bank subsidiary NationsSecurities came forward with what he described as an orchestrated nationwide scheme to get bank customers to move investments from safe, federally insured accounts to more risky brokerage and mutual funds.

NationsSecurities broker David Cray, who worked in Florida, said the bank intentionally blurred the lines between its traditional banking business and its securities business and misled customers into thinking those securities investments were protected by the bank or the federal government. The scheme permeated the entire bank, Cray, and later others, said. Brokers were given sales scripts to try to convince bank customers to move their money into more risky securities.

NationsSecurities branch managers encouraged employees to ""use fear to sell"" securities. In one orientation sales meeting, a manager suggested that a broker could ask customers: ""Is this your risky money or safe money? If this is risky, I know a guy at Merrill or Dean Witter.""

And NationsBank helped NationsSecurities by providing brokers with lists of customers who had Certificates of Deposit about to mature.

The bank and stock brokers pushed the mutual funds because they received more lucrative fees, Cray said.

The allegations led to a class-action lawsuit from investors who lost money by unknowingly making the risky investments, which in the end lost money. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission also began investigations. Eventually, NationsBank and NationsSecurities settled the investigations, agreeing to pay $8.1 million to investors in 2002, paying civil fines to the federal government of $6.75 million in 2000 and $6.4 million in 2002 and $4 million to the SEC in 1998. No criminal charges were ever filed.

Sink says the lawyer who started the case, Jonathan Alpert of Tampa, has said Sink had nothing to do with the scheme.

Here's what Alpert told the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald in October when previously asked about Sink's role in selling the risky investments.

""Alex Sink could've done nothing about it. It was run out of Charlotte,"" said Alpert, referring to NationsBank's headquarters. ""I know she knew what was going on -– that investments were being sold in the bank -- but that's it. And she was powerless to stop it, anyway. I had e-mails where the state presidents were being told what to do, that they had to help the securities people. They would dig into customers bank accounts to identify people who had enough money to buy securities. 
""Charlotte said: 'This is what's going to happen in your bank lobbies and this is the way it's going to be.' They didn't say you're going to do A, B, C and D, they would say the bank cooperates fully with NationsSecurities,"" Alpert said. ""If Alex Sink were involved in it, it would be a wonderful story for the gubernatorial election. But she didn't know anything about it.""

Alpert, who said he voted for Sink, said she no doubt knew that riskier investments were being sold in the bank, but that she was likely not aware of the way brokers were manipulating customers to close the sales. 
And Sink has previously told the Times she ""had no authority or control"" over the securities sales. ""There were very, very strict firewalls between any kind of securities and brokerage operations and operations of commercial banking,"" she said.  
Those ""firewalls,"" Sink said, were the result of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law that separated commercial and investment banking. (The act was repealed in 1999.) But that didn't prevent Sink from finding out what was going on in her bank, noted Yale University finance expert Jonathan Macey. ""She's the state bank president,"" he said. ""She has the authority and perhaps the responsibility to know what's going on in her lobby."" 
The original whistle-blower in the case, former NationsSecurity broker Cray, said, ""I would tend not to point the finger at Alex Sink for this."" 
Which brings us back to her statement. At the CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate Sink said that the lawyer who brought the case against NationsBank said ""publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didn't know about the problems."" We think Sink is mostly quoting the lawyer in the NationsBank case, Jonathan Alpert, accurately. 
Alpert said Sink wasn't involved in the deceptive selling of more risky involvements through NationsSecurities and didn't know anything about the deceptive practices being employed. The companies NationsBank and NationsSecurities were managed separately. But Sink did know securities were being sold in her banks, and was in a position to voice questions or concerns about the practice if she sensed anything was being handled inappropriately. That's enough of a connection in our minds to knock this claim down one notch, and rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/26/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-lawyer-backs-claims-she-didnt-know-/
