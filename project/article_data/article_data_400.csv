Ted Cruz: most GOP candidates 'publicly embraced amnesty'
","On one of the biggest issues in the 2016 Republican primary -- immigration -- Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was nothing if not consistent during the second GOP presidential debate. Cruz, angling to be the primary field’s most hard-line candidate against illegal immigration, said at the CNN Reagan Library debate, ""A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty."" That was similar to something he said at the first debate, held in Cleveland and aired by Fox News in August -- that ""a majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty."" We checked that claim and gave it a rating of Mostly True. The stages were similar for the two debates, with the addition of former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina in the second debate. Does Cruz’s claim hold up? As we noted in our previous fact-check, the tough part of checking this claim is that ""amnesty"" is a vague term. Some consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements. Cruz has been adamantly opposed to a pathway to citizenship, but he’s been quiet on whether he would support some other legal status for illegal immigrants. We’ve previously found that in modern politics, the standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, supported and signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law allowed illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents if they met certain standards, such as proving they had been in the country for several years and paying back taxes and a fine. After meeting other requirements, the legal permanent residents could apply for a green card and eventually make their way toward citizenship. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. We do know Cruz considered the 2013 bipartisan Senate immigration proposal to be a form of amnesty and opposed the bill. The failed bill was similar to the Reagan law in that immigrants had to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status that put them on a path to citizenship, though the requirements are more stringent than the previous law. So we’ve used that bill as a rough standard for evaluating the positions of those who shared the debate stage with Cruz. We’ll also note that since Cruz used the past tense -- ""previously and publicly embraced amnesty"" -- we’re only interested in whether the candidates have taken this position in the past, not whether they do now, or whether they have gone back and forth on the policy. Three members of the debate field have expressed outright support for the Gang of Eight bill, so called after the bipartisan group of eight senators who proposed it in 2013. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., by Cruz’s standards, has been a clear supporter of amnesty, as he was a member of the Gang of Eight. At the time, he said the bill was ""not amnesty,"" and we rated that claim Half True because of the vague nature of the term ""amnesty."" Since then, Rubio has softened his support for a path to citizenship and emphasized border security, but he still supports passing immigration legislation. Fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, the former governor, said in March 2015 that he would put his support behind a Gang of Eight-style immigration bill that included a path to citizenship. Like Rubio, though, Bush insisted at the debate that his position is not amnesty, because his ideal plan requires illegal immigrants to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status. Recently, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has avoided saying whether he would support a path to citizenship, though he has suggested he would not blanket deport all illegal immigrants. But in 2013, asked by Fox if he would side with Cruz or the Gang of Eight, Huckabee said he would choose the latter -- though he emphasized an eventual immigration bill had to emphasize border security. He has also previously endorsed a path to citizenship. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., did not support the Gang of Eight bill because he said it did not include strong enough provisions for ensuring reduced illegal immigration in the future. But in a March 2015 speech, Paul walked a fine line, supporting a path to some sort of normative legal status, though without using the word ""citizenship."" For the remaining candidates, we could not find their opinions on the Gang of Eight bill specifically, but all four have at some point said they supported a path either to citizenship or legal status, even if their position has since changed. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker no longer supports a path to citizenship, but he said in 2013 that ""it makes sense"" people could not only stay in the United States but get citizenship after overcoming penalties, waiting periods and other requirements. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson has declined to comment on the Gang of Eight bill. He has said that the solution for illegal immigrants currently in the United States is for them to go back to their home country, where they can apply for a visa and return legally. In Carson’s 2012 book, America the Beautiful, he said a path to citizenship is a moral choice. In 2010, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he supported a ""common-sense path to citizenship."" But this year, he said he’s changed his mind and no longer supports such a path. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said in 2014 and 2015 that he isn’t keen on a path to citizenship, but he’s open to the possibility -- especially because you can’t deport everyone who is already here, and it would help get lawmakers to a point of compromise on immigration legislation. Despite his fiery rhetoric regarding Mexican immigrants, real estate mogul Donald Trump hasn’t said many specifics about what he’d do regarding the illegal immigrants already here. He has said this year that he would support a ""merit-based"" system for some illegal immigrants earning their right to stay, echoing comments he made in 2011. Finally, the newcomer to the main debate stage -- Fiorina -- has also stated publicly that she is open to a path to legal status for at least some undocumented immigrants. In a June 2015 appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, she said, ""I think legal status is a possibility for sure. I think their children maybe can become citizens."" Our ruling Cruz said at the second Republican debate, ""A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty."" We’ll reiterate that many of these candidates have changed their position on what to do about undocumented immigrants already in the United States, and we’ll note once again that the definition of ""amnesty"" isn’t hard and fast. So what Cruz may consider amnesty might not be what any of these candidates considers to be amnesty. Still, as far as we can tell, Cruz is the only one on the CNN debate stage who has never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or some other form of legal status. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/sep/17/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-most-gop-candidates-publicly-embraced-amn/

Jeb Bush said Donald Trump wanted casino gambling in Florida, got told 'no'
","During the second GOP debate, Jeb Bush said that Florida stood up to Donald Trump when he tried to bring casino gambling to Florida. Here is part of their testy exchange: Bush: ""He wanted casino gambling in Florida -- "" Trump: ""I didn’t -- "" Bush: ""Yes, you did."" Trump: ""Totally false."" Bush: ""You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to -- "" Trump: ""I would have gotten it."" Bush: "" -- casino gambling before -- "" Trump: ""I promise, I would have gotten it."" Bush: "" -- during and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody."" Trump: ""I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it."" Later, Bush added, ""When he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no."" Trump: ""Wrong."" Did Trump ask to bring casino gambling to Florida, and did Florida under Bush shut him down? Trump’s history on casino gambling in Florida Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to provide any evidence to refute Bush’s claim. A spokeswoman for Bush referred us to a Sept. 1 CNN article headlined ""Jeb Bush: the man who killed Trump’s casino dreams."" News reports from the 1990s show that Trump helped finance Bush’s campaign and the state Republican Party during Bush’s 1998 bid for governor -- while Trump was seeking to open casinos in Florida. Trump held a 1997 fundraiser, which reportedly raised $500,000 for Bush when he ran for governor, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. As the race continued the next year, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts donated $50,000 to the Republican Party of Florida, when Trump was pushing the state to allow him to open casinos on Seminole tribal land. The tribe was seeking to open Vegas-style slot machines and poker in casinos, to be managed by Trump.  Trump backed a 1998 Seminole proposal to state officials to share gambling revenue with Florida. He also hosted a Seminole leader on his vacation estate that year, reported the Tampa Bay Times. Bush, meanwhile, was already known as an opponent of gambling because he had served on the board of No Casinos, a group that organized a few years earlier to fight casinos in Florida. State Republicans said at the time that donations from gambling interests had no bearing on the party’s agenda. ''It's not like our people say, 'You give us $ 50,000, buddy boy, and this is what you're gonna get,'' said Bob Sparks, Republican Party spokesman, according to a 1998 Sun-Sentinel report. ''Both Jeb Bush and the party have expressed no interest at all in expanding gambling."" Bush took office in 1999 and maintained his stance on casinos. ""I am opposed to casino gambling in this state, and I am opposed whether it is on Indian property or otherwise,"" Bush told the Tampa Bay Times in 1999. Bush also threatened to sue to prevent gambling in the state. In 2005, Bloomberg Business wrote a story about Trump’s failed attempt to bring casinos to Florida and his falling out with his consultant Richard T. Fields. (Bloomberg Business drew information from court filings. In 2004, Trump sued Fields in Broward County Circuit Court, and Fields intervened in the bankruptcy of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc.) From Bloomberg Business: ""Fields negotiated on Trump's behalf with the Seminoles to build and manage casinos on tribal property. Fields maintains in court documents that Trump was only interested in building ‘Class III’ casinos, offering pure games of chance, such as slot machines, craps, and roulette. When Florida Governor Jeb Bush nixed the idea, ‘Trump directed that the effort be terminated entirely,’ Fields's filings say. ""But Fields says Trump gave him the green light to try on his own. That's backed up by an affidavit signed in August from Mallory E. Horne, a lobbyist hired by Trump. Horne testified that he told Trump and Fields in late 1998 that Florida officials wouldn't budge. According to Horne, Trump replied, ‘That's the end of it,’ then told Fields: ‘If you want to try this on your own, Richard, that's fine, but I'm through with it.’ "" Our ruling Bush said of Trump, ""When he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no."" We didn’t find that Trump directly petitioned the state for gambling, but there’s a pile of evidence that Trump was pursuing a deal to operate casinos on Seminole land in Florida. And at the same time, Trump gave money to Bush and the state party during Bush’s 1998 race for governor. Trump said it was ""totally false"" that he sought casino gambling and failed, but we find that Bush has the better part of this fight.

Trump: Walker turned a $1 billion surplus into a $2.2 budget shortfall
","The CNN moderators aimed to get the Republican presidential candidates to go head-to-head in the second GOP debate and the contenders complied. Frontrunner Donald Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker got into verbal tussle over who had a worse fiscal track record. Walker charged that Trump had taken four projects into bankruptcy. Trump fired back that Walker had ruined his state’s budget. ""You were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state,"" Trump said. ""You lost 2.2 (billion). You have, right now, a huge budget deficit. That’s not a Democratic point. That's a point. That’s a fact."" Trump is partly right on the money, but he’s mixing apples and oranges, and his use of the word deficit is problematic. PolitiFact Wisconsin covered much of the ground before. The rules By law, Wisconsin’s two-year budgets must be balanced -- revenue equalling expenditures. So, unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can never run an actual budget deficit by borrowing money that piles up as debt. That said, the state does various projections of what revenues and expenditures will be for the upcoming two-year budget cycle. Those projections can show a surplus or a deficit -- although ""deficit"" is more accurately termed a projected shortfall, since there is no actual red ink. But the two figures he cited were projections that received plenty of attention when they were made. The two figures In January 2014, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected Wisconsin would see a surplus of about $1 billion by June 30, 2015 -- the end of the 2013-15 budget cycle. At the time, revenues were coming in higher than expected. Walker and the GOP-run Legislature adopted a series of tax cuts later in 2014, making good on a Walker promise to return such surpluses to taxpayers, but drawing criticism for not using the money for other purposes, such as boosting the state’s rainy day fund. Along the way, however, tax collections grew at a slower pace than had been projected.   By November 2014, there was a reversal of fortune: Walker’s own Department of Administration projected a $2.2 billion shortfall for 2015-17. Once again, that figure was not an actual deficit. Indeed, even as a projected shortfall it was overstated. That’s because the standard for projections made in the months leading up to the next budget cycle is to include all the funding requests made by state agencies -- even though, in reality, those requests always get trimmed. That serves to temporarily inflate the actual picture. In the end, the 2015-17 budget approved by the Legislature and signed by Walker in July 2015 was balanced -- just as every other Wisconsin state budget is. Our ruling Mixing apples and oranges, Trump said that under Walker, ""You were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state. You lost 2.2 (billion). You have right now a huge budget deficit. That’s not a Democratic point. That's a point. That’s a fact."" There was in early 2014 a projection of a $1 billion surplus heading into the 2015-17 budget period. Late in 2014, there was a projection of a $2.2 billion shortfall -- the difference between expected revenues and the amount of money being requested by state agencies. But the shortfall was never a deficit -- and some of the surplus was consciously spent by Republicans, as tax cuts. Trump’s statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Hugh Hewitt says fall sports sap public interest in GOP primary
","Fox News crushed past audience numbers with the first Republican presidential debate. Now CNN has its shot to match or beat the 24 million viewers that tuned in for round one. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt will be part of the CNN panel firing questions at the candidates, and Hewitt argues that they’d better do well now before the American public begins tuning out. ""Someone needs to break out of the pack if they're going to catch up to Donald Trump,"" Hewitt said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 13, 2015. ""So, they got to throw some long balls. The NFL starts this weekend. It's going to quickly subsume a lot of the attention span of the country. So, this is really the last opportunity for the 10 not named Donald to try and make themselves the alternative to Donald Trump."" In an op-ed titled ""Why Wednesday’s GOP presidential debates will matter,"" Hewitt made a similar point. ""The arrival of tailgating and of fall temps will also drop the temps of the campaign rhetoric,"" he wrote. ""Competition sets in for the Trump Show, and it won’t come from Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker. It will come from SportsCenter."" We wondered if fall sports really does drive down interest in politics. We ran the question by Hewitt, live on his radio show, and he said it stands to reason that interest in politics will suffer because people have a finite amount of time to consume media. ""If we look at the fact that the NFL is by far the most popular sport, the ratings for the World Series, especially when they feature the Cleveland Indians are very very high, therefore it must stand to reason that there is less time for politics because we spend so much time on sports,"" Hewitt said. ""My proposition, and it’s merely my argument, is it has to be true that Americans have less time to spend on politics between now and Christmas then they have had up until this point."" In terms of hard information, however, the polling data undermines Hewitt’s assertion. Going back to 2007, the Pew Research Center has been asking people if they follow various news stories ""very closely, fairly closely, not too closely, or not at all closely."" One of the stories the interviewers list is the election. They would do this nearly every week, with a hefty sample of over 1,000 people. Here are the trends in 2007 and 2011 (at this point in the election cycle four and eight years ago) for people who said they followed election news very or fairly closely:  Source: Pew Research Center via Roper Center for Public Opinion Research There are some ups and downs by a handful of percentage points, but overall, about 45 to 55 percent of the public (depending on the year) said they were following the election, with perhaps a slight increase through the season. The surveys took place in slightly different weeks but both years saw dips during October. The one in 2011 happened to coincide with the World Series (the St. Louis Cardinals won in the seventh game). In 2007, it was around the period of the American League Championship Series. Whatever might explain the sudden drops, interest recovered immediately. Hewitt discounted the Pew data because it gets at his point indirectly. ""Unless they ask the specific question, ‘Does your political consumption go down as your football consumption goes up’, you are guessing,"" he said. We couldn’t find a political scientist who specifically studied whether football and baseball reduce Americans’ appetite for politics. One analyst of public polling, Thomas Holbrook at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said he has no hard data, but he’s skeptical of the premise. ""I do doubt, however, that football is going to knock the presidential contest off the front page, to use an archaic reference,"" Holbrook said. ""If nothing else, we have had baseball and summer vacation during the most recent period, neither of which seemed to diminish the importance of the campaign."" John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, said there’s some evidence that public engagement remains robust through the fall. ""There is precedent for lots of poll movement after this point,"" Sides said. ""There was certainly some in 2011, including surges for (Herman) Cain and (Newt) Gingrich."" Sports and election viewing is not a zero sum game In our interview, Hewitt assumed that there is a finite time for consuming media and that football must compete with politics. Put simply, if you’re watching sports, that’s less time for you to pay attention to the election. But, of course, it is possible to give up time spent on another activity, such as washing the car, to watch football. Also, the importance Hewitt places on football and baseball viewership assumes that those people would otherwise have been paying attention to the primaries. But it’s likely at least some of those diehard sports fans didn’t follow election coverage in the first place. (Remember, only about 50 percent of respondents say they are closely following the election news.) Our ruling Hewitt said fall sports pull voters away from paying attention to the presidential primaries. The polling data from 2007 and 2011 shows that voter interest in election news held steady at about the 50 percent mark. There were brief dips in October that coincided with the American League Championship one year and the World Series the next, but both were only momentary interruptions. The data don’t measure the precise trade-off between politics and sports, but the stability of the audience for election news shows no impact of any external factor, whether it’s sports, weather or anything else.   We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/sep/16/hugh-hewitt/hugh-hewitt-says-fall-sports-sap-public-interest-/

Annexation or not, Decatur schools are overcrowded
","The specter of annexation still floats around DeKalb County, even as voters decide in two months whether to form the cities of LaVista Hills and Tucker. If approved, the cities would share a border roughly along the eastern edge of I-285. Depending on how those votes go, the decisions could revive Atlanta’s failed effort to annex Druid Hills and a bid for Decatur to take in key commercial areas such as Suburban Plaza and the Kroger shopping center on DeKalb Industrial Way Decatur’s proposal drew vigorous opposition from residents in the neighborhoods surrounding some of those shopping plazas, since the city would get the tax dollars but avoided taking more students into its school system. Some Decatur residents have insisted any annexation plans limit residential units, arguing that would lead to overcrowding its small school system. Those claims have taken on urban myth status, reviving again this month in comments on local blogs. A reader asked us to answer, once and for all, if annexation would overcrowd Decatur schools. Quite simply, no. First, it’s worth noting that LaVista Hills and Tucker, if created, would not have their own school districts. They would remain under DeKalb County’s schools. The Atlanta expansion in Druid Hills was largely fueled by residents there who wanted to join the city’s schools after DeKalb school leaders rejected the idea of a charter cluster to give them control over several schools. Decatur’s annexation plan, meanwhile, was designed, in part, to accommodate a school system already growing at an unprecedented rate. A joint letter from the city and school district in November, was blunt: Student enrollment would grow by about 550 students by 2020, even without annexation, based on low-growth projections. An annexation before a new city was adjacent to Decatur’s borders would allow the city to add to its tax base, and find land for new school facilities that would be needed, the letter said. The school board reluctantly signed off on annexation plans in December, with the conditions that a new school site be identified for Decatur, a densely populated city with about 20,400 residents in just 4.6-square miles. Another condition called for current and future city leaders to be ""cautious"" about rezoning commercial areas into residential zones. Those caveats suggest worry about overcrowding through annexation is a concern even to district leaders. But the enrollment numbers don’t bear those worries out. District spokeswoman Courtney Burnett provided us with a 10-year history of system enrollment. On Aug. 30, 2005, a total of 2,091 students were in the city’s four elementary schools (including the fourth- and fifth-grade academy), one middle school and one high school. This year, enrollment on Sept. 10 was at an all-time high of 4,662. That’s a 123 percent increase in a decade in a district that today includes six elementary schools (including a new fourth-and fifth-grade academy to replace the existing one, which was converted to a K-3 school), a middle school and high school. The high school alone, which houses grades 9-12, has 1,159 students. That puts it at 8 percent over the Georgia Department of Education’s enrollment capacity of 1,073 students. That growth occurred when the city’s last major annexation, in April 2014, brought in just 75 homes and 14 students from the Parkwood neighborhood. ""Until we see what happens after the Nov. 3 election, the whole question of our annexation plans are on hold,"" said Decatur City Manager Peggy Merriss. ""But we know that neither annexation nor apartments is spurring the growth of our student population. It’s mostly generational turnover in single-family housing."" In other words, more young families – with kids – have decided to call Decatur home. For instance, the 2015 edition of the city’s newsletter, Focus, notes that only 45 students are registered for the current school year from the six multi-family developments that have been erected since 1999. Annexation would, of course, bring some new students to Decatur schools. Enrollment is projected to grow to 8,145 students by 2020 under last year’s annexation maps. But even without those annexed areas, the district projected as many as 7,300 students by 2020. Today, there are about 550 more students in the city’s four K-3 schools than already packed into the over-capacity high school, Burnett said. That’s part of why the school board has placed a bond referendum on the November ballot, for up to $75 million to pay for new construction and expansion of various schools. ""The bond is designed for the low-growth, without any annexation, most conservative projection we have of our continued growth,"" Burnett said. ""We have to do something for our growth, now. And that’s if not one more student enters our buildings."" Our ruling If DeKalb County voters decide to create two new cities in the November election, it could have ripple effects on how existing cities in the county grow. Decatur’s annexation plans had previously called for more land, but not necessarily more residents, for its school system. Some leaders and residents alike continue to repeat that annexation will crowd the small city’s well-regarded school system. Adding people to the city would, no doubt, translate into more students. But any claims that annexation would crowd the schools ignore the already burgeoning classrooms. The schools are already overcrowded. Decatur school enrollment has exploded by more than 100 percent in the past decade, all without any major annexations. We rate the claim that annexation would crowd the schools as False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/16/internet-commenters/annexation-or-no-decatur-schools-are-overcrowded/

Donald Trump blames Jeb Bush for the recession in Florida
","Billionaire businessman Donald Trump blamed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for the Sunshine State’s recession woes, saying Bush’s policies were the catalyst for financial disaster. ""Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse,"" Trump tweeted on Sept. 8, 2015. ""Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers — wow!"" For this fact-check, we wanted to look at Trump’s claim that Bush’s policies as governor led to financial ruin in the Sunshine State. (For more on Bush's work after he left office, read this Tampa Bay Times story.) Let’s see if Trump truly can blame Florida’s experience of the Great Recession on his GOP rival. Boom and bust There’s no question that Bush oversaw a booming economic climate in Florida while he was governor. Between January 1999 and January 2007, the state’s population grew by 3.5 million people, a legacy that is now a cornerstone of Bush’s presidential campaign. He has made repeated boasts about spikes in job growth and cuts in taxation and spending. But he also was fortunate to leave office just as the economy was starting to falter. The state’s housing market, which had skyrocketed even more than the rest of the nation, cratered in the aftermath. Florida eventually lost 1 million of the 1.33 million new jobs that were created during Bush’s tenure. Many critics, like Trump, have said Bush can’t take credit for the party without accepting the blame for the hangover. So what caused the financial crisis? It was a mix of factors, leading to a perfect storm as home sales peaked in 2005 and 2006. The combination included untested financial regulations, lax lending, overzealous bankers and traders, poor risk assessment, greedy investors, compliant governments on all levels and a global economy looking for easy money. When the bubble burst, Florida was among the hardest-hit because it had gained so much during the boom. But observers told us that it is foolhardy to pin the meltdown on any single state official, let alone Bush. The downturn was a nationwide phenomenon, not just a problem in Florida. ""During a time when the global financial system was pumping cheap money into housing, mortgage credit rationally flowed to the fastest growing states,"" said Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. ""This system inflated prices in these states to unsustainable levels, and created the boom-and-bust cycle that seems so obvious in retrospect. None of this is Jeb Bush’s fault."" That’s not to say Bush escapes all culpability. Some economists and experts told us that Bush’s actions surely encouraged overbuilding during the boom, and state officials became addicted to the increase in tax revenue it brought, especially for schools. Many of those results were based on Florida’s growth management policies, however, which had been in place long before Bush took office. Under Bush, the state did loosen construction regulations by weakening the Department of Community Affairs, said University of Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research economist David Denslow, but easing rules on building happened at all levels of government. It also was a combination of what Bush didn’t do that helped fuel the bubble. ""With hindsight, Bush could have discouraged excessive development through more regulation of the mortgage industry, … with speeches saying house prices were too high, and by strongly fighting for higher impact fees,"" Denslow wrote in an email. ""That said, there were similar housing booms in other places that had pretty much avoided them since the early 1970s."" Some states managed to avoid the worst of the recession with policies that controlled growth and borrowing. Texas, for example, did not suffer as badly because the state restricted how much equity homeowners could pull out of their homes. But other states like Arizona and Nevada joined Florida in disproportionately enjoying the boom and suffering more during the bust. Florida State University economics professor Randall Holcombe added that Florida had the double whammy of losing tourists during the recession, weakening another cornerstone of the state economy. But none of this nuance is apparent in Trump’s accusation, Holcombe said, because the billionaire doesn’t give any specifics. (We asked Trump's campaign for evidence but didn't hear back.) ""Only somebody who is very uninformed would blame that downturn on Jeb, or on economic policy at the state level in Florida,"" Holcombe said. Our ruling Trump said, ""Jeb's policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse."" Economists told us the Great Recession was precipitated by a housing bubble that grew out of multiple factors, including policies on all levels of government. While Bush’s actions as governor may not have done anything to prevent the financial crisis — some experts said he could have worked to throttle down the overbuilding — all agreed he did not cause the recession.

Did Donald Trump support the Wall Street bailout as anti-tax Club for Growth says?
","The Club for Growth, an anti-tax group, portrays Donald Trump as a liberal in a new TV ad. ""Which presidential candidate supports higher taxes, national health care and the Wall Street bailout?"" asks the narrator in the Sept. 15 ad in Iowa as it shows photos of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. ""It's Donald Trump."" The ad then shows a clip of Trump saying in 2004: ""In many cases I probably identify more as a Democrat."" We have already fact-checked Trump’s statements on taxes (he’s supported increases), health care (he’s had different views over the years) and an attack about his party affiliation (he was once a Democrat). Here, we will fact-check if he supported the Wall Street bailout. Trump on the bailout In October 2008, Congress created a $700 billion emergency bailout fund called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP,  to rescue banks in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. President George W. Bush pressed for passage, and it also drew the support of GOP presidential nominee John McCain and the Democratic nominee, Barack Obama. The Club for Growth cited three statements by Trump in support of the bailout. However, the ad omits that he expressed some skepticism about whether it would work. On Sept. 30, 2008, CNN’s Kiran Chetry asked Trump about the bailout days before its final passage. The ad includes this segment of that interview: Chetry: ""Do you think that this bailout plan needs to pass in some way, shape or form for things to stabilize?"" Trump replied: ""Well, I think it would be better if it passed."" But the ad omits the rest of Trump’s statement in which he expressed some doubt about the bailout:   ""I'm not sure that it's going to work. You know, it is trial and error. This is very complicated. This is more complicated than sending rockets to the moon. ""Nobody really knows what impact it's going to have. Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't. But certainly it is worth a shot. I don't love the idea that the government's buying back all the bad loans. How about some of the good loans? You know? I don't like the idea that the government, frankly, is going to be negotiating with people to sell those loans, because maybe we'd be better off having the best bankers in the world do that. ""But I think overall, it's a probable positive, other than you have to control the price of oil. Because if you don't, whatever happens with the bailout, if you want to call it the bailout, whatever happens with the bailout, is will have no impact, no positive impact."" On Larry King Live on April 15, 2009, King asked Trump his opinion of Obama and Trump turned to the bailout in part of his answer: ""I do agree with what they're doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn't matter, but you have to keep the banks going,"" Trump said. On Feb. 18, 2009, Trump talked about the bank bailout on David Letterman: ""The one thing is, the government came in and intelligently put money into the banks, so that if you have your money in CDs or whatever in the banks, you’re not going to lose your money at least."" In response to the ad, Trump tweeted: ""Little respected Club for Growth asked me for $1,000,000 -- I said ‘NO’. Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads!"" Trump’s charge relates to a June 2 letter from Club for Growth president David McIntosh to Trump asking him to contribute $1 million to the group. Trump then issued a press release saying that the group was trying to shake him down. Club for Growth spokesman Doug Sachtleben told PolitiFact that Trump had asked for the meeting and was interested in donating to the group. Our ruling A Club for Growth TV ad states that Trump supports the Wall Street bailout. Trump made multiple statements in support of TARP, the bailout of the banks, in late 2008 and 2009. However, the ad omits that he raised concern that the banks had received billions and were not loaning them out. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.

Michele Bachmann: Donald Trump is 'the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been'
","All that talk about how unpopular Donald Trump is with Hispanics? In Michele Bachmann’s view, the opposite is true: Trump is polling at epic levels among Hispanic voters. Bachmann, whose life after the U.S. House has included stints as a conservative cable news pundit, said on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon on Sept. 10 that Trump is remarkably popular with minorities compared to the rest of the Republican field, even as he floats mass deportations, ending birthright citizenship and building a border wall as his first orders of business. ""Donald Trump's numbers show that he's the highest with African-Americans that any Republican has ever been, and the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been,"" Bachmann said. Like, ever ever? Given that Trump himself has said he’s polling No. 1 with Hispanics, PunditFact wanted to know if Bachmann is correct. What the polls say A spokesperson for Bachmann did not return our messages asking how she knows Trump’s numbers are ""the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been."" A survey of summer headlines indicates she is wrong Wall Street Journal: ""Hispanics hold dim view of Donald Trump, poll finds"" CNN: ""Poll: 82 percent of Hispanics view Donald Trump unfavorably"" Politico: ""Poll: Trump’s popularity increasing, but not with Hispanics"" Gallup: ""Hispanics Frown on Trump, but Not Rest of GOP Field."" Without a doubt, more Hispanics have made up their minds about Trump than the other candidates. But not in the way Bachmann said. As the Gallup poll shows below, the broader Hispanic view of Trump is strongly negative.  Trump’s net favorable rating, according to Gallup, ranks last of all candidates at -51 percent (65 percent unfavorable, 14 percent favorable). The next-lowest candidates are from Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz and former Gov. Rick Perry (who’s out of the race), tied at net -7 percent. Florida natives Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio top the tracking poll, with Gallup noting Bush’s favorability jumped as Trump’s fell this summer, undermining the theory that Trump is hurting the other candidates in the race with Hispanics. Gallup’s survey is based on interviews with about 650 Hispanics from July 8 to Aug. 23 with a margin of error of 5 percentage points. It’s no outlier. A Univision Noticias poll also shows Trump lacking the most support among Hispanics. Polling by The Economist/YouGov drives home the point. In a survey of more than 230 Hispanic adults, 62 percent said they had a very unfavorable view of Trump, compared to 43 percent of 2,000 voters of all backgrounds who felt the same way. Again, all of the other candidates were viewed more favorably. The Economist/YouGov poll was based on 2,000 interviews conducted Aug. 28-Sept. 1 via an opt-in Internet panel, with a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points. Problems with data Hispanics are not a monolithic voting bloc but a growing share of the population with roots in Spanish-speaking countries. However, most Hispanic registered voters lean toward the Democratic Party, with the Republican share accounting for about 25 percent, said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic polling at the Pew Research Center. The more relevant figure to this discussion is how Republican Hispanic registered voters feel about Trump compared to other candidates, Lopez said, since it is their vote that will influence the GOP state primaries. The problem with that is Republican Hispanic voters have not been queried as much as the broader electorate this early in the election cycle. Doing this well requires hiring Spanish speakers for interviews, randomly surveying households and asking respondents if they consider themselves Hispanic or Latino, and then making sure at least half of the respondents are reached by cell phone, Lopez said, reflecting Hispanic household trends. Some pollsters try to get at this through micro-sampling their larger pool of poll respondents, but the results are often meaningless because the sample is so small. The Economist/YouGov poll, for example, asked voters who identify as Republican to choose their preferred GOP nominee. Broken down by race/ethnicity, 28 percent of GOP-leaning Hispanic voters chose Trump, followed by ""no preference"" at 18 percent, and Bush at 15 percent. Here’s the problem with running away with those results and proclaiming Trump the favorite: Just 34 Hispanic adults answered the question. Put another way, that means 10 people chose Trump, six said they had no preference, and five chose Bush. No self-respecting statistician would say this tiny sample reflects the sentiment of all registered Hispanic Republicans. Also, the higher support for Trump makes sense, since he also posts higher name recognition than the other candidates. Only 9 percent of the larger pool of Hispanic voters said they did not know how they felt about Trump, compared to 22 percent for Bush and 24 percent for Rubio. The numbers were much higher for the rest of the field. A state poll? A Google search shows where Bachmann might be going with her erroneous claim. Some blogs crowed about a poll by Gravis Marketing for the conservative One America News Network that found ""Trump leads Nevada poll with overwhelming Hispanic support."" The Hispanic population is small in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the first three states to hold presidential caucuses or primaries next year, but that’s not true for Nevada, which goes fourth. About 31 percent of Hispanic respondents said they would vote for Trump in a Republican primary, followed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 11.4 percent, according to OAN. While this might sound good for Trump (and Bachmann), they shouldn’t read too much into the poll’s declarations. As CBS News pointed out when Trump made reference to this poll, the OAN poll is based on robocalling, which means a computer talked with respondents. This method is not as reliable, and it’s more problematic for reaching Hispanic residents — half of whom rely only on cell phones (higher than for African-Americans and whites). Robocalls to cell phone numbers are not permitted by federal regulators. It’s also not clear if the poll included a Spanish-speaking component, Lopez said. One last red flag: The poll’s details do not show how many Hispanics were asked the question from the sample of 620 registered Republicans. So we don’t know how many Hispanic Republican voters chose Trump. (Remember how much a handful of responses from Hispanic adults made Hispanic support for Trump appear in the YouGov poll?) That said, Lopez said the Hispanic Republican registered voter results seem to align with the view of Republicans overall in that poll, ""and I doubt the 31.4 percent for Hispanics is statistically different from the 27.7 percent of all Republican registered voters"" in Nevada who said they would vote for Trump. Our ruling Bachmann said Trump’s polling numbers show that he’s ""the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been."" We didn’t even have to crack open the history books of all Hispanic support for all Republicans ever to disprove her claim. Trump sits — and in many cases, firmly — at the bottom of favorability polls among Hispanics compared to the other GOP candidates. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/15/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-donald-trump-highest-hispanics-an/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Richard Woods']","
Woods' claim backed by reports: CRCT wasn't challenging enough
","The state announced the first round of the Georgia Milestones tests on Sept. 3 and, as predicted, scores were low. Only 10 percent of students who took a language arts or science course at any grade level finished in the top category of distinguished learners. In math, 60 percent of all Georgia students scored as beginning or developing learners. State School Superintendent Richard Woods said the new test sets standards that are higher, more comparable nationally and essential if students are to be college- and career-ready. ""Our previous assessment, the CRCT, set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation, and that cannot continue,"" Woods said in the press release announcing the results. The Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, or CRCT, is infamous for being central to the Atlanta Public Schools test-cheating scandals. Dozens of teachers and administrators risked careers and criminal prosecution changing CRCT scores to avoid losing bonus pay, even jobs. More than 20 educators pleaded guilty to reduced charges in the scandal. Eleven others were convicted in April on racketeering and other charges, receiving sentences from probation to three years in prison. Some are appealing. With all that said, did the CRCT really set some of the nation’s lowest expectations for student proficiency, as Woods suggests? ( Keep in mind that an easy test can still be failed.) First a little background about the CRCT. It stood as one of the primary measures of student achievement in Georgia from 2000 until it was retired in Summer 2014. The multiple-choice tests also were used to determine whether schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP), the benchmark of success under the federal No Child Left Behind law. The A-Plus Education Reform Act of 2000, pushed by former Gov. Roy Barnes, required all Georgia students in grades 1 to 8 to take the CRCT in reading, English/language arts and math. Students in grades 3 through 8 also were tested in science and social studies. A writing test was required in grades 3, 5, 8 and 11. Passing the CRCT was required for promotion to the next grade for students in grades 3 (reading) and 5 and 8 (reading and math). Who knew? Answer: Many Woods, who became state superintendent in January, isn’t saying something about the CRCT that hasn’t been said for years by some parents, teachers and certainly educators and education researchers/advocates. What was the tell-tale sign that the test was too easy? It was the wide gulf between passing rates on the CRCT and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), considered the gold standard of tests. The Education Trust in Washington D.C. raised a red flag back in 2006. The non-profit pointed out, for example, that 87 percent of Georgia fourth-graders were considered ""proficient"" in reading on the CRCT, but only 26 percent of a sampling of those same students were proficient on the 2005 NAEP reading test. (If the two tests had the same expectations, there should be a minimal gap. Wide disparities in results on the state and national test are referred to as the ""honesty gap."") State officials at the time said the report findings could lead to a strengthening of the test. If that happened, it doesn’t appear to have shown up in the data. A subsequent report from the group, relying on 2011 data, showed about the same results. Nearly 90 percent of students met standards on the CRCT, but only 32 percent did so on NAEP. It wasn’t a state secret either Our research turned up a report from the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, ""A Snapshot of K-8 Academic Achievement in Georgia."" The report said that performance on the CRCT had improved modestly between 2009-10 and 2012-13. But it said a comparison with national tests showed that Georgia set a low bar for proficiency on the CRCT and still ranked in the bottom half of national comparisons on NAEP. The report pointed out that a recent Education Next study found Georgia had the lowest mathematics and reading cut scores in the nation. (Georgia students had to answer fewer test questions right to pass the test, or be classified as proficient. About 50 percent was standard.) For 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, here's what a NAEP Mapping Study showed: (This study uses NAEP as a common scale to compare one state’s expectations of what their students should know and be able to do in order to be considered ""proficient"" on their state assessments to other states.) -- Georgia had the lowest numeric 4th grade reading expectations in the nation (Proficiency by NAEP standards was a scale score equivalent of 238 or better. But researchers found Georgia classified students who scored 167 or above, as proficient. No other state had that low a bar.); -- Georgia was third from the bottom on 4th grade math expectations (Georgia's NAEP scale score equivalent of 210 was numerically better than Maryland's and Alabama's; top was Texas at 256); -- Georgia was last in 8th grade reading expectations (Georgia had a NAEP scale score equivalent of 199 and was a distant last at that, with Idaho the next lowest at 217. Best was New York at 282 out of possible 500); -- and Georgia numerically ranked third from the bottom in 8th grade math expectations. (The state's NAEP scale score equivalent was 245, which is tied with Alabama, 245, and was followed by Connecticut, 244. Best was New York at 304, out of a possible 500.) ""Too many students were labeled as proficient when, in reality, they had not fully mastered the standards and needed additional support,"" Woods said recently. ""That hurt our kids who need to be competitive with others across the country and hurt our teachers by making it difficult for them to have a true picture of the academic strengths and weakness of their students."" Our ruling There’s ample evidence that, for years, Georgia’s CRCT ""set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation,"" as research has repeatedly shown and State Superintendent Richard Woods stated last week.

Conservative Facebook post faults lesbian Texas judge for refusing to perform heterosexual marriages
","Kentucky clerk Kim Davis is back on the job. The Rowan County official drew an ardent following when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She also spent a few days in jail for failing to follow a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing such unions. This prompted a group on Facebook called Conservative News Today to post an interesting comparison. ""Lesbian judge Tonya Parker refused to perform heterosexual marriages for three years. Never reprimanded. ""Christian clerk Kim Davis obeys Kentucky law and U.S. constitution. Gets thrown in jail."" Here’s the image shared by at least 59,000 people:  Set aside the accuracy of the statement that Davis obeyed the law. (The U.S. Supreme Court does have the final word on constitutional issues.) At the heart of this post is the claim that the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis. That comparison falls wide of the facts. Judge Tonya Parker Parker was elected to the 116th Judicial District Court of Texas in 2010. She was the first openly homosexual person elected to a judgeship in Dallas County, and in 2012, she said in a speech that she was refusing to perform marriage ceremonies until same-sex couples gained the same rights as their opposite-sex counterparts. ""I don't perform marriage ceremonies because we are in a state that does not have marriage equality and until it does, I'm not going to partially apply the law to one group of people that doesn't apply to another group of people,"" Parker told a meeting of the Stonewall Democrats of Dallas. Parker later explained in an email to news organizations that ""I do not, and would never, impede any person's right to get married."" She simply declined to conduct marriage ceremonies herself. Given that at that time, the only legal marriages in Texas were between opposite-sex couples, de facto, Parker was refusing to marry heterosexuals. We should note that she didn’t single out such couples. They were the only ones she had the opportunity not to officiate over. According to news reports, Parker faced no official sanctions as a result of her policy. Does that put her in the same boat as Davis? No. Judges and clerks play different roles The side-by-side comparison treats judges and clerks as if they play the same role in the marriage process. That's not true. While it is the responsibility of clerks to issue marriage licenses, judges do not share that obligation. Generally speaking, judges don’t marry people, said Alexandra Albright, who teaches Texas civil procedure at the University of Texas at Austin Law School. ""They can perform marriages in Texas, but it’s not their job,"" Albright said. ""Most judges I know marry people they know. It’s a thing they do for friends."" Albright said a judge like Parker is expected to spend her time presiding over lawsuits brought before her. When it comes to marriage ceremonies, the Texas code authorizes a range of people to officiate. The list includes clergy, a designated officer of any religious organization, a variety of judges, justices of the peace, and retired judges and justices of the peace. In contrast, a clerk like Davis holds a unique gatekeeper position in the marriage process. ""You can’t get married without a marriage license,"" Albright said. ""There all kinds of people who can perform wedding ceremonies."" Our ruling A conservative group on Facebook said the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis. The comparison fails because a judge in Texas and a clerk in Kentucky play different official roles in the marriage process. Texas law authorizes many people, including judges, to perform marriages. Doing so is optional. In Kentucky, couples must have a marriage license issued by a clerk to get married. Davis’ refusal shut the door on marriage for same-sex couples, at least in her county.

"['Abortion', 'Virginia', 'Victoria Cobb']","
Victoria Cobb says Gov. McAuliffe has ignored violations of parental consent law
","At a recent protest outside Planned Parenthood’s office in Richmond, several hundred anti-abortion activists heard accusations that Gov. Terry McAuliffe is refusing to enforce many abortion laws. Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation -- a socially conservative lobbying and public interest group -- made the charges in a speech. She said McAuliffe, a Democrat, is ignoring the laws as payback to the ""abortion industry"" for contributing to his 2013 campaign. Records from the Virginia Public Access Project show that abortion rights groups, led by Planned Parenthood, backed McAuliffe with nearly $1.8 million in contributions. Among Cobb’s accusations was this: ""Inspections of abortion centers around Virginia have found multiple violations of state parental consent laws but, because it’s the abortion industry, Governor McAuliffe and his administration have done nothing."" Fact-checking Cobb’s statement requires two determinations: Have inspections turned up ""multiple violations"" of the parental consent law for abortions on minors and, if so, did the McAuliffe administration do ""nothing""? Let’s start with some background. For many years, Virginia abortion clinics were regulated under the general category of ""physicians offices,"" and the Virginia Department of Health Professions inspected them only for cleanliness or in response to a complaint. That changed after the General Assembly in 2011 passed a bill -- signed by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican -- requiring that the clinics adhere to hospital standards. Regulations passed later that year by the State Board of Health required that all clinics receive at least one unannounced inspection every two years to determine if they were complying with building codes and a variety of rules regarding medical treatment, sanitation, drug storage and record-keeping. When violations are found, the administrator of the clinic is required to implement a plan of correction within 30 days. The Virginia Department of Health may suspend or revoke a clinic’s license if it determines the facility is ""permitting, aiding or abetting"" illegal abortions. The inspections began in 2012, and among the checklist items is determining whether clinics are following Virginia’s parental consent law that requires physicians, before performing an abortion on an unemancipated minor, to receive notarized permission from a parent or legal guardian, or an order from a judge. Inspectors randomly pull the files of three or four minors who received abortions at each center to see whether the requirement is being followed, said Erik Bodin, director of licensure and certification for the Virginia Department of Health.   There were 20 abortion clinics in Virginia when the inspection program began. Today, there are 18. Chris Freund, spokesman for the Family Foundation, backed Cobb’s statement by referring us to the inspection reports of three clinics that have been cited for not following parental consent mandates. Let’s explore these citations and see what, if any, corrective action was taken. Roanoke Medical Center for Women On Dec. 18, 2012, inspectors found violations in three of four records of minors they pulled. In one case, no parental consent record was found for a 16-year-old who received an abortion. An unidentified staff member at the clinic said, ""I don’t know how it slipped through the cracks."" In the other two cases, consent letters were on file, but they were not notarized and, therefore, did not properly validate the relationship between the patient and her parent or guardian. Inspectors demanded an immediate correction plan, and the administrator of the clinic obtained certification as a notary public and installed a system of checks to make sure all records are in order before minors get abortions. A March 27, 2013, inspection found the corrections had been carried out. Although the Family Center sent us the original report, it should be noted that all of these actions occurred under McDonnell’s administration, which ended in January 2014. Charlottesville Medical Center for Women Three records of minors were reviewed during a July 9, 2014, inspection. Two of the consent forms were notarized but had no notary seal. A staff member reported ""he/she left the official notary stamp in Richmond,"" according to the citation. The clinic’s administrator promised to correct the problem by having more staff members certified as notaries to ensure a seal always is on hand and by improving the review of patients’ charts before abortions are performed. A subsequent unannounced inspection on Oct. 8, 2014, found no deficiencies with the center’s parental consent procedures. Planned Parenthood Metro Washington-Falls Church A review of electronic records on Oct. 30, 2014, found no parental or guardian consent signature for a 17-year-old who had received an abortion six months earlier. A staff member told inspectors the clinic had experienced ""a problem with the system capturing electronic signatures,"" according to the citation. The administrator promised to create special red files and electronic checklists for minors to ensure required steps are carried out before abortions. Bodin said the clinic has not been re-inspected, because the violations there ""did not require a revisit."" Our ruling Cobb said, ""Inspections of abortion centers around Virginia have found multiple violations of state parental consent laws but, because it’s the abortion industry, Governor McAuliffe and his administration have done nothing."" Inspections since McAuliffe took office in 2014 have turned up consent problems in two of the state’s 18 abortion clinics. Inspectors found one instance where there was no record of parental or guardian consent for a minor who had received an abortion.  And there were two instances when the consent forms were not properly notarized. Some might say that the cited problems have been few and accidental. Cobb is technically correct in using the term ""multiple violations."" But Cobb’s claim that McAuliffe did ""nothing"" about the violations doesn’t hold up. The Department of Health followed state regulations by requiring both clinics to adopt procedures to prevent the violations from recurring. The department followed up with an unannounced re-inspection at one of the facilities. The response largely was identical to actions taken under the previous governor, McDonnell, when inspectors in 2012 found a Roanoke clinic had given abortions to one minor for whom there was no parental consent record and to two minors whose forms were not notarized. On the whole, Cobb’s statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That makes it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/14/victoria-cobb/victoria-cobb-says-gov-mcauliffe-has-ignored-viola/

Donald Trump says Yale Law's 'top man' criticized former HP CEO Carly Fiorina
","Donald Trump is again defending his disparaging comments about a woman on national television. This time it’s about Carly Fiorina, a rival for the Republican nomination whom Trump mocked by saying ""Look at that face!"" in front of a Rolling Stone reporter who published his remarks. Appearing on CBS’ Face the Nation, Trump contended that his remarks were not about her appearance, but about ""her persona"" and her track record as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard. ""She hasn’t done a good job in, you could call it, the private sector. The companies, take a look at the record,"" he said Sept. 13. ""The top man at Yale Law School came out, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, with just a raging report. She’s one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company."" Trump rarely cites his sources, so we were curious about the ""raging report"" by a top dog at Yale University’s law school. The Trump campaign did not get back to us by deadline, but we think he is likely referring to an Aug. 14, 2015, column in Fortune by Yale’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. The piece did criticize Fiorina’s record at HP, but Trump misstated a few things. First, Sonnenfeld is a professor and senior associate dean for leadership programs at the Yale School of Management, not ""the top man"" at Yale Law. Second, Sonnenfeld didn’t name Fiorina as one of the worst executives in his memory. But he told PolitiFact in an interview that ""these complaints over her leadership are facts, which she cannot erase by attacking messengers."" ""Fired in 2005, after six years in office, several leading publications titled her one of the worst technology CEOs of all time,"" he wrote in Fortune.   Here’s a laundry list of Fiorina’s failings, according to Sonnenfeld (which includes a nod to Trump himself): ""She was not a criminal nor one of the rogue CEOs of another era and may deserve another chance, but it is telling that in a decade, she has never been given another major company to lead,"" Sonnenfeld told us. ""Experience can be a badge of honor or a badge of shame."" Sonnenfeld’s assessment of Fiorina is echoed by several others, but he stands out as one of her most prominent critics (so much so that Fiorina dismissed him as a Clinton adviser on NBC, which Sonnenfeld denies, and her Super PAC has featured him and his ""disreputable past"" in a blog post). He deemed Fiorina’s tenure at HP a ""colossal failure"" in Bloomberg in April 2015 and ""a reign of terror and poor performance"" in a 2006 Associated Press story. ""You couldn’t pick a worse, non-imprisoned CEO to be your standard-bearer,"" he told the New York Times in 2008. A Fiorina spokeswoman contended that Fiorina ""was a successful CEO by any metric"" and said that Sonnenfeld ""is a Clinton ally with dubious motives."" ""This is a blatantly absurd statement which holds no factual or empirical basis,"" Leslie Shedd, press secretary for Fiorina’s Super PAC, said. Shedd also pointed out that Trump has disparaged Sonnenfeld in the past (and got his title right) when the latter criticized his NBC reality show, The Apprentice, in 2004. ""I would have to say that he lacks the insight required to understand the architecture of a corporation, and his review reflects that lack of knowledge,"" Trump wrote in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. ""Perhaps that is why he is a professor at Yale instead of the Wharton School of Finance (my alma mater)."" Since Sonnenfeld and the real estate mogul traded jabs, Trump apparently invited Sonnenfeld to lunch at Trump National Golf Course and charmed Sonnenfeld's wife and colleague, much to the Yale professor’s horror. Our ruling Trump said, ""The top man at Yale Law School came out, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, with just a raging report"" about former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, saying she is ""one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company."" Trump misses minor points about the Yale man and his message. Sonnenfeld teaches at Yale’s business school. He is not the law school’s ""top man. And Sonnenfeld doesn’t exactly say Fiorina is the worst HP CEO in ""his memory."" However, the gist of Trump’s claim is accurate, as Sonnenfeld has been a vocal critic of Fiorina’s HP record for years. Trump’s claim is missing some detail but is overall on point about Sonnenfeld’s long-running critique of Fiorina. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2015/sep/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-yale-laws-top-man-criticized-for/

Scott Walker: I'm the only governor to sign law requiring investigations of deaths in police custody
","Less than two weeks after tying President Barack Obama to the killing of police officers, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker defended his own approach to defusing tensions between law enforcement and the communities they patrol. In an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 13, 2015, host Jake Tapper asked Walker to explain why he thought Obama played a role in the recent violence against police. Walker said the president hasn’t spoken out enough on the issue, and that police should be both supported and held accountable. ""I’m proud to say I'm the only governor in America, the first one and I believe the only one today, who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation any time there's a death of someone in police custody."" The August 2014 police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., sparked calls for just such independent inquiries. We wanted to see if Walker in fact is the only governor to have approved a statewide law. According to a few legal experts, plus our review of state-level legislation, Walker is on solid ground. The Wisconsin law On April 23, 2014, months before the Brown shooting, Walker signed Act 348.  The law enjoyed bipartisan support. It required that whenever an officer on or off-duty kills someone, there will be an investigation by at least two investigators, ""neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death."" Once the investigation is complete, the report goes to the district attorney in the county where the death took place for consideration of criminal charges. If no charges are filed, the report is made public. Michael Scott is the director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing and clinical professor in criminology at Arizona State University. Scott told us that analysts for the Wisconsin Legislature in 2014 found no other state required an independent investigation for police-related deaths. Scott said this measure came after a 10-year effort by one family. ""The push for this legislation in Wisconsin came from a coalition organized by Mr. Michael Bell, the father of a young man shot and killed by police in Wisconsin,"" Scott said. ""Two state legislators, Sen. Gary Bies and Rep. Chris Taylor, took up his cause and sponsored the legislation that Gov. Walker signed. Gov. Walker can take credit for signing the legislation, but it was not proposed by his office."" We found legislators in several states, including Connecticut, California, New York and Missouri, introduced similar measures in 2015, but so far, none have passed. We also learned from the Walker campaign that many local police departments in Wisconsin and around the country already require an independent investigation. However, those policies are not state law. A funding wrinkle There was a brief flap in Wisconsin over the money to pay for these inquiries. PolitiFact Wisconsin reported that Walker’s initial 2015 budget provided no funds. But after the attorney general, a Republican, told House budget writers that this was not a cheap endeavor, and a state report showed the state’s Justice Department had investigated 12 deaths in less than a year since the law took effect, lawmakers agreed to fund four of the five positions that were requested. Walker’s office agreed, and the governor signed a two-year budget that included $635,000 for the work.

No, Michael Bloomberg didn’t make this statement about Donald Trump
","Ready for some ""billionaire talk,"" as a recent Facebook post was so labeled?

Updated: Sen. Johnson correct on southern border crossing claim
","Editor's note: This item was originally posted with a rating of Mostly True, based on a transcript provided by CBS. After Sen. Ron Johnson's staff objected to that version, we listened to the audio multiple times and feel the way his office transcribed the interview is correct. That changes this rating to True. To President Donald Trump, the number of illegal border crossings at the southern border has become so great that he declared the situation a national emergency. But just how much traffic is flowing from Mexico to the United States? According to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., roughly 23,000 families per week are crossing the border illegally. He made the comment following a recent trip to the southern border, saying Congress should prioritize action to cut border crossings instead of investigating Trump. ""Just the last three weeks, on average, about 23,000 women, children, men are coming over across the border illegally as family units or as unaccompanied children,"" Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said May 26, 2019 on CBS’ ""Face the Nation."" He then referenced ""22,000 to 23,000 per week,"" tweaking the number slightly. That’s a lot of illegal crossings. We decided to look into the numbers. The numbers Republicans have repeatedly referred to a border crisis at the southern edge of the country, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection data indeed shows a dramatic shift in recent months. The Border Patrol reports 440,000 apprehensions at the southwest border through May of 2019, already nearly equal to the 467,000 apprehensions in all of 2018. The number of apprehensions per month jumped from 48,000 in January to more than 90,000 in March and April and 133,000 in May. Those tallies include three different categories of immigrant tracked by the Border Patrol -- family units (anyone apprehended along with a family member), unaccompanied children and single adults. The totals do not include immigrants who are turned away when seeking asylum or other lawful admission to the U.S. When we contacted Johnson’s office, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson’s reference to 23,000 crossings came from Border Patrol apprehension data. Johnson’s office took the number of apprehensions in May involving family units and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras and divided by four. The ""Face the Nation"" transcript quoted Johnson as referring to unaccompanied children in a separate sentence: ""... about 23,000 women- women, children, men are coming over across the border illegally as family units. There's unaccompanied children."" That makes it less clear whether Johnson is including children in the 23,000 tally. But a news release from Johnson’s office used the ""or as unaccompanied children"" phrasing. Regardless, Johnson’s statement referenced illegal crossings in general, not from specific countries. So we’ll use that criteria to check his math. For May, the Border Patrol reported 96,049 apprehensions of immigrants from family units or unaccompanied children at the southern border. Converted to a weekly average (with 4.43 weeks in a 31-day month), that’s 21,681 people per week from a family unit. If we look at all immigrants apprehended in May at the southern border -- families, adults and unaccompanied children -- the weekly average is about 30,000. That’s more than three times the rate from a year earlier. In May 2018, an average of 9,000 migrants per week were apprehended at the southern border. Our ruling Johnson said about 23,000 people per week are crossing the southern border illegally as family units or unaccompanied children. The data used to reach that number doesn’t quite match the way Johnson described it, so the actual number was a little under 22,000 per week in May. So he’s very close. If we look at all apprehensions at the southern border, the number is well over what Johnson cited. And his general point about the increasing number of apprehensions at the border is correct. We rate this claim True.  ",/factchecks/2019/jun/18/ron-johnson/sen-johnson-ballpark-southern-border-crossing-clai/

No, New Mexico does not give EBT cards to immigrants in U.S. illegally as they wait to see a judge
","A man driving efforts to privately fund and build a wall at the southern border claims that New Mexico is giving public benefits to immigrants in the country illegally. Brian Kolfage, president and founder of Build the Wall, Inc., called out New Mexico in a series of tweets this month. ""Did u know the state of New Mexico gives all illegals emergency welfare, no process like Americans go through. Handed an EBT Loaded with $1000, + $200 per child paid every month until their court date 5-6 years later. The Governor @GovMLG has a crisis and it’s costing Americans,"" Kolfage tweeted June 9. ""🚨 ALERT 🚨 New Mexico and maybe other states illegals are issued emergency welfare EBT cards with $1k a month +$200 for each child, for at least 5+ years until they see a judge. Illegals are asking agents ‘when do I get my money. SOURCE: border agents.,"" he tweeted June 10. On June 11, he tweeted a video of people rushing from one side of a fence to another; he described it as an ""invasion underway"" and said about 1,000 people had crossed at that location, ""all getting free emergency welfare from New Mexico!"" Is New Mexico giving immigrants in the country illegally Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards loaded with $1,000, per month, for at least five years? Not so, according to Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico Human Services Department. ""None of these tweets are accurate,"" Porter said. ""It’s simply unconscionable for Mr. Kolfage to spread blatant lies. New Mexico is fully in compliance with federal regulations and only issues benefits to qualified recipients."" Kolfage told PolitiFact that his claim is based on what Border Patrol agents on the ground have told him. ""The agents said it’s called emergency welfare and they bypass all rules,"" Kolfage said. He said that immigrants get the benefits for five to six years ""because that’s the immigration backlog on court cases,"" but if they see an immigration judge in a month, they’d only receive the benefits for one month. Kolfage said the agents he spoke to were unwilling to talk to PolitiFact because they are not authorized by Customs and Border Protection to do so. The agency’s press office declined to comment. Kolfage on June 9 also tweeted a link to an April Breitbart post, authored by former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. ""U.S. law allows those who actually obtain asylum to qualify for federal welfare benefits, but now it appears that many asylum applicants may be getting them too,"" Kobach’s post said. He also wrote that ""it appears"" that many immigrants paroled into the country are getting EBT cards before their eligibility period. His post doesn’t specifically mention New Mexico nor link to data backing his claim. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federally funded program to help eligible, low-income families buy food. Benefits are provided through EBT cards that can be used at grocery stores. The U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees the program at the federal level and states administer it, following federal eligibility guidelines. (""Expedited SNAP"" is an emergency program for very low-income families and migrant or seasonal farm workers; it allows eligible applicants to have an EBT card within seven days.) We asked the USDA if it’s true that in New Mexico and other states, ""illegals are issued emergency welfare EBT cards"" with $1,000 a month plus $200 per child, for at least five years, until they see a judge, as Kolfage tweeted. ""USDA does not have an EBT program like the one you described,"" said Mike Illenberg, a spokesman for the federal agency. Generally, immigrants in the country illegally are not eligible for SNAP, and consequently cannot get an EBT card, several immigration law experts told PolitiFact. Aside from U.S. citizens, ""qualified"" immigrants can be eligible for SNAP; and some must meet additional criteria. ""Qualified"" immigrants include people legally admitted into the country as refugees, people granted asylum by an immigration judge, and people paroled into the United States for at least one year. (State Department says parole is ""an extraordinary measure"" that is sparingly used.) Kolfage’s phrasing that the EBT cards are issued to immigrants until they see a judge suggests that this includes people seeking asylum whose cases are decided by immigration judges. But the sole action of applying for asylum does not make someone eligible for SNAP. They are eligible for SNAP once they have been granted asylum. Some states offer state-funded food assistance to qualified immigrants who are ineligible for SNAP. But Kolfage tweeted about EBT cards that are part of a federal program. Kolfage said that in New Mexico, ""illegals are issued emergency welfare EBT cards with $1k a month +$200 for each child, for at least 5+ years until they see a judge."" Federal food assistance benefits are distributed to eligible participants through EBT cards. New Mexico’ Human Services Department, which administers the federal SNAP program, says Kolfage’s claim is inaccurate. The USDA said it does not have a program like the one Kolfage stated. People granted asylum are eligible for SNAP, but solely applying for the immigration protection does not grant eligibility for the food program.

Durkin off-base in claim about Illinois infrastructure woes
","In the final days of the spring legislative session, Illinois lawmakers paved the way for the state's first major public works program since 2009 by approving significant tax and fee hikes. To help finance the long-awaited $45 billion capital construction program, legislators from both parties voted to bump up state charges for gasoline, cigarettes, vehicle registration and more following a series of behind-the-scenes negotiations. Tax hikes are a sensitive topic for any politician, but especially so for Republicans who fashion themselves as fiscal conservatives and Democrats as wasteful and tax happy. In a recent radio interview, House Republican Leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs was asked to defend the increases to Illinoisans who feel they’re being nickeled and dimed by the state. ""We’re at a point right now in Illinois where we have to make the investment in our infrastructure,"" Durkin said on WGN Radio. ""There are parts of I-80 near Joliet that school buses are not allowed to cross because of the fragile nature of a bridge. That is just one example of many which reflect this necessity to make this investment."" It’s indisputable that concerns over the state’s neglected infrastructure are on the rise, not only in the suburbs and downstate but also in Chicago, where a crack in a bridge support beam forced the shutdown of Lake Shore Drive in February. That same month, Joliet’s mayor sounded the alarm about the condition of parallel bridges on Interstate 80 that cross the Des Plaines River in each direction in his city. Initially, the mayor warned he would divert traffic away from the bridges if the state failed to step in, but he backed away from the threat after the Illinois Department of Transportation concluded they remained safe for travel and promised maintenance work would soon begin. That left us wondering where Durkin was getting his information about the school buses, so we decided to dig into the issue. In early February, Chicago’s CBS station drew attention to the I-80 bridges, noting that a 2018 state inspection used terms like ""intolerable"" and a ""high priority for replacement"" to describe the structural condition of the westbound span. IDOT insisted the bridges remain safe for travel, but concern is still high among area residents, who even if they missed the news reports may have seen warning messages on billboards off the highway, paid for by a union local whose members do infrastructure work. Illinois is home to more than 2,270 of the 47,000 bridges in the nation considered structurally deficient, according to the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. Elsewhere in the Midwest, residents have witnessed firsthand what can happen when major infrastructure fails: In 2007, an interstate bridge collapsed over the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis, killing 13 people and injured 145 others. Despite widespread public concern, however, we could find no evidence that Joliet school buses had been prohibited from traversing the I-80 bridges with students aboard. A spokeswoman for Joliet Township High School District told us the district had no policy against crossing the bridges and said she hadn’t heard of any others in the area instituting such orders. Likewise, a spokeswoman for the district that runs Joliet’s elementary and junior high schools said it did not have a policy barring use of the bridges, though she said bus drivers had been instructed to avoid the interstate if possible mostly due to frequent traffic congestion. At that, however, the spokeswoman said officials of her district had engaged in considerable discussion about the safety of the bridges with the state and city as well as concerned parents who had requested their children not be bused along that route. Indeed, officials we spoke with at several school districts in the Joliet area described the I-80 corridor in general as a safety hazard, pointing to a high volume of trucks traveling at high speeds. ""It’s not a safe road to travel on at certain times of the day regardless of the bridges,"" said Rusty Ragon, superintendent for Manhattan School District 114 southeast of Joliet. A 2018 report from the Illinois Economic Policy Institute found the design of the 16-mile stretch of I-80 that traverses Joliet, much of it two-lanes in each direction, is insufficient to handle existing traffic — 20 percent of which is comprised of heavy trucks. It also noted 37 fatal crashes had occurred there between 2001 and 2016. The state has been studying the transportation needs of the area. Plans are now in the works to replace 10 smaller bridges along I-80 in Joliet, according to IDOT spokesman Guy Tridgell. The department will now have the funds to rebuild the Des Plaines River bridges as well thanks in part to the new state capital program, Tridgell told us in an email. IDOT has not yet finalized the timeline for these projects, however. In the meanwhile, the bridges remain open to all traffic and the state has no plans at this time to restrict vehicle crossings, Tridgell confirmed. So if neither the state nor any Joliet-area school districts had issued a ban on bridge bus use, where did Durkin’s information come from? Eleni Demertzis, a spokeswoman for the Republican leader, traced it back to the transportation department at Lincoln-Way Community High School District to the east of Joliet, which she said had complied with individual requests not to take I-80. Lincoln-Way officials did not respond to our specific questions about whether any overarching policy changes were made in response to bridge conditions. But a spokeswoman pointed out the boundaries of that district boundaries lie far east of the bridges so there would be little need for its buses to travel over them. Durkin said, ""There are parts of I-80 near Joliet that school buses are not allowed to cross because of the fragile nature of a bridge."" Neither state transportation officials nor any of the Joliet-area school district officials we spoke with could identify such a policy and Durkin’s office couldn’t point us to one. Some districts do try to avoid taking the interstate whenever possible, though, not just because of the bridges but also because of traffic congestion through Joliet and heavy trucks often barrelling at high speeds away from town. So Durkin’s on firm ground when it comes to his broader point about the critical need for infrastructure investment in the area following years of neglect. However, he underscored that argument with a sloppy example that does not match up with the facts. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Fact check: Bishop says dark money helped McCready
","In a tight 2018 congressional race that is now being redone because of allegations of election fraud, Democratic candidate Dan McCready spoke out on Twitter against dark money in politics. But now he is being accused of benefiting from it. McCready’s opponent in the do-over election, Republican Dan Bishop, called him out in a May 31 Facebook post for receiving support from dark money organizations, citing an article by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative political journalism website. ""Turns out ‘Wrong Dan’ (McCready) got nearly $1 million in support from a Nancy Pelosi aligned dark money org in the 2018 election cycle right after he tweeted, ‘Dark money has no place in our politics,’."" Bishop’s post says. PolitiFact North Carolina found this claim particularly interesting because McCready has been outspoken about his opposition to dark money. When we contacted his campaign, it released a statement from McCready saying he believes that ""money is corrupting our politics and that we’ve got to take on special interests and the status quo, which is why if elected to Congress I will advocate for the mandatory disclosure of all donors to dark money groups."" ""Federal election law expressly prohibits candidates from coordinating with a political nonprofit on its independent expenditure spending, and the McCready campaign fully complied with the law,"" Amanda Sherman, a spokesperson for McCready’s campaign, said in an email. Sherman also said McCready has been endorsed by End Citizens United, a group dedicated to reversing the Supreme Court decision that allowed dark money groups to grow in influence, Citizens United v. FEC. So, we decided to investigate further. It turns out McCready indeed got support from a dark money group. As for the connection to Pelosi, the truth is a little more complicated. WHAT IS DARK MONEY? The Center for Responsive Politics defines dark money as ""political spending meant to influence the decision of a voter, where the donor is not disclosed and the source of the money is unknown."" Dark money groups are usually either political nonprofits that are not required to disclose their donors or super PACs, which are allowed to accept unlimited donations from political nonprofits and other corporations that may or may not have disclosed their donors. Dark money organizations exist on both sides of the political spectrum -- some examples of 501(c) political nonprofits are Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association. ""If you look at the overall amount spent on elections, (dark money) is a relatively small part, but when you look at the most contested races, it’s when you see dark money playing a big role,"" Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, said. ""Dark money and outside money, generally, tend to gravitate towards the most competitive races."" McCready’s 2018 congressional race against Republican Mark Harris was one of those tight elections that drew outside spending. DID MCCREADY GET SUPPORT FROM DARK MONEY? Patriot Majority USA is a lesser known, liberal-leaning dark money nonprofit. We found that, as Bishop said, the group supported McCready in 2018. Patriot Majority spent $944,060 against Harris. However, Patriot Majority did not send money directly to McCready’s campaign. Instead, it ran TV ads attacking Harris’ campaign for being ""out of step"" with North Carolina families and alleging that Harris wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare. The ads did not say anything about McCready.
  Anna Massoglia, a researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics who specializes in dark money, said this is a common tactic used by these organizations. ""In many cases, the spending that we do see on political ads by dark money is more common actually against a candidate than in support of one,"" Massoglia said. ""...They aren’t necessarily ‘using’ dark money, I wouldn’t use that term. I would say that they benefit from dark money whether they like it or not."" If a dark money organization decides to use their money against a candidate, there is really not much a campaign can do, said Robin Kolodny, a professor of political science at Temple University who specializes in political consultants and campaign finances. ""(Patriot Majority USA) is entirely independent of the campaign and there is nothing either candidate could do to stop the spending even if they wanted to,"" Kolodny said. ""The Supreme Court has held time and again that people may exercise their free speech in whatever amounts they wish."" IS PATRIOT MAJORITY USA ALIGNED WITH NANCY PELOSI? The claim that McCready is in cahoots with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was actually the subject of another fact-check by PolitiFact, based on a claim made by Harris in 2018 that was found Half True. ""It’s certainly true that Patriot Majority is a dark money group, and that they support Democrats, and that they’re aligned with Democrats,"" Fischer said. ""I don’t know if that’s enough to say that they’re specifically aligned with Nancy Pelosi, unless they’re using Nancy Pelosi as a stand-in for all Democrats."" While we know that Patriot Majority USA spent almost all of its money in support of Democratic House candidates, we couldn’t find a record of Patriot Majority USA being connected to Pelosi. The McCready campaign also received support from the House Majority PAC — a super PAC that is not considered dark money because it discloses its sponsors, according to Massoglia. House Majority PAC is known to be aligned with Pelosi. She raised money for it in 2011, when it first started. In 2018, the House Majority PAC spent $340,018 against Harris, benefiting McCready.
  OUR RULING Bishop is correct that McCready received support from a dark money group. The McCready campaign did not take money from the group and cannot control the independent expenditures of outside organizations, but that doesn’t change the fact that the campaign benefited. While we know that Patriot Majority USA is aligned with the Democratic Party and spent most of its money on House Democrats, we didn’t find evidence that Pelosi is aligned with Patriot Majority USA. And while the Pelosi-aligned House Majority PAC did support the McCready campaign by spending money against Harris, it is not considered a dark money group because it discloses its donors. Therefore, we rate Bishop’s statement Mostly True. UPDATE: This story was updated after publication to add McCready's position on changing campaign disclosure laws. This does not change our ruling. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Joe Biden says China's thefts of U.S. technology have increased on Donald Trump's watch
","Joe Biden has made attacking Donald Trump a key part of his 2020 campaign, arguing that Trump has squandered the achievements of the Barack Obama administration. One mention referred to China stealing U.S. technology. ""In the Obama-Biden administration,"" Biden said, ""we got China to cut cyber-theft — it's gotten significantly worse under this administration."" There is evidence the Chinese government reduced its technology thefts from U.S. companies after an agreement struck by the Obama administration in 2015. Other factors also led to the reduction, and it’s not clear why the thefts have increased under Trump. For years, the Chinese government broke into the computer systems of American companies, military contractors and government agencies to obtain designs, technology and corporate secrets, usually on behalf of China’s state-owned firms. For example, we rated Mostly True a claim that the Chinese stole an estimated $360 billion in intellectual property from the United States in 2015 alone. The agreement announced in September 2015 by Obama and President Xi Jinping of China included a pledge not to conduct or knowingly support cyber-theft of confidential business information in order to aid companies or industries. To back Biden’s statement, his campaign pointed us to a report and news stories. (A spokesman for the National Security Council responded to our inquiry, but did not provide any information to help evaluate Biden’s claim.) An annual report for 2019 by FireEye, a California cybersecurity company, says that late 2015 and 2016 ""saw Chinese cyber espionage activity begin to significantly decline, especially against the U.S."" The report noted the agreement, but also that China’s People’s Liberation Army, which did some of the hacking, consolidated its cyber-related functions and the Chinese government ""shifted its national priorities."" That decline did eventually reverse, however, according to two news accounts in November 2018. The New York Times reported that ""for 18 months or so"" after the deal, ""the number of Chinese attacks plummeted,"" but soon after Trump took office, ""China’s cyber-espionage picked up again and, according to intelligence officials and analysts, accelerated in the last year as trade conflicts and other tensions began to poison relations between the world’s two largest economies."" The Wall Street Journal reported that Rob Joyce, then a Trump senior adviser for cybersecurity strategy at the National Security Agency, said the agreement had significantly reduced the amount of Chinese cybertheft targeting American companies, but that China had violated the agreement and ""it is clear they are well beyond the bounds of the agreement today."" The Journal also reported that several private-sector cybersecurity firms concluded that China had been in violation of that deal roughly since Trump took office, but that some security experts said independent factors, including a reorganization of the People’s Liberation Army, may have had more to do with the temporary decline in cybertheft. So, a reduction took place after the agreement, something even a Trump official acknowledged, but even the evidence cited by Biden indicates the reduction may have been due to other factors, as well. Several private cybersecurity experts we contacted agreed that the Obama deal was a major factor, though not the only one, in leading to the temporary reduction in China’s cyber-thefts. Those experts are Inside Cybersecurity editor and co-founder Charlie Mitchell; James Andrew Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Christopher Painter, a member of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace who, while at the State Department under Obama, helped negotiate the deal with China; and Sean Kanuck, CEO of Exedec International and former U.S. national intelligence officer for cyber issues. The deal may have saved American companies $15 billion a year, according to a 2017 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But we did not find consensus on the Trump administration’s role in the uptick of Chinese cyber thefts. The ramping up of the cyber-theft ""is because the Chinese decided to increase, not because of anything Trump did,"" said the center’s James Andrew Lewis, who was the U.S. Commerce Department lead for national security and espionage concerns related to high-technology trade with China. Lewis said China’s economy was stronger when it made the agreement and that China underestimated how important cyber-theft is to supporting the country’s economy. But Mitchell and Painter said that as U.S. relations with China have deteriorated since Trump took office, China has had less incentive to comply with the agreement. ""At least one motivation that the Chinese had for complying went away as Trump started slapping on tariffs,"" Mitchell said. A final note: The experts agreed that when it comes to cyber thefts, there is no way to know exactly how much is occurring. Biden said: ""In the Obama-Biden administration, we got China to cut cyber-theft — it's gotten significantly worse under this administration."" China did reduce its cyber-theft from American companies in the wake of a groundbreaking deal it made in 2015 with the Obama administration, but other factors may also have led to the reduction. The consensus among experts is that China’s cyber-thefts have gone on the uptick since Trump took office, but other factors, such as a dip in China’s economy, may have also played a role.

UW System president hits pay dirt with university pay gap claim
","In the battle over the 2019-’21 state budget, faculty salaries for the University of Wisconsin System have made for their own skirmish. It is part of a broader debate over the UW System can best attract and retain top faculty members -- and, specifically, how to compete with what other universities offer. In his 2019-’21 budget proposal, Gov. Tony Evers called for a 2% pay increase for UW System employees in each fiscal year. That was less than the 3% that UW System President Ray Cross had requested. However, on May 28, 2019, Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee trimmed Evers’ overall spending increase for the UW System by more than half. Their plan still provides an increase over current levels, but it means there will be less money available to address pay gap issues. Two days before the vote, in a May 26, 2019, appearance on WISN’s ""UpFront,"" Cross made his case for a pay increase in an interview with host Adrienne Pedersen. ""Most research shows that we are a little behind, and some areas we're behind more than others,"" he said. ""But compensation is an important piece of the total overall package to make the university part of the solution for the state."" Is Cross right that UW salaries are lagging peer institutions? Let’s take a look. Peer institutions In higher education, the term peer institution comes up a lot. In short, it is another school -- or set of schools -- that are similar in size, performance and mission. The idea is that they provide a good comparison when it comes to salaries, benefits and other matters. In Wisconsin, the UW System actually has a formalized list of peer institutions. It was established in 1984 by the Governor’s Faculty Compensation Study Commission, which was put in place by then-Gov. Tony Earl, a Democrat. The listing includes 11 peer institutions for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the state’s flagship; 14 peers for the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, also considered a research institution; and 31 peer institutions for what are known as the ""comprehensive institutions."" The UW comprehensive institutions are four-year campuses in Eau Claire, Green Bay, La Crosse, Oshkosh, Platteville, River Falls, Stevens Point, Superior and Whitewater, as well as UW-Stout in Menomonie and UW-Parkside in Kenosha County. Peer institutions for UW-Madison include: Indiana University, Michigan State University, Ohio State University, Purdue University and the University of Texas-Austin. Peer institutions for UW-Milwaukee include: Cleveland University, Temple University, the University of Illinois-Chicago, the University of New Orleans and the University of Texas-Dallas. Meanwhile, peer institutions for the group of other institutions include: Minnesota State University-Mankato, Central Michigan University, Chicago State University, the University of Northern Iowa and Grand Valley State University in Michigan. When we asked Cross for backup, his staff pointed us to the University of Wisconsin System Accountability Dashboard. The UW System maintains the online dashboard with links to various statistical information, including a page devoted to the ""Faculty Compensation Gap."" When it comes to comparisons, salaries are adjusted for the cost of living using the Economic Research Institute Index. That’s good, because it helps even out the comparison. Benefits are not included. The salary information is provided by the American Association of University Professors. How big is the lag? The dashboard charts cover the compensation gap from 2009-2010 to 2017-2018. For 2017-2018, the charts show that UW System salaries overall lag peers by 16.48%. Breaking it down further, UW-Madison lags by 15.60%; UW-Milwaukee lags by 10.82%; and the other campuses lag by 18.99%. In the previous academic year, 2016-2017, the compensation gap for UW System stood at 19.91%, UW-Madison at 19.15%, UW-Milwaukee at 12.67% and UW-Comprehensives at 22.65%. So, the difference shrunk a bit from the previous year, but the gaps are all longstanding. Other comparisons A March 4, 2019 USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin report using 2017-’18 salary information found a handful of professors, mainly in the finance and economics departments, are among the highest-paid employees in the system. Those salaries tend to be higher because of the need to compete with private-sector jobs. Overall, the USA TODAY NETWORK -- Wisconsin report found that faculty members across the UW System were paid an average of 12.3% less in 2017-2018 than those at peer universities. That gap rose to 16.5% when adjusted for cost of living. That matches what the UW System found in its own analysis. (Click here for an online database where readers can search and sort by pay, campus and employee name.) Meanwhile, an analysis by a UW-Madison senior policy analyst released April 11, 2018, found that UW-Madison average salaries were ranked 12th among its peers for full professors, 7th for associate professors and 9th for assistant professors. Our ruling Cross said ""Most research shows that (UW salaries) are a little behind, and (in) some areas we're behind more than others."" The peer institutions Cross was referring to have been well established. And the salary numbers show he is on target, even when cost-of-living differences between various states and cities are factored in.

Amy Klobuchar right about state psychiatric bed shortages
","After an interview with MSNBC host Chris Hayes, Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, said in a tweet June 7 that the U.S. needs to do more to support mental health patients. ""Millions of Americans need mental health care. Yet in Iowa, there are just 64 public mental health care beds. And you see similar numbers across the country,"" she tweeted.  Millions of Americans need mental health care. Yet in Iowa, there are just 64 public mental health care beds. And you see similar numbers across the country. We must work together to get people the care they need. More on my plan with @chrislhayes: pic.twitter.com/Pf8P5kRibD We wanted to see if Klobuchar, who proposed a plan in May 2019 to allocate $100 billion toward mental health treatments, was correct in her statement about psychiatric beds in Iowa and nationwide. Psychiatric inpatient beds in Iowa A Klobuchar campaign spokesperson sent us a 2016 article from WQAD, a local TV station in Iowa, which mentions the 64 beds figure. The Treatment Advocacy Center, an organization that pushes for mental health treatment accessibility, documents in a report that there were 64 state psychiatric inpatient beds for adults in Iowa in 2016. Typically, patients need psychiatric inpatient bed treatment because they are at risk of harming themselves or others or are unable to take care of themselves, said Dr. Peg Nopoulos, the chairperson of the University of Iowa’s Department of Psychiatry. ""Mental health still has a horrible stigma, and it gets treated separately and differently than other medical problems for unclear reasons. It shouldn’t be,"" Nopoulos said. In January 2019, there were 64 staffed psychiatric beds for adults younger than 55 at the mental health institutes in Iowa, according to Iowa Department of Human Services data sent to PolitiFact from department spokesperson Matt Highland. In addition to beds at Iowa’s public mental health institutes, there are 44 psychiatric beds for adults younger than 65 and 15 for adults of any age at University of Iowa Health Care, a medical center which receives state funding, according to Nopoulos. Those additional 15 beds are for patients who have psychiatric and other medical issues. The Treatment Advocacy Center ranked Iowa last out of all 50 states for number of public psychiatric beds available per capita, which results in people having to endure long waits before receiving treatment, ""if they are admitted at all,"" the center states. Psychiatric inpatient beds nationwide In 2017, an estimated 11.2 million, or 4.5% of U.S. adults, lived with serious mental illness, with 7.5 million receiving treatment during the previous year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Public hospitals with psychiatric beds (sometimes called state hospitals) provide critical services. Because they are funded by local, state and federal funds, they cannot turn away people who need treatment, regardless of how much money they have. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration states that adults suffering from mental illnesses who live below the poverty line face an additional set of challenges, including higher health care costs. Poverty may also increase the likelihood of mental illness or intensify the experience of mental illness. An estimated 25.5% of U.S. adults with a serious mental illness lives below the poverty line, according to the administration’s 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The Treatment Advocacy Center recommends a minimum of 50 beds for every 100,000 people ""to provide a minimally adequate treatment for individuals with severe mental illnesses."" There are two beds available at Iowa’s mental health institutes for every 100,000 people in the state, according to the Iowa Department of Human Services data. (If you wanted to include the University of Iowa beds, the number of beds would still be very low, and less than four per 100,000) In total, there were 11.7 psychiatric beds per 100,000 people in state hospitals in the U.S., according to the Treatment Advocacy Center 2016 report. Our ruling Klobuchar tweeted, ""Millions of Americans need mental health care. Yet in Iowa, there are just 64 public mental health care beds. And you see similar numbers across the country."" Iowa’s Department of Human Services data show that there were 64 staffed psychiatric beds for adults in public hospitals, as of January 2019. The figure does not include beds available at the University of Iowa Health Care, which receives state funding, but the number of beds per capita is still very low compared to other states.

No, Nixon was never officially impeached. He resigned first
","Former President Richard Nixon is making a comeback, this time as congressional Democrats mull impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. Just this week, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report from Nixon’s former White House counsel, John Dean, a key witness in the Watergate scandal. What’s often forgotten about Nixon is that, while he’s the only U.S. president to resign from office, he was never actually impeached. The latest public figure to bobble this fact was Jimmy Kimmel, host of ABC’s late-night show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" Kimmel’s comment came during the June 6 episode of his show, as part of an extended joke breaking down Trump’s recent feud with actress Bette Midler. The comedian listed several far-fetched connections between Trump, Nixon and Midler’s 1993 film ""Hocus Pocus"" as evidence for why Trump lashed out at her on Twitter. ""Richard Nixon was the last president to be impeached by a ‘witch hunt,’"" he said at one point. We found Kimmel’s joke funny, but also worth fact-checking. Our finding: Kimmel was wrong in a few ways, and the history is worth a review. For starters, Nixon was not the latest president to face the prospect of impeachment. That was Bill Clinton. The House of Representatives impeached him in 1998, but the Senate ultimately acquitted him. More importantly, Nixon was never impeached. Impeachment requires a formal vote, and the House has only voted to impeach two presidents — Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton more than 100 years later. (Johnson was also acquitted.) Nixon’s story was different. In Nixon’s case, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment in July 1974 and reported them to the full House for consideration. But after the Supreme Court forced him to release incriminating White House tapes, Nixon resigned in August 1974, leaving office before the House could vote on impeachment. Still, it was widely believed at the time that Nixon would have been ousted if he’d stayed around. ""Nixon would definitely have been impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate if he had not resigned first,"" said Ken Hughes, a historian at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center and an expert on Nixon’s secret recordings. Timothy Naftali, professor of public service at New York University and the former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, added that impeachment ""by an overwhelming bipartisan majority was beyond question"" and ""as close to inevitable as can be."" A spokesperson for ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" did not respond to requests for comment. Kimmel said, ""Richard Nixon was the last president to be impeached by a 'witch hunt.'"" Nixon probably would have been kicked out if he hadn’t resigned first, and the impeachment process against him had begun. But only two presidents have actually been impeached, and Nixon was not one of them. He resigned before the House had the chance to vote on the articles of impeachment.

Tab for federal benefits for the dead: $1 billion, Florida Congressman says
","You know the saying that you can’t take it with you? Well, maybe you can if it’s a federal government benefit -- and that’s a problem says a Florida congressman. Republican U.S. Rep. Greg Steube says tax dollars are being wasted on benefits for dead people. ""It’s estimated that in 2018 alone, dead people received $1 billion in benefits from Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security payments, and federal pensions,"" Steube said in a May 28 press release. Steube introduced legislation to require federal agencies and departments to verify eligibility for benefits for individuals 105 years of age or older. Steube is correct that the federal government spends a lot of money on benefits for people without verifying their information against death data, but his statement requires some caveats. Improper payments are payments made by the government to the wrong person, in the wrong amount, or for the wrong reason. Improper payments include fraud and abuse, errors and instances in which a payment lacked the required documentation. (Not every improper payment is an overpayment.) In 2018, improper payments added up to about $151 billion. Since 2003, improper payments have added up to $1.5 trillion. Steube is zeroing in on one type of improper payment, which the government labels ""failure to verify death data."" There are various reasons for improper payments. By searching the 2018 dataset at paymentaccuracy.gov, we found that the improper payments for ""failure to verify death data"" added up to about $966 million before any effort to recover those dollars. The largest chunk of improper payments was for Social Security -- about $796 million. (The remainder was from Medicaid, retirement and disability. Medicare information had not yet been reported.) One key caveat about Steube’s statement about dead people receiving health care benefits: Medicare and Medicaid payments are made to health care providers -- not the beneficiaries. ""No beneficiary receives a payment,"" said Joseph R. Antos, a health care and retirement policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the category ""failure to verify death data"" is failure to check if people are dead, not necessarily that they are all dead. Social Security receives death information from multiple sources, including family members, banks and other government agencies. Its ""Death Master File"" has 90 million records, but even then states it isn’t comprehensive of all deaths. The system isn’t perfect -- sometimes the Social Security Administration has prematurely declared a person dead. And not all federal agencies have the same access to death data, a problem some lawmakers want to rectify. While the $1 billion figure cited by Steube is large, it’s a small fraction of the total payments, Ellis said. For example, the Social Security improper payments rate in 2018 was 0.7% of total paid out, he said. The federal government certainly can and should do better, Ellis said. But the situation doesn’t get fixed because it doesn’t add up to enough money to lead to an outcry to change it. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found in 2016 that if Social Security could get rid of all improper payments, it would reduce costs by at most .6%. Steube said, ""It’s estimated that in 2018 alone, dead people received $1 billion in benefits from Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security payments, and federal pensions."" The data for 2018 showed about $966 million in improper payments for ""failure to verify death data."" Most of those improper payments were for Social Security. Also, beneficiaries don’t get the benefits directly for Medicare or Medicaid -- those go to providers.

Are migrants with diseases like Ebola being dumped in San Antonio? No
","Are Ebola-infected Congolese migrants streaming across the Texas border, endangering residents of San Antonio with a disease that is nearly always fatal? ""Disease-Ridden Congolese Migrants Dumped in San Antonio,"" reads the headline of one article on the Conservative Daily Post website. The article begins, ""Hundreds of Congolese migrants, with who knows what sorts of diseases given that the nation is chock full of Ebola, were unexpectedly dumped in San Antonio."" The remainder of the Conservative Daily Post article reprints a piece from Breitbart that does not go that far. That article focuses on the arrival of Congolese immigrants, but it does not mention Ebola. After interviewing federal and local officials as well as infectious disease experts, PolitiFact found that Congolese migrants are indeed coming to San Antonio, but, contrary to the Conservative Daily Post article, they are not carrying Ebola, or, for that matter, any infectious diseases other than common colds and upper respiratory infections that many American citizens grapple with every day. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency responsible for border control, put it simply in a statement to PolitiFact: ""There have been no encounters of Ebola along the southwest border."" But the flurry of social media attention to Ebola-infected migrants drove the City of San Antonio to hold a news conference to debunk those rumors on June 12. PolitiFact has written extensively about questionable claims involving Ebola, including one from 2014 by a then-member of Congress who said that amid the ""crisis at our southern border,"" there are ""reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus."" We rated that Pants on Fire. We did some reporting to make sure that the claim remains wrong. Concerns about Ebola at the border are ""much ado about nothing,"" said Colleen Bridger, San Antonio’s interim assistant city manager and metro health director. ""Any rumors that they are bringing Ebola or risks of Ebola are patently false."" Let’s take a closer look at the facts. (We tried to contact Conservative Daily Post through its website, but we did not hear back.) There is an ongoing Ebola outbreak in eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Through early June, the outbreak had killed 1,396 people, according to the World Health Organization, making it the second-biggest known outbreak of Ebola. ""The current outbreak of Ebola in eastern Congo is substantial and has been ongoing for at least 10 months,"" William Schaffner, a professor of medicine and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The good news, however, is that the outbreak has been contained to one geographic area. ""It remains confined to this remote region — there has been no local diffusion into surrounding areas, and there have been no long-distance exportations into Europe, the U.S., or any other part of the world,"" Schaffner said. ""That’s impressively reassuring, but of course public health remains on the alert, ready to respond, diagnose, treat and isolate any suspect case."" Congolese migrants are reaching the U.S.-Mexico border, although they remain a small percentage of all migrants. Customs and Border Protection has noticed an uptick in African migrants in recent weeks, reporting apprehension of 15 individuals from Congo on May 28; 116 individuals from Angola, Cameroon, and Congo on May 31; 37 individuals from the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo on June 3; and 34 from the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola on June 5. San Antonio city officials said that the locations of the apprehensions will eventually bring the migrants to the city because it has the closest major bus depot. The migrants were allowed to join relatives or other custodians elsewhere in the country because they are seeking asylum. The first step in that process is to have their case heard by an immigration judge. ""Since June 4, approximately 250 individuals from Central Africa -- some from Angola and some from the Democratic Republic of Congo -- have come to San Antonio,"" said interim assistant city manager and metro health director Colleen Bridger at the June 11 news conference. ""The last of that group is picking up their bus today and heading to their final destination."" A much larger number of migrants from other countries has passed through San Antonio in recent months, said city spokeswoman Laura E. Mayes. A local shelter handling the migrant influx ""has seen more than 14,000 come through,"" she said. For many reasons, none of the migrants from Congo have Ebola. First, science makes it impossible. Officials said the migrants had been in transit for several months, yet Ebola has an incubation period of 21 days. So, someone who became infected with Ebola in Congo and then started the journey to the United States would come down with symptoms during the trip, far from the U.S. border. The symptoms of Ebola are debilitating, and the infected individual would be unable to continue their journey. They would most likely die long before reaching the United States. ""It is clear that Ebola is not a consideration for a group of travelers who have long been out of Africa,"" said Thomas Fekete, a professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology at Temple University. ""It makes as much sense as keeping Americans out of other countries because we have had over 1,000 cases of measles here."" Second, each of these migrants has been extensively checked for Ebola, as well as for other health concerns. Most immediately, migrants are only released into the United States after having been cleared by medical screeners from the U.S. government. ""CBP personnel review all travelers entering the United States for general overt signs of illnesses ⁠— visual observation, questioning, and notification to CDC as appropriate ⁠— at all U.S. ports of entry,"" CBP spokeswoman Stephanie Malin said in a statement to PolitiFact. Customs and Border Protection and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""have closely coordinated to develop policies, procedures, and protocols to identify travelers at all ports of entry who may potentially be infected with communicable diseases and to minimize the risk to the traveling public,"" the statement said. In addition, the migrants from Congo would have been screened at every international border they crossed, for Ebola and any other health problems. ""They’ve gone through more health screenings in the past six months than most of us do in our lifetimes,"" Bridger said. Bridger, who said she’s been in contact with the CDC on migrant health screenings, said the migrants who show any ill effects have simply had colds or upper respiratory infections. All told, she said, fewer than 10 percent of the migrants coming through San Antonio are requesting medical services, ""and of those, maybe 1 percent have to go for further evaluations at a clinic or a hospital."" And third, there’s no guarantee that a migrant from Congo would be from the portion of the country grappling with the Ebola epidemic. The Democratic Republic of Congo is more than eight times bigger geographically than Texas is, and the Ebola outbreak has been concentrated in the North Kivu (or Kivu Nord) and Ituri provinces. Each of those provinces is smaller geographically than West Virginia.  (Wikimedia commons) So far, Bridger said, ""the migrants are not from the area of the Democratic Republic of Congo that is experiencing the current Ebola outbreak. There’s a much higher risk of someone bringing measles from New York than for someone who is coming from central Africa as an asylum seeker."" Conservative Daily Post published a headline saying, ""Disease-Ridden Congolese Migrants Dumped in San Antonio,"" and referencing an outbreak of Ebola in that region of Africa. While there is an Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo and while a number of Congolese immigrants have been showing up on the U.S.-Mexico border before being routed through San Antonio, government officials agree that none of these migrants have Ebola. Given their months-long journey, they would not have been healthy enough to reach the United States if they had been infected. Moreover, each migrant was screened by U.S. health officials before being let into the country, and they would have received multiple medical screenings before even reaching the United States.

The video, posted to Facebook-owned Instagram on June 7 by artist Bill Posters, shows Zuckerberg sitting at a desk with a CBSN broadcast banner along the bottom that says ""We’re increasing transparency on ads,"" making it look like it was taken from a news segment.

The deepfake was created by artists Bill Posters and Daniel Howe in collaboration with technology startups including CannyAI, Respeecher and Reflect, as part of an art installation called ""Spectre,"" according to Posters website. The installation displays videos of deepfake celebrities, including dead and living artists, the website says, to show how certain technologies can manipulate and alter data. The exhibit was on display at the Sheffield Doc/Fest in the United Kingdom from June 6-11. The original clip of Zuckerberg is from a 2017 video address he delivered explaining nine steps Facebook planned to take following findings that Russia interfered with 2016 U.S. elections using Zuckerberg’s social media platform. Omer Ben-Ami, co-founder of Canny AI, one of the video’s creators, told PolitiFact that the company develops a technology for video dialogue replacement using two videos, one of the person and another of the audio to be used. He said the company’s proprietary AI ""then trains on both videos and learns to reconstruct each facial movement of the actor,"" Ben-Ami wrote in an email ""...the initial training for this takes 12-24 hours."" For the Zuckerberg video, Ben-Ami said the original clip was selected by the artists, Posters and Howe, and they found a voice actor to read from a script. ""They then sent us the video they chose of Zuckerberg and the video of the voice actor,"" Ben-Ami said, ""and within less than a day our system created the video of Zuckerberg facial movement synced to the voice actor."" He added, ""For this specific exhibition we wanted to support Spectre's artists and also educate people about what can be done with the tech already today – this was a safe space where it was clear to the viewer the video was manipulated."" Hany Farid, a professor of computer science and digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley, agreed that the manipulation is clear.

The photo is of a suffragette protest for voting rights that was eventually named ""Black Friday"" – but it is not a picture of Susan B. Anthony and it was not taken in 1872 or in the United States. A reverse-image search led us to several websites that used the image as an example of the suffragette’s struggles in the early 20th Century. The photo appeared on the front cover of the British newspaper, the ""Daily Mirror,"" the day after approximately 300 women took to the streets of London on Nov. 18, 1910, to air their grievances of the shelving of the ""Conciliation Bill,"" which would have extended voting rights to almost a million women, mostly wealthy property-owners, according to the Museum of London. The protest led to the arrest of 119 women, who were later released without charges. The woman in the photo is widely believed to be suffragette Ada Wright, who was reportedly 50 years old at the time. According to reports, she was struck down by a policeman as she tried to enter the House of Commons. Wright reportedly later wrote about the experience and identified herself as the woman in the image. The passage can be found on page 261 in the 2004 book, ""Violent London: 2000 Years of Riots, Rebels and Revolts"" by Clive Bloom: ""...The police rode at us with shire horses...a policeman grabbed my arm and twisted it round and round until I felt the bone almost breaking and I sank to the pavement, helpless … The next morning I found I had been photographed lying on the ground..and the photograph occupied the front page of the Daily Mirror...There were headlines: BLACK FRIDAY."" Historian Kate Connelly also wrote about the event and identified Wright as the woman on the ground in the photograph: ""When the Daily Mirror published a photograph of suffragette Ada Wright lying collapsed on the ground, her hands clutching her face, the government tried to stop the newspaper being sold and ordered the negatives to be destroyed."" A viral photo on social media is captioned as depicting Susan B. Anthony being ""beaten and arrested for trying to vote"" in 1872. While the image was taken during a voting rights protest, the woman is not Susan B. Anthony, and the photo was not captured in the United States or in 1872. The image, believed to be of suffragette Ada Wright, was featured on the front cover of a British newspaper following a suffragette protest in London in November 1910.

"['National', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Ilhan Omar']","
Rep. Ilhan Omar's claim is high: There aren't 500 gun deaths per day in the US, it's closer to 100
","U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, who became a gun-control advocate after her 17-year-old son was shot to death, tweeted on June 5 that she was praying the U.S. Senate would adopt the House-passed Bipartisan Background Checks Act. That drew a retweet from a Democratic colleague, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who added this statement: ""Supporting my colleagues’ call on Senate Majority Leader to vote on H.R. 8, 1112 & 1158. Gun violence is an epidemic. Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence. How many more lives will we let gun violence claim?"" At 500 per day, that would be 182,500 deaths per year from gun violence in the United States. The actual figure is nowhere near that high. The legislation (H.R. 8) would establish new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties. Transfers would be prohibited unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. There would be some exceptions, such as a gift between spouses. Currently, only federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers are required to conduct a background check for someone seeking to obtain a gun. The House, which is controlled by Democrats, passed the bill 240-190 in February 2019. National Public Radio reported then that passage in the Republican-majority Senate is unlikely. The White House has signaled that President Donald Trump would veto the legislation, which is opposed by the NRA. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has declined to take up the bill. When we last examined the numbers, earlier this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported there had been 39,773 deaths related to firearms in 2017. 2017 is still the most recent year for which annual statistics from the CDC are available. The figure counts deaths resulting from suicides (60 percent of the total), homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths, as well as those from law enforcement. And it was the highest tally in at least 40 years. Meanwhile, the average over five years — 2013 through 2017  — is slightly lower, according to Brady, the nonprofit formerly known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Either way, the total gun deaths per day is far fewer than the 500 Omar claims: Total gun-related deaths, 2017: 39,773. Average per day: 109. Average annual gun-related deaths, 2013-2017: 36,383. Average per day: 100. Two other anti-gun violence groups  — Everytown for Gun Safety, which McBath became a spokeswoman for after her son’s death; and Giffords, which is named for former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona — also use figures of 100 deaths per day or fewer. To get near the figure that Omar used, you have to count nonfatal injuries as well as deaths. For 2017, the daily average comes to 475 cases of gun-related deaths and injuries, based on CDC figures. But the CDC itself says its injury estimate is ""unstable because of small sample size."" And an analysis by The Trace and FiveThirtyEight indicates the CDC could be overcounting the number of firearm injuries. Finally, Amnesty International states that every day more than 500 people die from gun violence  — around the world. That’s the figure Omar’s office cited to back up her statement, and it arguably is low. A study published in 2018 in the Journal of the American Medical Association said there are about 250,000 gun deaths worldwide per year. That would amount to 685 per day. But Omar’s claim was clearly made in the context of legislation that would affect gun transactions only in the United States. Omar’s spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, defended Omar’s use of the 500 figure. But he acknowledged to us that Omar’s tweet was in the context of domestic legislation and that the reference to 500 could have been more precise. Omar said, ""Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence."" Her claim was made in promoting legislation that would add new background check requirements for gun transfers made in the United States. Based on the latest federal figures, for 2017, the average per day was 109  — that’s counting deaths resulting from suicides, homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths as well as those from law enforcement. And it’s 100 if you use a five-year average for 2013 to 2017. We rate Omar’s statement False.",/factchecks/2019/jun/12/ilhan-omar/rep-ilhan-omars-claim-high-there-arent-500-gun-dea/
