Cost-shifting of uninsured is debated by the experts
","
President Barack Obama went on the Sunday news shows to make the case for health reform.
 

This Week

host George Stephanopolous questioned Obama on his support for an individual mandate, which requires everyone who can find affordable coverage to purchase health insurance.
 
Obama defended the matter as a fairness issue to people who now have coverage.
 
""Here's what's happening,"" Obama said. ""You and I are both paying 900 bucks on average — our families — in higher premiums because of uncompensated care. Now, what I've said is that, if you can't afford health insurance, you certainly shouldn't be punished for that. That's just piling on. 
 
""If, on the other hand, we're giving tax credits, we've set up an exchange, you are now part of a big pool. We've driven down the costs, we've done everything we can, and you actually can afford health insurance. But you've just decided, 'You know what? I want to take my chances,' and then you get hit by a bus, (then) you and I have to pay for the emergency room care.""
 
Health policy experts call this dynamic ""cost-shifting."" The idea is that hospitals treat uninsured patients for free or for below their costs, then make up for it by charging insured patients more. The hospitals bill the insurance companies at artificially higher rates, and the insurance companies pass the cost to customers through higher premiums.
 
Obama said for family coverage, the shift is $900. That's supported by a 2005 study by Families USA, a liberal advocacy group, which found the cost shift to people with insurance was $922 for a family policy and $341 for an individual policy.
 
Perhaps Obama was recalling this figure from the presidential campaign, though, because Families USA — a consumer-oriented nonprofit that advocates for better health care — commissioned a study released this year that found cost-shifting was higher. Insured people paid $1,017 more for a family policy and $368 more for an individual policy due to cost-shifting, according to the report.
 
But here's where things get a bit tricky. In 2008, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a report questioning the methodology of the Families USA study and hypothesizing that cost-shifting is not that significant.
 
Let's step back and explain what the experts are counting. They use federal data on medical expenditures to calculate the total amount spent on care for the uninsured. Then they subtract whatever the uninsured themselves paid for care, then what government and charities paid. The remainder of the cost is what people with insurance are paying for through higher premiums, according to Families USA.
 
When Kaiser looked for what the government was paying for uninsured care, it found a lot more than Families USA.
 
To give you an idea of how technical this can get, we'll quote from  the Kaiser study about the additional government spending it found. It found ""a share of Medicare IME, a portion of Medicaid supplemental payments made through upper payment limit (UPL) provisions, and federal and state direct service programs (community health center grants, maternal and child health grants, Ryan White CARE Act funds, the National Health Service Corps, Indian Health Service, and the Veterans Health Administration).""
 
The Kaiser study documented fluctuations in private premiums over many years, and the data don't seem to correlate with costs for the uninsured. Rather, cost-shifting is ""more strongly related to fluctuations in payments by Medicare and Medicaid,"" the Kaiser study said.
 
The Kaiser study did not set a per-policy number the way the Families USA study did. But Kaiser did say that cost-shifting might account for 1.7 percent of all private premiums.
 
So who is right? We reviewed the three studies and we don't see any obvious problems or conflicts. Families USA advocates for consumers, but its 2005 study was conducted under contract by Dr. Kenneth Thorpe of Emory University, a well-respected health care policy expert. Barring new evidence, this seems like a genuine disagreement between experts on a complex issue.
 
President Obama said ""You and I are both paying 900 bucks on average — our families — in higher premiums because of uncompensated care."" That's an accurate citing of older data. But another study found that cost-shifting for the uninsured was not significant. Because there's major disagreement on this issue, we rate Obama's statement Half True.

Obama says White Sox can still make the playoffs
","
At the conclusion of a wide-ranging interview on NBC's  Meet the Press  , President Barack Obama said he was holding out hope that his beloved Chicago White Sox can still make the playoffs. 
Host David Gregory asked him, ""On a lighter note, before I let you go, Mr. President, you were brazen this summer at the All-Star Game wearing your Chicago White Sox jacket out there to throw out the first pitch. Hate to break it to you, but doesn't look so good for your White Sox here. So I want to know who is your pick to win the World Series?"" 
Obama replied, ""You know — I am — I think mathematically, the White Sox can still get in the playoffs."" 
Here at PolitiFact, we're focused more on the American League East (Go Rays!), so we had lost track of how the White Sox were doing in the AL Central. We turned to our favorite baseball writer, Marc Topkin of the  St. Petersburg Times  , to find out if Obama was right. 
Topkin told us that while the White Sox are out of the running to be the wild-card team for the American League, it's mathematically possible they could still win their division and then be in the playoffs. 
As of Sunday morning when  Meet the Press  aired, the White Sox were 5 1/2 games behind the first-place Detroit Tigers. Topkin told us the White Sox ""wouldn't be mathematically eliminated until there were 6 games left, and going into today they have 13 left."" 
So Obama can hold out hope for at least another week or so. The odds are against the Sox — they play the Tigers and the Minnesota Twins, the No. 2 team in the division, in the next week. And Topkin noted that a lot of things have to break in favor of the Sox. 
But Obama is right that it's at least mathematically possible, so he earns a True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C22CCC0>],/factchecks/2009/sep/20/barack-obama/obama-says-white-sox-can-still-make-playoffs/

Alexander claims that cap-and-trade will cost consumer $1,761 a year
","It's hard to keep track of all those estimates about how much a cap-and-trade bill would cost American families. So, the latest prediction, coming from Sen. Lamar Alexander and other Republicans, is just adding to the confusion.
 
In a Sept. 16, 2009, press release, the Tennessean said, ""American families can’t afford a new $1,761 yearly energy tax.""
 
Similar numbers were widely posted on conservative blogs. A story on the  Weekly Standard  was headlined, ""Obama Admin Concedes: Cap and Trade Will Raise Your Taxes by 15%.""

Those were new numbers to us, so we decided to look into the claim.
 
But first, a little recap. At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting.
 
The cap-and-trade bill currently making its way through Congress was written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. It's an issue we've explored  several   times   over  .
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits is nothing more than a tax on consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass the cost of buying those permits on to consumers. There has been much debate about how much those costs could be, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Republicans often refer to it as a tax, although we have found that is incorrect. Only utilities that exceed their limits would have to pay for the allowances, which does not sound to us like a tax on families. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income.
 
The new numbers spring from some Treasury Department documents recently acquired by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, through a Freedom of Information Act request. Some of the documents are from 2008, shortly after the election, according to the group, and others are undated, though they appear to be from early 2009.
 
Nowhere in the documents does the Treasury Department cite the $1,761 figure. It seems Alexander got that number from a Sept. 15, 2009, story by Declan McCullagh, a blogger who writes the ""Taking Liberties"" column for CBS News. (Our calls to Alexander's office were not returned.) So it's worth noting that Alexander is relying not on a study by an economist, but on an estimate from a blogger.
 
""The Obama administration has privately concluded that a cap and trade law would cost American taxpayers up to $200 billion a year, the equivalent of hiking personal income taxes by about 15 percent,"" McCullagh wrote. ""A previously unreleased analysis prepared by the U.S. Department of Treasury says the total in new taxes would be between $100 billion to $200 billion a year. At the upper end of the administration's estimate, the cost per American household would be an extra $1,761 a year.""
 
We contacted McCullagh via e-mail, and he told us that he came up with $1,761 per household annually by simply dividing the number $200 billion by the number of households in the United States. According to the census, there are about 113.5 million households in the country this year.
 
We reviewed the estimate with people involved in the climate change debate who told us there are significant flaws in McCullagh's methodology. Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the math is too simple and doesn't reflect the true impact of the House bill, which specifies that any revenue from the plan be rebated to consumers to offset higher electrical bills they might have to pay. ""What [Treasury] was looking at was a situation where 100 percent of the permits were auctioned, and ignored what would be done with revenue,"" he said. The Waxman-Markey bill ""uses revenue to offset cost to consumers.""
 
There also have been changes to the bill since that Treasury document was created. Obama originally envisioned that every polluting permit would be sold, starting when the bill was enacted. But in the spirit of compromise, Waxman and Markey scaled back that plan by giving about 85 percent of the permits for free in the early years of the bill's implementation.

Also, under the latest version of the Waxman-Markey bill, which passed the House in June, 30 to 40 percent of the revenue would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher rates they would have to pay. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers.

""The bottom line is that it goes back to the consumers,"" Seidel said.
 
Seidel said there's another problem with the blogger's report, as quoted by the senator: the Treasury documents report that $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue raised each year by selling those pollution permits we mentioned earlier. Alexander and McCullagh incorrectly portray them as taxes. There are legitimate questions that can be raised about how much the cost might ultimately be passed on to consumers, but it is not correct to refer to the revenue as a tax.

And higher energy costs are not a sure thing. Regional cap-and-trade programs in Europe and in the northeast United States show that auctioning most or all credits have actually decreased the cost of energy, said Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan.
 
""What we've seen is that there's a lot of volatility,"" he said. ""It's hard to make those projections and say how these things are going to work as a result. That just underscores the difficulty of attaching numbers to these things that people can live with.""

Alan Krueger, the Obama administration's assistant treasury secretary for economic policy, sent us this statement via e-mail:
 
""The reporting on the Treasury memo is flat-out wrong,"" he wrote. ""Treasury's summary is consistent with public analyses by the EIA [Energy Information Administration], EPA, and CBO, and the reporting and blogging on this issue ignore the fact that the revenue raised from emission permits would be returned to consumers under both administration and legislative proposals.""
 
We spoke with Christopher Horner with the Competitive Enterprise Institute about the documents. He conceded that they don't reflect legislation currently under consideration, but he pointed out that the Senate is planning to start from scratch on the climate issue.
 
""Congress writes legislation for one reason,"" Horner said. ""This [document] sets forth the administration's desire and expectations.""
 
In the meantime, McCullagh has been  fielding criticism  about his column. On Sept. 16 he defended his analysis and wrote that revenue returned to consumers in the form of tax cuts and rebates is uncertain.
 
""The tax revenue might end up being directed at income tax cuts (or rescuing kittens and feeding orphans, for that matter), or it could end up being wasted on boondoggles,"" he wrote. ""If it is returned to American citizens, it's unlikely to be a wash: some people will end up paying much more in taxes, some will pay a little more, and some will see a net benefit.""
 
But back to Alexander's original claim. His statement that households will pay $1,761 in new taxes every year is based on a blogger's incorrect assumptions and overly simple math. The estimate does not account for revenue that will be returned to consumers in the form of rebates and other efficiency measures. Furthermore, the number is based on old numbers; the Treasury estimate was written on the premise that all permits would be sold, which, ultimately, is not the form that the Waxman-Markey legislation has taken. Finally, both Alexander and McCullagh portray money raised by selling these permits as a tax. We rate Alexander's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2AAD00>],/factchecks/2009/sep/18/lamar-alexander/alexander-claims-cap-and-trade-will-cost-consumer-/

TV ad overstates health insurance denials
","
Supporters of health care reform have portrayed insurance companies as insensitive and too quick to deny claims. In a recent television ad, Health Care for America Now, a group supporting the Democrats' health care reform bill, says insurance companies get wealthy by denying those claims.


The group's ad mockingly explains ""how to get rich"" by showing a ""book"" written ""by America's health insurance companies."" Chapter 3 reads, ""Deny 1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors."" A news release issued by HCAN attributed this statistic to a study released Sept. 2, 2009, by the California Nurses Association titled, ""California's Real Death Panels: Insurers Deny 21% of Claims."" (We checked

another claim

from the ad, about insurance companies paying CEOs $24 million per year, and rated it Barely True.)


In a news release summarizing the findings, the nurses' group — an influential union — explained that researchers from its staff and its affiliate, the National Nurses Organizing Committee, examined data disclosed by insurers to the California Department of Managed Care, the state agency that regulates HMOs. The researchers reported that from 2002 through June 30, 2009, six of the largest insurers operating in California rejected 47.7 million claims for care, or 22 percent of all claims. According to the nurses' group, during the first six months of 2009, PacifiCare denied 39.6 percent of claims; Cigna denied 32.7 percent; HealthNet denied 30 percent; Kaiser Permanente denied 28.3 percent; Blue Cross denied 27.9 percent and Aetna denied 6.4 percent.


But the California Department of Managed Care told us the study was misleading.


Lynne Randolph, the department's deputy director of communications, said that what the nurses' group portrayed as denials are not necessarily what most consumers would think of as denials. Most patients probably think of a denial as when their claim is rejected because the plan doesn't cover a treatment or a particular doctor, or because the patient has hit a limit on coverage. But Randolph said that a sizable chunk of the denials counted by the nurses' group — though the exact amount is unclear — are for other reasons that are simply part of the health care bureaucracy that do not really affect a consumer's care.
 
For instance, a claim might be denied because it was sent to the wrong insurer. (This is a common occurrence in California, Randolph and other experts said, because the state has many complicated business relationships between health plans and groups of doctors, and it's easy for claims to be unintentionally misdirected.) In fact, a patient may never even know that a given claim has been sent to the wrong place. Yet in the data used by the nurses' group, these claims are counted as denials.


For that matter, any claim denied during a given quarterly report is counted as a denial, even if that claim is eventually paid during a subsequent quarter. Claims could also be counted as denied because information on the form was missing or incorrect, even if that is later corrected and the claim is paid. And a claim sent simultaneously to two payers is counted twice, meaning that the same claim might be counted as both a completed payment and a denial.


Asked whether the nurses' group remains comfortable with its 1-in-5 estimate, spokesman Charles Idelson said it is. He noted that in the wake of the study's release, the state attorney general's office announced an ""independent inquiry into how health maintenance organizations review and pay insurance claims submitted by doctors, hospitals and other medical providers."" And he added that the group has received hundreds of reports from Californians about denied payments. ""There's no doubt that these type of denials are occurring,"" Idelson said.


Idelson added that even if the caveats cited by Randolph are valid, the fact that one of every five claims is denied at some stage adds to an administrative burden that hikes the cost of health care without improving care for patients.


Randolph and Idelson actually agree on one point: Reliable statistics on why denials are made are not currently available. While the department undertakes periodic audits by sampling claims data, Randolph said, officials do not have good data on the causes of denials, forcing them to speculate. Idelson said he hopes the attorney general's investigation provides a better handle on the reasons for denials.


The nurses' union numbers are significantly higher than other studies of denial rates.


In 2007, America's Health Insurance Plans — a group representing insurers — conducted an internal survey of data from 19 health plans to determine the percentage of claims denied for ""reasons that could affect consumers, including non-covered services, authorization issues, or network issues."" The survey found that 2.36 percent of claims were denied. Specifically, 1.2 percent were denied due to non-covered services, 0.36 percent were denied due to benefit limits having been met, and 0.34 percent were denied due to pre-authorization, referral or utilization review issues. Smaller percentages were denied for the provider not being in the patient’s network, for issues with eligibility or pre-existing conditions and for issues related to experimental or unapproved treatments.


A second study was produced by the American Medical Association, the main group representing doctors. The 2008 National Health Insurer Report Card found that for the biggest health insurers, rejection rates ranged from 2.65 percent to 6.8 percent — higher than AHIP's figures, but well below the nurses' study.


It should be noted that all three groups have vested interests in the health care debate. In fact, it's also worth noting that the nurses' group has clashed with California's Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who appointed the head of the California Department of Managed Care, although the department is mostly staffed by civil servants. Meanwhile, the state attorney general who is overseeing the investigation sparked by the nurses' report is Democrat Jerry Brown, a former governor who is running for an open gubernatorial seat next year.


Now that we have the politics out of the way, let's recap. The Health Care for America Now ad said that insurers ""deny 1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors."" But that claim is based solely on one study in one state, and in our view it doesn't provide enough evidence to back up the claim. The independent state agency that collected the data used in the nurses' study has raised significant doubt on the group's interpretations of that data. Many ""denials"" that were counted were not really what most people would consider a denial. And studies by other groups show much lower denial rates. So we rate this claim False.

Obama says decision to revoke insurance led to Illinois man's death
","
To show that insurance companies can be callous, President Barack Obama recently cited the case of an Illinois man who Obama said had died because of an insurer's decision.


""More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care,"" the president told a joint session of Congress on Sept. 9, 2009. ""It happens every day. One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it.""


The man Obama was referring to was Otto S. Raddatz, who died earlier this year. But Lynn Sweet, a reporter with the

Chicago Sun-Times

, found the president was wrong to blame Raddatz's death on the insurance company.


Raddatz, a restaurant owner, was insured by Fortis Insurance Co., according to congressional testimony by his sister, Peggy. In September 2004, at 59, he was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkins lymphoma and began chemotherapy. As he was preparing for a stem cell transplant for which timing was crucial, he was told that his coverage was being rescinded due to a ""routine"" review that had found that he'd failed to disclose having gallstones and an anyeurism. Explaining that the doctor had never even told him about the discovery, and that no treatment had ever been urged, Peggy Raddatz went to the state attorney general for help. Within weeks, the attorney general's office got the decision reversed, and Raddatz was able to proceed with his transplant.


The case drew national attention, including stories in Slate and on National Public Radio, and Peggy Raddatz testified twice to congressional commitees about her brother's story.


But the president's version of the story was challenged by a Sept. 13, 2009, blog post by Sweet, who covers the White House for the

Sun-Times

. She noted that the transplant went ahead and Raddatz lived for another three years — an indication that the company's decision to rescind his treatment didn't cause his death.


Peggy Raddatz's testimony backs this up. On June 16, 2009, Raddatz recounted the experience before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Raddatz is still angry with the insurer — in her prepared testimony, she called what the company did to her brother ""unethical"" and ""cruel"" — but she gave no indication that the delay hampered her brother's survival.


At one point, the full committee's ranking Republican, Joe Barton of Texas, asked Raddatz whether her brother had received the stem cell transplant he needed.


""He did indeed receive the stem cell transplant,"" she responded. ""It was extremely successful. It extended his life approximately three-and-a-half years. He did pass away January 6th of 2009, and he was about to have a second stem cell transplant. Unfortunately, due to certain situations, his donor became ill at the last minute, and so he did pass away on January 6th. But again, (the initial transplant) extended his life nearly three-and-a-half years. And at his age, each day meant everything to him.""


The White House acknowledges that the facts got garbled, but insists that the larger lessons from the story are unchanged.
 
""The story President Obama referenced in his speech underscores what so many Americans have learned the hard way: Insurance companies look for ways to rescind their coverage when you need it most,"" White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said. ""A media account of Mr. Raddatz’s story that the president relied on in his speech confused some of the details, but the underlying point remains the same.  President Obama wants to end the practice that allows insurance companies to pull insurance for individuals like Mr. Raddatz when they need it most.""
 
In her piece, Sweet noted that a fellow

Sun-Times

reporter, Cheryl V. Jackson, talked to Raddatz after the speech, and she had no complaint with Obama's account of her brother's death. ""The point is that my brother lost his insurance coverage when he was dying,"" the article quoted Raddatz as saying.


Still, the president said that Otto Raddatz's death was caused by a delay in his surgery caused by the insurer's decision to rescind his policy. But as Peggy Raddatz testified, government intervention enabled her brother to have the procedure, and he lived, despite his cancer, for another three and a half years. When Raddatz eventually died earlier this year, his sister said that his death came while waiting for a second procedure that did not happen because the transplant donor unexpectedly fell ill. Critics can still blame the insurance company for insensitivity — and it's true that the company only paid for Raddatz's treatment after the attorney general's office acted — but the evidence shows that it's inaccurate to say a delay in care caused his death. So we rate the president's statement False.

Olbermann glosses over detail on the Baucus plan
","When it comes to health reform, all eyes have been watching the powerful Senate Finance Committee. The committee has been trying to reach consensus between Democrats and Republicans. The committee released its findings on Wednesday in the form of a ""Chairman's mark,"" a report that sets out the parameters of legislation. None of the committee Republicans would support the bill at this stage. And some Democrats didn't like it much either. Liberal commentator Keith Olbermann of MSNBC savaged the proposal on his show  Countdown  that night, reserving particular criticism for committee chairman Sen. Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana. ""If it were up to Senator Max Baucus, middle-class families would be forced — literally forced — to pay far more on health care than they already do right now,"" Olberman said. ""Thirteen percent of what they make could be deducted directly from their paychecks and mainlined to insurance companies, the so-called 'Max Tax.'"" A few moments later he described the plan in more detail. Baucus' plan, he said, ""would give coverage to 30 million Americans who currently do not have any, first, by extending Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for the poor; next, by providing government subsidies to modest-income families and individuals to help them buy over-the-counter coverage. ... That means any individual making more than $32,500, or any family of four making more than $66,150, is on their own subject to the 'Max Tax' of 13 percent."" For families earning $66,000, he added, ""that is $700 a month they'd have to pay. If the families do not buy that insurance at that rate, they would be fined nearly half that amount."" We wanted to see if he was accurately describing the plan as a 13 percent ""tax"" for the middle class. We found Olbermann got a lot right —- especially in his lengthier explanation — but he also left out details that would provide a fuller picture of the Baucus plan. He was right about the expansion of Medicaid. Anyone who makes less than 133 percent of the poverty level would be eligible for Medicaid under the new plan. Right now, in addition to being poor, you also have to be either elderly, pregnant, blind or disabled. Olbermann's claim about the 13 percent ""tax"" is based on the caps that limit how much people would pay for health insurance. Baucus' plan caps the premiums for those who earn 133 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level. Some of these people would get credits to make up the difference between the caps and what the insurance would cost. If they get a credit, they would send their premium payments to the federal government, which would then pay the insurer. The caps on how much people would have to pay for insurance are based on their income. The caps gradually increase from an estimated 4.7 percent for people at the lowest income levels, up to 13 percent of income for people who earn 300 percent of the poverty level. They stay at the 13 percent level up to 400 percent of the poverty level. Olbermann used the example of a family of four at 300 percent of the poverty line. According to the plan, the family would have income of $66,150 and pay premiums of $8,600 a year, or $716 a month. So Olbermann's numbers are solid. We have to add a few caveats here, though. Olbermann twice called these payments a tax. They are not a tax. They are a cap on premiums paid for health insurance. Other Democratic health reform plans in Congress have similar requirements that ""force"" people to buy insurance or pay a penalty. Their caps on premiums are more generous than 13 percent, but they still require people to pay a percentage of their income for insurance. For a detailed comparison of the three Democratic bills on this point, the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has created a  handy chart  . The center has criticized the Baucus plan for not being as generous for people of modest incomes as the other Democratic plans. Another caveat to Olbermann's remarks is that under Baucus' plan, none of this applies to people who already have coverage some other way. If people of modest incomes get coverage through work, for example, they keep paying whatever it is they pay now. They would not have to pay additional premiums or a penalty. Finally, we want to note that it is very difficult to make a direct comparison of how much people who now buy insurance on their own would pay under the reform plans, because the proposals would substantially change requirements for what medical treatment must be covered. We hoped to either confirm or refute Olbermann's statement that families would be forced ""to pay far more on health care than they already do right now."" But if they buy on the individual market, we're not sure what they're paying now. We looked for current data on this point, but were unable to find it. Right now, standards for minimum coverage vary greatly from state to state. This state-to-state variation also makes it difficult to find current data on what an ""average"" price for a family of four pays for an ""average"" plan. Obviously, if a family is uninsured now, they're going to pay more to get coverage. So back to the statement we are fact-checking. Olbermann said that for middle-class families, the Baucus plan would mean that "" 13 percent of what they make could be deducted directly from their paychecks and mainlined to insurance companies, the so-called 'Max Tax.'"" He's right that for people who are uninsured now, the upper limit would be 13 percent, and that money would go to insurance companies. But it's to pay for coverage they don't have now — not a tax — and some people would pay less. And all of the plans under consideration in Congress require people to pay something for coverage. So we rate Olbermann's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1E7F00>],/factchecks/2009/sep/17/keith-olbermann/olbermann-glosses-over-detail-baucus-plan/

ACORN admitted as much when chief executive Bertha Lewis referred to the conduct as ""the indefensible action of a handful of our employees."" ACORN has canned or suspended some of the employees, and ordered mandatory training for employees and an independent review. Meanwhile, a number of Republican lawmakers — who have long been critical of the voter registration practices of this left-leaning group — have called for a federal investigation and to cut off all federal funding to the group. While ACORN has taken a public beating, some conservatives renewed accusations of close past ties between President Barack Obama and ACORN. ""Is it time for him (Obama) to weigh in on this group (ACORN), with which he does have some considerable ties, or at least he did?"" Fox News' Megyn Kelly asked Republican strategist Karl Rove on Sept. 16, 2009.

""Yeah, he used to be a lawyer for them,"" Rove replied. ""Look, it is a problem for him,"" Rove said. ""This is a key element of his campaign. They played a huge role in voter registration efforts last year."" Obama has not commented on the ACORN situation this week. But the same day Kelly raised the question on Fox, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs condemned the comments made by ACORN employees on some of the videos. ""Obviously the conduct that you see on those tapes is completely unacceptable,"" Gibbs said in a daily press briefing on Sept. 16. ""I think everyone would agree with that."" But what about Obama's ties to ACORN? Was Rove correct that Obama used to be a lawyer for ACORN? We first looked at this during the presidential race when the Sen. John McCain campaign made a similar claim about Obama. And here's the skinny: Obama graduated from law school in 1991, worked on the book that would become his memoir  Dreams From My Father  , and directed a voter registration drive in 1992. After that, Obama went to work for a civil rights law firm then named Davis, Miner, Barnhill and Galland. (It is now known only as Miner, Barnhill and Galland.) The firm's specialty is civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development work.  Obama and two other attorneys represented ACORN in a 1995 federal civil lawsuit against the state of Illinois — Gov. James Edgar and other state officials were the named defendants — to demand that it enforce a new federal law known as ""motor voter,"" which allowed people to register to vote when they got their drivers' licenses. There were five other named plaintiffs in the case, but ACORN was the lead plaintiff. Among the groups that sided with ACORN in the matter: the U.S. Department of Justice and the League of Women Voters. The courts concluded that Illinois had to enforce the law, and the case generated several federal court orders through 1995 and 1996. During the final presidential debate on Oct. 15, 2008, Republican opponent McCain said the country deserved to know ""the full extent of Sen. Obama's relationship with ACORN."" Said Obama: ""ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.

""It had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs."" But as evidence of deeper ties, some have pointed to that voter registration drive we mentioned earlier, one that Obama directed in 1992 for Project Vote, a nonprofit focused on voter rights and education. Back in 1992, Project Vote and ACORN were separate organizations with common goals: getting people to vote, especially low-income, minority and young voters. But in 1994, Project Vote went through a reorganization and the two organizations began to partner with each other on voter registration. But even in 1992, the groups were close. In a 2004 article in  Social Policy  , Toni Foulkes, a Chicago ACORN leader, said that under Obama's leadership, Project VOTE in 1992 delivered 50,000 newly registered Illinois voters that helped Carol Moseley Braun win a Senate seat. Of those 50,000 votes, Foulkes wrote, ""ACORN delivered about 5,000 of them."" ""Since then,"" Foulkes wrote, ""we have invited Obama to our leadership training sessions to run the session on power every year."" The Obama campaign Web site fightthesmears.com states that ACORN never hired Obama as a trainer, organizer or any type of employee. When Obama met with ACORN leaders in November 2007, he reminded them of his affinity for ACORN and his time as a Project Vote organizer. Sen. Obama said, ""I come out of a grass roots organizing background. That's what I did for three and half years before I went to law school. That's the reason I moved to Chicago was to organize. So this is something that I know personally, the work you do, the importance of it.  I've been fighting alongside ACORN on issues you care about my entire career. Even before I was an elected official, when I ran the Project Vote voter registration drive in Illinois, ACORN was smack dab in the middle of it, and we appreciate your work."" ACORN's political action committee endorsed Obama for president. We note that Obama said he worked ""alongside"" ACORN, but not  for  ACORN. And ACORN itself says Obama didn't work for them during that time. We provide all of this information so that you can decide how deep the president's ties are with the embattled ACORN. As for Rove's claim that Obama used to be a lawyer for ACORN, yes, Obama once took on a case for ACORN. But Obama was never a staff attorney for ACORN. He did not do ongoing work for the organization. He handled o  ne  case along with two other attorneys. ACORN was one of several plaintiffs. And the U.S. Department of Justice sided with ACORN in the case. We think Rove's comment suggests a deeper legal relationship between Obama and ACORN than actually existed. And so we rule Rove's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E64540>],/factchecks/2009/sep/17/karl-rove/rove-claims-obama-used-to-be-lawyer-for-acorn/

Health care advocacy group blasts insurers for CEO pay packages
","
Supporters of health care reform have portrayed insurance company CEOs as overpaid villains. In a recent television ad, Health Care for America Now, a group supporting the Democrats' health care reform bill, takes direct aim at the CEOs.


The group's ad mockingly explains ""how to get rich"" by showing a ""book"" written ""by America's health insurance companies."" Chapter 2 reads, ""Pay your CEO $24,000,000 a year."" A news release issued by HCAN attributed the assertion to the entry for Ronald A. Williams, CEO of insurance giant Aetna, in the 2008

Forbes

magazine executive compensation survey.


We checked

Forbes

, which compiles the total compensation from public filings of salaries and stock options, and the $24 million figure does indeed jibe with the entry the group cited. But we wondered whether it was fair to use Williams as an example of health insurance CEOs. So we looked through the magazine's full rankings for a bit more context.


One thing to note up front is that HCAN used

Forbes

' 2008 survey, even though the 2009 survey is available. Oddly, if the group had used the more recent numbers, Williams' compensation would actually have been higher: In the 2009

Forbes

survey, Williams' compensation was listed as $38.125 million.


That said, Williams' pay package was easily the highest in the health insurance sector, according to

Forbes

. Here are seven health insurance CEOs who made the 2009

Forbes

list. (All lead publicly traded companies, which have more stringent disclosure requirements than private firms.)


-- 22nd place among all CEOs: Ronald A. Williams, Aetna, $38.125 million


-- 135th place: H. Edward Hanway, Cigna, $10.27 million


-- 269th place: Stephen J. Hemsley, UnitedHealth Group, $5.035 million


-- 306th place: Angela F. Braly, WellPoint, $4.07 million


-- 359th place: Robert B. Pollock, Assurant, $3.14 million


-- 387th place: Allen F. Wise, Coventry Health Care, $2.6 million


-- 399th place: Michael B. McCallister, Humana, $2.39 million


The average for the other six executives above was $3.93 million — almost one-tenth of what Williams was paid. So it's clear that HCAN has chosen the highest-paid CEO for its purposes.


We should note that executive compensation is notoriously complicated to calculate, since it often includes a mix of salary, benefits, deferred compensation and stock options. Indeed, different sources reported the same CEO pay package differently. For instance, the current listing on Yahoo! Finance has Williams' salary at $3.04 million with no stock options — a number that would have made HCAN's ad highly misleading. However, for the sake of consistency, we will stick with the

Forbes

methodology.


We won't venture an opinion on whether these CEOs' salaries are merited, but we did talk to one expert who provided some cross-industry context: Graef Crystal, a veteran consultant and analyst on executive compensation who is also a columnist for Bloomberg News. In a recent column inspired by congressional Democrats' denunciations of the health insurance sector, Crystal offered some calculations designed to gauge whether CEOs in the health insurance sector were overpaid or underpaid compared to executives in other sectors.
 
Crystal's math is complicated, but the bottom line is that when he looked at compensation for the five biggest health insurers' CEOs in 2007 and 2008, Williams' pay package was the only one of that group that in both years was bigger than the typical compensation package for CEOs throughout all the industries Crystal studied. Most of the other health insurance CEOs were paid 15 percent to 81 percent below the typical level calculated by Crystal. In other words, Williams was the one health insurance CEO who has consistently been paid on the highest end of the scale.
 
The ad leaves viewers with the impression that $24-million is a typical compensation for a health insurer's CEO. But in fact, it is the highest example and the average of the others is considerably lower — just under $4 million. So HCAN has certainly cherry-picked the most dramatic number. We find the claim Barely True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Tom Price']","
Medicare's history as public option
","Rep. Tom Price of Georgia sent a letter to doctors in September 2009 urging them to oppose Democratic initiatives on health reform. ""If health care reform is taken down the wrong path, it will end in nothing short of disaster,"" the three-term Republican wrote. Price, who is an orthopedic surgeon, singled out plans for a public option for the most criticism. ""As a fellow doctor, I know you have personally navigated the federal health care system of our first 'public option' — Medicare,"" Price wrote. ""And I know your experience will tell you that government-run programs many times mean restrictive coverage rules, endless bureaucratic delays, and inadequate financing structures. . . . ""There will be no turning back, no reversing the government intrusion that Democrats desire,"" he warned. ""Medicare began as a public option and now holds 97 percent of the market share."" We were interested in checking whether Medicare began as a public option and whether Price is right about its current market share. To check this, we turned to several books on the history of Medicare and spoke with a couple of experts in the field. It's difficult to concisely summarize decades of health policy and legislative history, but we'll try. Medicare had been discussed by presidents since the 1940s, but its big moment began in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson was elected by a large margin, along with Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate. Johnson relied on Rep. Wilbur Mills, a conservative Democrat from Arkansas, to craft the legislation and move it through the House Ways and Means Committee. Johnson kept close tabs on the process. There were arguments about what should be in the bill and how it should be paid for. Mills decided to combine the proposals of several factions into one package to maximize support. He started with the administration's proposal to cover hospital services for the elderly, now known as Medicare Part A. He also included a proposal promoted by the committee's senior Republican member, John Byrnes of Wisconsin, who wanted coverage for physicians' services, now Medicare Part B. Finally, Mills included coverage for poor elderly Americans, which is today's Medicaid. The histories of Medicare that we reviewed emphasized that the part of Medicare that covered visits to doctors' offices was voluntary. Here's how an April 8, 1965, report in the  New York Time  s described the plan: ""As revised, the bill provides the basic hospitalization and nursing care benefits originally proposed by the administration while covering major doctor bills and many other medical expenses under a supplementary insurance program in which participation would be voluntary. ""The basic benefits, financed by increases in the Social Security payroll tax, would be automatically available to persons over 65. The additional coverage would be available to those over 65 who enrolled in the voluntary plan and paid premiums of $3 a month. Half of the voluntary plan's cost would be financed by federal subsidies of about $600 million a year from general tax revenues."" Johnson signed the Medicare law on July 30, 1965, and the program's aministrators began an intensive recruitment drive. At the end of the first year, participation was up to 93 percent of the elderly, according to  The Politics of Medicare  , a history by Theodore Marmor. Subsequent research indicates that Medicare participation has remained very high among those who qualify for the program, at roughly 97 percent in recent years, according to  Medicare: A Policy Primer  , a 2005 book by Marilyn Moon. All of this supports Price's statement, with one exception. As we reviewed the history of Medicare, we noticed that legislators and policymakers drafting the legislation seemed to assume that Medicare participation would be very high. We could find nothing implying that Medicare coverage would compete with private insurers in paying for coverage. Marmor, author of  The Politics of Medicare  , confirmed that perception when we asked him. Marmor witnessed the Medicare negotiations firsthand when he worked as assistant on the drafting of the 1965 legislation. ""The voluntary part was a mirage,"" he said. ""They fully expected most people to join, because the terms were so attractive. And that's exactly what happened."" This is markedly different from today's debate and discussion about the public option. Obama has said the public option would be one among many insurance proposals from which people could choose, and that it would be a backstop to keep private insurers honest. He also said it should not be subsidized by other tax revenues but pay for itself with customer premiums. A spokesman for Price said the Democrats can say the public option will be limited, but it won't be. ""While they claim it's a public option, the end goal is saturation,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Price. We're noting that disagreement for the record. For a fuller explanation of the public option and how it fits into overall reform effort, read our story  Health care reform: A simple explanation  . But getting back to Price's statement, we find the following: He is right that Medicare was a public plan and its coverage of physicians' services was voluntary, which is another way to say ""optional."" And its participation rate among eligible seniors is close to 97 percent. But we take a notch off our rating to acknowledge that people disagree about whether the words ""public option"" today are the same as Medicare's ""voluntary"" Part B in 1965. It's important to note that the founders of Medicare expected that nearly every senior would be covered by Part B, while the Democrats' ""public option"" today is envisioned as just one of many options in the health care exchange. We rate Price's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B71540>],/factchecks/2009/sep/16/tom-price/medicares-history-public-option/
"['National', 'History', 'John Boehner']","
Boehner claims his chamber has never passed a resolution of disapproval to punish a member
","
Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina has received a proverbial slap on the wrist for yelling ""You lie!"" during President Barack Obama's recent address to Congress.

 

The scuffle officially ended Sept. 15, 2009, when the House of Representatives passed 240-179 a resolution disapproving of Wilson's behavior during the speech six days earlier.

 

But before the vote, Republican Leader John Boehner gave the majority a piece of his mind.

 

""We all know Joe Wilson. He is a decent man. And to put him through this on the floor of the House I think is unacceptable, and it is a partisan stunt,"" Boehner said on the House floor. ""There has been behavior that has gone on around here far more serious than this, and it didn't bring a resolution to the floor to condemn someone's behavior. Yes people have made mistakes. Some have come down to the floor and apologized, others have not. But none of it -- none of it -- required a resolution. ... Never has this happened before.""

 

Passing the resolution would set a bad precedent, Boehner said.

 

Given all the mischief lawmakers have gotten themselves into in the past, we wondered whether Boehner was right, that the House had never passed a resolution of disapproval to condemn a member's behavior.

 

Some background: During his Sept. 9 speech, Obama said, ""There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false — the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.""

 

Wilson yelled from the crowd, ""You lie!"" We put Wilson's outburst to the Truth-O-Meter, which you can read about

here

.

 

According to the Constitution, Congress has a right to punish its own members for such misconduct.

 

Article 1, Section 5, Clause 2 of the Constitution states that, ""Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.”

 

And it turns out such reprimands can come in multiple forms, according to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives.

 

An expulsion, for example, requires a two-thirds majority vote in the House. The maneuver was most recently used on July 24, 2002, to rid the chamber of former Rep. James Traficant, a Democrat from Ohio who went to jail for trading political favors for cash and gifts. He was released from prison on Sept. 2, 2009.

 

Other examples include censures and reprimands, which only require a majority for passage and simply express a formal disapproval of the conduct.

 

A resolution of disapproval -- Wilson's punishment -- is more often used as a way for the House to condemn a foreign or executive branch action. It is a sentiment and carries no force of law.

 

However, it is rarely used as an internal disciplinary tool, said Anthony Wallis, research analyst for the historian's office, who described the action as the least severe of the many forms of congressional punishment.

 

While there may be more such instances deep in congressional history - finding them would require reviewing reams of legislation introduced since the founding of Congress - the only example the historian's office could readily find was against Rep. Bill Thomas, who, in 2003 as the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called in the U.S. Capitol Police to remove Democratic panel members who were protesting Thomas' handling of a pension bill. The resolution was dropped by a vote of 170-143.

 

So, back to Boehner's claim. In recent history, there's only been one instance of the chamber specifically using a resolution of disapproval to punish a lawmaker, though the historian's office said there may be more. Given that small bit of uncertainty, we give Boehner a Mostly True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Howard Dean']","
Dean says U.S. is only democracy without universal health care
","
Supporters of health care reform have often said health coverage in the United States lags behind other countries. On the Sept. 13 edition of NBC's

Meet the Press

, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean said the United States should meet the standards of its international peers.


Dean, who just stepped down after serving as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said that ""America can do anything. Every other democracy in the world has a health care system that covers everybody, and we don't. Of course we can do this. How ridiculous.""


But is he right that the United States is alone among democracies? No.


It is true that most, if not all, industrialized democracies in Western Europe have systems that experts consider universal coverage, as do wealthier countries such as Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. But other democracies fall short, according to international statistics and a half-dozen experts we spoke with.


While dozens of countries are classified as democracies, we chose to examine a few that are large and have been politically stable in recent years. Here's the lowdown on their degree of health coverage:


-- India. In the cities, and especially for families with means, the medical care ranks among the best in the world. But hundreds of millions of Indians are desperately poor, and about three-quarters live in rural villages. For these Indians, health care is sporadic and substandard.


""In theory, India has a publicly financed and publicly provided health care delivery system, aside from its large private sector, that is available at heavily subsidized rates to everyone,"" said Ajay Mahal, an international health economist at Harvard's School of Public Health. ""Thus, one could say that it does have a health system that 'covers' everybody. In practice, however, at least at primary health care facilities in rural areas, doctors and health workers are often absent from work. Drugs tend to be unavailable in many public facilities and there are long lines to contend with at public hospitals. This leads to lots of people opting for private care — and for that they have to pay out of pocket. In this sense you could say that the system does not cover everybody.""


-- Mexico. The United States' southern neighbor has a constitution that guarantees universal health care, and observers credit the Mexican government with launching Seguro Popular, a federal program that targets the uninsured. For better-off Mexicans, health insurance and facilities are similar to what is found in richer nations. But in practice, the Mexican system falls short of universal coverage.


The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of wealthy countries that includes Mexico, reported that in 2007, 65.7 percent of Mexicans had either public or private health insurance. All other OECD countries — except for Turkey (see below) and the United States — either reached 100 percent or came very close to doing so.


David C. Warner, a professor of health and social policy at the University of Texas who has studied health care in Mexico, said that ""in reality, I would say it falls short"" of universal coverage. Mexicans are ""guaranteed public health clinics and hospitals, but those tend to be fairly spotty.""


-- Turkey. The other OECD nation besides the United States to fall short of full coverage is Turkey. The most recent statistics, from 2003, show that 67.2 percent of Turks were covered. A 2008 report by the U.S. Library of Congress found that ""the rural population is poorly served by the health care system"" and that ""workers in Turkey’s large informal economic sector generally lack health coverage.""


For the past six years, the governing party has been implementing a plan to broaden coverage, so the number has likely risen. ""Turkey is in transition to make health care universal,"" said Mustafa Younis, a health economist at Jackson State University who has studied the Turkish system.


A number of other large democratic countries have struggled with carrying out their stated promises to provide universal coverage. In South Africa and the Philippines, for instance, widespread poverty, insufficient health budgets and a shaky medical infrastructure — especially in rural areas — have posed steep challenges, experts say.


We called Dean to ask about his comment. A spokeswoman said that the former governor ""simply misspoke. He meant to say, as he has for years, that every other industrialized democracy"" has universal coverage.


If Dean had said that, he'd probably be right. But on

Meet the Press

, he didn't, so we rate his statement False.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Thomas Sowell']","
Sowell claims stimulus was rushed through Congress in two days
","
In a recent column in

Investor's Business Daily

, economist and political commentator Thomas Sowell said that President Barack Obama was trying to rush his health care bill through Congress. Sowell cited the quick passage of the economic stimulus bill in February 2009 as proof that Obama is too hasty in passing major legislation.
 
Sowell wrote that ""the administration was successful in rushing a massive spending bill through Congress in just two days — after which it sat on the president's desk for three days, while he was away on vacation.""
 
We wondered if Sowell was right, so we checked the bill's timeline.
 
It's important to note that the bill had been under discussion for at least two months before it was formally introduced. When Obama announced his selection of economic advisers on Nov. 24, 2008, he said he had asked his team to come up with a stimulus plan to help struggling automakers, stabilize the financial system, create jobs and invest in infrastructure.
 
A search of

Thomas

, the Library of Congress Web site that tracks legislation, shows that H.R. 1, the economic stimulus bill known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, was formally introduced in the House on Jan. 26. (In fact, four days before the bill was formally introduced, it was discussed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.) On Jan. 28, two days after the bill was introduced, it was passed by the full House in a party-line vote.
 
The Senate took longer. Senators received the bill Jan. 29 and passed it Feb. 10.
 
Then, the House and Senate had to work out their differences in a conference committee. It finished work on Feb. 12.
 
Finally, on Feb. 13 — almost three weeks after the bill was introduced in the House — the final version was approved by both houses.

 
So it took nearly three weeks to pass Congress, not two days as Sowell claims. And the bill had been under discussion since at least November.
 
The second part of Sowell's claim was that that bill ""sat on the president's desk for three days, while he was away on vacation."" We checked with the White House, and a spokeswoman told us the president received the bill on Feb. 16, 2009, and signed it into law the very next day.
 
The Thomas Web site confirmed that. Although the bill was cleared for the White House by the Senate on Friday, Feb. 13, it wasn't formally presented to the president until the following Monday, Feb. 16. He signed it Feb. 17. Obama did spend that weekend in Chicago to celebrate Valentine's Day with first lady Michelle Obama, but the bill had not been formally presented to him, contrary to Sowell's claim that it was sitting on his desk. (Sowell did not respond to an e-mail from PolitiFact.)
 
Congress acted quickly on the stimulus bill — after all, the purpose was to rapidly pump money into the economy — but it took far longer than the two days that Sowell claimed. And Obama signed the bill the day after he received it, not three days later as Sowell claimed. We rate his claim False.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Paul Hipp']","
Rocker in viral video mocks U.S. for 37th-best health care in world
","
With biting sarcasm, singer Paul Hipp says the United States should be proud of its global ranking on health care.


""We're No. 37!"" he sings in a YouTube video released Sept. 9, 2009. 


With some electric guitar riffs and topical references to the summer's vitriolic debate over health care reform — including Rep. Joe Wilson's ""You lie!"" heckle of President Barack Obama — the satiric romp ""celebrates"" the United States' standing:



We're No. 37

We're the U.S.A.

We're No. 37

And we're so proud to say

We got old people crying at the pharmacy

Pay your deductible

This ain't the land of the f-f-f-free Grandma

We're No. 37



We're the U.S.A.



The number refers to the World Health Organization's ranking of the United States as the 37th best health care system in the world, out of 191 countries. In a cheeky countdown, the video shows viewers a cross-section of nations that ranked better than the United States in WHO's tally — a mix of industrialized nations in Western Europe, Scandinavia and Asia; wealthy oil producers from the Middle East; tiny realms of prosperity such as Monaco and Luxembourg; and some seemingly unlikely nations such as Colombia, Cyprus, Morocco, Dominica and Costa Rica.


It's an anthem for health care reform that even shows its sources: Hipp includes a shot of himself looking at WHO's report. So he wins points for transparency in sourcing.


But as hummable as the song is, we thought it deserved a bit of scrutiny. How did WHO arrive at the numbers? And how widely accepted is the health organization's methodology? Ultimately, did Hipp choose a good benchmark on which to base his song?


Observers generally agree on two things about the report. It was a landmark study that attracted a lot of attention around the world. And its conclusions have inspired controversy for nearly a decade.


We should point out that the ranking is actually not new. WHO, an arm of the United Nations, published the international comparison in its

World Health Report 2000

, and it hasn't been updated since. (Other groups have offered their take, as we explain below.)


Five factors went into WHO's calculation:
 
• Health level, as defined by a measure of life expectancy, which shows how healthy a country's population is. This factor gets a 25 percent weight.


• Responsiveness, which includes factors such as speed of health services, privacy protections, choice of doctors and quality of amenities. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight.


• Financial fairness, which measures how progressive or regressive the financing of a country's health care system is — that is, whether or not the financial burdens are borne by those who are economically better off. This factor receives a 25 percent weight.


• Health distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care resources are allocated among the population. This factor receives a 25 percent weight.


• Responsiveness distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care responsiveness (which we defined above) is spread through society. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight.


Once these statistics were collected, the WHO combined them into two summary rankings. One, called ""overall attainment,"" is the basic weighted average of the five factors listed above. The other, called ""overall performance,"" took that number and adjusted it for how well a country's health system was doing compared to how well WHO's experts believed it

should

be doing based on education level and economic resources.


Using the second of the two ratings — overall performance — the United States does indeed rank 37th. But using the first factor — overall attainment — the United States does better, finishing 15th. One might be tempted to downgrade Hipp's song for cherry-picking the less favorable number, but Hipp seems to be on solid ground here. The WHO itself considers overall performance to be the more important ranking of the two. In a news release accompanying the original report, the WHO placed the 37th-place ranking right near the top and never even mentioned the 15th-place ranking. So it seems fair to us for Hipp to focus on that number.


Of course, any ranking — whether it's

U.S. News and World Report

's ranking of universities or the WHO's ranking of health systems — is subject to disputes over what factors should be included. In his 2009 book,

The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper and Fairer Health Care

, journalist T.R. Reid finds value in the WHO's study even as he acknowledges that it is ""all but impossible to design a single rating scale that would accommodate countries ranging from Monaco (population, 33,000; per capita income, $30,000 per year) to Nigeria (population 101 million; per capita income, $310 per year).""


Despite some quibbling on technical matters, most observers broadly agree that two of the WHO's five measures — health level and responsiveness — are reasonable. The first statistic gauges health outcomes, which are obviously a health care system's No. 1 goal, and the second seeks to measure how well a health system works when interacting with patients, another widely agreed upon mission.


But there is far less consensus over the other three factors. Concerns stem from a mix of methodology and ideology.


Glen Whitman, an associate professor of economics at California State University at Northridge, offers one critique in a paper for the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Suppose, for instance, that Country A has health responsiveness that is 'excellent' for most citizens but merely 'good' for some disadvantaged groups, while Country B has responsiveness that is uniformly 'poor' for everyone,"" he writes. ""Country B would score

higher

than Country A in terms of responsiveness distribution, despite country A having better responsiveness than Country B for even its worst-off citizens.""


Whitman also joins other conservatives in taking issue with the assumption that the rich should pay a similar percentage of their income for health care as the poor do. Because basic mathematics suggests that those with smaller incomes will naturally spend a larger share on highly important items such as food and health care, doing well in WHO's rankings almost requires a steeply progressive tax structure.


WHO officials make no bones about their desire to push countries in the direction of aiding the have-nots. They gave the controversial factors that reward socioeconomic fairness 62.5 percent weight, compared with only 37.5 percent for the broadly accepted factors of health level and responsiveness.
 
Tweak the weighting a little bit and a country such as the United States rises or falls in the rankings. For instance, judged on responsiveness alone, the United States ranked No. 1 in the world. A bigger weight for that factor — and a smaller weight for financial fairness, where the United States ranked 54th in the world — would have given the country a much higher ranking.
 
Adding other factors could also change the results. A 2001 paper in the journal

Science

found that adding just one more variable into the mix changed the rankings dramatically for 79 of 96 countries studied.
 
Meanwhile, Whitman also raised questions about the WHO's ""overall performance"" measure — the one in which a country's health ranking is adjusted for its education level and economic resources. (This is the category in which the United States finished 37th.) The implication from the WHO itself as well as subsequent news reports, Whitman wrote, ""is that the United States performs badly ...

despite

its high expenditures."" In fact, he writes, in the WHO's statistical model, America's first-in-the-world expenditures for health care actually hurt its ranking in overall performance by setting the theoretical bar it had to reach very high. ""A more accurate statement is that the United States performs badly

because

of its high expenditures, at least in part,"" Whitman writes.


Finally, a number of other critics say that WHO listened to the experts but did not measure public satisfaction with health care.


A paper published in the journal

Health Affairs

found the rankings did not necessarily reflect whether people were happy with their country's health coverage. For instance, Italy finished second in WHO's study, even though only 20 percent of its citizens say they were satisfied with their health care system. Meanwhile, Denmark ranked 16th in the WHO report even though 91 percent of Danes say they were satisfied.


So while Hipp is right that the United States ranked 37th in the most widely known barometer in the WHO study, it ranked 15th by another WHO ranking and, for one factor (responsiveness) it actually ranked No. 1. Still, this is a rock song, and a well-sourced one at that. So we find Hipp's claim to be Mostly True.

Rob Cornilles attacks David Wu over Oregon’s high unemployment rate
","
Oregon's unemployment rate has hovered around 10.6 percent for nearly a year and a half, a full point or so above the national jobless rate.

Economists have offered a slew of reasons why the state's jobless rate has remained consistently above most other states’. Those explanations range from a net in-migration of new residents, who increase the number of people looking for jobs, to quality-of-life considerations that tend to keep newly jobless Oregonians from wanting to wander elsewhere.

First District congressional challenger Rob Cornilles, the Tualatin Republican taking on veteran Democrat David Wu, has his own views on the matter.

""For each and every one of the 137 months that David Wu has been in Congress,"" Cornilles'  statement in The Oregonian’s Voter Guide asserts, ""Oregon's unemployment rate has been above the national average. We deserve better!""

The basis of Cornilles' claim appears to be that policies and practices endorsed by Wu have led to higher joblessness here than elsewhere for the past 137 months, or 11.5 years. Specifically,  Cornilles criticizes Wu for ""not providing tax certainty"" by failing to extend the Bush-era tax cuts; for supporting the federal stimulus bill; and for failing, after during 12 years in Congress, to gain the kind of influence that would help create jobs across the First Congressional District.

He’s right that Wu and the rest of Congress did not extend the tax cuts before the current break. He’s right Wu voted for the stimulus. And on the 137-month claim, Cornilles is also correct.

And then some. But is it fair to link Wu to that statistic?

PolitiFact Oregon looked back to 1976, when the state began tracking employment rates. According to state and federal data, Oregon has traditionally and consistently been above the national unemployment figure.

Only for 66 of the past 418 months, in fact, has Oregon's unemployment rate dipped below the federal rate.

Oregon nearly pulled even with the U.S. rate for the first few months in 2008. Both the national and state unemployment figures hovered just above 5 percent before skyrocketing in ensuing months as the worst overall economy since the Great Depression took hold.

The most recent time Oregon's unemployment rate was below the national rate was February 1996, according to Tom Potiowsky, state economist. That was nearly three years before Wu took office.

""With a few exceptions, we were pretty much below the national average from the mid-1990s until February 1996,"" Potiowsky said. Oregon's high-tech boom years accounted for much of that boost, he said.

State economists cite several reasons for the state generally lagging behind the nation on this measure.

In addition to the quality of life and net in-migration factors cited above, they include the lack of a really large metropolitan area in Oregon. If the Portland area's population were on the order of 4 million, for instance, it could support a labor market large enough to let someone who had lost a job more easily find a comparable one, said David Cooke, an Oregon Employment Department economist.

Could Wu have done much to reverse any of these factors? Doubtful, Cooke said.

""There are so many factors that influence the economy,'' he said. ""One congressperson's actions are a very small contributor, especially when you move down to the state level.""

So while Cornilles' 137-month figure is correct, it's quite a reach to imply that Wu had much to do with it. We find his claim is Half True.

Caprio says Chafee gave Warwick teachers a 19-percent raise
","
During the Oct. 6 WPRI/Providence Journal gubernatorial debate, candidates were asked for assurances that they would stand up to public employee unions.

Independent Lincoln Chafee, whose list of union endorsements includes the state's major teacher unions, urged voters to look at his record as a U.S. senator and as a mayor and councilman in Warwick. He specifically mentioned helping, as mayor, to resolve the city's bitter teachers dispute in the 1990s.

When his Democratic opponent, Frank Caprio, was asked the same question, his first reaction was to attack Chafee.

""When Linc Chafee says look at his record, you talk about opening up the checkbook and giving the unions a blank check. He settled a union strike by giving the teachers a 19-percent raise. So I don't think looking at the record makes anybody feel too comfortable tonight,"" he said.

Nineteen percent sounds like a big increase, especially in an era when many workers are taking pay cuts, so we decided to look back at what actually happened.

In September 1991, before Chafee was elected mayor, Warwick teachers went on strike when their contract expired. The action delayed school for a week. Teachers returned to the classroom after union leaders said they had reached a tentative agreement with the School Committee, but the deal fell through in a dispute over what each side had actually agreed to.

The case went to the State Labor Relations Board and was still simmering the following September, when the teachers went on strike again. Eighteen teachers were briefly sent to the ACI for refusing to obey a judge's back-to-work order.

Teachers continued to work without a contract and without a pay increase, but they refused to perform extra duties, such as advising student groups, taking students on field trips or meeting with parents outside school hours.

The dispute became so disruptive, some parents were putting houses up for sale to get out of the school system, according to Providence Journal accounts at the time.

Chafee inherited the dispute in its third year when he became mayor in 1993. At one point, he threatened to take the money set aside for teacher pay increases and use it to cut property taxes unless the union and the School Committee resolved the dispute. ""I'm sure a tax decrease will spur some economic development here,"" he said.

In spring 1994, after talks broke down and the state mediator resigned in frustration, Chafee stepped in and cut a deal with the teachers, essentially bypassing the School Committee.

Under the agreement, backed by eight of the nine members of the Democrat-controlled City Council, base pay for a top-step teacher went from $39,762 during the 1990-1991 school year to $49,371 for 1996-'97, the final year of the pact. That's a 24.2-percent hike. The deal also included an extra 2.5 percent that teachers who were working during the 1992-'93 school year are entitled to receive when they retire or resign, a bonus that continues to be paid as teachers leave.

So Caprio's 19-percent claim actually understates the total pay increase the teachers received. (The Chafee campaign has asserted the overall increase was 19.4 percent, the figure that had been reported at the time of the settlement.)

But Caprio leaves out an important bit of information: the agreement covered six years, running through August 1997.

We asked the Caprio campaign if the candidate thought the six-year time span was relevant. ""I think what's relevant is that the raise was given,"" said spokesman Nick Hemond.

But we think it's crucial. After all, we would hope that if Caprio, as Rhode Island's state treasurer, was promised a rate of return of 20 percent, he would want to know if the 20 percent was over one year, or 20.

In the Warwick case, the compounded cost of the salary increases was the same as if the School Committee had awarded 3.67 percent raises during each of the six years of the settlement.

And there's another question of context.

Annual raises such as those may seem high in this economic climate, but the 1990s was a different era.

At the time Chafee reached the deal, the cost of living as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index had increased by 23.6 percent during the previous six years.

And according to data from the Rhode Island affiliates of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers,  the average teacher salary in the state increased by 3.7 percent for the 1993-'94 school year, with 14 school systems giving out raises of 5 percent or higher.

To reach a ruling, we focused on three key points:

Caprio understated the teachers' overall pay increase and incorrectly said the settlement came during a strike. But his intended message -- that Chafee was overly generous to the teachers -- was clear.

He ignored the economic context of the era -- and the turmoil in the city's schools -- when the deal was reached.

And he neglected to mention that the teachers' agreement covered six years, which we consider a significant  omission.

On balance, we find the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EB7C80>],/factchecks/2010/oct/14/frank-caprio/caprio-says-chafee-gave-warwick-teachers-19-percen/
"['National', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Taxes', ""Christine O'Donnell""]","
Christine O'Donnell ad accuses Chris Coons of proposing property tax hikes totaling 50 percent
","
The latest ad from Republican Christine O'Donnell is set up like a trailer for a horror or an action movie, complete with a deep-throated voice-over heightening the suspense.

The bad guy of this ""movie""? ""The Taxman,"" aka O'Donnell's opponent in the Delaware Senate race, Democrat Chris Coons.

""In America ... "" the voice-over begins as tension-building music swells in the background, ""where jobs are being lost and wages cut. In Delaware, where the economy is suffering and families are losing their homes, there is one man who stood against the tide and raised taxes.

""One man who thought a 911 call should be taxed...One man thought property taxes should be hiked almost 50 percent ... One man who was county executive and drove New Castle County on the brink of bankruptcy.""

"" ... Chris Coons is The Taxman.""

We're checking a couple claims in this ad, and in this item, we'll focus on the part, ""One man who thought property taxes should be hiked almost 50 percent.""

Coons was elected County Executive of New Castle County, Del., in 2004 and has served in that position ever since. Records show that three times -- in 2006, 2007 and 2009 -- Coons proposed property tax increases.

We'll go through each in order.

* In 2006, Coons proposed a 5 percent property tax increase in his 2007 fiscal year budget, raising the average annual tax bill by $16 to $342. Coons' proposal called for a $230 million operating budget, a 7 percent increase over the previous year's spending.

The County Council voted 12-1 for the budget and then voted 9-4 to set the higher tax rate. At the time, Coons said the increase was the first of several small tax hikes needed to help close the gap between spending and revenue, according to a story in the News Journal in Wilmington on May 24, 2006.

* In 2007, Coons proposed a 17.5 percent increase in property taxes, upping the average annual bill by $60 to $402. Coons' budget also included $14 million in spending cuts, achieved through a variety of measures including the elimination of 61 vacant positions, elimination of non-emergency overtime, a pay freeze for 55 executive-branch employees and a greatly reduced long-term budget for capital projects. The $228 million budget -- $2 million less than the previous year -- was the first negative-growth budget in a decade.

""We have made in this budget all the cuts I think we can stand,"" Coons said at the time.

Coons again said the tax increase was needed to help get the county's deficit under control. For several year, the county had been spending down cash reserves. The News Journal noted then that one of the biggest challenges to the budget was a sharp decline in real-estate transfer taxes revenues -- the county's second-largest source of income -- due to a downturn in the housing market.

The Council voted 8-5 for the budget and tax rate.

* In 2009, Coons unveiled a budget that proposed a 25 percent property tax increase, raising the average tax bill by $100, to about $501. The $228 million budget and tax hike -- approved by Council 8-5 -- also reduced spending by $29 million, the second biggest budget reduction in county history, according to the News Journal. The spending cuts were achieved, in part, by a 5 percent salary rollback for the majority of the county's nearly 1,500 employees; the elimination of 97 unfilled jobs, and the layoff of nine paramedics-in-training.

According to March 18, 2009, story in the News Journal, ""The overall budget reflects the impact of the recession, particularly in housing. The county has depended heavily for years on a share of the statewide real estate transfer tax to balance its budget. Revenues from that tax have plummeted as home sales swooned.""

Coons explained the rationale for the budget this way: ""Rather than taking an extreme approach that either slashes the county work force or that dramatically raises taxes beyond what our community can fairly bear, I am taking a balanced middle course,"" he said. ""One that asks for shared sacrifice from all who deliver our county services and all who benefit from them.""

There was no proposed property tax increase for next year's budget. But the three property tax hikes proposed by Coons, and approved by Council, resulted in a net increase of 54 percent.

During a debate last month, Coons defended the tax increases, saying that without them he would have been forced to lay off police and close parks and libraries.

The recession wreaked havoc with county budgets around the country, and you can agree or disagree with the way Coons proposed to handle things in New Castle County. But the fact is, as County Executive, Coons did propose almost 50 percent worth of property tax increases. He also cut spending during the years with the biggest tax hikes (though overall, the operating budget has gone from $214.5 million in 2006 to $235.5 million in the 2011 budget proposal).

Our only beef with the claim in the O'Donnell ad is the whole ""one man"" theme. ""One man who stood against the tide and raised taxes,"" the ad says. "" ... One man thought property taxes should be hiked almost 50 percent."" In fact, all of Coons' budget proposals were approved by a majority of the County Council. And so we knock the ad's claim down to a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973BCBC0>],/factchecks/2010/oct/13/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-ad-accuses-chris-coons-proposin/

Tying Jeff Atwater to the 'Taj Mahal' courthouse project
","
Another day on the campaign trail in Florida, another accusation that a politician is spending tax dollars recklessly.

This time the accused is state Sen. Jeff Atwater, the Republican candidate for chief financial officer. The accuser is his Democratic opponent, former state Rep. Loranne Ausley.

""Tallahassee's a mess, and Jeff Atwater's part of the problem,"" a narrator says in a TV ad Ausley unveiled Oct. 11, 2010. ""Atwater's busy helping his friends and wasting our tax dollars -- $48 million for a government building so lavish it's dubbed the 'Taj Mahal,' $100,000 for a golf museum, and $110 million to build a private prison to help a big contributor.""

Enter the ad's foil, who (can you believe it?) just happens to be Ausley.

""I'm Loranne Ausley, and as chief financial officer I'll eliminate pay-to-play contracts and hold politicians like Jeff Atwater accountable for how they spend our tax dollars,"" Ausley says. ""It's time to clean up the mess in Tallahassee.""

The three projects Ausley questioned span seven years of Atwater's legislative history, starting in 2003. Let's take a look at each.

The $100,000 for a golf museum

As a freshman state senator in January 2003, Atwater requested $100,000 to help cover future expenses at the PGA Historical Center in Palm Beach Gardens. The money was included in Community Budget Issue Request -- which is a budget request legislators make for local projects, the state's version of an earmark. State Rep. Carl Domino, R-Jupiter, made a matching request in the state House.

The historical center is akin to a golf museum, according to the PGA's website, and features displays of the four major championship trophies and the PGA Golf Professional Hall of Fame.

CBIRs, love them or hate them, have been part of the legislative process. (The Legislature stopped the practice in 2009). Ausley has her share of budget requests over eight years in the state House: $400,000 for design, development and construction of public improvements adjacent to the Capitol Center in Tallahassee; $300,000 to help create an information kit for new parents; and $400,000 to restore Tallahassee's waterworks building, are just a few.

A lot of times, CBIRs don't get funded. That's the case here -- Atwater's $100,000 request didn't make it into the final 2003-2004 budget.

The 'Taj Mahal' courthouse

The genesis of the $48 million 'Taj Mahal' 1st District Court of Appeals courthouse came in the form of a bond issue slipped into a 142-page transportation bill on the last day of the 2007 session. Plans for the Tallahassee courthouse included mahogany paneling, 60-inch LCD flat screen televisions for each judge, a private bathroom for each judge (featuring granite countertops) and an accompanying kitchen (complete with microwave and refrigerator).

The construction project has been widely panned by elected leaders who said they didn't know that funding was inserted into a transportation bill or blame someone else for letting the building costs rage out of control. The Department of Revenue, for instance, recently constructed a new building at $225 per square foot. The cost of the new courthouse, which will house about 120 state employees? About $425 a square foot.

What was Atwater's role in approving the courthouse project?

The only link we could find, and the only one the Ausley campaign provided, was that he voted for the transportation bill, HB 985. The bill passed the Senate 37-2. Atwater says he simply voted for a bond issue for the project and that the construction details were handled by the court system and the state building agency. ""Apparently I personally went out and hand-built the 1st DCA building,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times.

The Times' Lucy Morgan obtained an e-mail circulated among the judges on the courthouse building committee identifying ""heroes'' in delivering the money to build it. The list includes five Republican state senators, then-House speaker Marco Rubio, and others, but not Atwater. And an audit of the courthouse project, ordered by current Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, largely laid blame for the project at the feet of the court and the Department of Management Services, the state agency that oversees construction and leasing of state buildings. Authorization of the bond issue put DMS in charge of the project.

Ausley voted against the transportation bill in the House, but says she did not know about the amendment that was added to build the courthouse.

The $110 million private prison

In 2008, with Florida's prison population growing and expected to continue to grow rapidly, lawmakers added hundreds of millions of dollars in the state budget to construct new prison facilities.

Included in the budget was a requirement that the state use some of the money to build a 2,000-bed, $110 million privately operated correctional facility. Proponents say privately run facilities cost taxpayers less, but they are opposed by police unions. It wasn't a new concept -- the state already had six privately managed prison facilities.

Atwater's role in the private prison deal? All we could find is that he voted for the state budget, which included the appropriation. Ausley voted against the budget that year. The private prison clause, it turns out, was inserted by former state Rep. Ray Sansom, the one-time Republican House speaker who resigned in disgrace in 2010.

The deal did include a requirement that the contract to build the facility be competitively bid. The contract was won by The GEO Group, of Boca Raton -- one of two companies already managing private prison facilities in Florida. The GEO Group manages or owns 116 corrections facilities worldwide.

Fast forward to this spring. The private prison, now called the Blackwater River Correctional Facility, was nearing completion but because the prison population hadn't grown as anticipated it had no potential prisoners to take in. Atwater, as Senate president, helped craft a budget deal to allow the new private prison to open by shifting some inmates from state-run prisons to the Blackwater River facility.

As we already noted, The GEO Group won the contract to build Blackwater River after Atwater voted for the state budget, which passed the Senate 32-8. But since Ausley talks about The GEO Group as a ""big contributor"" in the ad, we decided to check that claim out, too. Since 2000 when Atwater was first elected to the state House, The GEO Group, its political action committee and subsidiaries have donated $2,500 to Atwater's campaigns, according to a review of campaign finance records.

In the 2010 election cycle alone, The GEO Group's PAC has contributed almost $236,000 to candidates -- including $500 to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink and $500 to Democratic House leader Franklin Sands.

Summary

Along with the claims, Ausley's ad includes visuals of an actor who plays Atwater accepting envelopes from men in suits and then tucking those envelopes into his jacket pocket. That's an obvious and dubious suggestion that somehow Atwater is taking bribes or kickbacks for his votes. We note it only for its ridiculousness.

Ausley makes three claims about Atwater helping his friends and wasting taxpayer dollars. The $100,000 for the PGA golf museum was not included in the state budget. The only connections between Atwater and the 1st District Court of Appeals courthouse project and a 2,000-bed private prison are that Atwater voted on massive bills that included these projects and lots of other things. The ad makes it sound somehow like Atwater was spearheading or directing these projects, when there is zero evidence he was. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096962240>],/factchecks/2010/oct/13/loranne-ausley/tying-jeff-atwater-taj-mahal-courthouse-project/

Christine O'Donnell attacks Chris Coons for raising taxes to fund 911 in spooky new ad
","
Ever since she won the primary on Sept. 14, 2010, Christine O'Donnell, the surprise Republican nominee for a Senate seat from Delaware, has been the center of media attention -- from Real Time with Bill Maher to Saturday Night Live. An ad released on Oct. 11 paid for and authorized by Friends of Christine O'Donnell, seeks to turn the focus on her  opponent, Democrat Chris Coons.

In a minute-long ad featuring dark, horror-movie visuals and spooky music, O'Donnell portrays Coons -- the county executive of Delaware's populous New Castle County -- as a roving psychopath that she dubs ""The Taxman."" Coons, the narrator intones, ""is taxing everything out here.""

The ad makes several charges about Coons raising specific taxes. We'll take up one claim in another item -- that Coons proposed hiking property taxes by about 50 percent. This article will focus on a claim regarding taxes for 911 emergency service. Efforts to reach the O'Donnell campaign were unsuccessful.

The ad phrases this claim in two slightly different ways. The narrator says that Coons ""thought that a 911 call should be taxed."" And as the narrator says that, the screen shows the text: ""Proposed a 911 Cell Phone Fee.""

Before we critique the ad's accuracy, let's provide some background on the financing of 911 services, provided by Brian Fontes, the chief executive of the National Emergency Number Association, the group that represents 911 call centers and the vendors who service them.

In theory, 911 services can simply be funded through a jurisdiction's general tax revenues, and in some places that is what's done. But more commonly, jurisdictions use either a tariff (that is, a levy approved by a telephone regulatory commission) or a fee (a levy often approved by an elected body such as a city council, a county council or a state legislature).

Either way, the tariff or the fee appears as a line item on a customer's phone bill. Typically, users will see a standard amount assessed each month on any phone registered in a given jurisdiction. Fontes said that these levies tend not to be officially referred to as a ""tax,"" but we think it's fair for O'Donnell to characterize it that way, since we expect most people wouldn't know what a 911 ""tariff"" is.

As cell phones have become more common, they have overtaken land lines in the number of calls made to 911. That is especially true now because most cell phones can electronically route a call directly to the appropriate local 911 line, even if the phone is registered out of state. Nationally, Fontes said, cell phones make about 60 percent of 911 calls, and that percentage is growing by the year.

In a 2007 story, Delaware's biggest newspaper, the Wilmington News Journal, quoted Dave Roberts, New Castle County's chief of emergency communications, saying that instead of getting ""one or two calls on an incident on the turnpike, now we get 20 to 30 calls,"" he said. ""When people see an emergency like that, they want to play their part."" It's helpful, Roberts added, because some witnesses will have information that others missed, such as the color or model of a fleeing car.

This has had an impact on how jurisdictions pay for 911 services. Since cell phones are a relatively recent invention, jurisdictions have had to write new laws or regulations to finance 911 calls through levies on cell phones, rather than just longstanding 911 fees on landlines.

That's what happened in New Castle County in 2007.

In early 2007, when Coons was assembling his county's budget proposal, he told the Wilmington News Journal in a March 17, 2007, article that ""he plans to approach the General Assembly this spring for authority to create new revenue streams, such as a hotel tax, a 911 cell-phone fee and a paramedic-service fee."" (Coons wouldn't have been able to implement the fee on his own -- it needed approval of the state legislature.)

Later News Journal stories elaborated on the details. Coons wanted to increase the existing 911 excise tax on landlines from 60 cents a month to $1.00 and to impose, for the first time, a $1.00 monthly excise tax for 911 on cell phones. The newspaper quoted estimates that this could raise $3 million a year. The law passed in 2007.

So where does O'Donnell's ad fit into this?

The ad is correct that Coons proposed a tax to fund 911 services. But it adds some layers of obfuscation to this grain of truth.

First, the ad is misleading when it implies that Coons strode into a tax-free oasis of 911 service and decided to impose a tax for the first time. Landlines had long been taxed to support 911 service. What Coons did was extend the tax to cell phones after their use to call 911 surged.

Second, and probably more important, the ad is misleading about what exactly Coons proposed to do. The ad says that Chris Coons ""thought that a 911 call should be taxed."" We think most people would understand that to mean that every time they dialed 911, they would be hit by a tax. But that's not the case. Instead, Coons' proposed tax would have been a monthly levy on each user's bill, regardless of whether someone called 911 or not. No one needed to worry that calling 911 to help an injured motorist on the highway would lead to a special fee on their next phone bill.

 O'Donnell's ad twisted the details of a proposed 911 levy to fit her image of Coons as an insatiable tax monster. Yes, he proposed a tax, but for a service on which other phones already were being taxed. And Coons most certainly did not propose taxing individual 911 calls. We rate the claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968BF6C0>],/factchecks/2010/oct/13/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-attacks-chris-coons-raising-tax/

GOP challenger John Kasich says Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland’s tax freeze amounted to a tax hike
","
Over the past month of their hotly contested race for governor, Republican challenger John Kasich has accused Gov. Ted Strickland of raising taxes on Ohioans, a charge the Democratic governor has vehemently denied.

Kasich has leveled the tax hike charge in his public speeches, during both gubernatorial debates and in campaign commercials. He says the governor’s decision last December to halt a scheduled 2009 income tax cut essentially took away $844 million in refunds earmarked for Ohioans and instead gave it to the government.

A television ad from the Republican Governor’s Association released this month features still photographs of Strickland with a woman speaking: ""Ted Strickland promised not to raise taxes. He broke that promise.""

Strickland says he didn’t raise taxes, he only temporarily froze a planned income tax cut to fill an unexpected budget hole. Strickland’s running mate Yvette McGee Brown certainly feels comfortable with that explanation.

""They had the nerve to say, the Republican Governor’s Association, that this governor (Strickland) raised taxes $800 million on Ohioans. Not true,"" Brown said during a rally on Sept. 27 in Cleveland with Strickland standing behind her. ""And I wish PolitiFact would go check that.""

So, we are.

The tax issue Kasich is referencing is Strickland’s decision last year to halt the final year of a five-year, 21-percent across-the-board income tax cut that started in 2005. The move saved the state approximately $840 million, money the governor used to fill a budget hole. The only alternative, Strickland insists, was to cut the equivalent amount of cash out of primary and secondary education.

Strickland is careful to characterize his move as having frozen the final year of that tax cut and not having eliminated it altogether. The difference: what’s frozen can be thawed and used, but it might not be possible to replicate what has been completely erased.

""We have cut the state income tax 17 percent since 2005,"" Strickland said during his Oct. 7 debate against Kasich, taking credit for the first four years of the tax cuts. Strickland became governor in January 2007.

And the governor notes that the postponed final year tax cut is scheduled to be reinstated next year after the current budget cycle expires. Also, the decision to freeze the tax cut required legislative approval, which means the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate had to OK the deal and it did — narrowly.

But having received the first four years of the tax cut, Ohioans were already looking forward to the final year, 4.2 percent reduction, Kasich said, until the governor snatched it away.

""He raised taxes last year to the tune of $840 million,"" Kasich said on Oct. 4 during a press conference at the Ohio Republican Party headquarters.

To be fair, Strickland had to find a source of revenue or would have had to slash programs. Ohio law requires the state budget be balanced. And part of the reason for the shortfall can be pinned on Republicans, who increased spending in seven consecutive budgets while they controlled the General Assembly while also cutting taxes.

And the truth is Ohioans didn’t pay any more in taxes for 2009 over what they paid in 2008, and maybe less once you factor in some inflationary indexing. So, this was not a tax hike in that sense, which Kasich concedes.

But he argues it is an increase when residents are forced to pay more in taxes than they had been promised, or to look at it another way, get back less in their state income tax refund than they anticipated.

Those who owed the state after filing their 2009 taxes, owed a little bit extra thanks to Strickland’s tax freeze. Strickland’s decision cost a family of four earning $60,000 a year about $78 last year.

Strickland prides himself on having made tough decisions in rough economic times. One of those decisions was postponing the income tax cut which meant taking money out of the pockets of Ohioans.

But while the freeze is expected to be lifted next year, there are no guarantees that will happen in what is still a rough economic landscape for Ohio. And state taxpayers, who had to pay more in income taxes than what had been promised, may continue to pay at the higher rate.

We rate Kasich’s statement Mostly True.

Congressional candidate Julie Lassa says GOP rival Sean Duffy was a ""no show"" on the job
","
Ashland County’s Courthouse couldn’t be much smaller -- one judge, one district attorney, one part-time assistant DA.

So it was no surprise that Dan Goglin, the part-time assistant DA, stirred attention when he appeared in a television ad for Democratic congressional candidate Julie Lassa ripping Sean Duffy -- his former boss and Lassa’s opponent -- for spending more time campaigning than prosecuting criminals.

For most voters in the northwest Wisconsin district, both candidates are new -- they are aiming to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau), who has held the 7th District seat since 1969. The ad from Lassa, a state senator, aims to undercut Duffy by relying on first-hand testimony from someone who presumably knows his work best.

""We did not see him often,"" Goglin says of Duffy in the ad. ""His campaign was taking him away from the job.""

Goglin continues: ""All the time, witnesses (and) victims would have to wait in the hallway for him to come to work. The quality of services that were provided to the citizens of this county suffered.""

Goglin’s image fades and is replaced by these words, with a voice saying: ""Sean Duffy was a no show."" It’s unclear whether or not the final words were spoken by Goglin.

 So, is Lassa right: Was Sean Duffy a ""no show""?

We started with Lassa’s campaign, to see what evidence they could provide beyond the testimony of Goglin, who is active in the local Democratic party. (Goglin gave $150 to Obey’s campaign fund Feb. 22. There is no indication he has contributed to Lassa’s campaign.)

The Lassa campaign, relying largely on Duffy’s campaign finance reports, cited seven nights where Duffy apparently stayed out of town overnight in the time period between March 22 and June 2, 2010. The list included a GOP ""Young Guns"" fund-raiser in Washington, D.C., on May 25. The campaign also said Duffy didn’t log onto his work computer for 20 work days in the first six months of the year ""but attended campaign events on more than half of those same dates.""

A little background will help here.

Duffy served about eight years as district attorney for the small county in far northern Wisconsin. He was appointed by former Gov. Scott McCallum, a Republican, and soon hired Goglin as his part-time assistant.

In July 2009, Duffy announced he would challenge Obey, the third most senior member of the U.S. House and chair of the powerful Budget Committee. In late April, 2010, The New York Times ran a front-page story noting Obey faced a stiff challenge. Ten days later Obey, made the surprise announcement that he was retiring. Now an open seat, the race became even more of a target for national Republicans and the campaign heated up.

In June 2010, Duffy resigned from the $93,123-a-year job to campaign full time. Gov. Jim Doyle named his replacement, Kelly McKnight, a month later.

Lassa’s evidence, on its face, does not support the charge she is making. There was no list of hearings that were delayed or any phone records of citizen complaints. Duffy, for instance, could have used vacation time on the days he was out of town or his computer was not turned on.

We attempted to find Duffy’s vacation records, but there are none. As a state employee, district attorneys are allowed to take time off at will and no record is kept of that, according to McKnight, Duffy’s replacement.

So Lassa’s claim hinges largely on the testimony of Goglin.

We called Goglin, who refused to take our call. He said through a staff person he would not take political calls from our work phone. We left several additional messages. He did not respond.

We then turned to a variety of other people familiar with the inner workings of the courthouse and the community. All said they have not been actively involved in the campaign on either side.

Was Duffy a ""no show"" on the job, prompting complaints and problems?

* ""That did not seem to be the case,"" said Claire Duquette, editor of The Daily Press newspaper in Ashland. She said the paper had received no complaints and the paper did not hear of problems with cases being delayed or mishandled.

*""Nobody called me on that,"" said district court administrator Scott Johnson, who added: ""It’s a busy court. It was situation normal.""

* ""As far as the court system, no,"" said Ashland County Clerk of Courts Katie Colgrove. ""It did not come to a screeching halt.""

Colgrove and others said the comment about people waiting in the hallway makes sense to a point.

""That sounds like a usual Monday here"" when Judge Robert Eaton holds intake court for those arrested over the weekend, Colgrove said.

Others noted that there isn’t a waiting room for the district attorney’s office.

""The waiting room for the DA’s office is the hallway,"" said defense attorney Joe Rafferty, who added: ""I have never seen anyone sitting on that bench.""

The most detail about the campaigning DA came from Nancy Thyberg, the office’s victim-witness coordinator. She said Duffy, a married father of six young kids, tried to do too much -- a full-time job and the campaign.

""Sean was a very good DA, but in all honesty in the last couple of months he wasn’t there a lot,"" she said. ""He really thought he could do both and he couldn’t. It’s just an impossible thing.""

She said Duffy was difficult to reach at times, and ""we had some scheduling issues."" She said the transition increased frustration, particularly for Goglin, who had to do more work to help run the office.

McKnight, Duffy’s replacement, said there were some cases backed up when he took over but said it wasn’t clear to him whether it was because of Duffy’s campaigning or the four weeks between Duffy’s announcement and his being named to the job.

Finally, Mark Perrine, assistant state public defender, said in his view Duffy was ""getting a little frazzled"" and that others in the office were ""covering for Sean.""  But like others, he did not cite any cases that were delayed or specifics on items missed or mishandled.

The Lassa campaign noted that between September 2009 and March 2010, Duffy’s campaign reimbursed him $13,712 for campaign-related travel. At 50 cents a mile, that means Duffy drove 27,422 miles during that period.

Duffy said the figure is accurate: ""I’m working my tail off here.""

He acknowledged the demands on his time mounted in the spring but said it did not come at the expense of his job. He said he tried to flex his schedule and came into the office on weekends. By the end of May, he said he realized campaigning in a large district would not work with his job, a position he could have held at least until the 2012 election.

""I did the honorable thing"" and stepped down, he said, noting he worked until Doyle named his replacement: ""It’s not like I said ‘OK, I’ve moved on, see you all later.' ""

Lassa, it should be noted, has continued to hold her $49,943-a-year job as a state senator -- and many other officials, including gubernatorial candidates Democrat Tom Barrett (Milwaukee mayor) and Scott Walker (Milwaukee County executive) have campaigned for higher office while keeping their day jobs.

So what to make of Lassa’s allegations of an AWOL DA?

In making her charge, Julie Lassa cites some nights out of town and days out of the office, but by themselves they are not evidence that Sean Duffy’s campaign schedule had a negative impact on his work schedule. Thus, her claim largely centers on the testimony of assistant district attorney Dan Goglin, who cites several general examples of delays. But others at the Ashland County courthouse paint a different story and largely do not back up his claims. Nevertheless, by Duffy’s own admission, in his final months on the job it was a difficult balance. That is why, he said, he resigned -- something Lassa and other higher-office seekers have not done.

We rate Lassa’s claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968840C0>],/factchecks/2010/oct/13/julie-lassa/congressional-candidate-julie-lassa-says-gop-rival/

Rick Perry says Houston had a $1.7 billion operating loss under Bill White
","
In a recent television ad, Gov. Rick Perry says Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White was a poor financial manager as mayor of Houston 
Perry's spot levels budget-related charges including this one: ""Houston suffered $1.7 billion in operating losses under Mayor Bill White."" 
We dug into this figure, which also pops up in a Perry ad that refers to the total as 17 billion dimes. 
In support of the number, Perry's campaign pointed us to a July report from Citizens for Public Accountability, which calls itself ""a bipartisan group of retired partners of some of Houston's accounting firms."" The report — written by Bob Lemer, a retired Ernst & Young accountant who often criticized city finances on White's watch — is titled ""City of Houston Total Operating Losses Fiscal Years 2004-2009: $1.7 billion."" 
In an interview, Lemer told us that he reached the figure by adding up the ""change in net assets"" entry from the city's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for each of the years White was mayor, 2004 through 2009. Because Houston's net assets declined every year, the cumulative change was a negative $1.69 billion. 
That figure, Lemer said, is the amount by which the city's expenditures exceeded its income during White's tenure. 
White spokeswoman Katy Bacon challenged the characterization of the $1.7 billion as an operating loss. ""An operating loss is a business concept, not a government concept,"" she said. Lemer's report distorts ""financial statements that are generated under government accounting standards,"" Bacon said. 
Say what? We decided to hit the books — one book, anyway — for a crash course in municipal finance. 
Our question: What are a city's ""net assets"" and what does it mean when they go up or down? According to ""Financial Management in the Public Sector"" by XiaoHu Wang, a public administration professor at the University of Central Florida, assets include land, building and equipment, as well cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities are what an organization owes to others. 
Subtracting liabilities from assets yields net assets. Cities track their net assets from year to year in their financial reports. A positive change means net assets increased; a negative number means they declined. The change ""can be seen as an organization-wide operating surplus (or deficit),"" the book says. 
Next, we asked Wang if it's fair to equate ""change in net assets"" with ""operating loss,"" as Lemer did. Yes, Wang said, because both terms indicate a deficit. However, he cautioned that no single indicator, including this one, is sufficient to gauge a city's overall financial health. 
Other experts were critical of calling the $1.7 billion figure ""operating losses."" 
Lewis McLain, former executive director of the Government Finance Officers Association of Texas, told us that the problem with applying ""for-profit"" accounting terms — like operating loss — to nonprofit public entities is that their enterprises serve different purposes. ""You wouldn’t expect the accounting for church finances to be exactly the same as for an automobile corporation,"" he said. While a company ""focuses on measuring its use of assets to return a profit,"" a city focuses on the funding of a variety of expensive services for its citizens, ""from road repair to police and fire officers to libraries and mowed parks."" 
Diana Thomas, controller for the City of Austin, said the term ""operating losses"" is an unfair description; she noted that among the expenses subtracted from the city's net assets each year are long-term liabilities such as depreciation of assets and retiree benefits that will actually be paid out later. Cities only recently were required to account for some of those future costs on their current financial statements, Thomas said. 
McLain said the changes in accounting rules are a reason that Houston's ""change in net assets"" report shows high negative numbers. 
""The accounting profession has changed rules to recognize more of these (long-term) costs, since to not do so makes a huge liability less transparent,"" McLain said. ""Houston is experiencing the same pressures as many cities across the state and nation. These liabilities have been accumulating for a number of years, mostly in the last three decades. It is not an overnight problem, and the solutions are going to be slow and painful."" 
When asked what changes in net assets say about a city's financial health, McLain said: ""Virtually nothing. In fact, they can be misleading and misused."" The central purpose of a city's annual financial report, McLain said, is to fully report the financial affairs of a city functioning as ""a multi-business entity with legal constraints on various monies that are placed in standalone funds for the purpose of accountability, control and disclosure."" 
In fact, said McLain, ""if you are going to talk about operating losses or gains,"" a more telling number is the balance in its general fund at the end of the year. The general fund, which is the government's largest kitty, helps supports most basic services, including police and fire protection. In Houston's case, the general fund balance increased every year that White was in office, except for 2009, McLain said, going from $136 million in 2004 to $332 million in 2008. The balance fell to $304 million in 2009. 
""That means revenues had to be bigger than expenditures for operations"" during those years, McLain said. 
Summing up: The $1.7 billion figure for net operating losses in White's time as mayor has a basis in fact; the city's net assets did decline by that amount on his watch, though changes in accounting practices also drove up the number. 
Problematically, using a single private-sector measure to gauge overall financial performance in the public sector doesn't necessarily produce conclusive results. Houston's accumulated ""changes in net assets"" by themselves are an incomplete reflection of the city's fiscal health while White was mayor; the $1.7 billion figure may even be meaningless in this regard.

"['Abortion', 'Oregon', 'Planned Parenthood PAC']","
Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon says Chris Dudley is anti-choice
","
Oregon is liberal when it comes to access to abortion. It’s among 16 states that do not require parental notification or consent for teen abortions. Oregon does not mandate counseling or limit when an abortion can be performed.

Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon sent out a letter this month claiming that Democrat John Kitzhaber is the only pro-choice candidate in the race for governor. That means Chris Dudley, the Republican in the race, is anti-choice.  

The campaign letter reads: ""In contrast, Chris Dudley wants to roll back a woman's right to choose. He supports restrictions that Oregon voters have rejected multiple times, and that threaten women's health. And Chris Dudley has singled out ‘abstinence’ education as a way to address unintended pregnancy. He is out of step with Oregon values and cares more about catering to extreme positions than providing real education and access to birth control.""

Two questions came to mind. Does Dudley really want to ""roll back"" a woman’s right to choose? And if he is open to restrictions -- such as notifying parents before a minor opts for an abortion -- does that automatically mean he is not pro-choice?

PolitiFact Oregon asked Planned Parenthood to share the goods. Roey Thorpe, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, provided a letter that Dudley sent June 2. In it, he declines to answer the group’s questionnaire and explains his position on abortion.

""I believe that abortion should remain legal -- but limited. I do not support the public funding of abortion. As governor, I will not propose new legal restrictions on abortion, but I would be open to proposals for parental notification for minors who seek abortions, limits on late-term abortions and efforts to reduce abortion through education and abstinence."" He added that he would not use a single-issue litmus test when nominating judges, appointing board members or approving legislation.

OK, that sounds clear, but not crystal. For example, does that mean he would spearhead legislation if it’s regarding parental notification, or just entertain the idea if it comes from elsewhere?

We followed up with the Dudley campaign. Spokesman Jake Suski said Dudley would not propose any legislation related to abortion or reproductive rights. But if legislation landed on his desk related to parental notification or late-term abortions, Dudley would be ""open to signing it. It doesn’t guarantee he would sign it."" Suski also said Dudley identifies himself as ""pro-choice.""

Thorpe says any effort to restrict access or curb the law means a person is not pro-choice.

""Rolling back the rights that women already have in Oregon is not a centrist position,"" she said. ""Safe and legal abortion is a right that people have.""

Thorpe also cited Dudley’s singling out of abstinence education as a sign that he’s on the wrong side of the issue. But Sharon Kitzhaber, the former first lady, was a founder and board member of the STARS Foundation in Oregon. That stands for Students Today Aren’t Ready for Sex, and its mission, according to this archived press release, was to ""help reduce teenage pregnancies by postponing teenage sexual involvement.""

In any case, the Oregon Right to Life people aren’t happy with Dudley, either. He didn’t fill out their questionnaire and the group declined to recommend -- much less endorse -- him in the general election. ""He wrote them a letter,"" sniffed Gayle Atteberry, director of Oregon Right to Life, referring to Planned Parenthood. ""He didn't even write us a letter.""

Dudley believes -- and we think many people concur -- that he is pro-choice because he believes abortion should be legal. We recognize, though, that there isn’t universal agreement on the definition of pro-choice.

Some abortion rights supporters are against any restrictions. Others who define themselves as pro-choice do support limitations, on late term abortions, for example.

Dudley admittedly has not said much on this issue, and that’s part of what’s driving Thorpe and Planned Parenthood. He said he’s open to restrictions but doesn’t have an agenda to roll back reproductive rights. Dudley mentioned abstinence in his letter to Planned Parenthood, but Kitzhaber’s former wife championed abstinence education and nobody marked her as anti-choice.

Certainly, Kitzhaber is more adamant about his stance on abortion and reproductive rights. He has the endorsement of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon, which traditionally endorses Democrats. And when he was governor, he vetoed a 1999 bill that would have required physicians to notify parents before providing abortion care to minors.

Planned Parenthood PAC’s statement ignores critical facts. The claim is Barely True.

Pat Quinn blasts Bill Brady for sponsoring bill on pet euthanasia in Illinois gubernatorial race
","
Illinois is famous for its rough and tumble politics, but Gov. Pat Quinn still managed to turn heads with a new TV ad that says his Republican rival, state Sen. Bill Brady, wanted to make it easier to put pets to death.

With creepy music in the background, the ad shows grainy images of dogs being forced into a chamber. As the dogs are put in, the soundtrack suggests the dogs are screeching and howling with fear.

Words superimposed over the images of the dogs say, ""Just two days after Bill Brady won the primary for governor, Sen. Bill Brady's first priority was to sponsor a bill that would mass-euthanize sheltered dogs and cats in gas chambers.""

It continues, ""Bill Brady's law would undo a deal worked out over two years by veterinarians, Farm Bureau and Illinois' Humane Society."" The ad cuts to shots of people with their pets denouncing the bill and Brady's role in it.

""Shame on Bill Brady!"" says a woman holding a fluffy white dog. ""I'm a Republican, but I don't support him for the mass euthanization of animals.""

To check the claims in the ad, we first turned to the legislative archive for the Illinois Senate. We found the bill referenced in the ad, SB 2999. It was indeed filed on Feb. 4, 2010, two days after the Feb. 2 primary, and we confirmed that it was the first bill Brady introduced after primary day. However, the primary election results were so close that, due to recounts, it actually took until March 5 for Brady to officially be declared the winner.

Brady's bill sought to amend a landmark 2009 law on euthanizations. The 2009 law was a compromise for animal-welfare advocates who had been seeking a flat-out ban on the use of gas chambers. Instead, it put more restrictions on the practice.

Under the 2009 law, shelters using the gas chambers had to euthanize animals one at a time, had to provide a justification for using the gas chamber, and had to have a veterinarian present from start to finish. The new requirements were expected to sharply reduce the use of gas chambers in Illinois, because of the significant added time and expense, said Jordan Matyas, Illinois state director for the Humane Society of the United States. A lethal injection -- the most common way of euthanizing pets -- typically takes two minutes or so, rather than the 30 to 40 minutes it takes in a gas chamber. So two of the biggest reasons a shelter would want to use the gas chamber -- euthanizing many pets at once and doing it inexpensively -- were upended by the new law. In fact, Matyas said he's unaware of any gas chambers being used in Illinois today.

Brady's bill, offered the following year, would have widened the options for animal shelters. His bill, which according to media reports was introduced on behalf of a constituent who works in animal control, would have lifted the one-animal-at-a-time limit. That could have made a difference in how shelters calculated whether to use gas chambers instead of injection. For instance, the chambers can be used for ""fractious cats, violent dogs or other animals that may subject the staff at the animal control facility to risk of injury,"" said Peter S. Weber, executive director of the Illinois State Veterinary Medical Association, one of the groups that initially had supported gas chambers prior to backing the 2009 compromise bill.

Our research suggests that the ad's summary of the issue is pretty accurate. But there are a couple of significant caveats that we think are worth noting.

First, the ad says the bill ""would mass-euthanize sheltered dogs and cats in gas chambers."" Actually, the bill wouldn't mandate it, as the ad's use of the word ""would"" suggests, but rather allow the practice. In fact, the bill requires veterinarians ""to use professional judgment"" on doing single or multiple euthanizations, ""taking into consideration the safety of facility staff and the most humane practices"" -- a requirement that animal-welfare advocates believe would be used as a loophole, but which does appear explicitly in the bill.

Second, the ad includes footage of dogs being placed into a cramped-looking metal box that, we are led to assume, is a gas chamber for putting down shelter animals. In the footage shown, we counted at least four, possibly five dogs, crammed into the same enclosure within that box. However, whether the practice shown on the footage would be allowed under Brady's bill is questionable.

The Brady bill required that the euthanasia chambers ""must allow for the separation of animals."" Matyas' interpretation is that the chambers must be manufactured to be compatible with separated chambers, but that the separators don't have to be installed. But the wording is vague enough that no one knows for sure how that language would be interpreted. So the ad's use of footage showing dogs crammed into one chamber is justifiable, but not necessarily the only outcome.

Third, we think a viewer watching the ad could come away thinking the bill is still active, and that Brady continues to back it. In fact, just days after sponsoring the measure, Brady backed off after opposition by the Humane Society of the U.S. and its allies prompted several unflattering news articles. In one Chicago Sun-Times story, Matyas was quoted saying, ""I have no idea why Sen. Brady introduced a bill that would allow as many animals as you want to be put into a gas chamber and they’d be exposed to one another. Under his legislation, you could have 10 dogs in one box, gasping for air, at the same time fighting, at the same time fearing for their lives.""

A Quad City Times story quoted Brady explaining his decision to back off. ""It’s not ready,"" Brady said. ""And the political games were distracting from the discussion.""

Ultimately, on March 3, John O. Jones, the state senator who became sponsor of the bill after Brady dropped out, tabled the measure. So the bill has been moot for more than half a year. 
The Brady campaign told us the ad gets the timing wrong because of the long delay in settling the election. Indeed, by the time Brady was officially declared the winner, Brady had disassociated from the bill and it had been tabled by its new sponsor. 
So where does this leave us?

Quinn's stark ad is right that the bill was sponsored two days after the primary but it incorrectly suggests that it was Brady's first act after winning. Quinn is close on the substance of what the bill would have done. But the ad oversteps somewhat in suggesting that the bill would have required mass euthanizations, rather than just allowing them, and it glosses over the fact that Brady dropped his sponsorship and that the bill has been moot for most of this year. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280977B2F00>],/factchecks/2010/oct/12/pat-quinn/pat-quinn-blasts-bill-brady-sponsoring-bill-pet-eu/
"['National', 'Campaign Finance', 'Corporations', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Transparency', 'George Will']","
George Will claims AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it - just like U.S. Chamber of Commerce
","The Obama administration has continued to speculate about foreign money being used to fund attack ads against Democrats -- and last week President Barack Obama offered Exhibit A: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

""Just this week, we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations,"" Obama said at a campaign stop on Oct. 7, 2010. ""So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections. And they won't tell you where the money (for) their ads comes from.""

As ABC's This Week host Christiane Amanpour played a clip of the president's remark during the Oct. 10, 2010, program, she noted that conservative George Will, a panelist on This Week, was shaking his head in frustration.

""Well, he won't tell us who he's talking about,"" Will said. ""He's talking about the Chamber of Commerce, which does indeed receive dues from foreign entities that are associated with American business, just as the AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it. And the shock and awe that we're supposed to feel from this is somewhat selective.""

We looked at the president's half of this exchange in a separate item, and rated his claim about the Chamber -- that ""groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections"" -- Half True.

Here, we'll examine Will's comment that just like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ""the AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it.""

The Chamber and the AFL-CIO have very different perspectives in the political debate. The Chamber of Commerce predominantly supports Republican candidates, while the AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions, almost exclusively backs Democrats.

Will's statement is technically true, said AFL-CIO spokesman Eddie Vale, but requires some caveats.

The AFL-CIO (it stands for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations) is a federation of dozens of unions, so it doesn't have individual members in and of itself. The members belong to unions which in turn are members of the AFL-CIO.

And some of the AFL-CIO's affiliates do have Canadian members -- most notably the United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers unions. Those union affiliates pass through a portion of the dues they collect from American members to the AFL-CIO, but not from their foreign members, said Vale.

""We don't take money at the national level from foreign members,"" Vale said.

There's another big difference in disclosure requirements between unions and groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. While FEC and IRS laws do not require unions to disclose donors -- just as they do not require disclosure of donors to trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- unions are subject to the Labor Management Relations Act, which requires public disclosure of payments over $5,000 to unions. So you can go to the Department of Labor's website and search the contributions to (and disbursements made by) the AFL-CIO and other unions in any given year.

""Our information, people can see it,"" Vale said.

Politico's Ben Smith did a good explainer of all this, challenging a twitter message posted by Jim Dyke, one of the GOP consultants on the board of the conservative group American Crossroads, which stated, ""[U]nions are [501](c)(5)s and don’t disclose...is that the business as usual? Or does that make them shadowy?""

Smith concluded that unions have to disclose significant contributions, while some of the most politically active groups such as the Chamber of Commerce do not.

Vale would not say how much the AFL-CIO is spending on ads in this year's mid-term elections, but he said the federation spent about $50 million in the 2006 midterm elections. This time around, he said, the AFL-CIO is active in campaigns in about 26 states, particularly in California, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Ohio.

We e-mailed Will about Vale's characterization of the funding for the AFL-CIO and he responded, ""Although I am content to have my statement assessed as 'technically true' --which is to say: true--I would add this from the October 8 New York Times:'Organizations from both ends of the political spectrum, from liberal ones like the AFL-CIO and the Sierra Club to conservative groups like the National Rifle Association, have international affiliations and get money from foreign entities while at the same time pushing political causes in the United States.'""

So disclosure requirements for unions are different than ""Super PACs"" such as Crossroads GPS or trade associations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (which essentially have none). But Will didn't broach the disclosure issue in his statement about the AFL-CIO. He said only that the AFL-CIO ""receives dues from foreign entities associated with it"" just like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce does. It's true that some individual members affiliated with the AFL-CIO collect dues from foreign (Canadian) residents. And those unions pay dues to the AFL-CIO. But according to the AFL-CIO, the dues collected from non-U.S. workers are not passed up to the national AFL-CIO. And so we rate Will's comment Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B1B80>],/factchecks/2010/oct/12/george-will/george-will-claims-afl-cio-receives-dues-foreign-e/

Ohio House Speaker Armond Budish raps Republicans for their big-spending ways
","
House Speaker Armond Budish kicked off what he called his ""rhetoric reality tour"" last month in Columbus hoping to fight back against House Republicans who have painted Democrats with the usual ""tax and spend"" brush.

At a news conference, Budish got uncharacteristically lathered up, saying that Democrats have ""made the cuts that Republicans wouldn’t"" in slicing almost $2 billion from the current $50.5 billion general revenue fund budget.

The mild-mannered Beachwood Democrat then attacked the House Republican record from 1994 to 2006 when the GOP controlled the 99-member lower chamber (as well as the governor’s office and the Ohio Senate).

""Never once did they actually cut spending or reduce the state budget. Even when they cut taxes in 2005, they increased spending,"" Budish said. ""They never paid for their tax cuts.""

Instead, they put off the bills until last year using budget gimmicks, he said.

Those are fairly inflammatory claims, and just the kind of thing that PolitiFact Ohio likes to check out, so we did some digging to see if Budish was right.

First, we pored over the state budget details dating back to 1994. We quickly saw that the first part of his statement is true, as long as Budish is talking about the entire budget and not individual programs that may have seen cuts at one time or another.

From 1994 to 2006, the seven state budgets approved while Republicans were in complete  control increased spending an average of 9.39 percent from one budget to the next. The closest thing to a cut under Republican control was the 2005-06 budget, which went up only slightly, but included a 21 percent across-the-board income tax reduction spread over five years — which is the tax cut Budish is referring to in his comment.

So far, so good.

But to evaluate the second portion of Budish’s statement where he says Republicans ""never paid for their tax cuts,"" you need a brief education in the numerous changes made to the state’s tax structure in 2005 by lawmakers. In a nutshell, a number of taxes of business and individual taxes were adjusted at the same time — some were increased by lawmakers in 2005 while others were cut or phased out entirely.

A pair of business taxes that were phased out slowly by the budget that was passed in 2005 were the tangible personal property tax and the corporation franchise tax. They were replaced by a new tax on businesses called the Commercial Activities Tax, or CAT, which was phased in as the duo was ramped down.

While those changes affected businesses, individual taxpayers were also affected by tax changes, including a sales tax hike and a 21 percent cut in the personal income tax rates for everyone in Ohio spread across five years.

That was the plan anyway. But last year Gov. Ted Strickland proposed, and lawmakers approved, pushing the fifth year of that tax cut back a year to fill a hole in the state budget.

But Budish isn’t totally correct when he says that the Republicans ""never paid for"" the tax cuts contained in the 2005 state budget. In fact, the 2007 state budget passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by Strickland had about $1.8 billion less in revenue because of the tax cuts of 2005, according to a 2009 state budget document. That, by law, required adjustments to the budget in other places to keep the state budget balanced.

Still, the impact in 2007 of the tax cuts was fairly light compared to the impact that had been projected for the current budget -- $4.2 billion. But when lawmakers adopted  Strickland’s proposal to push back the final year of the income tax cuts that pushed back some of the effect. The state actually ended up with $3.4 billion less to spend in the current budget than if the tax changes of 2005 never happened.

So let’s get to the grading card and see what we got:
  
  
  

Budish’s statement is largely accurate but needs additional information to see the full picture. That’s why we rate Budish’s statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968AFB80>],/factchecks/2010/oct/12/armond-budish/ohio-house-speaker-armond-budish-raps-republicans-/

Does Rick Scott invoking the Fifth Amendment imply guilt?
","
Democrat Alex Sink is airing a rare, two-minute ad that whacks Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott for alleged fraud at his former health care company, Columbia/HCA, as well as his current health care business, Solantic.

A key part of the ad, called ""Fraud Files,"" is a discussion about Scott taking the Fifth Amendment 75 times in a legal case involving Columbia/HCA. During a discussion about Scott taking the Fifth Amendment, Florida Democrats and Sink use video of Palm Beach County state attorney Michael McAuliffe.

He says about halfway through the campaign commercial that taking the Fifth Amendment ""means a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him.""

That's the claim we're analyzing in this fact check.

First, a little bit of back story on Scott and Columbia/HCA.

Scott started what was first called Columbia in the spring of 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country's largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals.

In early 1997, federal agents revealed they were investigating the Columbia/HCA chain for, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Allegations included that Columbia/HCA billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and that the hospital chain would perform one type of medical test but bill the federal government for a more expensive test or procedure. Agents seized records from Columbia facilities across the country in Tennessee, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Florida.

Scott resigned in the middle of the federal investigation in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations; the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle, and did. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. The company agreed to further settlements in 2002, paying an additional $881 million in fines.

About the Fifth Amendment

As we noted in another item, Scott indeed did give a deposition in 2000 where he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 75 times. The amendment reads in part that no one ""shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."" But Scott's deposition was not part of the criminal fraud case being pursued by the federal government as the ad suggests (he was never officially questioned). Instead, the case in question was a civil case involving Columbia/HCA and Nevada Communications Corp. Nevada Communications alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract.

Scott's lawyer interjected after an opposing lawyer began the deposition by asking if Scott was employed. ""Under normal circumstances, Mr. Scott would be pleased to answer that question and other questions that you pose today,"" Scott's lawyer, Steven Steinbach, said. ""Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself.""

Scott then went on to read the same answer to every question Nevada Communications lawyers asked, even when asked if Scott is a current or former employee of Columbia/HCA -- ""Upon advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the questions by asserting my rights and privileges under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.""

Does that mean truthful answers to the questions he was asked would incriminate him? Not necessarily, legal experts we talked to said.

For one thing, invoking the Fifth Amendment cannot be used in a criminal court to suggest guilt, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1956. The case is an interesting one. Brooklyn College professor Harry Slochower was called to testify before a U.S. Senate committee led by Joseph McCarthy to determine if he was a member of the Communist Party. Slochower invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege not to answer questions about his party membership in 1940 and 1941. As a result, the college fired Slochower.

But the court said the college could not fire Slochower for invoking his constitutional rights. ""The privilege against self-incrimination would be reduced to a hollow mockery if its exercise could be taken as equivalent either to a confession of guilt or a conclusive presumption of perjury,"" the court wrote in the Slochower case. That means McAuliffe could never tell a criminal jury what he's telling voters on TV.

""If this was a criminal prosecution I would not refer to his invocation of the Fifth Amendment, but that’s not what we’re talking about,"" McAuliffe said. ""This is not a criminal prosecution. It’s the political process and he has put himself out there to be vetted by voters. They're the jury in this case.""

In a civil case, things get a little murkier. Judges and juries can infer that a person who uses the Fifth Amendment would not incriminate themselves if they answered honestly. They also, however, can infer the opposite.

What does that mean? Put simply, Scott's answers to those 75 questions may or may not be used to incriminate him.

""The bottom line is that in a civil case, the judge and jury are free to draw the inference that 'a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him,' "" said George R. Dekle, Sr., a professor of law at the University of Florida. ""However, there can be myriads of reasons other than guilt which prompt a person to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, and it might be just as reasonable to infer that the witness refused to answer for some other reason.""

We talked to two other legal scholars who seemed surprised that Scott used the Fifth Amendment so much in a deposition, especially when answering routine questions about his employment history. ""You should not use the Fifth Amendment privilege if you don't think there's possible criminal liability,"" said Bruce Jacob, a law professor at Stetson.

That said, it's not an admission of guilt, said Oscar Michelen, a New York lawyer who has written articles on the Fifth Amendment. It can also be used as a way to protect the innocent from wrongful prosecution, he says. Investigators try to link people to crimes, he said. Not prove they did it. It reminds of us of a Law & Order episode -- the cops find a suspect and make a case. But halfway through the show, they realize they have the wrong person. ""Experienced litigators and particularly experienced criminal defense lawyers will tell you that 9 out of 9.95 times if there is any remote possibility that you may be charged with a crime or become a target of a criminal investigation or proceeding, you should 'take the Fifth,' "" Michelen said. 
Our ruling

We find a couple of things lacking in the claim that Scott, if he answered those depositions honestly, would ""incriminate himself."" First, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that in criminal cases courts cannot take the use of the Fifth Amendment to mean guilty. Second, while judges and juries may infer that a truthful answer in a civil case may incriminate Scott, they also may infer the opposite. Part of the confusion in this ad is that the Democrats imply that Scott's deposition is part of the criminal prosecution when, in fact, it was a civil case, making McAuliffe's description of the case awkward. 
(UPDATE: To clarify, we also have to acknowledge a bit of legalese here. McAuliffe uses the word incriminate, which is lawyer for ""help make a case against."" It doesn't mean, ""he did it."" The ad does a poor job of providing the distinction, but that's no fault of McAuliffe's.) 
One of the questions Scott refused to answer, for instance, is whether he worked for Columbia/HCA. Using basic logic we feel comfortable thinking that an honest answer to that question wouldn't harm him. Legal experts say, that though Scott may have used the privilege too freely, there are myriads of reasons other than guilt to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFC8B3C0>],/factchecks/2010/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/does-rick-scott-invoking-fifth-amendment-imply-gui/

Rick Scott dodges answers by invoking Fifth Amendment, Democrats claim in ad
","
Democrat Alex Sink is airing a new ad that whacks Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott for alleged fraud at Columbia/HCA, and in particular, for refusing to answer questions about his role in any wrongdoing.

The ad, which will air Oct. 13, 2010, is two minutes long and crafted to look like a TV news magazine segment. It's called ""Fraud Files,"" and pieces together the voice of a narrator with video news clips.

""Is Columbia/HCA putting profits ahead of patients?"" NBC's Brian Williams asks near the beginning of the ad. ""Did Columbia treat a patient for a mild disease, then bill Medicare for something more expensive?"" another reporter asks.

A narrator and a Palm Beach County prosecutor help fill in the details. ""A whistleblower revealed that Scott's company was cooking the books. Refusing to cooperate, Rick Scott gave a deposition in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times,"" the narrator says. ""Which means a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him,"" adds Michael McAuliffe, Palm Beach County's Democratic state attorney, finishing the thought.

The ad then cuts quickly to another news reporter ... ""The Medicare fraud that cost his former company, Columbia/HCA $1.7 billion in fines ..."" And then back to the narrator. ""The fine was the largest in the history of the United States. Rick Scott resigned in disgrace with a $300 million golden parachute.""

We're dealing with McAuliffe's claim in another item. In this fact-check, we wanted to learn more about that deposition, and Scott's use of the Fifth Amendment.

Columbia/HCA background

First, a little bit of back story on Scott and Columbia/HCA.

Scott started what was first called Columbia in the spring of 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country's largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals.

Agents seized records from Columbia facilities across the country in Tennessee, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Florida.

Scott resigned in the middle of the federal investigation in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations; the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle, and did. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. The company agreed to further settlements in 2002, paying an additional $881 million in fines.

Scott's deposition

Scott indeed did give a deposition in 2000 in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 75 times. The amendment reads in part that no one ""shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.""

Scott's deposition, however, was not part of the criminal fraud case being pursued by the federal government. In fact, Scott was never officially questioned during the federal criminal investigation. Instead, the case in question was a civil case involving Columbia/HCA and Nevada Communications Corp. Nevada Communications alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract.

Scott's lawyer interjected after an opposing lawyer began the deposition by asking if Scott was employed. ""Under normal circumstances, Mr. Scott would be pleased to answer that question and other questions that you pose today,"" Scott's lawyer, Steven Steinbach, said. ""Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself.

The ad never clarifies, or tries to distinguish the deposition as being part of a civil case unconnected to the criminal investigation. It simply adds the claim into the middle of a series of claims about the criminal fraud case. On the other hand, Scott's reason for invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege was because of the criminal investigations surrounding Columbia/HCA, his lawyer said.

During the Univision debate on Oct. 8, 2010, Scott said he pleaded the Fifth so many times because the opposing lawyers were on a ""fishing expedition."" But that's not what the Fifth Amendment should be used for, legal experts say.

The Fifth Amendment is a way to protect yourself from prosecution, regardless of whether you committed the crime.

""The Fifth Amendment is not a shield against fishing expeditions,"" said Nancy Dowd, a UF Levin College of Law professor. ""If you want to cloak yourself in the protection of the Fifth Amendment, it has to be for the reason that your answer could result in criminal liability.""

Added Bruce Jacob, a law professor at Stetson: ""You should not use the Fifth Amendment privilege if you don't think there's possible criminal liability.""

Ruling

Scott did give a deposition in 2000 where he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege not to be a witness against himself 75 times (we counted). But that alone doesn't make the claim right. We think it's fair to look at the context of how the number's used, and what an average viewer will take away upon seeing the ad.

The inference here is clear -- that Scott gave a deposition in the federal criminal investigation of Columbia/HCA and pleaded the Fifth Amendment 75 times. That's not true. Scott invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times in an unrelated civil suit over a communications contract. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C59F40>],/factchecks/2010/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-dodges-answers-invoking-fifth-amendment/

Problems at Rick Scott's new health care business, Solantic, alleged in new ad
","
Democrat Alex Sink is airing a rare, two-minute campaign ad that tries to link Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott to alleged fraud at a urgent patient care business he founded in 2001, Solantic.

The spot, called ""Fraud Files,"" opens more like an introduction to a Dateline NBC episode than a campaign commercial, mixing a narrator's voice with short clips from TV. The first half of the ad deals with Scott's time running Columbia/HCA.

The second half talks about Solantic, the company he built after resigning from Columbia/HCA.

""In 2008, new allegations emerged that Solantic was also engaging in multiple forms of fraud,"" the narrator says over visuals of flapping yellow sheriff's police tape, a detective in a suit taking notes and men in police T-shirts carrying boxes out of a building.

The ad essentially is blending together two fraud allegations.

The first is a 2008 lawsuit filed by Dr. P. Mark Glencross. Glencross alleged that Solantic improperly used his medical license in 2004 when the company filed paperwork saying each clinic had a medical director in charge. Scott was deposed during the case -- Scott has declined to release that deposition. The two-year-old case was settled within a month of Scott's deposition and both parties signed a confidentiality agreement.

The second stems from allegations by another former Solantic physician, Dr. Randy Prokes. During the gubernatorial primary, Prokes sent an e-mail to Bill McCollum's Republican campaign for governor claiming that Solantic billed Medicare at full rates for patients seen by a nurse practitioner, when federal rules require that billing be at 85 percent of the fee paid for physician examinations.

The McCollum campaign passed the letter on to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The FDLE then sent the letter on to the inspector general’s office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That's where the letter sits today. The Department of Health and Human Services has not said whether it's investigating Prokes' claims.

The claims of fraud are real, but suggesting through images that police raided or seized records from Solantic is entirely misleading. Ads are about both the visuals and the words campaigns choose. In this case, the Democratic Party is inflating the allegations against Solantic by including video of sheriff's tape and police collecting evidence. There have been no reports that we could find of police raiding a Solantic facility, and the Democratic Party, when asked, could provide no evidence of any such search. As such, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979C9E00>],/factchecks/2010/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/problems-rick-scotts-new-health-care-business-sola/

Fraud allegations dominate new Democat ad attacking Rick Scott
","
Democrat Alex Sink is airing a rare, two-minute campaign ad that tries to again hammer Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott  over allegations he was involved in fraud while running mega hospital chain Columbia/HCA.

The spot, called ""Fraud Files,"" opens more like an introduction to a Dateline NBC episode than a campaign commercial, mixing a narrator's voice with short clips from TV. At one point, a female reporter says, ""Three executives of Columbia/HCA health care corp. have been indicted.""

The ad doesn't make reference to the executives again. That's what we're for.

First, a little bit of back story on Scott and Columbia/HCA.

Scott started what was first called Columbia in the spring of 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country's largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals.

The company agreed to further settlements in 2002, paying an additional $881 million in fines.

In July 1997, three Columbia/HCA executives were indicted on charges of Medicare fraud in connection with billing at a Port Charlotte hospital. Indicted were Jay A. Jarrell, CEO of Columbia's Southwest Division, based in Fort Myers; Michael T. Neeb, chief financial officer of Columbia's Jacksonville Division; and Robert W. Whiteside, director of reimbursement for Columbia in Nashville.

The government accused the three executives of conspiring to overbill Medicare by inflating the hospital's capital expenses -- money spent on hospital facilities and equipment. That allowed the hospital to be overpaid by about $1.8 million, the government claimed.

A fouth executive, Carl Lynn Dick, was subsequently indicted in July 1998. Dick, director of finance for Columbia's East Florida division in Orlando, was charged with conspiracy to defraud government insurance programs.

After an eight-week federal jury trial in 1999, including three days of deliberations, Jarrell and Whiteside were found guilty on six counts of fraud and sentenced to 33 months and 24 months in prison respectively. That same jury acquitted Neeb of all charges, and failed to reach a verdict on Dick.

Jarrell and Whiteside's convictions, however, were overturned on appeal. The two men never served any prison sentence.

Columbia/HCA did also plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies, but those felonies come with fines, not prison time. No one else was indicted or tried in connection with the criminal fraud investigation.

In their two-minute ad attacking Scott, Florida Democrats say three executives of Columbia/HCA were indicted for fraud. They were, as was a fourth. But the government failed to secure a conviction on any of the executives indicted. That's a noteworthy caveat that would have put the indictments in the proper context.

Sen. Russ Feingold says unfair trade deals have cost 64,000 jobs in Wisconsin
","
Even in a U.S. Senate contest of ideological near-opposites, the gap between Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold and Republican challenger Ron Johnson on trade issues is notable.

Feingold, supported by labor unions, consistently has voted against foreign-trade agreements over his three terms, saying they unfairly punish Wisconsin workers -- especially on the manufacturing line.

Johnson, the manufacturing plant executive, extols global trade as the gateway to job growth and higher profits, citing his own Oshkosh firm as an example. There are unfortunate casualties, he says, but they are necessary to boost employment overall.

With the unemployment rate stubbornly high, a new TV and radio ad blitz from Feingold is aimed at hitting home with disgruntled workers.

Here is the central claim, stated on the radio, implied with graphics on TV:

""According to independent analysis, unfair trade deals have resulted in the loss of over 64,000 jobs in Wisconsin. That’s why Russ Feingold has consistently voted against them. But Ron Johnson favors those deals.""

There is a lot in that statement, but we’ll take it apart piece by piece.

First, the trade deals being cited are those such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).

The radio ad cites no source or time frame for the 64,000 number, but Feingold senior campaign strategist John Kraus says it came from a database generated by Global Trade Watch, a project of the liberal consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.

Is that group independent, as the ad claims?

Public Citizen is a leading critical voice on trade deals, so it comes to the issue from that perspective. The group holds Feingold in high regard because his stance fits the group’s agenda. It has publicly praised Feingold for campaign finance reform and his trade votes, and even filed a legal brief with the U.S. Supreme Court against a challenge to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reforms.

With that in mind, let’s look at the origin of the numbers.

The group’s job-loss database is based on U.S. Department of Labor data from a program that helps workers who have lost their jobs as a result of foreign trade. It’s called the Trade Adjustment Assistance program.

The U.S. Department of Labor does not use that data to measure job losses due to foreign trade, a spokesman said, because of undercounting (not every company or union applies to the voluntary program) and overcounting (some workers apply but aren’t ultimately laid off).

The department doesn’t specify the extent of either over- or under-counting.

But researchers, even pro-trade deal ones, say the Labor Department program serves only a fraction of those who lose their jobs in industries facing heavy  import competition. A 1999 study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics -- a group in favor of free trade -- found that only 10% of those workers showed up in the federal program.

Indeed, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a Peterson Institute expert, said the data is commonly used by researchers as the best available for showing how trade can close factories.

The 64,000 figure cited by Feingold goes back to 1994, when NAFTA kicked in.

When PolitiFact Wisconsin downloaded company-by-company figures from the group’s database, it came up with the same figure.

But there’s a larger issue on claims of job loss.

Looking at one side of the coin, as Feingold does, provides a one-sided view. It does not take into account job gains made elsewhere in part by trade agreements.

Said Hufbauer: ""It isn’t the whole story.""

Hufbauer said trade deals had helped fuel big increases in trade, though in his view the business climate, monetary policy and spending policy are much bigger drivers for job losses and gains than trade pacts.

So, in presenting only one side of the coin, Feingold leaves out important context.

This leaves us with Feingold’s suggestion that the trade deals he opposed -- and Johnson supports -- were ""unfair.""

The characterization depends on your point of view.

In short, Feingold believes they are ""unfair"" to workers who lose their jobs. Johnson says they are fair because long-term they are the engine behind the wheels of capitalism.

Johnson says he would not support an ""unfair""’ deal.

He has not addressed every trade deal specifically, but at a July WisPolitics luncheon, Johnson did say he would have supported NAFTA, favored-nation status for China and the pending Korea-U.S. trade pact. Feingold uses quotes from that luncheon in his ad, including this one:.

""Yeah, I think history has proven if you really take a look at the economic statistics, free trade works, so I’m definitely supportive.""

Johnson emphasized ""free and fair"" trade, something omitted from the ad.

The ad also quotes Johnson as saying:

""In a free market capitalist system, there are always winners and losers. It’s creative destruction.""

The ad leaves off the rest of the ""creative destruction"" quote: Johnson said the natural cycle of business births and deaths was unfortunate, ""but let’s face it -- if it weren’t for that we’d still have buggy whip companies.""

So where does this leave us?

Russ Feingold uses Ron Johnson’s own words to capture his rival’s support for several trade deals that Feingold asserts cost the state some 64,000 jobs. The source of the analysis is not independent, as Feingold claims, but it uses numbers both sides agree are the best available -- and ones that may vastly understate the number of jobs lost. Nevertheless, those numbers leave out the other side of the equation -- jobs created through the deals. As for defining the deals as ""unfair,"" it is a characterization by Feingold that is disputed by Johnson.

We rate Feingold’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968B93C0>],/factchecks/2010/oct/12/russ-feingold/sen-russ-feingold-says-unfair-trade-deals-have-cos/
