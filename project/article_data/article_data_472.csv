No, clicking on a photo of Trump supposedly having a stroke does not cause a virus on your computer
","In the world of hacking, scammers are known to publish enticing headlines of fake breaking news or sensational photos to trick people into clicking on virus-infected links. One warning currently circulating online is itself a hoax. A social media ""warning"" post is going around that says a photo of President Donald Trump having a stroke is actually a virus that will wipe out your information if you click on it. The message says: ""There are (pics) going around of Trump having a stroke. Do not open. It will wipe out all information in your phone and computer. Pass this on."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could find no virus or malware scam like the one described and, for the record, Trump has not suffered from a stroke. If he had, it would have made huge domestic and international news. Versions of the faux notice have gone around since at least early 2017. A similar false warning came in 2016, claiming that a video of Trump getting arrested would infest computers if opened. That was also false.   Sharing false warnings, for any situation, may not appear to have any drawbacks, but people should not expect such things to keep their information safe. It is important to be cautious when clicking on links and visiting new websites, especially when it involves high-profile figures.

Did 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris say 'We will take their (health) insurance away'?
","When asked why he endorsed President Donald Trump for re-election, U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., responded by criticizing policy stances taken by Democrats who are running for president. He singled out U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who some media (Rolling Stone, CNN, Vanity Fair) suggest is the early front-runner in a large and unsettled field of Democrats seeking the 2020 nomination. Here's how Gardner attacked Harris. Gardner made his comments during this part of an interview with Ryan Warner of Colorado Public Radio (bolded emphasis is ours): Gardner: ""Well, if you look at the people that he'll be running against who will receive the Democratic nomination, these are people who have embraced higher taxes, more regulations. They want to undo a lot of the progress that's been made in the economy for people across our country who were able to take more of their own pay home. We've heard socialized medicine efforts, people that want to take away 150, 160 million people's insurance. I don't support that. We've heard talk of a lot of things that they want to do, and this  — creep, ever creep — towards socialism, I think is the wrong direction for our country."" Warner: ""I think those folks who want to take people's insurance away, as you put it, might put it differently, and say they want to make sure that there's —""

Gardner: ""Well, they did not. I mean, listen to what Kamala Harris said. She said, ‘Let's just do away with that.’ That's not my words. That's what she said. When it comes to somebody's insurance in this country, she said, ‘Let's just do away with that.’ That's not making it up. Those are her words on national television."" Warner: ""I would think the idea, though, is to make sure that people are covered in terms of health care. Do you have any misgivings  —""

Gardner: ""She would take their insurance away. Now, you can't put words in her mouth. What she said is, ‘We will take their insurance away.’ That's what she said."" Before we get into what Harris said, or didn't say, it’s important to understand Medicare for All, which is what Gardner is getting at with his comments. Medicare for All is a proposal from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has also announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president. Sanders’ plan would create a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. It would replace all other insurance, including employer-provided insurance, Medicaid and ultimately Medicare. (Read our explainer on what Medicare for All is, and what it isn’t.) In her campaign launch speech, Harris said: ""I am running to declare, once and for all, that health care is a fundamental right, and we will deliver that right with Medicare for All!"" And she has since defended her support of Medicare for All. A Gardner spokeswoman confirmed that Gardner was referring in his interview to comments Harris made at a town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, a couple of weeks earlier. The event was hosted by Jake Tapper and was broadcast by CNN. Here was the exchange (bolded emphasis is ours): Audience member: ""What is your solution to ensure that people have access to quality health care at an affordable price? And does that solution involve cutting insurance companies as we know them out of the equation?""

Harris: ""I believe the solution -- and I actually feel very strongly about this — is that we need to have Medicare for All. That's just the bottom line."" Moments later, Tapper noted that Harris is a co-sponsor of Sanders’ Medicare for All bill, and the exchange continued. Tapper: ""I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. So, for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it?""

Harris: ""Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. Who of us has not had that situation, where you've got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this? Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on."" On a literal level, Gardner is misquoting Harris. She never said, ""Let's do away with that,"" or ""We will take their insurance away."" Harris said, ""Let's eliminate all that,"" referring to the approval and waiting process of having to go through a private insurance company. Yet, by supporting Medicare For All, Harris is advocating for getting rid of the private insurance market. In that sense, Gardner is right that Harris supports changing the health care system for many people. But he fails to make clear that she supports replacing their health care with something else, not taking away their health care entirely. As the New York Times reported: Harris ""breezily"" made reference to ending private insurance, which drew attacks from Republicans and triggered an intraparty debate among Democrats. Her aides later hastened to add that she would also support changes to health care that are less sweeping, the Times said. But Harris campaign aides also said, as reported by CNN, that Harris’ ""willingness to consider alternate routes to a single-payer system should not cast doubt on her commitment to the policy."" In response to Gardner’s claim, Harris’ spokesman told us: ""The Medicare for All bill Harris supports would give every American access to insurance."" Gardner says that Harris said, ""We will take their (health) insurance away."" Gardner’s reference was to Harris’ remarks at a CNN town hall. Gardner was adamant that's what Harris said, but that's wrong. Asked about her support for Medicare for All, and its elimination of private health insurance, Harris criticized various aspects of private insurance and said, ""let’s do away with all of that."" The context was clear. That said, Harris does support Medicare for All, which would end the private health insurance system. But where Gardner was silent is that the plan Harris supports would create a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone. People would change health insurance.

"['Federal Budget', 'Income', 'Workers', 'Missouri', 'Jason Smith']","
Federal workers are paid more than the average southern Missourian
","The House of Representatives passed a 2.6 percent pay raise for all civilian federal employees in response to a government shutdown that left hundreds of thousands of federal workers either furloughed or working without pay. Some Republican lawmakers decried the move. U.S. Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., sent out a tweet saying, ""Where I come from you don’t get a pay raise just for showing up to work."" ""Today Dem leaders pushed a $5B pay raise for federal workers who are paid well above the HOUSEHOLD income in southern Missouri. Retweet if you think that money would be better spent to #SecureOurBorder."" Where I come from you don't get a pay raise just for showing up to work. Today Dem leaders pushed a $5B pay raise for federal workers who are paid well above the HOUSEHOLD income in southern Missouri. Retweet if you think that money would be better spent to #SecureOurBorder On Feb. 1, Smith repeated the claim in his Weekly Capitol Report. The raise in question matches an increase in pay for military personnel that was passed in 2019. If passed by the Senate, the bill would undo a pay freeze instituted by President Donald Trump on Dec. 28. We decided to take a closer look to see if federal workers really do make that much more than southern Missourians and if so, why. Smith’s claim focuses on two different metrics — the income of an individual federal civilian employee and the income of households in southern Missouri. This distinction is important, because household income can include the wages and salaries of multiple people. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis supports Smith’s claim that individual federal employees bring in more pay than southern Missouri households. The mean household income in Missouri is $70,144, a figure already lower than the mean income of a federal civilian worker, which is $90,811. When asked for data supporting the claim, Smith’s communications director Joey Brown pointed to census data compiled by congressional district. To determine the average household income in ""southern"" Missouri, we looked at the two congressional districts that cover the state’s southernmost counties — districts 7 and 8. Smith’s district, Congressional District 8, encompasses the southeast corner of the state, stretching from Ozark County to Jefferson County and extending into the Bootheel region. There, the mean household income is $54,393. In neighboring Congressional District 7, which covers the southwest corner of the state, the mean household income is $62,145. There are many explanations for why federal employees are paid more than the average southern Missourian household. Experts told us that any comparison should also take into account education, training, skills and experience that increase worker productivity and typically result in higher incomes. The federal government’s 2.2 million civilian workers tend to be ""older, more educated and more concentrated in professional occupations than private-sector workers,"" according to the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress. About 51 percent of federal workers have attained at least a bachelor’s degree. In Smith’s district, about 16 percent of constituents 25 and older have a bachelor’s degree, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Office of Personnel Management. A report by the Congressional Budget Office that accounted for these differences found that there is a disparity between how federal and private workers are paid. But this disparity depends on levels of education. ""There’s very little question that the top people in government are being paid quite a bit less usually than the top people with those kinds of skills in the private sector,"" said University of Missouri economics professor Peter Mueser. Federal workers with a professional or doctorate degree earned roughly 24 percent less than their privately-employed counterparts. But federal workers with no more than a high school education earned 34 percent more than similar workers employed outside the federal government. Federal employees whose highest level of education was a bachelor’s degree earned 5 percent more. Another factor worth considering is benefits, said Iowa State University economics professor John Winters by email. In addition to salaries and wages, workers are compensated with benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans and job security. However, benefits are more difficult to quantify, because they are in part based on future predictions and less-detailed data is available on benefits than wages. The CBO study found that for federal employees whose highest level of education was a bachelor’s degree, benefits were 52 percent higher. Average benefits were 93 percent higher for federal employees with no more than a high school education. For employees with a doctorate or professional degree, average benefits were ""about the same in the two sectors."" The bare bones of Smith’s claim hold up to scrutiny. Federal workers do take home more in income than the average household in southern Missouri. But Smith’s statement doesn’t take into account differences between southern Missourians and the average federal employee that help explain income disparity, such as education.

Rep. Tom McClintock distorts number of homicides by undocumented immigrants
","Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., is a strong supporter of President Trump and his efforts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.  The congressman, who represents the suburbs east of Sacramento and much of the Sierra Nevada, says building a wall is a necessary step to achieve border security.  He made that argument during a speech on the U.S. House floor last month, which PolitiFact California readers suggested should be fact-checked. One statement in particular stood out: ""In 2017, illegal aliens murdered 1,800 Americans,"" McClintock said in his Jan. 29 speech.  We fact-checked that startling claim. Our research Immigration researchers say there is no comprehensive national database or study tracking how many people have been killed by undocumented immigrants or the nationality of their victims. Law enforcement officials in many states do not ask suspects for their immigration status. An estimated 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the United States in 2016, according to a report this month from the Pew Research Center. That figure was the lowest in a decade and represented about 3.3 percent of the country’s population. Certainly, some undocumented immigrants do commit violent crimes. Asked to support the claim of 1,800 murders, McClintock’s office pointed, without explanation, to a report by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, titled Fiscal Year 2017 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Report.  McClintock’s office pointed to a 2017 ICE report, which includes the above data on homicide convictions and other offenses by ""arrested aliens."" The crimes listed, however, did not necessarily take place in 2017, but instead over many years, according to immigration experts.   ‘Outrageously high’  The document summarizes ICE’s deportation efforts, including removing people in the country illegally following their prison terms for crimes from traffic offenses to homicide. We asked several immigration experts to assess the report with a special focus on a chart that McClintock likely used for the 1,800 figure. The experts said that number is greatly inflated and that a closer inspection shows it does not represent murders in 2017, as the congressman claimed, but instead represents homicide convictions amassed over a much longer period of time.   ""1,800 murders by illegal immigrants is insanely and outrageously high,"" Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think-tank, wrote in an email. ""Illegal immigrants, about 3.75 percent of the population, did not commit 10.4 percent of murders in the U.S.,"" in 2017. There were 17,284 homicides in the United States in 2017, according to FBI crime data, which does not include information on immigration status. ‘Not a definitive source’  Nowrasteh said McClintock’s 1,800 figure (actually 1,886 in the report) represents a combination of homicide charges (355) and homicide convictions (1,531), mostly for people who were released from prison and taken into ICE custody in 2017 for deportation. But the homicides, he said, took place ""over the last several decades,"" and not in a single year. An ICE spokeswoman said she had no information about when the crimes occured. She also could not say how many of the 355 homicide charges resulted in convictions. ""It’s not really a definitive source,"" added Louis DeSipio, a professor of political science at University of California at Irvine, who specializes in immigration. The tally of 1,886 homicide convictions ""doesn’t necessarily mean the people committed the crime in 2017,"" he said. DeSipio added that the report appears to include not just unauthorized immigrants, or ""illegal aliens"" as McClintock described them, but also potentially the much larger group of legal permanent residents. Asked about this, the ICE spokeswoman said the vast majority of individuals taken into custody by the agency are in the country illegally. Charis Kubrin, a criminology professor at University of California at Irvine, questioned whether the report lumped in lesser crimes with homicides, given footnotes that discuss ""the criminal background"" and ""all criminal charges and convictions."" The ICE spokeswoman said that was not the case. ""It’s a muddling kind of way to present the data,"" Kubrin said. ""And I can see why someone would look at 1,886, go over (in the report’s same table) and look at ‘homicide’ and want to make that claim. But that claim is incorrect."" A spokesman for McClintock said the congressman ""stands by his speech."" He noted that Vice President Mike Pence made the same claim last July. Distorting the facts Looking at past fact checks, McClintock isn’t the first to distort the facts on this topic. In December, PolitiFact National fact-checked a viral Facebook post that claimed: ""2,000 illegal aliens were arrested by ICE in 2017 for murders committed here in the United States!"" PolitiFact rated that claim False after finding it also misinterprets ICE data, and noting the offenses in the agency’s report could have been accumulated over many years. In that case, immigration experts told PolitiFact there is no comprehensive data on homicides committed by unauthorized immigrants. ""There is no way to count it because no one keeps track,"" Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think-tank that favors low levels of immigration, told PolitiFact. Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, also told PolitiFact ""the homicides could have been committed at any time, not in a single year."" Earlier this week, PolitiFact also rated False a claim by Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. It found he also innacurately portrayed data on murders attributed to immigrants in the country illegally. Our rating  Rep. Tom McClintock claimed, ""In 2017, illegal aliens murdered 1,800 Americans."" There is no comprehensive database that tracks these figures. Immigration researchers said the 2017 ICE report McClintock relied on does not support his claim and that the 1,800 figure is greatly inflated. The report tallies 1,531 homicide convictions and 355 homicide charges for people taken into ICE custody in 2017 for deportation, some after completing prison terms for their crimes.  The convictions, however, represent crimes that took place over potentially several decades, and not necessarily in 2017, according to immigration experts. There’s also no accounting for how many of the homicide charges led to convictions. Additionally, the figures may also include some legal permanent residents, a group that’s much larger than those who are in the country illegally. Overall, we found McClintock’s claim is a severe exaggeration and misrepresents the information in the report. We rate it False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Text on top of the photo says, ""‘Broadway’ Joe Namath an Al Woodall. All the players used to kneel for the National Anthem. Now do you understand the ignorance of the current administration and his minions?"" ""Ponder this. What changed?"" The Facebook page’s caption for the post, ""White History 101,"" seems to suggest that the practice only became a problem when Kaepernick, a black player, started to do it. The image has been shared over 10,000 times and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

A reverse-image search led us to the ""Lively Morgue"" Tumblr page, a blog set up by the New York Times to showcase photographs from the newspaper’s archives. The picture of Namath was taken by sports photographer Barton Silverman when the New York Jets played the New England Patriots on Nov. 11, 1973.

Namath stood on the sidelines as his team played, a shoulder injury keeping him out of uniform. The Jets won the game without him. A recap published the next day said that Woodall came out of the game after straining a tendon in his right elbow early in the second quarter. The Lively Morgue also provided a shot of the back of the photo, which was covered in clippings, stamps and notes. Though partially concealed, the original caption says the photo was taken in the third quarter, long after the national anthem would have played. Namath did appear on multiple Fox News shows in recent years and showed support for players’ decision to protest, but has also said the flag needs to be respected, too. A post sharing a photo of Joe Namath claims he was kneeling during the national anthem and it was something ""all players"" used to do. The photo is legitimate, but it was taken sometime during the third quarter after Namath’s teammate, Al Woodall, left the game due to an injury.

Was Joe Manchin right about the scale of shutdown's impact in W.Va.?
","As the partial government shutdown was underway in January, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., tweeted about his distaste for the closure. In the tweet sent on Jan. 2, 2019, Manchin wrote, ""I have always said we should never shutdown the government and governing this way is embarrassing for both Democrats and Republicans. This partial government shutdown effects every American, including the 18,000 federal employees in West Virginia."" The tweet linked to a more detailed statement by the senator that listed some of the federal agencies that have workers in West Virginia. I have always said we should never shutdown the government and governing this way is embarrassing for both Democrats and Republicans. This partial government shutdown effects every American, including the 18,000 federal employees in West Virginia. MORE: https://t.co/BKrpwdWJa9 We decided to take a closer look at whether Manchin was right that the partial government shutdown affected ""18,000 federal employees in West Virginia."" How many federal workers are there in West Virginia? It turns out that Manchin’s number is in the ballpark. Data from the Office of Personnel Management -- the federal government’s human resources department -- shows that as of September 2017, West Virginia had a total of 18,656 federal workers. Determining the accuracy of Manchin’s tweet requires a look at some background on the shutdown. The shutdown stemmed largely from disagreement between President Donald Trump and the Democratic-controlled House over whether to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and, if so, how much money should be allocated for it. It was a partial rather than a full shutdown because only some federal agencies had to close because their funding bills expired. The departments affected by the partial shutdown due to their funding bills expiring were Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice, parts of Interior (such as the Bureau of Reclamation), State, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Treasury and NASA. A range of independent agencies were also shuttered, including the U.S. Trade Representative, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Archives and Records Administration, and the Smithsonian Institution. At the same time, other departments had valid spending bills in place, so they operated as normal. They included Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, Veterans Affairs and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The shuttered federal departments and agencies employed more than 800,000 people, or roughly 40 percent of the federal workforce. These 800,000 employees fell into two categories. About 380,000 were furloughed, meaning they could come to work and were not being paid. Another 420,000 weren’t being paid, but were required to remain on the job. This distinction is relevant for analyzing the text of Manchin’s tweet, because it means that 60 percent of federal workers whose agencies were running as normal were on the job and were paid on time. This means that not every West Virginia federal worker was directly affected by the shutdown, either by being furloughed or by being required to work without being paid. The workers who remained on the job and received their paychecks may have been affected by the shutdown by virtue of being ordinary Americans who lacked access to certain shuttered federal services. But they were not specifically affected because of their own federal job. And Manchin was correct in his detailed statement when he cited a range of departments and agencies that were left without valid funding bills. They included the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI, the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Service, the Justice Department’s Bureau of Prisons, and the National Science Foundation's Green Bank Observatory. Manchin tweeted that the partial government shutdown in early 2019 affected ""18,000 federal employees in West Virginia."" Manchin is close on the number of federal workers in the state. However, it’s important to note that not all of those federal workers in West Virginia were either furloughed or required to work without pay; those employed by agencies with valid spending bills were working and getting paid as normal.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Federal Budget', 'Amy Klobuchar']","
Would the 2013 immigration bill have saved $158 billion, as Amy Klobuchar said?
","Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a presidential candidate, pitched immigration legislation as a way to ease the federal fiscal picture during a CNN town hall in New Hampshire. During the Feb. 19 town hall, a participant asked what Klobuchar’s budget proposal would look like if she became president. One of the elements she mentioned was her support for overhauling the nation’s immigration system -- a change that, she said, would save the federal government money. Klobuchar said, ""One thing alone -- comprehensive immigration reform, the bill we had back in 2013, supported by none other than Grover Norquist. Why? Because it brought the debt down $158 billion, OK? That is how much it would save."" She was referring to S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which was the fruit of a round of negotiations between a group of bipartisan senators known as the ""Gang of Eight."" The bill would have given many undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship, and it would have created or expanded other forms of legal immigration. Meanwhile, it would have provided a large increase in border security. The bill passed the Senate on June 27, 2013, by a 68-32 margin. It never advanced through the House, meaning it never became law, even though President Barack Obama was willing to sign it. Klobuchar was one of many Senate Democrats who voted for the bill. (Her mention of Grover Norquist refers to a prominent anti-tax conservative activist who supported the bill.) We decided to take a closer look at Klobuchar’s statement that the 2013 bill ""brought the debt down $158 billion."" We found that Klobuchar is justified in saying the bill was judged to be a net positive for the federal budget, but she used the wrong word to describe its fiscal impact. The bill would have reduced future net federal spending, but it would not have reduced actual debt. The source of the $158 billion figure is an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan arm of Congress that is tasked with publishing the official cost estimates of bills being considered in the House and Senate. The CBO cost estimate for the version of the bill that passed the Senate said it would, on net, shrink federal budget deficits by $158 billion in the 10-year period 2014 and 2023. And over the following decade, from 2024 to 2033, CBO projected that the decrease in the deficit would be bigger -- $685 billion. In making these calculations, CBO noted that federal spending would increase in some ways, but that this increase would be more than balanced out by increases in revenues. For instance, newly legalized individuals would be eligible for benefits, costing the treasury. But once their work status was legalized, these workers would start to pay taxes, thus increasing federal revenues by more than those workers would draw in benefits. Opponents of the bill, particularly conservatives, pointed out other aspects of the CBO’s analysis that they found worrisome, including the projection that average wages for the labor force as a whole would be 0.1 percent lower in 2023, because many of the newly legalized individuals would be less skilled than the workforce as a whole. (Wages, however, would be 0.5 percent higher 10 years later, in 2033.) So what’s wrong with Klobuchar’s wording? She said ""debt"" when she should have said ""deficit"" -- the metric that CBO was looking at. The difference isn’t trivial. ""Deficit"" refers to an annual shortfall, in which outlays exceed revenues. The ""debt"" is the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus any surpluses. Even when deficits shrink, the debt still grows, as long as deficits don’t shrink all the way to zero (as they wouldn’t have with this bill). The cumulative debt only starts going down once you have a surplus. The Klobuchar campaign noted that her point was that as a result of the bill, the debt would be $158 billion lower than it would have been otherwise, according to CBO’s projections. She has a point, but her specific words didn’t provide that nuance. Klobuchar said, ""Comprehensive immigration reform, the bill we had back in 2013 ... brought the debt down $158 billion."" The bill would have brought down projected future deficits by a total of $158 billion over 10 years. But the debt would have still gone up, just at a slower rate than it would have otherwise.

Trump falsely claims Northam said he'd let doctors 'execute' newborns
","Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is facing national scorn for a racist photo that appears by his name in his 1984 medical school yearbook. President Donald Trump has been deriding the Democrat, but for a different reason. Here’s what Trump said during a Feb. 11 rally in El Paso, Texas: ""The governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world, and wrap the baby, and make the baby comfortable, and then talk to the mother and talk to the father, and then execute the baby. Execute the baby!"" Trump made a similar statement in his State of the Union speech on Feb. 6. After criticizing New York’s recent easing of abortion restrictions, Trump said, ""And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth."" Did Northam, a pediatric neurologist, really say he would ""execute a baby"" after birth? Northam’s comments are confusing, but Trump put words in the governor’s mouth. The story begins on Jan. 28 when a subcommittee of the Virginia's House of Delegates was considering a Democrat-backed bill that would have loosened the state’s abortion laws in all stages of pregnancy. Much of the debate, however, focused on late-term abortions. Virginia allows third-trimester abortions in hospitals if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would ""likely"" kill the woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" harm her mental or physical health. The proposed bill, which was defeated, would have lowered the authorization from three physicians to one. That doctor only would have to certify that the pregnancy would damage a woman’s health. The ""substantial and irremediable"" threshold would have been repealed. The bill’s sponsor - Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax - faced tough questioning from Republicans on the third-trimester proposals. Asked if the legislation would allow a woman who is dilating to get an abortion, she said, ""My bill would allow that. Yes."" Video of her statement went viral, drawing partisan charges that Democrats were endorsing ""infanticide."" Democrats accused the GOP of launching a stunt during an election year when all 140 General Assembly seats are on the ballot. Virginia Department of Health records show two third-trimester abortions have been performed in Virginia since 2000, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Northam’s comments Trump’s lambasting of Northam is based on confusing comments the governor made on Jan. 30 - two days after the hearing - during a radio interview on WTOP in Washington. Northam, an abortion-rights advocate, was asked to explain Tran’s statement. ""This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers, physicians, and the mothers and fathers that are involved,"" Northam said. ""When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent, obviously, of the mother, with the consent of the physicians - more than one physician, by the way. It’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s nonviable. ""So, in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen,"" he added. ""The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother."" A number of conservative media outlets and national Republican leaders quickly accused Northam of sanctioning killing babies. Trump predicted Northam's words will ""lift up the whole pro-life movement like maybe it's never been lifted up before."" Northam, during a Jan. 31 news conference, took offense at the charges but did not clarify his WTOP remarks. ""I have devoted my life to caring for children and any insinuation otherwise is shameful and disgusting,"" he said. Ofirah Yheskel, Northam’s communications director, issued a written statement accusing critics of twisting the governor’s words. ""No woman seeks a third-trimester abortion except in the case of tragic or difficult circumstances, such as a nonviable pregnancy or in the event of severe fetal abnormalities, and the governor's comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman in those circumstances went into labor,"" Yheskel wrote. ""Attempts to extrapolate these comments otherwise is in bad faith and underscores exactly why the governor believes physicians and women, not legislators, should make these difficult and deeply personal medical decisions."" While Yheshkel’s statement added some clarity, it did not address reporters’ requests for elaboration on what Northam meant by mentioning ""resuscitated"" and ""discussion"" in the same sentence about what happens to a tragically deformed newborn. We asked Yheshkel if the governor meant that a discussion would take place between physicians and parents on whether extraordinary means should be taken to keep the baby alive. She declined to answer, saying, ""I feel we’ve spelled that out, and I don’t know that I want to go beyond that."" Yheshkel added, ""Any insinuation that the governor or any medical physician would do anything but provide the family with the best possible care and exhaust all options is disgusting and shameful."" Our ruling Trump says Northam ""stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby, and make the baby comfortable, and then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby. Execute the baby."" Northam, a physician, never said he would sanction the execution of newborns. What he did say during a radio interview is that in rare, late-pregnancy cases when fetuses are nonviable, doctors deliver the baby, keep it comfortable, resuscitate it if the mother wishes, and then have a ""discussion"" with the mother. The issue is that Northam declines to say what that discussion would entail. Trump puts words in the governor’s mouth, saying doctors would urge the mother to let them forcibly kill the newborn, which is a felony in Virginia punishable by a long prison sentence or death. Trump misstates and exaggerates Northam’s words in ways that fan division. Often, that’s enough for us to torch someone’s pants. But Northam left himself open to some interpretation by declining to clarify his confusing remarks. So we rate Trump’s statement False.  ",/factchecks/2019/feb/20/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-northam-said-he-would-execute/

No, former Starbucks CEO never said he prefers to hire 'illegal immigrants' over vets
","As talk builds around former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz’s possible presidential run, claims about the coffee giant’s hiring practices have resurfaced. A Facebook post shares a rumor that Schultz said he prefers to hire immigrants in the country illegally before hiring U.S. veterans. The post says, ""On the former CEO of STARBUCKS who thinks he can be President: In 2017 if you remember right, stated he would hire an illegal immigrant before he would hire a VET .. Let that sink in folks and share the heck out of this."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that Schultz ever said he would hire immigrants over veterans, and his actions toward veterans and their families also prove otherwise. This claim is a twist on Starbucks’ 2017 pledge to hire 10,000 refugees in the wake of President Donald Trump’s travel ban from Muslim-majority countries. Unlike immigrants who are in the country illegally, refugees go through an application and screening process through the U.S. State Department’s refugee admission program. Starbucks did receive some backlash for the decision, with people calling for boycotts and for the company to hire veterans instead. But Starbucks was already in the process of doing that. In 2013, the company announced it would hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by 2018. The Starbucks Armed Forces Network (AFN), an internal veteran group that provides support for its current and former military employees and their partners, responded to critics in an open letter. The group wrote that Schultz helped lead the veteran-hiring initiative, contributed personal finances and visited military bases as the company helped establish ""military family stores at over 30 bases around the country"" and said that ""less than four years into the commitment, Starbucks has hired over 8,800 veterans and spouses and counting.""   By late March 2017, the company announced it had hit its goal of hiring 10,000 veterans and active-duty spouses a year early and set a new goal of reaching a total of 25,000 veterans and spouses by 2025. A post shared on social media claims that in 2017 Schultz said he would rather hire ""an illegal immigrant"" over a U.S. veteran. We found no record of Schultz saying that. The rumor is a misunderstanding of a Starbucks pledge to hire 10,000 refugees. The company has an internal veterans group and announced it had reached its previous goal of hiring 10,000 veterans and their spouses in March 2017, and it pledged to expand that number.

Grothman off-base with claim on U.S. tax dollars funding abortions abroad
","On Jan. 3, 2019, the House of Representatives -- fresh under Democratic control -- passed a bill in an effort to reopen government departments that were affected by the partial shutdown. Ultimately, that bill didn’t go anywhere, and the shutdown was resolved differently. But we wanted to return to that piece of legislation and a claim made by U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah. His view: Democratic leaders sneakily inserted U.S. funding for overseas abortions into the bill. ""Not even 24 hours into the new session of Congress and Democrats are voting to send our tax dollars overseas to fund abortions,"" he tweeted Jan. 4, 2019. He expanded on that, a bit, in a statement issued Jan. 15, 2019: ""Democrats opened the new Congress by, on day 1, surreptitiously inserting a provision into H.R. 21 that will overturn (Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance) and allow the billions of dollars of aid we send to other countries to be used for abortions."" Is Grothman correct that a provision in the first bill passed by House Democrats would ""allow the billions of dollars of aid we send to other countries to be used for abortions""? Not exactly. The evidence When we asked for backup for the claim, Grothman spokesman Timothy Svoboda cited the text of the bill and noted it ""was sponsored by Nita Lowey and placed on the House floor by Democrat leadership — hence ‘Democrats.’ "" Svoboda also highlighted parts of the bill: Section 7071(a): The bill repeals Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) (expanded Mexico City Policy) (pg. 1021-1022)   PLGHA requires foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to agree, as a condition of their receipt of global health assistance grant money, not to perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.   Reinstated and modernized by President Trump, the policy now applies to all global health programs (approx. $8.8 billion based on FY17 global health assistance funding levels). If NGOs choose to stop doing abortions, they can remain eligible for federal grant money. The choice has been up to the NGO – either change business practices or forego funding from the United States."" On the surface of it, Grothman seems to be correct. But there is more to it than that. Reagan-era Roots The program in question has been part of federal policy off and on for decades, with the policy frequently shifting between presidents. When originally announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 it was dubbed the ""Mexico City Policy"" after the site of a United Nations conference on global population. Critics called it the ""global gag rule."" ""What the policy does is it requires foreign NGOs that receive U.S. government health assistance to certify that they are not using U.S. funds or any other funds to do several things,"" said Emily Maistrellis, a senior program officer for the Program on Global Health Justice and Governance within Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. ""One is provide abortion as a method of family planning. Another is to counsel and refer women to an abortion in a context where abortions are legal."" Organizations also can’t advocate or lobby for the continued legality or push for the legality of abortion in their country. (The policy does not apply to cases of rape, incest or if childbirth endangers the mother’s life.) President Bill Clinton revoked the policy in 1993, claiming it undermined efforts to promote safe family planning abroad. President George W. Bush reinstated it. Then President Barack Obama rescinded it. In 2017, President Donald Trump reinstated it -- but went further. He expanded it under a new name: Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance. The original version applied to funding for family planning programs. ""The policy in its expanded version is applied to any global health funding,"" Maistrellis said. ""It’s expanded in terms of dollar amount. It’s expanded in terms of areas of health and the potential (foreign) NGOs that will be affected."" Barriers to funding abortions So, had the House Democrats been successful with their measure, and undid the new policy, would it mean U.S. aid money could then go to fund abortions? No. Before the Mexico City Policy, there was a budget amendment enacted in 1973 that states ""no foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions."" The so-called ""Helms Amendment"" was named for the late U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-North Carolina. That remains in place and, according to Maistrellis, is ""scrupulously applied"" by federal agencies. If that’s the case, why has the Mexico City Policy been put in place and undone so many times over the years? That relates to a wrinkle in how it applies. Before the Mexico City Policy, U.S. aid recipients could use non-U.S. funds to engage in abortion-related activities, but had to keep it separate from U.S. aid money. So, when the policy is not in effect, countries that pursue abortion-related activities can still get U.S. family planning money. They just can’t mix the two pots together. When the policy is in place, if foreign NGOs want to receive any family planning funds from the U.S., they cannot use any other funding for abortion-related activities. Meanwhile, under Trump’s expanded policy, any U.S. health funding -- not just family-planning related money -- is affected in this way. That’s the policy in place today. Our rating Grothman claimed a provision in a bill backed by House Democrats would ""allow the billions of dollars of aid we send to other countries to be used for abortions."" Part of the language in the bill would have extended a long-running back-and-forth on the Mexico City policy. But the so-called Helms Amendment would have remained in place. Therefore, U.S. tax dollars could not be used to fund abortions abroad. We rate Grothman’s claim False. ",/factchecks/2019/feb/19/glenn-grothman/grothman-base-claim-us-tax-dollars-funding-abortio/
"['Climate Change', 'PunditFact', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Scientists’ response to Rush Limbaugh’s climate denial: ‘utter nonsense’
","Conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh dismissed climate change as the work of agenda-driven computer models spitting out threats that loom just beyond the horizon, where scientists can elude accountability for their dubious predictions. ""Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30,"" Limbaugh said on Fox News Sunday. ""Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next ten years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true."" What's not true, in this case, is what Limbaugh said. We'll explain why with the help of scientists.  The first problem with Limbaugh’s claim is this: Climate change is already happening. Its impact is seen around the world. Here’s the topline: The broad scientific consensus is that human factors are the main contributor to global warming, with carbon dioxide emissions primarily driving up the earth’s temperature, which are now at record levels. ""Utter nonsense,"" is how climate scientist Kevin Trenberth characterized Limbaugh’s claim. ""We can simply look at the actual climate record,"" said Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""The Earth is now hotter than it has ever been on record."" The last four years were the hottest on record, according to an analysis by the World Meteorological Organization of five leading international datasets. In 2018, the oceans as a whole — which contain most of the earth’s energy — were the hottest on record, according to an international panel of scientists who track the data. What’s more, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading authority on climate change has concluded with high confidence that ""impacts on natural and human systems from global warming have already been observed."" Last summer, the Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area of Norway was found to be 40 percent below average for that time of year, according to the Norwegian Ice Service, which tracks data going back to 1981. Scientists also point to an uptick in extreme weather. Trenberth noted that rainfalls are heavier in most places around the world, and that 2015 was the most active hurricane year globally on record. ""It’s not just ‘a bunch of computer models,’ "" said Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""Climate change is visible in hundreds of independent observational data sets of land, ice, ocean, ecosystems."" Limbaugh said climate predictions are always pegged to some distant future, ""when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true."" But what about predictions from decades past? According to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist with Berkeley Earth, these older projections have largely been borne out. ""Broadly speaking, climate models have been quite skillful over the past 30 years in predicting warming in the years after they were published,"" said Hausfather, who assessed previous climate change models in an analysis for the website Carbon Brief. He cited the example of Columbia University scientist Wally Broecker, who in 1975 predicted global temperatures would rise due to increased CO2 emissions.  ""Broecker predicted by 2010 the world would have warmed by around 0.74C,"" Hausfather said. ""In reality, it warmed by 0.62C, which is pretty good for a very rudimentary climate model in the 1970s."" Scientists often focus on longer-term projections because a warming trend, relative to natural variability, can be seen more clearly from this timeframe, said John Reilly, a climate scientist at MIT. However, many climate models begin their simulations around 1850, and can project forward through the present day, and up to the year 2100. ""So there are projections for the present and next few years,"" Reilly said. Limbaugh said, ""Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30. Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next ten years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true."" First, global warming is already happening. Earth is the hottest it has ever been, and the impact is observable. Second, climate change predictions from decades past have largely been borne out. Third, models project further out because it helps show warming trends more clearly, relative to natural variability. But scientists also have near-term projections available. We rate this False.  We updated this article on March 5, 2019, to make clear that the Earth is now hotter than it has ever been based on the record of the planet's measured climate.",/factchecks/2019/feb/19/rush-limbaugh/scientists-response-rush-limbaughs-climate-denial-/

Florida congressman misrepresents data on murders attributed to immigrants in the country illegally
","Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has defended bringing up illegal immigration and a need for a border wall at a hearing on gun violence. ""Because the wall will help have fewer violent illegal immigrants in this country killing people,"" Gaetz told CNN host Chris Cuomo during a Feb. 7 interview. Cuomo challenged his choice, arguing that ""the numbers don't match up, and the politics don't match up."" ""Do you realize that one out of every five people that the federal government charges with murder is an illegal alien?"" Gaetz responded. In that same interview, Gaetz claimed that the Democratic platform in 1992 said immigrants came to the United States illegally, committed felonies, were deported, and came back to do the same thing. We rated that Mostly True (because it was '96). But on this murder statistic, Gaetz is wrong. Rather than present evidence for a broad trend, his office told PolitiFact he was citing a single year's number that came from the U.S. Sentencing Commission. The number for the 2016 fiscal year nearly reflects what Gaetz claimed, though his description was imprecise. The commission’s data is on people sentenced for murder, not just charged with that offense. The bigger flaw in what Gaetz laid out, however, comes down to cherry-picking. He presented the one-in-five statistic as a trend. But the percentage of ""illegal aliens"" sentenced for murder in 2016 (17.9 percent of 84 people sentenced) was notably higher than the percentages reported in recent years. For instance, in 2015, ""illegal aliens"" accounted for 5.5 percent of the 91 people sentenced in federal courts for murder. In 2017, they represented 6.9 percent of the 72 people sentenced. Worth keeping in mind: Most murder cases are handled at the state level. ""Federal murder sentences constitute an extremely small fraction of murder sentences nationwide,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, emeritus professor at the department of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. Information on the citizenship of people who commit crimes is limited. There is no comprehensive or consistent data on the number of overall murders committed by immigrants in the country illegally. The U.S. Sentencing Commission data looks at sentences for crimes tried in federal courts. The report lists the primary offenses for which individuals were sentenced (such as murder, fraud, immigration), the total number of people sentenced per offense, and how many of those sentenced were either a U.S. citizen or non-U.S. citizen. In 2016, 84 people were sentenced in federal courts for murder. Of those, 22.6 percent were non-U.S. citizens. Not every non-U.S. citizen was in the country illegally. The category includes immigrants who are in the United States legally. An interactive tool breaks down the non-U.S. citizen category to show that ""illegal aliens"" accounted for 17.9 percent of the 84 people sentenced for murder in 2016. That’s close to Gaetz's figure. But it’s out of date and not reflective of the longer-term trend. In fiscal year 2017, there were 72 people sentenced in federal courts for murder. Five of them, or 6.9 percent, were in the United States illegally. The commission’s interactive tool lists data from 2006 through 2017. In that time period, 2016 had the highest percentage of immigrants in the country illegally sentenced for murder. The average over that 12-year period was 7.85 percent. A spokesperson for Gaetz did not clarify why he did not use the most recent numbers available, or why sentencing data was used to back a claim about charges. The commission’s data is on offenders sentenced in a fiscal year. Figures do not include cases initiated but for which no convictions were obtained; offenders convicted for whom no sentences were yet issued; and offenders sentenced but for whom no sentencing documents were submitted to the commission. Gaetz’s latest claim is similar to another one he made in 2017: He claimed that immigrants in the country illegally made up roughly 3.5 percent of the population in 2014, and ""committed over 10 percent of all murders."" We rated it Mostly False. A criminologist then told us that it’s misleading to make assumptions and inferences based on the commission’s data, since it’s specific and limited to federal sentences. Violent offenses are a small subset of the federal caseload. It’s difficult to determine how many murders are committed by immigrants illegally in the United States. For instance, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program publishes data on murders reported across the country. It has data on the age, sex, race and ethnicity of offenders, but not on their immigration status. The FBI program also does not collect conviction or sentencing information. Gaetz said, ""One out of every five people that the federal government charges with murder is an illegal alien."" Information provided by his office is outdated and does not directly back what he said. He relied on 2016 federal sentencing data that said nearly 20 percent of ""illegal aliens"" were sentenced for murder that year (out of 84 people sentenced). The latest numbers available are from 2017, and reflect a much lower percentage. Of 72 people sentenced in 2017, 6.9 percent were ""illegal aliens."" Federal sentencing data from 2006 through 2017 shows that 7.85 was the average percentage of ""illegal aliens"" sentenced for murder over that period. Most murder convictions and sentences happen at the state, not federal level. There isn’t comprehensive national data on crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally. The claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2019/feb/19/matt-gaetz/gaetz-misrepresents-federal-data-murder-immigrants/

Boehner says Democrats' health care plan would subsidize abortions
","
In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion.
 
The word ""abortion"" was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage.
 
In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan ""will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.""
 
Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage.
 
But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question.
 
Let's back up a minute and explain some background:
 
Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. 
 
President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, ""As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station.""
 
Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer.
 
To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money ""to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion."" The amendment was narrowly defeated.
 
Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a ""radical departure from the status quo,"" because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely.
 
According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions.
 
And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill ""abortion neutral.""
 
A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange.
 
Under the Capps amendment:
 
• Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange.
 
• The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage.
 
• Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger.
 
• At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not.
 
• Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions.
 
• The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws.
 
Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping.
 
The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, ""It's still the government running the whole plan.""
 
""The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan,"" Johnson said.
 
But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups.
 
Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a ""misleading campaign"" that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions.
 
""The goal should be to maintain the current policies,"" Korzen said. ""That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim.""
 
And, he said, ""there's a lot to be happy about,""  including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package.
 
Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents.
 
""We thought they got everything they wanted,"" Crane said. ""We are confused why they continue to push.""
 
Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate.
 
The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that.
 
In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement False.

The claim comes from a long list of items allegedly in the bill that is posted on the group's Web site and has been widely circulated in a chain e-mail. The list looks a lot like one that we

checked

in July, based partly on blog postings by Peter Fleckenstein on his blog

Common Sense from a Common Man

. In fact, the Liberty Counsel says it adapted its memo from Fleckenstein's original work.

 

The group describes its mission as an ""education and policy organization dedicated to advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of human life and the traditional family"" and is affiliated with Liberty University School of Law in Lynchburg, Va. The group said it was so troubled by Fleckenstein's analysis that it ""doubted its accuracy, so the staff in our D.C. office compared it to the voluminous bill. What they found astonished us so much that we had to share it with you today. You can read our updated and revised overview of HR 3200 and you will be alarmed, too.""

 

It appears to us that Liberty Counsel elaborated on Fleckenstein's original take on the clinics. He wrote, ""PG 993 Govt will establish school based health clinics. Ur kids wont have a chance.""


School-based health clinics are different from the traditional nurse's offices that schools have long had. Typically, the clinics are staffed with nurse practitioners, doctors and social workers who do everything from administer immunizations to provide nutrition advice. They can also provide counseling. Federal and state governments have long provided funding to support these clinics, which tend to crop up in areas where students have limited access to other health care services.

 

""These clinics have been around for 30 years,"" said Divya Mohan Little, communications director for the National Assembly on School-Based Health Care. ""They've been getting a lot of attention recently in a time of recession because fewer kids are being covered and aren't able to see doctors.""


Of the 2,000 clinics nationwide, none provide abortions and the bill would not change that, said Mohan Little.

 

There are three major versions of the bill floating around the House — one in the Energy and Commerce Committee, one in the Ways and Means Committee and one in the Education and Labor Committee — and we checked all three just to make sure.

 

All three bills have identical language when it comes to the school clinics. Basically, the bill would provide grants so the clinics can continue providing ""comprehensive health assessments, diagnosis, and treatment of minor, acute, and chronic medical conditions and referrals to, and follow-up for, specialty care.""

 

The money could also be used to provide ""mental health assessments, crisis interventions, counseling, treatment and referral to a continuum of services including emergency psychiatric care, community support programs, inpatient care and outpatient care."" The clinics would have the option to provide, ""oral health, social and age-appropriate health education services including nutritional counseling.""

 

Clinics getting federal dollars must act in accordance with federal, state and local law, according to the bills. For example, clinics in Louisiana are not even allowed to counsel students on abortion, according to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.


And here's the important part: the bills now before the House say nothing about the school clinics being able to offer abortions.


Perplexed, we called the Liberty Counsel to see how they could make the connection from innocuous langauge about clinics that have been around for 30 years to the claim that ""children will be indoctrinated and your grandchildren may be aborted!""


We spoke with Sarah Speller at the Liberty Counsel, who told us that the group had been getting a lot of calls about the memo and that everyone there was very busy as a result. However, she assured us that ""as far as our office can tell, everything in the overview is accurate. That's about all I can tell you,"" she said. ""I'm just relaying what I've been told to say.""

 

That's not persuasive. We see no language in the three main versions of the bill that would allow school-based clinics, which have a long history of providing basic health services to underprivileged students, to provide abortions. Nor would the clinics even be new — they have been around for three decades. So we rate the claim Pants on Fire!

Paul Krugman claims protests in 2005 weren't as raucous as health care protests
","As congressional town halls across the country increasingly draw loud protests from critics of Democratic health care legislation, a debate is brewing about whether the protests are more raucous than those four years ago against President George W. Bush’s effort to create private accounts for Social Security.
 
In an Aug. 5 blog posting, liberal  New York Times  columnist Paul Krugman wrote:
 
""Indeed, activists made trouble in 2005 by asking congressmen tough questions about policy. Activists are making trouble now by shouting congressmen down so they can’t be heard. It’s exactly the same thing, right?""
 
He continued, ""Seriously, I’ve been searching through news reports on the Social Security town halls, and I can’t find any examples of the kind of behavior we’re seeing now. Yes, there were noisy demonstrations — but they were outside the events. That was even true during the first month or two, when Republicans actually tried having open town halls. Congressmen were very upset by the reception they received, but not, at least according to any of the reports I can find, because opponents were disruptive — crowds booed lines they didn’t like, but that was about it.
 
""After that, the events were open only to demonstrated loyalists; you may recall the people arrested at a Bush Social Security event in Denver for the crime of … not being Bush supporters.
 
""So please, no false equivalences. The campaign against Social Security privatization was energetic and no doubt rude, but did not involve intimidation and disruption.""
 
We decided to join Krugman in looking back to the news clippings. We conclude that while some of the recent conservative protests — such as ones at town halls in Tampa, Little Rock, Ark., Houston, Philadelphia, and Green Bay, Wis.— may have been angrier and more widespread than the ones in 2005, it would be incorrect to suggest, as Krugman does, that the noisy demonstrations against Bush's policies were only taking place outside the events or that disruptions were limited to the occasional boo.
 
We used the Lexis-Nexis news database to find newspaper and wire service stories in calendar year 2005 that included the words ""town hall,"" ""Social Security,"" and a variant of either ""protest,"" ""heckler"" or ""shout."" The search returned just under 250 articles. Not all were relevant, and a majority of ones that were relevant addressed town halls hosted by President Bush rather than Members of Congress.
 
Generally speaking, the Bush events were, as Krugman correctly notes, held in front of largely handpicked crowds, which meant that little disruption went on inside the hall. Most of them, as he also notes, inspired protests outside, some of them loud and unruly, and all of them kept at a distance by the Secret Service. (At one event in Westfield, N.J., for instance, a protest that included ""hundreds"" of people led to the arrest of nine people on disorderly conduct charges.)
 
But for this comparison, we need to look at town halls sponsored by members of Congress. News coverage was more spotty, but here is a sampling of examples we found in which journalists reported conflict inside an event:
 
— ""At two stops, morning at Drexel University, afternoon at Widener University, [Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.] encountered skepticism and hostility as he voiced his support for the White House plan to allow creation of personal accounts using payroll taxes. He was heckled by protesters, called a liar, and told that his views were unconscionable. Those sentiments ranged across the age spectrum. …
 
""Santorum asked the audience what would happen in 2008. The response he wanted was that the oldest baby boomers would turn 62 and be eligible for early retirement.
 
""What he got instead, shouted out by an unfriendly voice, was: ‘George Bush will leave office!’
 
""Actually, that's scheduled for 2009. But many in the crowd cheered anyway.""
(Feb. 23, 2005,  Philadelphia Inquirer  )
 
— ""Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., delivered a PowerPoint presentation Thursday night to a packed auditorium in Phoenix. As he laid out the long-term demographic problems for Social Security and expressed his support for private accounts, Shadegg encountered scattered heckling, boos and hisses.

(Feb. 26,  Chicago Tribune  )
 
— A session sponsored by Rep. Chris Chocola, R-Ind., in South Bend, at the downtown branch of the St. Joseph County Public Library ""was a raucous affair, with many of the 100 or so people who attended shouting questions and insults, talking over each other and still bubbling with questions when it was all over.
 
""One gentleman was so angry when Chocola indicated the hour-long session was coming to an end and wouldn't be extended that he walked out.""

(  South Bend Tribune  , Feb. 27, 2005)
 
— John Busch, a letter-writer to a newspaper in Chico, Calif., said, ""I attended Congressman Wally Herger's recent town hall meeting in Chico regarding Social Security. I must have witnessed more rude, disrespectful behavior from an audience somewhere along the line, I just can't remember where. The congressman's efforts to provide and gather information were continually thwarted by hecklers who seemed not to care what the congressman had to say, but whose sole reason for attending the meeting was to be rude and disruptive. They certainly accomplished that.""

(May 8, 2005,  Enterprise-Record  of Chico, Calif.)
 
Republican officials at the time said that about 95 House lawmakers took part in 287 Social Security-related events in February, with more held in March, so in all likelihood, there were many, many events that did not result in news coverage we could find. So we can't say whether there were protests or shouting matches.
 
And some stories noted the meetings were civil. For example, a Feb. 26, 2005,  Chicago Tribune  report found that a meeting held by Rep. Rick Renzi, R-Ariz., had ""no booing or shouting or threatening tirades. A volunteer from AARP took notes and politely reminded Renzi that ‘Social Security is a retirement plan and a family protection plan. It is not an investment plan.’"" And a different Chocola event, according to the news account, ""was quiet, orderly and polite, with the 60 or so persons on hand taking turns asking questions and listening to Chocola's response.""
 
Still, the protests inside and outside town halls, even if they were not universal, clearly rattled Republican leaders. On March 17, 2005,  USA Today  reported:
 
""Shaken by raucous protests at open ‘town hall’-style meetings last month, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Deborah Pryce of Ohio and other GOP leaders are urging lawmakers to hold lower-profile events this time. … This month, Republican leaders say they are chucking the open town-hall format. They plan to visit newspaper editorial boards and talk to constituents at Rotary Club lunches, senior citizen centers, chambers of commerce meetings and local businesses. In those settings, ‘there isn't an opportunity for it to disintegrate into something that's less desirable,’ says Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.""
 
And leaders of the movement against changing Social Security made no bones about being aggressive.
 
Brad Woodhouse, then a spokesman for Americans United to Protect Social Security, the labor-backed group that was a key player in the fight against Bush’s proposal, told the  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  on March 20, 2005 that ""we are going to be getting in the faces of people who are for privatization; they're going to feel the heat. ... It's vociferous, it's rough, it's tough.""
 
It’s worth noting that today, Woodhouse is on the other side, so to speak — criticizing the people who are disrupting town halls. He is the communications director for the Democratic National Committee and issued a statement on Aug. 4, 2009, blasting ""the Republican Party and Allied Groups’ Mob Rule,"" saying it was ""inciting angry mobs of a small number of rabid right wing extremists funded by K Street Lobbyists to disrupt thoughtful discussions about the future of health care in America taking place in Congressional Districts across the country.""
 
He continued, ""The right wing extremists’ use of things like devil horns on pictures of our elected officials, hanging members of Congress in effigy, breathlessly questioning the president's citizenship and the use of Nazi SS symbols and the like just shows how outside of the mainstream the Republican Party and their allies are. This type of anger and discord did not serve Republicans well in 2008 — and it is bound to backfire again.""
 
It is true that there’s nothing in the clips from 2005 about burning members of Congress in effigy or the use of devils’ horns. But Woodhouse’s group employed 28-foot gorillas, duck suits, plates of hot waffles and sheet cakes as props, according to an Aug. 13, 2005, report in the  Albuquerque Tribune  .

So while the protests may be more intense this time (devils' horns instead of duck suits), it's clear that there was plenty of disruption inside town hall meetings in 2005, contrary to Krugman's assertions. We find his claim False.",/factchecks/2009/aug/07/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-claims-protests-2005-werent-raucous-h/

Conservative news release says health care bill ""likely"" to cover sex change surgery
","
In trying to build opposition to President Barack Obama's health care proposal, critics have suggested that health care would be

government-controlled

, that people would be

left to die

if their treatment exceeded a certain cost and that it would require counseling telling people ""

how to end their life sooner

."" (We've ruled versions of each of those False or Pants on Fire.) Now comes a new one: that taxpayers may soon be footing the bill for free sex-change operations.


On Aug. 4, a news release to that effect went out under the name of Matt Barber, who is director of cultural affairs with Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group, and the associate dean of Liberty University School of Law, which was founded by the late televangelist Jerry Falwell. It was quickly spread by blogs on the left and the right.


Titled, “ObamaCare Likely to Mandate Free ‘Sex Change’ Surgeries,” the release asserted that “the weight of the evidence indicates that cosmetic ‘gender reassignment’ surgeries for both U.S. citizens and illegal immigrants who suffer from [the American Psychiatric Association-] recognized ‘Gender Identity Disorder’ (GID) may also be provided – free of charge – courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. The current price tag for such a procedure can exceed $50,000.”


To confirm Barber’s authorship and learn more about his reasoning, we tried to reach him through the phone number and e-mail address listed on the release, as well as through a call to a different number at Liberty Counsel. But he did not respond. Because we couldn't confirm his authorship, we're attributing this item to our generic category ""bloggers,"" since they have spread it so widely.


Before we delve into our findings in detail, here's an overview of why we found the claim was False: The news release tries to stitch together a patchwork of unrelated items to back up the sex-change claim, but the health care bills as they appear today simply don't do what the release alleges. There is no mandate for sex-change coverage.
 
The news release offers three pieces of evidence:
 
• An exchange between Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., about the legislation covering treatments that would be ""medically necessary.""
 
• Language in the House version of the health care bill that provides for ""standards, as appropriate, for the collection of accurate data on health and health care"" based on ""sex, sexual orientation [and] gender identity.""
 
• And language in a draft Senate bill that requires the Department of Health and Human Services to “‘develop standards for the measurement of gender’ (i.e., officially recognize subjectively self-determined ""transgender"" or ""transsexual"" gender identities). It further mandates ‘participation in the institutions’ programs of individuals and groups from ... different genders and sexual orientations.”


Let’s take these assertions one by one.



The Hatch-Mikulski exchange



It came during a session held by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to revise a Senate version of the health care bill.


The committee was discussing an amendment by Mikulski that would require health insurance plans to include preventive women's health services. Hatch asked his colleague whether that meant that coverage of abortions would be required. She replied that the measure would not “mandate” abortion coverage but would “provide for any service deemed medically necessary or medically appropriate.” The amendment narrowly passed the committee and was appended to the bill.
 
It's worth noting that Mikulski's amendment may not survive to enactment. And her comments quoted in the news release aren’t, in and of themselves, binding.
 
Still, the news release used Mikulski’s explanation on abortion to assert that sex-change treatments would also be covered under the same doctrine. Before we get to the substance of that claim, let’s look at the significance of Mikulski's phrase ""medically necessary.""


Seth Chandler, the co-director of the Health Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston, said that the phrase does carry weight. “That is kind of a magic word in health insurance, in that virtually every private insurance plan I know of contains an exclusion for procedures that are not medically necessary,” he said. “It’s designed to preclude fraudulent or highly experimental procedures.”


The American Medical Association, the nation’s leading doctors’ group, has already gone on record saying that gender-reassignment surgery can be medically necessary. In 2008, the AMA passed a resolution on gender identity disorder that opposes coverage limitations “when such care is based upon sound scientific evidence and sound medical opinion.”


Even so, insurers have not made such coverage universal today. The Web site of the National Center for Lesbian Rights posts a fact sheet that says that such surgeries have long been banned by Medicare and CHAMPUS, the federally run military health plan. Medicaid does not specifically bar those surgeries, the fact sheet added, but some states have statutes barring them.


As for the private sector, neither America’s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for private insurers, nor the Transgender Law Center could provide us with figures on how common it is for transgender surgeries to be covered by insurance. But AHIP’s vice president of communications, Susan Pisano, said that, anecdotally, “my understanding is that there is less coverage for those procedures and treatments. … Some employers do provide it, but I don’t think most people have coverage for those services.”


Indeed, the AMA resolution noted that “many health insurance plans categorically exclude coverage of mental health, medical, and surgical treatments for GID, even though many of these same treatments, such as psychotherapy, hormone therapy, breast augmentation and removal, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and salpingectomy, are often covered for other medical conditions.”


Still, there is at least a nugget of plausibility in the news release citing Mikulski’s language. It may indeed make it into the final version of health reform, and if so, it could provide justification for expanding (though not necessarily mandating) coverage of procedures that are controversial but deemed medically necessary.



The House and Senate language



But in its other points, relating to language in the House and Senate bills, the news release offers little evidence to back up its claim.


The release's discussion of the House bill's language focuses on one mention of collecting health care data based on “sex, sexual orientation [and] gender identity.” We looked up the passage, and it comes in a section that lays out the job description for a new assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for health information. That official is charged with setting standards for data collection on a number of factors, including such commonplace categories as race, sex, ethnicity, primary language and geographic setting in addition to “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.”


While it’s true that the section mentions gender identity, it merely addresses how health care data on a wide variety of subgroups should be collected. It is not a green light to cover sex-change surgeries.


The evidence is even flimsier in the release's claim about the Senate bill’s language. The first phrase the news release cites – that a Senate draft bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to “develop standards for the measurement of gender” – would, according the release, “officially recognize subjectively self-determined  ‘transgender’ or ‘transsexual’ gender identities.”


We find that's a ridiculous leap of logic. The passage in question is the equivalent of the House bill’s language on data collection, not mandated coverage. The full passage cites the development of statistical standards to measure not just for gender but also for “geographic location, socioeconomic status, primary language and disability measures.”


The second passage cited from the Senate bill addresses mental and behavioral health grants that may be awarded by the federal government to students. Its reference to “participation in the institutions’ programs of individuals and groups from ... different genders and sexual orientations” merely constitutes a requirement that schools receiving support under the grant program adhere to principles of nondiscrimination and diversity in “racial, ethnic, cultural, geographic, religious, linguistic, and class backgrounds” as well as for “different genders and sexual orientations.”


That's simply a requirement that the participating educational institutions not discriminate — not a mandate for covering sex-change surgeries.


The bottom line is that neither bill talks specifically about gender-reassignment surgery. The news release has attempted — poorly, in most cases — to piece together a patchwork case. But the health reform plans as they stand now don't do what the release claims.
 
In theory, the House bill does offer one path by which coverage of sex-change surgeries could be made mandatory.  If that part of the bill survives to enactment, a new panel called the Health Benefits Advisory Council could eventually recommend that sex-change surgeries be covered.
 
The council, chaired by the surgeon general, would be tasked with recommending to the HHS secretary what “treatments, items and services” constitute “essential benefits.” If the HHS secretary agreed with the recommendations, they would initially take effect for public-option plans if such plans were part of the final legislation. After a five-year transitional period, private plans would have to adhere to this basic package of services.


So in theory, it would be in the Health Benefits Advisory Council’s power to decide to include gender-reassignment surgery in the package of essential benefits.
 
But that's a far cry — and many political hurdles away — from ""mandating"" sex-change coverage. Given the public’s squeamishness about the topic, it doesn't seem to us that it's “likely,” as the news release suggested.
 
So let’s recap. The release may have a point that Mikulski’s comment could open the door to ""medically necessary"" coverage which conceivably may include sex-change operations. But it's unclear whether her amendment will remain in the legislation, and there's nothing specific in the legislation on sex-change procedures and nothing else solid that indicates such coverage will be provided. The news release cherry-picked a few fleeting references to “gender” and “sexual orientation” in completely unrelated contexts to argue that proposed health care legislation would mandate free sex-change surgeries (and allow them for illegal aliens, no less). To us, these bits of evidence are wholly unpersuasive. We find the claim False.

Club for Growth's health care ad campaign is misleading
","
Like other groups criticizing health care reform, the conservative Club for Growth is using the August recess to try to stop the congressional effort to create a government-run health insurance option.

 

Part of the Club's strategy will include a $1.2 million ad campaign aimed at Democrats who may be wavering about the plan.
 
In the ad, a man weeps over someone lying in a hospital bed while the announcer says, ""$22,750. In England, government health officials decided that's how much six months of life is worth. Under their socialized system if a medical treatment costs more, you're out of luck. That's wrong for America.""

 

That footage is interspersed with shots of the Capitol building and the whole thing is set to some very ominous music. You can watch it

here.


 

The carefully worded ad doesn't directly say that the government is planning to put a price on our lives, but the implication is clear: The reform plan will lead to callous decisions that would allow people to die if they face a costly treatment. So that's what we're going to check — whether the reform plan would impose those kind of caps on treatment.

 

At its heart, the Club for Growth's ad criticizes a medical approach known as comparative effectiveness research, which aims to find the most effective treatments for the lowest cost.


Such research became a flashpoint during the stimulus debate, when the Conservatives for Patients Rights portrayed the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research, a new board created by the stimulus bill to find the best health treatments, as being modeled after the British system. In fact, the board is very different from the British system, where government entities run the health care system and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence — NICE for short — determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. The stimulus emphasized that the board is not meant to ""mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer"" and that none of the board's reports or recommendations ""shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment, coverage, or treatment."" So we gave the Conservatives for Patients Rights claim a

Barely True

.

 

Once again, some Republicans have started linking the general premise of comparative effectiveness and what NICE does in Britain to describe how a government-run plan in the United States would discriminate against people who are older or very sick. Here's one such comment:

 

""I don't know for sure, but I've heard several senators say that Ted Kennedy with a brain tumor, being 77 years old as opposed to being 37 years old, if he were in England, would not be treated for his disease, because end of life — when you get to be 77, your life is considered less valuable under those systems,"" said Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, in a news conference with reporters.

 

NICE is an element in the Club for Growth ad as well. The ad refers to a December 2008 article in the

New York Times

that followed the case of Bruce Hardy, a British man who was denied a $54,000 drug by British health authorities. The article said the drug could have delayed his cancer progression for six months.

 

Under NICE policies, the government would only pay about 15,000 pounds — or $22,750 — to save six months of Hardy's life. (NICE's limits are well known and have been widely discussed in the medical community.) The agency generally considers treatments cost-effective if they are less than $34,000 a year, according to an article in the

New England Journal of Medicine.

But sometimes the agency will accept treatments that cost far more than that.


So the Club for Growth's claim that NICE has a price limit of $22,750 for six months of life is roughly accurate, said Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that is often in step with the Club for Growth.

 

But ""does the (Obama health care) legislation say it's going to do what Britain is doing? The answer to that is no,"" said Cannon.


Nevertheless, Cannon doesn't believe that the ad is too far off, pointing to a proposal by the White House that would create an independent group of health experts that would look for inefficiencies in Medicare coverage. ""With the government assuming an even larger majority in health spending, it becomes very hard to argue that they won't have to ration... [Club for Growth] is implying that this is where it would lead and that's valid.""

 

But at this point, that proposal is not included in either the House or the Senate bill, so we believe it's quite a stretch for the Club for Growth to suggest it would be part of the health reform plan.

 

Dr. Sean Tunis, a former top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid under the Bush administration and current director of the Center for Medical Technology Policy, says the ad is misleading.

 

""We have a public plan now, and that's Medicare,"" Tunis said. ""And Medicare doesn't put a price on life. ... That seems like a fallacious connection to me.""

 

The only initiative from the Obama administration along those lines is the increase in funding for comparative effectiveness research through the stimulus. That data would be used to help doctors and patients make better drug and procedure decisions, not dictate treatment, he said.

 

So, back to the Club for Growth ad. Although our experts agree that it gets the NICE statistic correct about the British practice, the ad's main point about cost limits is incorrect. There is no such practice in the comparative effectiveness program, nor is it part of the current health reform proposals pending in Congress. The House and Senate bills under consideration would not require the government to decide how much a person's life is worth. As a result, we give the Club for Growth a False.

Public Citizen gets it right about insider trading rules
","
Little-known fact: Members of Congress are exempt from rules that prevent insider trading.

 

Or so says the left-leaning advocacy group Public Citizen in a July 10, 2009, e-mail sent to supporters.

 

""The federal government has finally got the message that it’s time for stronger oversight of Wall Street and the financial services sector.  It’s also time to put an end to secret spending and insider trading,"" the e-mail reads. ""A dangerous legal loophole still exists which allows members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to exploit 'insider' knowledge of the financial industry in order to turn personal profit.""

 

It goes on to describe an army of lobbyists and traders who ""haunt the halls of Congress seeking insider tips from staff — known as 'political intelligence consultants'"" who may also use the confidential information.

 

The e-mail asks supporters to write their representatives to support the Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, a bill sponsored by Reps. Louise Slaughter of New York and Brian Baird of Washington, that would ban insider trading by lawmakers, members of the executive branch and staff, and require that they publicly disclose stock trades of more than $1,000 within 90 days. It would also require the ""political intelligence consultants"" to register as lobbyists in both chambers of Congress.


We hadn't heard the allegation that members of Congress had a leg up for insider trading and wondered if it's true.


Thomas Newkirk, a partner with the law firm Jenner and Block, told us that indeed there's some uncertainty about how insider trading rules impact members of Congress and their staff.
 
For example, in 2001, a financial consultant meeting with the Treasury Department learned that the department planned to kill off the 30-year bond. In turn, the consultant tipped off traders at Goldman Sachs who proceeded to use that information to make the firm lots of money. It was considered insider trading because the consultant knew he was not supposed to release the information, Newkirk said. Federal regulators settled with Goldman Sachs and the consultant for about $10.3 million in September 2003.


But with members of Congress, it's different. Unless lawmakers have some express confidentiality agreement — whether it's in writing or in word — they can do whatever they want with the information they obtain on Capitol Hill, Newkirk said. 
 
Bruce Carton, a former Senior Counsel with the SEC's enforcement division and current editor of

Securities Docket,

agreed there is uncertainty about the rules. ""Insider trading depends on some kind of duty. You can steal information, but unless you have some sort of duty of confidentiality to it, you're not going to be held liable,"" Carton said.
 
Right now, there is no duty of confidentiality for Congress, their staff or executive branch employees, he said.
 
""It may be unethical, and it may be unseemly, but it's not illegal,"" Carton said.
 
So yes, it seems there is a way for members of Congress to engage in insider trading. Whether they are actually doing it is another story. So far, there are no specific examples of lawmakers engaging in ""secret spending and insider trading,"" as the e-mail indicates. But for its factual claim, we give Public Citizen a True.

Obama flubs number of Indiana households getting tax break during speech
","When President Barack Obama gave a speech on the economy in Wakarusa, Ind., on Aug. 5, 2009, one of his statements raised the eyebrows of one alert PolitiFact reader.   Obama, touting an element of his stimulus package, said that a tax cut “began showing up in paychecks of 4.8 million Indiana households about three months ago.”   That struck our reader as odd because the Census Bureau pegs Indiana’s population at 6.3 million, of which one quarter are under 18. What’s the likelihood that the remaining 4.8 million Indiana adults each constitute their own household? Not likely at all. When we asked the Indiana Department of Revenue how many tax returns are filed annually in the state, they said the number is around 3.2 million, and that includes both joint filers and individuals. So clearly Obama was wrong. A White House official confirmed for us that it was a goof, pure and simple. A staffer mistakenly used the number of households in Illinois in Obama's speech, 4.8 million, instead of Indiana, which is 2.4 million.

Donna Brazile says Bush spent $1.3 trillion on tax cuts, trillions each on war and drugs for seniors
","
Republicans have been attacking President Barack Obama for proposing an expensive health care overhaul on top of a costly economic stimulus. But some Democrats have been growing frustrated at the GOP attacks, saying that the same Republican Party agreed to massive spending and deficits when it controlled the presidency and Congress.


Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist and pundit, gave voice to these frustrations on Aug. 2, 2009, on CNN’s

State of the Union.



""The Bush administration doubled the national debt and it did not help the middle class with the basics of their everyday living,"" Brazile said. ""So we're all concerned about the deficit, but this is needed investment to ensure that we give Americans who have lost their jobs a lifeline, whether it's providing food stamps, whether it's giving states (money to continue) Medicaid funding, or giving these American workers the ability to go out there and retrain and retool themselves.""


She continued, “We spent $1.3 trillion on tax cuts for the wealthy that we could not afford. We spent trillions on a war that we could not afford. We spent trillions on Medicare with the expensive program that gives money to the drug companies, and nobody raised a peep about the deficit.”


We won’t pass judgment on the more subjective issue of whether the tax cuts, the war costs or the Medicare drug plan were, as Brazile, claims, unaffordable. But we think it’s worth checking to see whether Brazile did the math right. We'll take her assertions one by one.


On the tax cuts, Brazile was right: President George W. Bush’s 2001 tax package was expected to reduce federal revenues by roughly $1.3 trillion, according to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, the key arbiter for the cost of tax legislation.
 
Brazile also asserted that the Bush tax cuts were for the wealthy. The Joint Committee on Taxation found the changes in the tax rates were roughly the same among different groups, but analyses using other measurements have found a disproportionate benefit to wealthier Americans; even supporters of the tax cuts conceded that the rich, under a system of progressive taxation, already paid a large share of the tax burden, and thus reaped a disproportionate share of the gains when taxes were cut. The Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the centrist-to-liberal Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, looked at all of the Bush-backed tax cuts enacted between 2001 and 2008 and found that the richest one-fifth of the population saw its after-tax income rise by 5.4 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for the bottom one-fifth. Meanwhile, the richest 1 percent saw its after-tax income rise by 7.3 percent.


Brazile’s second claim was that ""a war"" cost trillions of dollars. She wasn't specific about which war, but since most assessments of this question have combined the costs for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — in part because untangling those costs is so difficult — we'll look at them together.


A partial answer to this question comes from a May 15, 2009, report by the Congressional Research Service, “The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11.” That report found that $864 billion had been spent for “military operations, base security, reconstruction, foreign aid, embassy costs and veterans’ health care.” That number can be updated to take into account the slightly more than $77 billion allocated for ongoing war operations in May, when Obama signed a supplemental war spending bill. Finally, one can also include the $130 billion sought by the president for regular fiscal year 2010 for operations in Afghanistan.


In all, these three numbers add to about $1.07 trillion — crossing the 13-digit threshold, but not reaching the multiple ""trillions"" suggested by Brazile.


Some budget analysts believe future costs will ultimately hike the overall pricetag into the trillions. Former Clinton administration economic adviser and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, writing with Harvard University scholar Linda J. Bilmes, published a book last year titled

The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict

. It includes $700 billion for veterans’ costs that exceed peacetime levels, including disability payments and health care coverage; $1 trillion for the interest on funds borrowed to finance the war; and another $1 trillion to cover the loss of life and severe disability caused by the war, including the provision of caregivers for wounded veterans and the removal of productive assets from the economy. Economists we spoke with said it's reasonable to include those costs in the ultimate pricetag. But most of that additional money has not yet been ""spent,"" as Brazile claimed.


Finally, we looked at how much the Medicare drug plan has cost the taxpayers.


According to the 2008 annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees, a total of $549 billion is expected to be spent on the program in fiscal years 2006 through 2015. (Budget wonks take note: We did not include the full amount paid out by the drug plan, but rather took that number and subtracted the costs footed by beneficiary premiums and transfers from the states. Our number includes what was actually paid by the taxpayers through the general treasury.)


Because costs for the program are expected to rise as the years go on, the total amount spent will eventually cross the $1 trillion threshold. But during the standard, 10-year budget window, the amount only gets a little more than halfway to that level. And it will be many, many years before it hits ""trillions,"" as Brazile suggested. So she is incorrect to say that amount has been spent.


So let’s recap. The numbers support her broad point that there was lots of spending when Republicans controlled the White House and Congress. But individually, the accuracy of her assertions is more mixed. Brazile correctly described the cost of the 2001 Bush tax cut, but she overstated the cost of the wars. Although the pricetag may ultimately be trillions, that hasn't been spent yet. And she exaggerated the 10-year cost of the Medicare drug plan. So we rate her claim Half True.

Michelle Malkin says former Clinton official says extending unemployment benefits is counterproductive
","It's a conundrum of compassion: If you provide someone with unemployment benefits, does he lose the incentive to find a job?

On the Aug. 2, 2009, edition of ABC's  This Week with George Stephanopoulos,  conservative blogger Michelle Malkin asserted that even a liberal economist believes that unemployment benefits have a negative impact on joblessness because those benefits discourage people from taking jobs.

""It was Larry Katz, who was the chief labor economist under the Clinton Labor Department, who came out with a study, and there are a lot of these smart economists who say this – that if you keep extending these temporary unemployment benefits, you're just going to extend joblessness even more,"" she said.
 
Stephanopoulous expressed skepticism at the idea that Americans would choose ""to take the unemployment benefits when a job is available.""
 
But Malkin was undeterred. ""Well, it's 79 weeks already,"" she said. ""And then they're going to extend it by another 13 weeks. And what happens is, according to these economists who have seen it, including this Clinton economist, is that people will just delay getting a job until the three weeks before the benefits run out.""
 
Malkin's fellow panelists joined Stephanopoulos in pushing back against Malkin's assertion.
 
""But when businesses advertise the few job openings they have — they'll advertise 20 openings — they have 6,000 applicants,"" said Cynthia Tucker of the  Atlanta Journal-Constitution  . ""So I don't think that's the problem at the moment.""

We decided to see if Malkin was correct. We contacted Katz, now a Harvard professor, and he said Malkin was probably referring to two papers he co-wrote in 1990 with fellow economist Bruce D. Meyer. One, ""The Impact of the Potential Duration of Unemployment Benefits on the Duration of Unemployment,"" was published in the  Journal of Public Economics  in February 1990. The other, ""Unemployment Insurance, Recall Expectations and Unemployment Outcomes,"" was published in The  Quarterly Journal of Economics  , in November 1990.
 
We looked at the papers, and the first seems especially on point. The paper noted that in certain European countries, generous unemployment benefit policies often had a strong correlation with high rates of long-term unemployment. After looking at U.S. unemployment data from 1979 to 1983, the authors concluded that ""the potential duration of [unemployment insurance] benefits has a strong impact on the duration of the unemployment."" In fact, the authors wrote, ""an increase in potential benefit duration from 6 months to 1 year is predicted to increase mean duration of unemployment by 4-5 weeks, and an increase from 6 months to 2 years is predicted to generate a 13-16 week increase in unemployment duration.""
 
To scholars, this was not a shocking result: It confirmed other research, and it has regularly been cited in subsequent studies.
 
So Malkin was correct in summarizing Katz's work. But there is a significant caveat: Katz himself argues that his two-decade-old finding isn't valid in today's recession.

In fact, the day before Malkin went on the air, the  New York Times  ran a front-page story headlined, ""Prolonged Aid to Unemployed Is Running Out"" that happened to quote Katz. The article said:

""Traditionally, many economists have been leery of prolonged unemployment benefits because they can reduce the incentive to seek work. But that should not be a concern now because jobs remain so scarce, said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. For every job that becomes available, about six people are looking, Dr. Katz said. ‘Unemployment insurance gives income to families who are really suffering and can't find work even if they are hustling to look,' he said. With the economy still listing, he added, a temporary extension can provide a quick fiscal stimulus. And, Dr. Katz said, when people exhaust unemployment and health insurance, many end up applying for disability benefits, which become a large, unending drain on the Treasury.""
 
When we asked Katz about the discrepency between his remarks then and now, he explained that labor markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s were significantly different from today. Back then, it was common for companies making layoffs to later recall workers, and often workers accepted those jobs right as their benefits were coming to an end. Today, recalls rarely happen, and with the job market so tight, a job search can prove fruitless for many months. Most unemployed workers don't have the luxury of timing when they accept a job.

For that reason, Katz told us in an interview, ""I strongly favor extensions of UI benefits when the labor market is weak and the ratio of job seekers to job openings is very high"" – in other words, like the situation is right now.
 
As for Malkin's claim that other economists agreed with Katz' 1990 view that extending benefits merely prolongs unemployment, we found that they concurred that his old papers were sound — but they also agreed that the papers' conclusions aren't applicable to today's recession. They said that today's job market is so tight that if someone does turn down a job in order to remain on unemployment benefits, someone else who's unemployed will take that job instead, canceling out any extra time the first person stays on unemployment benefits. We spoke with several economists and found a consensus that the broader stimulative effect on the economy that comes from extending unemployment benefits outweighs any potential lengthening of how long some people choose to stay on unemployment.

So let's review what Malkin said. She correctly characterized Katz's writings from nearly 20 years ago. However, due to the changed nature of the labor market in today's recession, neither Katz nor most economists we talked to believe that his findings have much relevance to the current situation. This undercuts Malkin's assertion that ""there are a lot of these smart economists who say this – that if you keep extending these temporary unemployment benefits, you're just going to extend joblessness even more."" For this reason, we rate her statement Half True.",/factchecks/2009/aug/04/michelle-malkin/michelle-malkin-says-former-clinton-official-says-/

CNN's King doesn't provide full count for Obama Twitter followers
","Flash back to the 2008 campaign and you might recall a technology gap between Barack Obama and John McCain. Obama was portrayed as the youthful candidate of change whose campaign harnessed the Internet in ways no candidate had before. McCain was the senior statesman, a veteran senator and former POW . . .  but not someone who was checking his BlackBerry 24/7. The Obama campaign poked fun at McCain with an ad titled ""1982"" that portrayed him as an out-of-touch old guy. ""Things have changed in the last 26 years. But McCain hasn't,"" the announcer said as the screen flashed images flash of a record player and a Rubik's Cube. ""He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail,"" the announcer said. We rated that claim  Mostly True  because it was based on McCain's comments in an interview with journalist Mike Allen. So imagine our surprise when we heard John King of CNN say in an interview with McCain that the Arizona Republican actually has more Twitter followers than the Obama White House. Here's the exchange: KING: ""I'll close with this one. The John McCain Twitter account has more than 1.1 million followers. The official White House Twitter account has only about 830,000 as of last count. Is it time to replace the Electoral College with the Twitter count?"" MCCAIN: ""It is a phenomenal way of communicating."" We checked the Twitter pages and found King is correct about those counts. McCain's page,  @SenJohnMcCain  (A recent tweet: ""Fighting to remove two more pork barrel projects totaling $24.5 million - we will probably lose, again, because it's business as usual in DC"") had 1,128,161 followers. The White House account,  @whitehouse  , had 860,835 (Recent tweet: ""Don't believe everything you see on the web about health insurance reform . . . ""). But there's a significant caveat to King's statement: Obama has a second Twitter account that was created during the campaign and is now handled by the Democratic National Committee. That one,  @barackobama  , had 1,902,667 followers. So add them together and Obama has nearly triple McCain's followers. One of King's producers correctly noted the caveat in an article on the CNN Web site, but King did not mention it during the interview. So King is correct with his claim that McCain beats the  official White House Twitter account,  but viewers might be misled to think that's the total count for Obama when in fact it's just one of his two accounts.

On Glenn Beck's Fox News program, Guilfoyle claims government's Cash for Clunkers Web site would give government complete access to your home computer
","On Glenn Beck's Fox News program on July 31, 2009, Fox anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle suggested that clicking on the government's Cash for Clunkers Web page (cars.gov) would give the government complete access to your home computer. The accusation came in a back-and-forth exchange among Beck, Guilfoyle and Jonah Goldberg, author of  Liberal Fascism.  After warning viewers not to try this at home, Beck typed in cars.gov., the U.S. Department of Transportation Web site for the program better known as Cash for Clunkers. ""Here is Cars.gov,"" Beck said. ""Let's say you go in. If I understand this right, I go in and I say, 'I want to turn in my clunker.' The dealer goes to Cars.gov, and then they hit 'submit transaction.' Here it says 'privacy act and security statement,' and it's like, oh, it's the Privacy Act of 1974. Whatever. I agree.""

But when you pull it up, he noted, here's how the warning statement read: ""This application provides access to the DOT CARS system. When logged on to the CARS system, your computer is considered a federal computer system and it is property of the United States Government. Any or all uses of this system and all files on this system may be intercepted, monitored, recorded, copied, audited, inspected, and disclosed to authorized CARS, DOT, and law enforcement personnel, as well as authorized officials of other agencies, both domestic and foreign.""

""Good God Almighty!"" Beck said.

Said Guilfoyle: ""Could it be any more broad and frightening? Here you are trying to be a good citizen and make a charitable contribution, do something that's good — and guess what? They are jumping right inside you, seizing all of your personal and private (information) ... And it's absolutely legal, Glenn. They can do it.""

""They can continue to track you basically forever,"" Guilfoyle warned. ""Once they tap into your system, the government, of course, has like malware systems and tracking cookies and they can tap in anytime they want.""

""Can you believe that?"" she asked. ""I mean, seriously, they can get all your information.""

Later, Goldberg said it was ""all very troubling. And, look, let me give you a hard example of this. Say you use Skype or some other Internet phone system, right? If you're on the phone while logged in on this thing, according to this, according to a lawyer I talked to before ... the government can legally listen to your phone call. They can check out what Web sites you've been searching.""

""Because it says ... your computer is a government's property,"" Goldberg said.

""That's correct, if you log on to this at your home, everything in your home is now theirs?"" Beck asked.

""Basically,"" Guilfoyle said, ""and there's nothing you can do."" To dissect this one, we have to begin by noting the small amount of truth in their comments. The statement Beck read was on a government Web site for auto dealers, but Guilfoyle twists that into some incorrect claims about the government getting access to individuals. Here's the true part: The Department of Transportation confirmed the language was on the cars.gov Web site, but on Aug. 3 it was removed. The DOT released this statement to PolitiFact: ""A security warning on the CARS.gov dealer support page that stated computers logged into the system were considered property of the Federal Government has been removed.  We are working to revise the language.  The language was posted on the portion of the website accessible by car dealers and not the general public."" ""It would be factually inaccurate to say that any computer that went to cars.gov would become the property of the U.S. government,"" said Sasha Johnson, a DOT spokeswoman said. Although Beck began his segment by noting that the warning was on a part of the site for dealers, Guilfoyle then distorted the truth by suggesting it applied to members of the general public coming to the site for information about Cash for Clunkers. The allegations escalated as she and Goldberg issued warnings about anyone even typing in that address at home. And that's just wrong. Beck seemed to concede that point when raising the issue again on Aug. 3. ""Now, these blogs have come out this weekend and said, 'Oh, there goes Glenn Beck trying to stir up trouble again. It doesn't affect the average person. It's just the car dealerships.' I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the car dealerships. Oh, so then I shouldn't care? It's not the average people? It's just the average people who are in small business running the car dealerships,"" Beck said. DOT's Johnson said the government has no plans to take over the computer of auto dealers either. And, again, the language was removed on Aug. 3. But the language was there when Beck and Guilfoyle first raised their concerns. And clearly the language was overly broad, and bad enough to give ammunition to conspiracy theorists. That much is implied by the fact the government felt the need to remove the language. So in that sense, we think the DOT bears some blame for the confusion. Had she said from the start that this just applied to dealers completing transactions, we might be more generous in our ruling. But we think anyone who saw the July 31 program — in which she claimed ""seriously, they can get all your information"" — would be left with the clear impression that anyone who logged into the cars.gov site was opening their computer to Big Brother. And that's False.",/factchecks/2009/aug/03/kimberly-guilfoyle/glenn-beck-claims-governments-cash-clunkers-web-si/

Lungren says Obama would have government require a centenarian to get a pill, not a pacemaker
","
Rep. Dan Lungren, a Republican from California, says President Barack Obama's health care plan is so mixed up that the government would tell 100-year-old ladies who need pacemakers to take pain pills instead.
 
During a speech on the House floor on July 28, 2009, Lungren cited comments that Obama made in a TV special to suggest that Obama's plan was callous and bureaucratic.
 
""If we are being told that this week we have to make the decision as to whether or not the program we put forward will have government decide whether a 100-year-old woman who is in extraordinarily good health but needs a pacemaker ought to instead be told by the government that merely she should take a pain pill — as the president suggested on television not too long ago — then maybe we owe it to the American people to give ourselves sufficient time” to study this legislation further.


Lungren was referring to remarks Obama made during the ABC News' June 24 special,

Questions for the President: Prescription for America,

which was anchored by Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson.


We went to the transcript of the event and found that Lungren is distorting Obama's words. While Obama did bring up the example of patients and their families possibly having to choose between a pill and a pacemaker at some point, he did it as a hypothetical example while emphasizing that the government’s role should be to provide background information so that patients and doctors can better sort through thorny, end-of-life issues.


The exchange began when Sawyer introduced Jane Sturm, who takes care of her mother, Hazel, now 105. When Hazel was 100, Sturm said, the doctor told her she needed a pacemaker. Both mother and daughter said they were game, but an arrhythmia specialist initially said no, before seeing Hazel’s “joy of life” in person.


Sturm asked the president, “Outside the medical criteria for prolonging life for somebody elderly, is there any consideration that can be given for a certain spirit, a certain joy of living, quality of life? Or is it just a medical cutoff at a certain age?”


After joking that he’d like to meet Sturm’s mother and “find out what she’s eating,” the president said, “I don't think that we can make judgments based on peoples' spirit. That would be a pretty subjective decision to be making. I think we have to have rules that say that we are going to provide good, quality care for all people.”


After Gibson interjected with a comment about how money may not have been available for a pacemaker, Obama responded, “Well, and — and that's absolutely true. And end-of-life care is one of the most difficult sets of decisions that we're going to have to make. I don't want bureaucracies making those decisions, but understand that those decisions are already being made in one way or another. If they're not being made under Medicare and Medicaid, they're being made by private insurers. We don't always make those decisions explicitly. We often make those decisions by just letting people run out of money or making the deductibles so high or the out-of-pocket expenses so onerous that they just can't afford the care.”


Obama continued, “And all we're suggesting — and we're not going to solve every difficult problem in terms of end-of-life care. A lot of that is going to have to be, we as a culture and as a society starting to make better decisions within our own families and for ourselves. But what we can do is make sure that at least some of the waste that exists in the system that's not making anybody's mom better, that is loading up on additional tests or additional drugs that the evidence shows is not necessarily going to improve care, that at least we can let doctors know and your mom know that, you know what? Maybe this isn't going to help. Maybe you're better off not having the surgery, but taking the painkiller. And those kinds of decisions between doctors and patients, and making sure that our incentives are not preventing those good decisions, and that — that doctors and hospitals all are aligned for patient care, that's something we can achieve.”


Looking at the full transcript, it’s clear that Obama voluntarily brought up the example of having to choose between a surgery and a pill. But he did so as a hypothetical example of difficult decisions about medical treatment for older patients. He was not advocating, much less requiring, bureaucrats to make a potentially life-ending decision for a centenarian.


“I don’t want bureaucracies making those decisions,” Obama said.
 
One can be skeptical about whether Obama’s promises to keep the government out of doctor-patient decisionmaking will hold if health care legislation becomes a reality. But Lungren goes beyond that to distort what the president actually said. We rate Lungren’s claim False.

Carnahan misquotes CBO about cost of health care reform plan
","
During a town hall meeting, U.S. Rep. Russ Carnahan, a Democrat from Missouri, tried to reassure constituents that his party's health care reform bill would cost less than expected.

 

""The Congressional Budget Office most recently came out and analyzed the current plan and said that it was not only deficit-neutral, which has been one of the important factors for the president and congressional leaders, but also that over 10 years it would create a $6 billion surplus,"" Carnahan told an audience on July 20, 2009, at Forest Park Community College in St. Louis.

 

The audience laughed in response. (To see for yourself, fast forward

this video

to the 7-minute mark.)

 

It's a claim that's been repeated by many Democrats since the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does all the number crunching for Congress, released its cost estimate for the health care bill on July 17.


In its report, the CBO estimated the bill will cost about $1.04 trillion over 10 years. That sum would be partially offset by $219.3 billion in Medicare savings and by $583 billion in tax increases over the same amount of time.

 

Still, the bill would create a $239 billion deficit, according to CBO.

 

We were perplexed: How could Carnahan proclaim a $6 billion surplus if the budget office was projecting a deficit?

 

The confusion comes down to an accounting question about how to treat $245 billion in the House bill that would cover the cost of adjusting Medicare reimbursement rates so doctors don't face the potential of a 21 percent cut in fees.


In 1997, Congress agreed that, should Medicare reimbursement rates grow faster than the economy, they would be cut. But instead of following its own rules, Congress has put off those cuts year after year with a Medicare ""fix."" CBO considers that sum as part of the cost of the bill.

 

But many Democrats don't. Two days after Carnahan's town hall meeting, the House approved a bill that would require all new spending be paid for by new taxes or spending cuts to other government programs, a practice widely known as pay-as-you-go. That bill exempts the Medicare pay fix from these rules, which effectively reduces the cost of the health care reform bill by that same $245 billion. The pay-as-you-go bill is pending in the Senate.

 

But in the meantime, CBO will continue to include it as part of the legislation's price tag until the pay-as-you-go rules are put into law.

 

Back to Carnahan's math: If you accept his assumption that pay-as-you-go ultimately passes both houses of Congress and is signed into law, the health care bill will only cost $797 billion over 10 years. The $219.3 in spending cuts and the $583 billion in tax revenue total $802 billion, so that leaves $5.3 billion extra. (That's not quite $6 billion, but it's in the ballpark. We can assume this is the result of rounding.)

 

Whether Republicans or Democrats are in charge, this kind of budget trickery is nothing new to Washington, said Brian Riedl, a budget expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

 

""It's the best way to do business in Washington,"" he said. ""You inflate the baseline [of a bill] to make it seem like you're spending less.""

 

So as for Carnahan's statement, he is definitely misstating CBO's findings. The budget office did not say there would be a $6 billion surplus, it said there would be a $239 billion deficit. Only when Carnahan added some optimistic assumptions did the math work the way he claimed. We find his claim False.

Pascrell says 53 percent of Americans cut back on health care due to costs
","
The debate over reforming the U.S. health care system has inspired a torrent of often conflicting statistics. We will look at three assertions made by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. In this item, we will test his assertion that 53 percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs.


On July 28, 2009, Pascrell took to the House floor to counter assertions by Republicans and others that a Democratic bill under consideration in the chamber would lead to the rationing of health care. Pascrell’s larger point was that rationing already exists today, just a different type — thanks to the financial barriers to coverage faced by millions of Americans.


Specifically, Pascrell said: “Forty-five percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs in this country in 2007. That’s rationing. Fifty-three percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs. That’s rationing. … As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance. My brothers and sisters, that’s rationing.”


We are not going to weigh in on the question of whether it’s fair to equate Pascrell’s examples of “rationing” with what the bill’s critics charge the bill would do if enacted. Rather, we wanted to gauge whether Pascrell’s numbers were sound. So we looked at these three claims individually.


Pascrell’s second claim is based on a tracking poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is a respected, independent source of data on health policy.


Pascrell chose a survey result from February, when the foundation sponsored a poll of 1,204 randomly sampled adults ages 18 and over. All told, 53 percent said that they or a family member in their household had done one of the following things because of cost concerns: relied on home remedies or over-the-counter drugs instead of going to see a doctor (35 percent said yes); skipped dental care or checkups (34 percent); put off or postponed getting health care you needed (27 percent); skipped a recommended medical test or treatment (23 percent); not filled a prescription (21 percent); cut pills in half or skipped doses (15 percent); or had problems getting mental health care (7 percent).


What Pascrell or his staff apparently wasn’t aware of was that the same survey has subsequently been repeated three more times — that’s the purpose of a tracking poll, after all — and that, in fact, the percentage of respondents saying they had done one of those things has jumped around quite a bit. In April, the number rose to 59 percent, before falling to 55 percent in June and 49 percent in July.


Another point to note: Not all of the actions mentioned to survey respondents are equally damaging, which suggests that the 53 percent figure ought to be taken with a grain of salt.


Taking over-the-counter drugs for a temporary condition such as a cold might not be very risky; indeed, for minor illnesses such as colds that doctors aren’t able to treat well anyway, some health care economists would be delighted to see Americans skipping a visit to the doctor. Moreover, the poll data shows that Americans who did scale back their visits seemed to have the right priorities.


Of the 27 percent of respondents in the February poll who answered “yes” to the question about putting off needed health care, the two most common items skipped were “a visit to the doctor for a temporary illness, such as a cold or stomach flu” and “preventive care such as a yearly physical exam,” both at 19 percent. Lower rates were recorded for more urgent situations, including a visit for a chronic condition such as diabetes or asthma (10 percent), minor surgery (6 percent) or major surgery (5 percent).


Cathy Schoen, a senior vice president with the Commonwealth Fund, agreed that the results on chronic conditions are especially important.


“Health plans have started to notice this, as have some employers, and they are lowering cost-shares for essential and effective medications, especially generics,” she said. “Otherwise, plans are seeing an increase in emergency room or hospital visits for complications, which mean higher costs.”


Schoen added, “Fortunately most people are healthy each year: The healthiest 50 percent of the population accounts for only 3 percent of all spending. The sickest 10 percent account for 64 percent of all spending. This is where timely and appropriate medical care can make a difference.”


Finally, the survey wording raises a bit of a red flag. Pascrell said that 53 percent of Americans “cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs,” a number that reflects anyone who cited one of the seven possible actions offered to respondents. But Pascrell’s statement is not far off from one of those seven offerings, a rather broadly worded question that asked respondents whether they had “put off or postponed getting health care you needed.” That question drew a yes from 27 percent of respondents, well below the 53 percent Pascrell chose to cite.


Pascrell accurately conveyed the survey’s topline figure, but he did use old numbers (figures that have varied a bit in subsequent months) and the survey provides other data that make the problem seem less dire than the headline number indicates. We rate his assertion Half True.

Pascrell says 45 percent of Americans went without needed health care due to cost
","
The debate over reforming the U.S. health care system has inspired a torrent of often-conflicting statistics. We will look at three assertions made by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. In this item, we will test his assertion that 45 percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs.


On July 28, 2009, Pascrell took to the House floor to counter assertions by Republicans and others that a Democratic bill under consideration in the chamber would lead to the rationing of health care. Pascrell’s larger point was that rationing already exists today, just a different type — thanks to the financial barriers to coverage faced by millions of Americans.


Specifically, Pascrell said: “Forty-five percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs in this country in 2007. That’s rationing. Fifty-three percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs. That’s rationing. … As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance. My brothers and sisters, that’s rationing.”


We are not going to weigh in on the question of whether it’s fair to equate Pascrell’s examples of “rationing” with what the bill’s critics charge the bill would do if enacted. Rather, we wanted to gauge whether Pascrell’s numbers were sound. So we looked at these three claims individually.


The first claim comes from a biennial survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a widely respected nonprofit that studies health care policy. The survey sampled the views of 3,501 U.S. adults age 19 and older, between June 6 and October 24, 2007.


The 2007 version of Commonwealth’s survey did indeed find that 45 percent of adults aged 19 to 64 had one of four “access problems” related to cost — not filling a prescription; not seeing a specialist when needed; skipping a recommended medical test, treatment or followup; or not visiting a doctor or a clinic when they had a medical problem. That rate is notably higher than the 29 percent who reported similar actions in the 2001 survey.


Surveys, especially where participants need to recall for survey-takers what they did or didn’t do in the past, are always somewhat less reliable than research methodology that checks verifiable facts. “As a survey it’s reasonable, but surveys are inherently imperfect yardsticks for this kind of policy research,” said Ed Haislmaier, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation.


Moreover, the numbers are now two years out of date. (The next Commonwealth survey is scheduled for release later this year.) And it’s obvious, but worth noting, that individually, the rates for each of those four actions was quite a bit lower than 45 percent: 31 percent of respondents didn’t fill a prescription, 31 percent didn’t go to a doctor or clinic for a medical problem, 25 percent skipped a test, treatment or followup, and 20 percent didn’t see a specialist.


Still, we do not believe these problems detract in any serious way from the congressman’s claim, but they are worth noting. These are the most recent numbers available from Commonwealth — and it’s hard to imagine that the rates of access problems would have dropped precipitously since the 2007 poll was taken. Back then, the national unemployment rate was averaging 4.7 percent. Today, it’s almost twice that.


We rate this claim by Pascrell to be Mostly True.

No free health care for illegal immigrants in the health bill
","
It may be the longest chain e-mail we've ever received. A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: ""Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services.""
 
Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our

extended analysis

to find out why.
 
One of its most bizarre claims is the one about free health care for noncitizens, ""illegal or not.""
 
We read the bill and its legislative summary, and could find nothing about free health care for anyone, much less noncitizens.
 
To confirm our examination, we turned to Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform. Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides

point-by-point analyses

of the plans on its Web site.
 
""No one's provided with free health care. That's ridiculous,"" she said.
 
Page 50, which the e-mail references, is part of Section 152, which includes a generic nondiscrimination clause saying that insurers may not discriminate with regard to ""personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services.""
 
The section says nothing about ""non-US citizens"" or immigrants, legal or otherwise. In fact, the legislation specifically states that ""undocumented aliens"" will not be eligible for credits to help them buy health insurance, in Section 246 on page 143.
 
The bottom line here is the e-mail is making things up. The bill does not say anything close to ""All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services."" We rate this chain e-mail statement Pants on Fire!

Health care exchange is government's way of regulating insurers
","
It may be the longest chain e-mail we've ever received. A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: ""Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services.""
 
Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our

extended analysis

to find out why.
 
But one of the claims is actually true: ""All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange.""
 
To explain this one, we will start with an explanation of the overall bill, which was unveiled July 14, 2009. The bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance. People who get health insurance through work satisfy this requirement right off the bat.
 
People who don't get insurance through work or other groups will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees. The reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate  insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer, can't refuse people for pre-existing conditions, and must offer basic levels of service.
 
""This is designed to protect consumers from plans that have outrageous cost-sharing or really limited benefits,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform.
 
Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides

point-by-point analyses

of the plans on its Web site.
 
The exchange is meant to ensure that people are ""actually getting coverage and not a junk policy,"" Tolbert added.
 
We should note that the e-mail says this rule is listed on page 72 of the health care bill. We found that the requirement that insurance companies must conform is also presented much earlier in the bill. We spotted an earlier reference on page 15, Section 101.
 
That doesn't change the fact that the assertion is correct. We've ruled that many of the e-mail's other claims are wrong, but not this one. The e-mail said, ""All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange."" We rule that True.
