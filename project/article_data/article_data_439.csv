Did Jeff Reardon cut school programs and vote to raise school lunch prices?
","
In defending his House District 48 seat in the primary election, Rep. Mike Schaufler, D-Portland, paints challenger Jeff Reardon as a big honking disappointment to schools. (Actually, this accusation cuts both ways.)

A Schaufler campaign mailer features a forlorn-looking girl on one side. On the other, there’s an apple sliced with all the different ways Reardon, a David Douglas High School teacher and former school board member, has failed that girl and other students.

Specifically, Reardon ""cut elementary school music classes... cut art instruction … cut teaching positions … cut basketball and volleyball programs."" He ""even voted to raise school lunch prices."" Truly, he must be a dreadful person opposed to the children. We had to know more.

Reardon served on the David Douglas School Board from October 1987 to 1998, and as chair for the 1993-94 and 1996-97 fiscal school years. Hiram Sachs, a Schaufler consultant, said in an email that all of the claims stemmed from news stories published in The Oregonian and school board minutes, in the years 1988 and 1993.

In February 1988, the David Douglas schools superintendent proposed a $25.4 million budget for the 1988-89 school year, according to a news story in The Oregonian. The proposed budget eliminated eight teaching positions. Board minutes show that Reardon, as a member of seven-member board, approved the budget. (The Oregonian news story also noted that the superintendent said the reduction shouldn’t raise the student-to-teacher ratio.)

Let’s go to the next claim, that Reardon cut extracurriculars, including music, art, basketball and volleyball. Again, as a member of the board, Reardon voted to scale back athletics and extracurricular programs in the 1993-94 school year. (The following year some of those cuts were restored due to an increase in the budget, according to a 1994 news story in The Oregonian.)

And finally, the claim about raising the price of school breakfasts and lunches. True! He did, in May 1993. Children had to pay 10 cents more for each meal.

""If there were cuts, I can tell you they were done with the greatest agony. Any cuts of that nature would have been done as a last resort,"" said Reardon, who had trouble remembering details of the votes.

Sachs, Schaufler’s consultant, said of course Reardon had choices. He could have pushed for administrative or other savings that would not have hurt children. ""This is his voting record; this is the basis of his candidacy,"" Sachs said.

Reardon, as a member of a school board, is absolutely responsible for every decision made by the board. We have no quibble with that, and wouldn’t suggest otherwise. But the mailer states that ""Jeff Reardon’s cuts devastated our schools and shortchanged our kids."" Reardon did not personally or single-handedly deprive children of teachers, art classes or basketball programs.

We also think the mailer is misleading because it cherrypicks two budget votes and one school meal vote out of the more than 10 years Reardon served on the school board. For example, as we noted above, the school district was able ""to hire 11 more teachers, restore cuts made in athletics last year and begin education reforms"" in 1994-95 thanks to a $2.7 million budget increase. Budgets go up and they go down.

If ""Reardon’s cuts"" shortchanged children, then most anyone who’s ever served on a school board probably is guilty of the same crime. As are legislators who approve K-12 budgets that result in program cuts. A decision to approve a budget -- or a bill -- that results in larger classrooms, fewer teachers, or more expensive lunches does not mean that that person supports those results.

Schaufler’s mailer contains a nugget of truth but is woefully misleading. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC965DC0>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/mike-schaufler/did-jeff-reardon-cut-school-programs-and-vote-rais/
"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Jennifer Williamson']","
Do we really spend a third of health care dollars on billing and bureaucracy?
","
State lawmakers are fresh off a legislative session in which they passed sweeping health care reforms. But Jennifer Williamson, a candidate running to represent House District 36, isn’t content with just those changes. In a mailer she’s sent to potential voters, she’s promised to fight for a single-payer system.

What’s more, she knows how she’d fund it.

Here’s what she says: ""Jennifer Williamson will work to implement a single, statewide, publicly funded plan that covers everyone in our state. Jennifer knows this doesn’t have to cost more, because one-third of our healthcare dollars go to wasteful insurance billing and bureaucracy that could be eliminated with a universal, publicly-funded plan.""

There is a lot there -- way more than we can get to in one fact check -- and much of it is hypothetical. There are estimates about how much a single-payer system would cost, for example, but there’s not a clear consensus. So, we’re going to drill down into this idea that nearly a third of our dollars go to bureaucracy and billing.

First, here’s a little health care primer. In the insurance industry, there’s something called a medical loss ratio. You might have heard this term back when the health care reform legislation was making its way through Congress.

Basically, the medical loss ratio describes the percent of every dollar that an insurance company takes in that goes to medical costs. So, for instance, if a company has a 70 percent medical loss ratio, that means that 70 cents of every dollar goes to health care while 30 cents goes to other areas -- administration, advertising and profit, for example. (Under the new federal healthcare law, the ratio must be 80 percent or insurance companies have to rebate the overage.)

With that out of the way, let’s get to what we heard from the Williamson campaign. Spokeswoman Tera Pierce pointed us to several articles on the subject of medical loss ratios.

Perhaps the most central to the mailer’s argument was one out of the New England Journal of Medicine called ""Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada"" by Steffie Woolhandler, Terry Campbell and David Himmelstein. (Campbell comes from the Canadian Institute for Health Information; Woolhandler and Himmelstein from the Cambridge Hospital and Harvard Medical School.)

That study found that ""(a)fter exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United State.""

The campaign encouraged us to speak with Dr. Sam Metz, a physician who is both an advocate for Williamson and for a single payer system.

Metz noted -- and we’ll come back to this in a minute -- that the average medical loss ratio in the United States is about 80 percent. But the reason this study tacks on another 11 percent is that the medical loss ratio ""does not take into account the cost of physicians to collect from insurance companies.""

When you consider that end of the supply chain -- or at least when this study did -- the amount of cash flowing toward administrative costs increases. Now, it’s worth noting that this study advocated for a single payer system after comparing the U.S. to Canada. It’s also worth noting that the study is not without its critics. Health care, after all, is a very hot issue.

With all that in mind, we called Dr. Jeff Luck, a professor of health management and policy at Oregon State University.

Luck was less bully on the Woolhandler-Campbell study. ""Thirty percent is an overstatement, I think,"" Luck said. ""There are some proponents of a single-payer health care system that I think overstate the contribution of administration in insurance.""

What about the added costs to doctor offices and other providers?

""That's probably a fair statement that physicians and hospitals spend money because of the complexity of the U.S. insurance system,"" he said. But, ""I think even adding the insurance costs ... putting the costs at 30 percent is overstatement.""

Now, this is all a game of extrapolation. And we’re not health care experts. For a clearer understanding, we decided to dig up Oregon’s numbers, especially given that Williamson is talking about a statewide plan. This is where things get a little murkier.

See, while Oregon might not have the best school system, and while we might have sky-high unemployment, we do manage to keep our insurance industry lean.

We spoke with Cheryl Martinis, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Insurance Division. The amount of money going to administrative costs varies widely depending on the market. Nationally, large private insurers that provide coverage through employers see about 12 percent of their intake going to non-medical expenses. But if you look at the individual market, those can skyrocket to 30, sometimes 40 percent. Medicare’s overhead, meanwhile, is usually put somewhere around 2 or 3 percent, though some argue that’s a superficially low estimate. Ezra Klein over at the Washington Post has a really nice primer on this for those interested in reading more.

All that said, Oregon’s overall medical loss ratio is around 89 percent, according to the Insurance Division. Put another way, in 2011 about 89 cents of every insurance dollar in Oregon went to medical costs. Only 2 cents went to profits. Now, Oregon is in a unique place because not only is our insurance market highly competitive in the Portland area, where the vast majority of Oregonians live, but two of our biggest insurers -- Providence and Kaiser -- are also providers. That means they can cut through administrative costs easily. They’re also not-for-profit.

So, where does that leave us? Well, Williamson says that about 30 percent of our health care dollars goes to administrative costs and other bureaucracy. There is a peer-reviewed study that backs this up, even if it’s not the final word. She was also careful not to say that 30 percent of our insurance dollars go to administrative costs and bureaucracy -- just that 30 percent of our health care dollars did.

It’s true that one professor we spoke to was skeptical of this study, but it was published in a reputable journal and, moreover, even that professor felt that it was appropriate to tack on the added administrative costs the provider incurs. The campaign also cited other studies that suggest providers incur considerable costs in their administrative dealings with insurance companies.

Oregon’s health care industry is leaner than the national average and if Williamson is talking about a statewide single-payer system -- which is really the only sort she could conceivably impact in the position for which she is running -- that is important context. She wouldn’t be able to wring as much out of administrative costs in Oregon as she could nationally.

As for the final ruling, we’ll give this statement a Mostly True. It’s accurate, but we think that voters might want additional information about statewide performance.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDFB940>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/jennifer-williamson/do-we-really-spend-nearly-third-health-care-dollar/

President Barack Obama's shifting stance on gay marriage
","
ABC broke into its daytime lineup May 9, 2012, to announce a historic shift: the president of the United States declaring his personal support for gay marriage.

""I've been going through an evolution on this issue,"" President Barack Obama told ABC News.

Indeed.

While the president has consistently supported civil rights for gay couples — peppering his comments with specifics such as hospital visitation, transfer of property and Social Security benefits — his discussion of marriage has differed. He’s called same-sex marriage unstrategic, against his religious beliefs, and something that should be in the hands of churches rather than government.

In 2008, he said:  ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.""

On Wednesday, by contrast, he said:  ""I’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.""

PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s just gauging whether they did.

How does the president’s ""evolution"" on marriage rate?

POLITICO and others have tracked Obama’s statements on same-sex marriage since 1996. Here’s our recap.

Full circle

Obama was in favor of same-sex marriage before he was against it — and before he was for it again.

In 1996, as he ran for Illinois state Senate, Chicago’s Outlines gay newspaper asked candidates to fill out a questionnaire. Tracy Baim, the co-founder and publisher of Outlines, dug up a copy of the questionnaire in 2009, cataloging the president-elect’s shift.

He had written on the 1996 questionnaire, ""I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.""

Just two years later, on another Outlines questionnaire, Obama wasn’t so sure. Did he favor legalizing same-sex marriage? ""Undecided."" Would he support a bill to repeal Illinois legislation prohibiting same-sex marriage? ""Undecided."" Would he co-sponsor it? ""Undecided.""

Later years offered greater clarity — and a shift from 1996. Civil unions? Yes. Gay marriage? No.

As Obama sought a U.S. Senate seat in 2004, he told the Windy City Times, ""I am a fierce supporter of domestic-partnership and civil-union laws. I am not a supporter of gay marriage as it has been thrown about, primarily just as a strategic issue. I think that marriage, in the minds of a lot of voters, has a religious connotation. ...""

He described his hesitation to endorse same-sex marriage as strategic and political.

""What I'm saying is that strategically, I think we can get civil unions passed. … I think that to the extent that we can get the rights, I'm less concerned about the name. … Republicans are going to use a particular language that has all sorts of connotations in the broader culture as a wedge issue, to prevent us moving forward, in securing those rights, then I don't want to play their game.""

When he wrote his 2006 memoir, The Audacity of Hope, he offered a religious explanation for his definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. But he left the door open for yet another shift.

""I believe that American society can choose to carve out a special place for the union of a man and a woman as the unit of child rearing most common to every culture. …"" he said. ""(But) it is my obligation not only as an elected official in a pluralistic society, but also as a Christian, to remain open to the possibility that my unwillingness to support gay marriage is misguided, just as I cannot claim infallibility in my support of abortion rights. I must admit that I may have been infected with society's prejudices and predilections and attributed them to God; that Jesus' call to love one another might demand a different conclusion; and that in years hence I may be seen as someone who was on the wrong side of history.""

He said his doubts didn't make him a bad Christian — but human, limited in his understanding of God’s purpose and therefore ""prone to sin.""

""When I read the Bible, I do so with the belief that it is not a static text but the Living Word and that I must continually be open to new revelations — whether they come from a lesbian friend or a doctor opposed to abortion.""

Still, in a 2007 Democratic primary debate sponsored by a gay rights group and a gay-oriented cable TV channel, he spoke instead about his support for civil unions with ""all the benefits that are available for a legally sanctioned marriage"" — but not for legal recognition of ""marriage"" between same-sex couples. It should be up to religious denominations to determine whether they wanted to recognize that as marriage or not, he said.

In August 2008, he told Southern California megachurch Pastor Rick Warren his definition of marriage: ""I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union. God's in the mix.""

He later added: ""I am not somebody who promotes same-sex marriage, but I do believe in civil unions.""

In November 2008, he said much the same thing to a rather different audience: MTV.

""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.""

By October 2010, almost two years into his presidency, he acknowledged his views were evolving. But he wasn’t prepared to reverse himself, he said.

He told a group of liberal bloggers, ""I have been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily because of my understandings of the traditional definitions of marriage. But I also think you’re right that attitudes evolve, including mine.""

He offered an explanation that would presage his 2012 shift: ""I think that it is an issue that I wrestle with and think about because I have a whole host of friends who are in gay partnerships. I have staff members who are in committed, monogamous relationships, who are raising children, who are wonderful parents.  And I care about them deeply. And so while I’m not prepared to reverse myself here, sitting in the Roosevelt Room at 3:30 in the afternoon, I think it’s fair to say that it’s something that I think a lot about. That’s probably the best you’ll do out of me today.""

A year and a half later, he announced the result of that wrestling and thinking.

Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts asked him on Wednesday, ""Mr. President, are you still opposed to same-sex marriage?""

He answered:
  
Well, you know, I have to tell you, as I've said, I've been going through an evolution on this issue. I've always been adamant that — gay and lesbian — Americans should be treated fairly and equally. And that's why in addition to everything we've done in this administration, rolling back Don't Ask, Don't Tell — so that, you know, outstanding Americans can serve our country. Whether it's no longer defending the Defense Against Marriage Act, which tried to federalize what has historically been state law. 
I've stood on the side of broader equality for the LGBT community. And I had hesitated on gay marriage — in part, because I thought civil unions would be sufficient. That that was something that would give people hospital visitation rights and other elements that we take for granted. And I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, you know, the word marriage was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs, and so forth. 
But I have to tell you that over the course of several years, as I talk to friends and family and neighbors. When I think about members of my own staff who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together. When I think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet, feel constrained, even now that Don't Ask, Don't Tell is gone, because they're not able to commit themselves in a marriage. 
At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married. 

Our ruling

Obama, a consistent supporter of civil rights for gay couples, nevertheless said as early as 2004 and through 2008 that he didn’t support same-sex marriage. He had written that he believed ""that American society can choose to carve out a special place for the union of a man and a woman."" In 2010, he said he wasn’t prepared to reverse himself. This week, the president said he thinks same-sex couples should be able to get married. On the Flip-O-Meter, he earns a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD7B700>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/barack-obama/president-barack-obamas-shift-gay-marriage/
"['Message Machine 2012', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio said Democrats want to raises taxes on small businesses to pay for student loans
","
Everyone seems to agree they don’t want student loan interest rates going up this summer. President Barack Obama, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress -- all say the government should take action to keep the rates where they are.

Yet for all that agreement, it’s still become a political fight.

That because keeping interest rates low for student loans means increasing the deficit. Both parties in Congress say they want to find a way to offset that.

As you might have guessed, Republicans want to cut spending, while Democrats favor raising taxes on the wealthy.

Republicans in the Senate voted down a bill on the matter from the Democrats on May 8, 2012. To explain his vote, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., released a statement that day:

""As someone with a student loan and with a state with so many people with student loans, I support a hundred percent making sure that the interest rates on student loans do not go up,"" Rubio said.

""I cannot support the way the Democrats want to do it, however, because, they want to do it by raising taxes on small businesses, very small businesses. The kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates who not only need low interest rates but need jobs in order to pay their student loans.""

We decided to check out Rubio's claim that Democrats want to raise taxes on ""small businesses, very small businesses … the kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates.""

To fact-check Rubio's statement, we read the text of the legislation the Democrats were proposing, examined a summary of the bill provided by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, and ran the proposal by the experts at the Tax Policy Center, a respected independent think tank that focuses on taxes.

The Democratic proposal seeks to raise more tax revenues by changing rules on some S-corporations. This is pretty arcane tax law, but what we found was very different from Rubio’s description.

What’s an S-corporation? Under Internal Revenue Service rules, S-corporations are companies with a limited number of shareholders. Profits can be paid out to owners or retained by the corporation; both are taxed as regular income. S-corporations are not always small businesses, but they often are.

Democrats say their bill would crack down on a loophole that some professionals are using to avoid payroll taxes by paying themselves through S-corporations.

Here’s the scenario: S-corporations are sometimes owned by the same people who do most of the work -- think of small law firms, accounting firms and the like. As employees, their earnings are subject to payroll taxes, which go to pay for Social Security and Medicare. But as owners, their profits are not subject to payroll taxes. So employee-owners decide to avoid the payroll taxes by giving themselves low pay and high dividends.

""It is only when the owner and the employee are the same person, so that the wages come from the same person’s profit, that there is a problem,"" said Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center. ""Typically this will happen only if there are a very small number of owners who also do the work.""

The Democratic bill said that all income of partners of those types of S-corporations would now be subject to payroll taxes. And the bill includes several steps to make sure that only those types of people would be targeted.

For one, the bill applies only on S-corporations where the owners are doing the work, and only on professional services firms in the fields of ""health, law, lobbying, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, investment advice or management, or brokerage services.""

The bill also stipulates that the new taxes wouldn’t apply to individuals making less than $200,000 or couples making less than $250,000.

In defending the bill, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said it was aimed at people who are avoiding taxes.

""We want to pay for this with legislation that closes a long, long overdue tax loophole of people who are gaming the system,"" he said. ""These are people who are usually accountants and lawyers who try to pay themselves through dividends and not ordinary income. It's wrong, it's not a tax increase, they're just being called upon to pay what they should pay.""

We asked Rubio's office for evidence that the Democratic proposal hits ""small businesses, very small businesses … the kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates.""  His staff referred us to a U.S. Treasury Report analysis that found that some individuals report small business income in excess of $200,000. The Treasury report found that approximately 8 to 11 percent of all small businesses report income at that level or above.

That report, though, counted small businesses as individuals who reported income from a sole proprietorship, partnership, farming operation, miscellaneous rental activity or S-corporation. The Democratic bill called for higher taxes only on a subset of S-corporations. 
Our ruling

Rubio said he opposed the Democratic bill on student loan interest because it would raise taxes on ""small businesses, very small businesses … the kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates."" 
Actually, the bill changed tax rules only for S-corporations, and only on professionals like lawyers and accountants who could be taking advantage of the tax code to avoid paying payroll taxes. The Democrats took the additional step of saying the rule change would only apply to individuals who reported more than $200,000 in income. 
The bill's intent was to close a loophole on people who were avoiding payroll taxes, taxes that they're supposed to be paying anyway. 

Rubio's statement gives the impression that all kinds of mom-and-pop operations might be subject to new, additional taxes, when actually the bill is aimed squarely at high-income professionals who are taking advantage of a loophole.

We rate Rubio’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD2AE00>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-democrats-want-raises-taxes-small/
"['New Hampshire', 'Taxes', 'Charles Bass']","

Charlie Bass says expiration of Bush tax cuts would be highest tax increase in history
","
U.S. Rep. Charles Bass sees a perfect financial storm looming.

Meeting last month with The Telegraph editorial board, Bass, a New Hampshire Republican, ran through the list of upcoming votes that could divide Congress and American taxpayers over the coming months.

""We now have a sequester of about $1 trillion hanging over our heads at the end of the year,"" Bass said in the April 3 meeting, referring to mandatory cuts that will take effect if Congress doesn't act.

He added, ""We have the payroll tax issue to address. We have the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts, all of them, which, if un-extended, would be the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, about $4.6 trillion over 10 years.""

There is certainly no shortage of major votes facing Congress as the fall election approaches. But, are Americans really facing the biggest tax hike in history? We decided to crunch the numbers.

Bass is hardly the first politician to make the claim. When the Bush tax cuts were last up for renewal in 2010, it became a rallying cry of sorts for Congressional Republicans and news entities alike.

Former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin made a similar claim that year when she appeared on Fox News Sunday. PolitiFact ruled the claim ""Pants On Fire"" at the time because she was wrong about the ranking and also incorrectly described the Democrats' plans.
And the numbers haven’t changed much since.

Estimates vary as to how much taxes would rise if the Bush-era tax cuts were allowed to expire fully. Congress approved the tax breaks in 2001 through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, and adjusted them in 2003 through the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.

The tax cuts were set to expire in 2010, because they passed Congress through a procedure known as reconciliation, which only requires 50 votes in the Senate. But, after a heated debate, lawmakers voted in 2010 to extend them for two more years.

Some tax analysts have argued that, because the tax cuts were intended to be temporary, their expiration does not count as a tax increase. But, we’ll leave that argument for another day.
Most estimates for the increase caused by repealing the tax cuts hover around $3.7 trillion over 10 years, the number represented in the Congressional Budget Office’s Budget and Economic outlook from January. (The number is listed under the category of ""extend certain income tax and estate and gift tax,"" though analysts assure us that it refers to the Bush tax cuts).

In his statement, however, Bass included not just the $3.7 trillion estimate, but an additional $900 billion from the Alternative Minimum Tax, another level of income tax set to expire at the end of this year.

""The expiration of just those two measures results in income tax brackets rising at all levels,"" Bass spokesman Stephanie DuBois wrote in an e-mail to The Telegraph.

In hard dollars, the total $4.6 trillion figure would rank among the highest tax increase in history, analysts say. But, through the lens of the Gross Domestic Product -- the only true way to assess tax increases in an apples to apples way, according to analysts -- the Bush tax cuts don’t measure up.

Spread out over the next 10 years, the $4.6 trillion tax increase would amount to about 2.25 percent of the total GDP. We calculated that figure, with help from several tax analysts, by adding together the Budget Office’s projected GDP figures over the next 10 years, 2013-2022, and dividing it by the $4.6 trillion figure.

The result is higher than most tax increases in recent history, according to a U.S. treasury department report, released in 2006, which analyzes all tax provisions since 1940.

According to the report, the Bush tax cuts have held a higher percentage of the GDP than many of the biggest tax laws in recent history. It beats out the the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which measured in at 1.23 percent of GDP by the time all its provisions went into effect in 1986. It also measures larger than the Revenue Act of 1941, which at $3.6 billion, amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP.

Yet, according to the treasury department analysis, the Bush tax cuts fall well below the Revenue Act of 1942, which is estimated at 5.04 percent of GDP. This would make the Bush tax cuts, should they expire, the second largest tax increase in history, as a percentage of GDP.

""There is no doubt, if all the (Bush) tax cuts were allowed to expire, this would have a very big impact,"" said Howard Gleckman, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, an independent tax analysis group, and author of the blog TaxVox.org..

""But, if you’re asking the question, would it be the largest tax increase ever?, the answer is no,"" Gleckman said. ""World War II required this massive tax increases, and nothing we’ve done since have come close.""

Further, as Gleckman notes, few in Washington, D.C. expect the Bush tax cuts to expire in full. Rather, the debate centers largely on whether to extend the tax breaks for the nation’s highest earners, those taking in $200,000 or more a year.

If those cuts were allowed to expire, it would mean a tax increase of about 0.4 percent of GDP, far less than Bass’ claim.

Our ruling:

The trillions of dollars at stake this year with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts place them among the nation’s most costly. But, a historical review of other tax legislation show the cuts, if allowed to expire, would still amount to less than half the percentage of the Gross Domestic Product that World War II spending bills took on.

"['City Budget', 'City Government', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Brigid Shea']","
Brigid Shea says Lee Leffingwell raised Austin's taxes 20 percent
","
Brigid Shea, running for mayor of Austin against incumbent Lee Leffingwell and activist Clay Dafoe, sent a mailer we spotted May 7, 2012, including a double-digit claim about hizzoner and taxes.

""Lee raised property taxes 20 percent in three years,"" the mailer says.

All that much, and by his lonesome?

Fortuitously, we had in hand a chart provided by the Travis Central Appraisal District showing the tax rate set by the Austin City Council each year from 1990-91 through 2011-12.

Before Leffingwell was elected mayor, the council set a rate of 40.12 cents per $100 of appraised value for 2008-09, meaning the fiscal year through September 2009. Last year, the Leffingwell-led council set a rate of 48.11 cents for 2011-12. Put another way, the liability on a property valued at $100,000 before Leffingwell became mayor was $401.20. The liability in 2011-12 was $481.10.

On its face, that’s a 20 percent increase over three years -- as referenced on the flip side of Shea's mailer, which says: ""Lee voted to raise your property tax rate 20 percent in three years.""

But no mayor can set a tax rate on his or her own, which Shea knows because she’s a former council member. Each year, the seven-member council votes on the rate as it completes the city’s budget. In Austin’s form of government, the mayor has one vote, like fellow council members. Asked by email about Shea’s claim, the mayor’s campaign consultant, Mark Littlefield, said: ""Lee did not raise these taxes — the Austin City Council raised these taxes.""

Another wrinkle: Leffingwell, a retired airline pilot, was on the council before he ran for mayor and had a vote on city tax rates set for every budget starting in 2005-06. Through his council tenure, the tax rate has dipped and gone up, according to the appraisal district’s breakdown. In Leffingwell’s first year on the council, members kept the previous year’s rate of 44.30 cents per $100 in appraised value. Members cut the rate each of the next three years before raising it each of the next three years.

Ed Van Eenoo, the city’s budget officer, told us the council voted 7-0 for the three tax-rate changes — all increases — with Leffingwell as mayor.

However, tax-rate changes alone don’t reveal the pocketbook impact of city property taxes.

Notably, for instance, Leffingwell said recently that Austin has the lowest tax rate by far of the five biggest Texas cities. That’s so, but we rated his claim Half True after pointing out that any touting of tax rates is incomplete if it fails to fold in how much property-owners actually pay out.

That’s because property valuations and tax exemptions also influence what property owners pay. To gauge the property taxes owed the city, for instance, take your house’s dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate — with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than ""48.11 cents.""

Van Eenoo put it this way in an email reply to our inquiries about changes in the rates on the mayor’s watch: ""Simply looking at tax rates does not provide a complete analysis as tax rates are heavily influenced by home values. When property values go up, the revenue needed to maintain operations can generally be achieved at a lower tax rate. Vice versa when values go down as they did in 2010 and 2011.""

One way to evaluate property tax rates without ignoring the role of home values, Van Eenoo said, is to compare the tax rate adopted by the council with what’s known as the ""rollback rate."" That’s the maximum rate the city is allowed to set under state law without triggering a voter referendum. The rollback rate, Van Eenoo told us, is calculated as the rate that would bring in 8 percent more in revenue for operations and maintenance than in the previous year, plus enough money to pay the coming year’s debt service.

In keeping with the time period behind Shea’s claim, let’s focus on Leffingwell’s mayoral years.

In his first year leading the council, the tax rate set by the council was the rollback rate, as it had been for the previous three years. In the latter two years of Leffingwell’s mayorship, the adopted tax rates were lower than the rollback rate, Van Eenoo said. In those years, then, the council didn’t raise taxes as much as it could have.

Yet another measure that takes into account changes in property values is the ""effective tax rate."" That’s the rate that the city would have to set to bring in roughly the same amount of revenue it received the year before on properties taxed in both years. In each year of Leffingwell’s mayoral term, according to city data, the council’s adopted tax rate exceeded the effective rate; on average, the rate was nearly 4 percent higher.

Looking beyond rates, we wondered how much typical homeowners’ city property tax bills had changed in the years Leffingwell has been mayor -- though we should note, of course, that the city is only one of the entities taxing Austin properties. Others include school districts, county government and community colleges.

To support her statement that Leffingwell ""raised property taxes 20 percent in three years,"" Shea sent us data that she said showed tax bills for Austin homeowners had increased more than that amount since Leffingwell became mayor.

Shea’s analysis, which does not take into account exemptions, calculates annual tax bills using two different measures for home values: the median and average prices of homes sold in February of each year. Shea obtained the sales price information from the Texas A&M University Real Estate Center, which gathers data from real estate professionals across the state.

Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a ""middle"" value — median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half the city's homes sold for more and half sold for less.

For this reason, we put aside Shea’s data on average sale price and stuck with her figures for the median. Those show that the city tax bill for a home valued at the February median sales price increased about 23 percent from 2008-09 ($753) to 2011-12 ($924).

Still, Shea’s data relies on the prices of homes sold in a single month each year. That’s a small pool. We wondered whether there was a better representation of a typical Austin homeowner’s property value.

We found one in data from the city: annual ""median taxable value."" Samantha Park, a city spokeswoman, told us that the ""taxable value"" of a home is the amount on which the city can actually tax. It’s based on the appraised value, determined by the county’s assessment, minus exemptions. The ""median taxable value,"" then, is the value at which half the city's homes were valued at more and half were valued at less.

Next, we used the city’s data to calculate how much the city taxes on a home with the median taxable value had changed during Leffingwell’s mayoral term. Our calculations found an increase of about 25 percent from 2008-09 ($700) to 2011-12 ($877). That’s greater than the 20 percent Shea cited on her mailer.

Another factor to consider: inflation.

Adjusting Shea’s tax bill figures for inflation reduces the size of the increase during Leffingwell’s mayorship to about 18 percent. Doing the same to the figures in our analysis of city data reduces the property tax increase to about 20 percent.

We ran our work by the city. Park told us that our calculations of the city-provided data were fine, but that she had a quibble with our use of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index to account for inflation in property tax increases.

The CPI, Park said, ""takes into account the change in price for goods and services purchased by households, not government services that are provided,"" which is what taxpayers are funding through their property tax bills. And she suggested that rising prices may be hitting governments harder than consumers. To illustrate her point, she noted that the price of a gallon of milk rises more slowly than the price of health care services for city employees.

Also, she said, our analysis does not consider the cost of ""improvements in service delivery."" As an example, she pointed to the City Council’s decision to turn the the city’s animal shelter into a ""no-kill facility."" We take this as saying the city chose to do more things — and those had costs.

In response to the city’s concern about the CPI, we used a different index — one from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis that gauges inflation for state and local governments — to adjust the tax bill figures in Shea’s and our data. That reduces the increases by only half a percentage point compared to our calculations using the CPI.

Our ruling

Mindful that tax rates alone paint an incomplete picture of the impact of property taxes, which are also driven by changes in property values, we found that what a typical Austin homeowner — one with the median-value home — paid in taxes went up 25 percent in the three years that Leffingwell’s served as Austin mayor. Adjusted for inflation, that figure drops somewhat, but is still about 20 percent.

So, taxes went up 20 percent, or more, with Leffingwell as mayor.

However, no Austin mayor can raise taxes solo commando. Leffingwell had one of the seven votes that were cast each year in setting the city’s rates. This significant perspective is absent from Shea’s statement, making her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB866F00>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/brigid-shea/brigid-shea-says-lee-leffingwell-raised-austins-ta/

In Wisconsin recall, Gov. Scott Walker says opponent Tom Barrett campaigning to raise taxes
","
Reducing property taxes is one accomplishment Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker touts in his bid to remain in office.

In April 2012, the Republican governor announced that during his first year in office, the property tax bill for the typical Wisconsin homeowner had gone down -- the first such decrease in 12 years.

Meanwhile, as we found in rating a claim by the Republican Governors Association,  the Milwaukee property tax levy increased in seven of eight years under Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker’s opponent in the June 2012 recall election.  

So it was no surprise that Walker would seek an opportunity to hit Barrett on the issue.

On May 7, 2012, a day before Barrett won the Democratic recall nomination, Walker released a TV ad claiming -- among other things -- that taxes would go up if Barrett is elected governor.

At one point in the ad, the narrator says ""Barrett wants to undo (Walker’s) reforms and raise your taxes to pay for it.""

As those words are spoken, a more specific message appears on the screen:

""Barrett campaigns on lifting property tax ceilings.""

Walker himself repeated the more specific claim the next day on Milwaukee talk radio, telling host Jay Weber of WISN-AM (1130) that both Barrett and Kathleen Falk, who finished second in the primary, ""said they’d lift the caps on property taxes.""

But hardly anybody likes taxes, right? Is Barrett really ""campaigning on"" raising them?

Let’s start with some background.

Walker and the Republican-led Legislature adopted strict property tax caps as part of the 2011-2013 state budget. For counties and municipalities, growth in the levy is limited to the value of new construction. Walker and lawmakers also cut school aid and reduced the overall amount of revenue that schools could raise in state aid and property taxes -- known as the revenue limit -- by 5.5 percent.

The result?

According to the state Department of Revenue, the total property tax levy in the state rose by just $21 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2011. And property taxes on the median home valued at $157,600 fell about $11, or 0.4 percent, to $2,951 -- the first such drop since 1999.

But Walker’s ad focuses on Barrett’s position.

Walker’s evidence

In accusing Barrett of campaigning to lift the caps, the ad cites a news article on the website of WTAQ, an AM and FM radio station in Green Bay. The article was posted April 17, 2012, the day after Walker announced the property tax reduction.

The headline on the article -- ""Barrett, Falk campaign on lifting property tax ceilings"" -- was almost word for word the message that appeared on the screen in Walker’s ad.

But the article itself made an important distinction between Barrett and Falk.

Both criticized the property tax limits, but while Falk said she would repeal the limits, Barrett ""stopped short of making that promise,"" the article said.

When we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews to back Walker’s claim, she argued that even if Barrett didn’t promise to remove the caps, he nevertheless had campaigned to do so.

Matthews pointed us to another part of the article, which quoted Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak as saying the caps are ""absolute and draconian.""

Matthews also noted that a longer version of Walzak’s comment appeared in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article the same day the radio station website article was posted.

The newspaper, noting that Walzak’s comment was made in a prepared statement, quoted Walzak as saying:  

""Of course controlling tax increases will be a priority. But Walker's caps are absolute and draconian. They don't account for inflation adjustments, or allow adjustments for real economic growth.""

That statement shows Barrett is against keeping the current property tax caps in place -- but doesn’t indicate whether Barrett would merely modify the limits or lift them altogether.

Matthews didn’t provide any other evidence, and we couldn’t find any other statements Barrett has made in the campaign about property tax caps.

Barrett’s response

Walzak told us Barrett has not campaigned on lifting the caps, and that the statement he issued criticizing them was in response to a Journal Sentinel reporter’s question.

That’s a relevant point, given that Barrett has campaigned repeatedly on a number of issues -- including restoring collective bargaining rights for public employees and ""ending the civil war"" that he says Walker started. But he hasn’t emphasized property tax caps.

Walzak also argued that Walker’s ad wrongly implies Barrett would lift the caps in a way that would lead to widespread property tax increases, leaving no controls. But what Barrett advocates, according to Walzak, is working with local governments to give them flexibility to raise property taxes when more revenue is needed to spur economic growth.

Here’s the full statement Walzak issued on the subject:

""Unlike the top-down imposition of policy that dictates policy instead of develops it in partnership with local leaders, Tom as governor will work with local governments and officials to determine what they need to make local investments to attract retain and create jobs on the local level.  Of course controlling tax increases will be a priority.  But Walker's caps are absolute and draconian.  They don't account for inflation adjustments, or allow adjustments for real economic growth.  These inflexible, rigid caps can actually stifle opportunities for local growth, because they can have a negative impact in investing in business parks and transportation infrastructure that are so often key to making investments that encourage business expansion or make local areas more attractive to businesses considering relocation from other states.""

The complete statement makes it clear that Barrett wants to change the current property tax caps.  

But the fact that no other Barrett statements on the caps could be found indicates he has not been campaigning on the issue. And he has not articulated to what degree he would change the caps.

Our rating

In a TV ad, Walker claimed that Barrett is campaigning ""on lifting property tax ceilings."" It was part of a more sweeping claim that taxes overall would go up with Barrett as governor.

Barrett issued a statement during the campaign making it clear he wants to change the caps, so in that sense he would ""lift"" them. But he has not campaigned on the issue, nor spelled out how much he would modify the current limits.

Walker’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Frank Lautenberg']","
Frank Lautenberg claims the national health care reform “put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before”
","
Many provisions of the national health care reform law have yet to take effect, but U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg recently made it sound like the landmark legislation already has brought coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans.

The Democratic senator visited the Rutgers-Camden campus last week to discuss an effort to prevent student loan interest rates from increasing. But in response to a question about health care coverage, Lautenberg touted the benefits of the reform signed into law in March 2010.

""Just remember this: the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before,"" Lautenberg told the crowd on May 3.

The number cited by Lautenberg is solid, but the timing is off, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

The health care reform is estimated to provide insurance coverage to about 30 million additional people, but not until after many of the law’s provisions are implemented in the years ahead.

At the earliest, the number of newly insured Americans would reach 30 million in 2016, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

In a statement, Lautenberg spokesman Caley Gray responded to our findings:

""The President's health care reform bill is working for millions of people. It's going to put at least 30 million people on the rolls and millions in New Jersey have already benefited from new access, lower costs and better service.""

Now, let’s explain some of the major features of the health care reform.

Signed into law by President Barack Obama, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes various measures to boost health insurance coverage. Some of the most notable provisions are the individual mandate; the expansion of Medicaid; and the creation of insurance exchanges.

The individual mandate is the requirement that residents have health insurance, with certain exemptions. Medicaid eligibility will be expanded to individuals under 65 years of age with income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase private health insurance through the new exchanges.

Each of those provisions takes effect on Jan. 1, 2014.

Given the impact of those provisions, the health care reform is projected to increase the number of nonelderly individuals with health insurance by 30 million as of 2016, according to estimates released in March by the Congressional Budget Office. That number would increase to 33 million in 2021, the budget office said.

However, the forthcoming decision of the U.S. Supreme Court could throw off those projections. The nation’s highest court heard arguments in March about, among other issues, the constitutionality of the individual mandate.

If the individual mandate is eliminated, the budget office has stated about 16 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2021.

Our ruling

During his May 3 appearance on the Rutgers-Camden campus, Lautenberg made this claim about the health care reform law: ""Just remember this: the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before.""

Based on the latest projections, the health care reform may lead to insurance coverage for about 30 million additional Americans -- but contrary to what Lautenberg suggested, that has not happened yet. The increase in newly insured people is estimated to reach 30 million in 2016.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['Tennessee', 'Negative Campaigning', 'Charlotte Bergmann']","
GOP 2010 nominee for Congress says George Flinn is confirming attendance at events then not showing up
","
When is a no-show not a no-show? That’s at issue in an ongoing contretemps between the Charlotte Bergmann and George Flinn campaigns for the Republican nomination for the 9th Congressional District.

Bergmann, the 2010 GOP nominee who got 25 percent of the vote in her loss to incumbent Democrat Steve Cohen, contends Flinn was a ""no show"" at recent scheduled ""forums."" In a press release in early April, Bergmann said that Flinn ""has been invited to forums where he can make his case for his bid for office, he confirms his attendance, then does not show.""

In the paragraph following that assertion, Bergmann asks where Flinn was in the previous 30 days when she attended meetings of the Republican Women of Purpose, the Shelby County Republican Women, the Collierville Republican Club, and the East Shelby Republican Club. The clear implication is that those were forums where Flinn confirmed and was a no-show.

We decided to determine whether Flinn, a former Shelby County commissioner who spent $3.5 million in finishing third for the 8th Congressional District nomination in 2010, did in fact duck those events and others Bergmann’s campaign subsequently said he missed with the Midtown Republicans on March 27 and two events it called ""forums"" -- on April 12 at The Cupboard restaurant and on April 27 at Tom Lee Park.

Is it true that Flinn, a wealthy Memphis radiologist and radio station magnate, confirmed his attendance then did ""not show"" up to various events for Shelby County Republicans?

We asked Bergmann’s campaign for the specifics of the events at issue and campaign manager Randy Lawson provided details. Then we checked in with the presumably jilted hosts of the events and with Flinn’s campaign.

Republican Women of Purpose spokeswoman Mary Jane Anderson of  Germantown emailed us: ""After checking the records, I will tell you that this did not happen."" She said Flinn spoke to the group when he was running for the 8th Congressional District seat in 2010 but ""other than that, Dr. Flinn has not been invited to speak at our meetings.""

Shelby County Republican Women’s Club president Debbie Stamson said she couldn’t recall whether Flinn attended the club’s luncheon in March but was on hand at both its April 10 and May 8 luncheons. In April, she said, ""we didn’t really have a speaker because we had a fashion show."" As for whether he confirmed his attendance in advance by making a reservation, Stamson said she couldn’t say. But he wasn’t a no-show; he was there. Stamson made another curious observation: ""Normally, she (Bergmann) comes to our meetings. She was not there April 10.""

Collierville Republican Club president and Collierville vice mayor Tony Sarwar, who owns the restaurant where the group meets, said, ""we’ve never had a situation when Dr. Flinn ever cancelled out on us or was ever supposed to be . . . the main speaker for the evening and cancel on us. . . . As far as I recall, I think Dr. Flinn has been there less than a handful of times.""

But Flinn’s campaign manager, Kristi Stanley made two salient points: first, the Collierville club’s March 20 meeting agenda dealt with school board issues, not Congressional races; and second, Collierville (like Germantown) is actually no longer in the newly redrawn 9th Congressional District.

East Shelby Republican Club president Arnold Weiner, who will be a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Tampa this summer, said he would not take sides in the Bergmann-Flinn contest. Told that all he was being asked to confirm was whether Flinn had been invited to speak to his group and had not shown up, Weiner said: ""No."" And added:  ""We’re going to have a candidate forum in July. But there’s never been anything -- official forum -- where he has been a no-show.""

Stanley says Flinn regrets a conflict prevented him from addressing the Midtown Republican Club on March 27, but notified the club in advance that he would not be there. The campaign sent consultant Gene Bryan to speak in Flinn’s behalf to the Midtowners. Lawson said Bergmann also did not attend that event and sent a surrogate -- because the campaign learned, before the event, that Flinn would not attend.

As for the noon forum at The Cupboard forum on April 12, Stanley says the campaign never received an invitation. Members of the news media, however, were informed of the event by email on April 10, so it’s likely Flinn’s people were at least aware of it. A back room of the restaurant was reserved by Bergmann’s campaign manager for a private party of 20, records show, and that gathering did occur, according to Cupboard manager Darla Morgan.

A video of the April 27 event at Tom Lee Park captures the drama of the session in which a squawking rubber chicken in a folding chair stands in for Flinn. Again, Stanley said Flinn never received an invitation and said her review of the video indicates the ""debate"" didn’t have a sponsor; it was a Bergmann campaign media event.  ""Did they plan on us not being there, so they brought the rubber chicken?"" she asks.

The video shows the moderator, Bartlett City Alderman David Parsons, asking both Bergmann and the rubber chicken about jobs, energy and ""restoring liberty,"" with the Mississippi River and the Arkansas shoreline as backdrop. In Bergmann’s remarks, she said, among other things, that she was looking forward to going ""toe-to-toe"" in the House Chamber’s well with 21-year veteran California Congresswoman Maxine Waters.

At the end of the video event, Parsons says, ""I’d like to thank all the listening audience out there for participating today and joining us down here at Tom Lee Park."" But, in the course of the ""debate,"" the camera scanning the park and bluff beyond where an audience should be visible shows no one there. Who Parsons was thanking is a mystery since an audience, in this case, was the no show. Parsons has not responded to email and voicemail messages seeking clarification.

Our ruling 
Charlotte Bergmann’s 9th Congressional District campaign claims that George Flinn, her Republican primary opponent, has a pattern of confirming his attendance at partisan forums and then not showing up, and is seeking to label him a ""chicken,"" unwilling to debate. But the evidence shows Flinn has either attended events or sent his regrets in advance.

Immigration bill cost Georgia farmers ‘close to’ $400 million, labor leader says
","
Georgia labor leader Charlie Flemming took the microphone at a May 1 rally at the state Capitol to talk about the challenges facing working people around the world and ended up taking on the state’s new immigration law.

""I was trying to stay away from that,"" Flemming said. But concerns about HB 87 -- Georgia’s immigration law -- were too hot a topic not to mention, he said.

A Morris News Service article about the rally attributed to him a claim that the legislation cost farmers $400 million last year.

""I said, ‘close to $400 million,’ "" said Flemming, president of the Georgia AFL-CIO.

Flemming said he got the number from an Oct. 4 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which itself was based on a University of Georgia study commissioned by the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association.

It’s a pretty big number and raises a couple of questions: Is the number right and are the losses attributable to the new immigration bill?

We tracked down report co-author John McKissick, a UGA distinguished professor of agriculture marketing emeritus, to explain the report.

McKissick said he and co-author Sharon Kane surveyed 189 farmers representing nearly half the state’s acreage for seven fruit and vegetable crops about their labor troubles during last spring’s harvest. The crops -- including blueberries, onions and watermelons -- were chosen because they are ""most dependent on timely seasonal harvest.""

The results showed an acute labor shortage cost those farmers just under $75 million.

Since the sample size was so large -- 46.4 percent of the state’s total acreage in those crops -- McKissick said it is fair to project the direct cost to farmers was about $140 million. The report couches that conclusion because responses to the survey were voluntary, but McKissick feels confident the projection is valid.

""It wasn’t a random survey,"" he said. ""But you rarely ever get a survey that covers that amount of acreage.""

So, if the impact to farmers was $140 million, where did Flemming get his figure?

Along with the direct impact on farmers, the UGA report projected an indirect impact of the lost harvest on the rest of the state’s economy. Truck drivers, grocery store workers, even accountants get hurt indirectly when crops don’t get to market, McKissick said.

The report calculated both the direct (to the farmers) and indirect (to the rest of us) impacts of the labor shortage to be $391 million. That’s the ""close to $400 million"" that Flemming got from the AJC article he scanned on his way to the rally.

For the record, the AJC article reported the projected loss was for the entire state economy, not just farmers. Flemming said he may have misread the story before speaking, but he said the larger point remains.

""It was a significant hit for our state,"" he said. ""This law has cost the state a lot of money. It’s hurt and is continuing to hurt.""

That’s the second question: Is HB 87 the culprit?

The UGA report is based on losses from the spring harvest -- which is the largest and most significant harvest in the state for fruits and veggies. But HB 87 did not take effect until July 1, so how could it have caused the shortage?

That’s conjecture, McKissick said, but it is not that hard to make the connection.

""The bill had been passed, but even though it had not gone into effect, it created an atmosphere where people had a lot of questions,"" he said.

The report itself does not draw that conclusion, but McKissick said both the labor shortage and legislative promises to crack down on illegal immigrants occurred simultaneously.

A follow-up study has not been done, but McKissick said he expects the economic ripples will continue as farmers cut back on their spring crop acreage.

""We did ask in the survey whether or not the results of the labor shortage would impact their production decisions for the fall and the following year’s crop,"" he said. ""There was a good number that said it would affect their decisions, so there probably is a multiyear impact.""

So Flemming was wrong in attributing the entire loss to farmers, but he was in the neighborhood when he said agricultural losses were about $400 million if you count indirect losses. It is impossible to say with absolute certainty that HB 87 caused the labor problem, although McKissick and others believe the two are linked.

There are a couple of problems with Flemming’s statement. It’s not completely clear that HB 87 is responsible for all of the farm losses. But even if it is, the amount of those losses if far less than he stated.

There’s a kernel of truth to what he said. But just a kernel. 

That’s fits our definition of Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD43380>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/charlie-flemming/immigration-bill-cost-georgia-farmers-close-400-mi/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Betty Sutton']","
Betty Sutton says Jim Renacci has voted repeatedly to end Medicare
","
Few subjects can equal health care for stirring political debate and fueling partisan talking points. 

Claims about health care have won the dubious honor of being PolitiFact National's ""Lie of the Year"" for three straight years. PolitiFact’s editors award that title to the claim they view as the most significant falsehood, the one that had the most impact on the political discourse.

Republican claims that health care reform law would include ""death panels"" and that health care reform represented a ""government takeover of health care"" were winners for 2009 and 2010.

A claim from Democrats' that Republicans ""voted to end Medicare"" was tapped for the honor in 2011.

But as hot-button an item as health care is with voters, it’s no surprise that politicians and their campaigns return to those claims -- particularly when the race is expected to be hotly contested.

That is indeed the case with Rep. Betty Sutton. Because of redistricting, she is running this fall against Rep. Jim Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, in the new 16th District.

A new campaign solicitation emailed by Sutton’s campaign referred to Renacci as ""someone who has voted repeatedly to end Medicare.""

Sutton's campaign staff said the statement referred to Renacci's votes, in April 2011 and March 2012, in favor of the House Republican budget plans presented by Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

The Ryan budget proposal restructures Medicare toward private insurance. Under the current Medicare system, the government pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65. Under the Ryan plan, future beneficiaries would be given a credit from the government to shop for new health plans — a dramatic departure from the current system.

The plan has some guarantees for coverage, although seniors would have to pay more to get the benefits they receive today, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Sutton's campaign provided two sources for the ""end Medicare"" statement. The first was a Wall Street Journal article from April 2011 that, according to the campaign, said the Ryan plan ""would essentially end Medicare.""

As we have noted in previous fact-checks, however, the Journal article didn’t quite say that. The partial quote deceptively truncates what the article said: ""The plan would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills.""

Changing the payment method is not the same as ending the entire program.

The other source cited as an article from the McClatchy-Tribune News Service that ran in The Plain Dealer. It said Ryan's plan ""effectively would end Medicare for seniors."" It said the plan ""would end Medicare for anyone who retires after 2021 and replace it with a 'premium support' program, in which the federal government would subsidize private health plans.""

Sutton's campaign manager, Scotty Eggleston, added this: ""Ohio seniors deserve the Medicare guarantee that they have paid for and that will actually cover their costs, not the pretend version and voucher system that Jim Renacci wants that has seniors pay nearly $6,000 more while getting less coverage.""

These are questions of degree. While Medicare would move into a privatized voucher version under the Ryan plan, it would still exist as a health-insurance program for seniors. And the Ryan plan would not affect seniors currently in Medicare, or even the people who would join the program in the next 10 years.

For everyone else, the Ryan plan might better be defined as the end of ""Medicare as we know it"" -- a cliche, but one with enough qualification to keep the claim out of the hot seat.

PolitiFact's rating was matched by other independent fact-checkers.

""Medicare would remain an entitlement program, but it would also be more costly to future beneficiaries. It would not end,"" said FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

Dominic Chavez says Austin “tax burden” up more than 40 percent, family income up more than 20 percent since 2000
","
In his video posted on a city web page featuring videos from numerous candidates, Austin City Council hopeful Dominic ""Dom"" Chavez expresses concern about the city’s affordability.

Chavez, who’s running for Place 5, says: ""Since 2000, the median family income has increased more than 20 percent in Austin, but during that same time, the city sales and property tax burden on the typical family has increased by more than 40 percent.""

Are local taxes outpacing family incomes by so much? We wondered.

Chavez told us by email that he used data from the Real Estate Council of Austin’s 2011 annual Combined Costs of Governments Index. That index indicates the estimated city ""tax burden"" per household increased 48 percent from 2000 to 2011, he said, and the ""median family income"" rose 27 percent.

According to the index, Austin’s median family income went from $58,900 in 2000 to $74,900 in 2011. To calculate residents’ city tax ""burden,"" the group used city sales tax, city property tax and the amount of money from utility fees that is returned to the city each year. They estimated that in those three categories, a typical Austin household paid $1,368.48 to the city in 2000 and $2,029.58 in 2011.

The real estate council, which advocates for commercial real estate interests, has calculated the ""Cost of Governments"" index for each year starting with 1989. Susan Engelking of Engelking Communications updates the index annually, and spoke with us by phone about how it’s compiled.

She said Chavez’s use of 20 percent and 40 percent ""looks OK … (it’s) in the ballpark,"" and described for us the variables they use to calculate this ""tax burden"": 

The real estate group selected those measures, Engelking said, because the group wanted to use annual numbers that would be reported consistently for years to come -- with no changes in methodology -- so that the results would continue to be directly comparable.

For similar reasons, she said, the group opted not to adjust the data for inflation. ""There were several compelling reasons to not do it,"" Engelking said. They wanted the index to be simple enough that anyone could quickly recreate the work just by making a few phonecalls, she said -- and simple enough so that it would be clear nobody was ""fiddling"" with the numbers.

But most importantly, she said, adjusting for inflation would not change the big picture: how taxes and income affect Austinites through the years. ""It isn’t necessary for the question we are asking,"" she said.

Mark Robyn, an economist who studies local, state and federal taxes at the Washington-based, nonpartisan Tax Foundation, said he thinks the real estate council’s sales/utility/property tax definition of ""tax burden"" is a fair measure if it includes all the major taxes levied by the city.

Citing median income for a family of four but calculating tax bills for an average household is not a perfect comparison, Robyn said, but he added, ""I can’t think of a reason there’s anything wrong with it."" Although medians and averages are calculated differently, neither one is ""wrong""; there are just many ways to slice the data, he said.

Like Engelking, Robyn noted that Chavez had used a conservative estimate. ""He could make an even more shocking statement if he wanted to,"" Robyn said.

Over a longer period, the real estate group’s numbers show even more disparity.

Michael Wilt, the group’s director of government relations, told us by phone, ""What our numbers indicate is that since 1989, the median family income has doubled but the combined tax burden has tripled.""

His group maintains the index to remind local government of of these aspects, he said. ""The main statement is that the cost of government is outpacing the median income.""

Robyn said that such a conclusion would most likely hold even if the numbers were adjusted for inflation. With inflation factored in, he said, change in income over time might not be 27 percent, and the change in tax bill over time might not be 48 percent, but overall, tax bills should still be outpacing income.

We tracked down the data independently from the sources Engelking used.

From the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, we learned Austin’s median family incomes were $58,900 in 2000 and $74,900 in 2011, a 27 percent increase. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city (rather than the Austin metropolitan statistical area, which is larger) had 265,649 households in 2000 and 330,010 households in 2011. Austin’s demographer, Ryan Robinson, told us by phone that the city calculates its own numbers for non-census years, and said he probably supplied Engelking with an October 2011 quarterly estimate of 333,815 households.

Austin’s budget office gave us the city’s total sales tax revenue for 2000 ($122.2 million) and 2011 ($151.2 million), as well as total utility dollars transferred to the city in 2000 ($78.4 million) and 2011 ($134.3 million). The Travis Central Appraisal District sent us average taxable home values and city property tax rates for those years.

Next we ran the math, and found that one of Austin’s 265,649 households in 2000 would have paid an average of $461 in city sales taxes and seen $295 of its utility fees transferred back to the general fund. If that household owned a home worth the city’s average taxable value ($138,674, in 2000), its city property tax bill would have been $647, at the 2000 rate of 46.63 cents per $100.

That yields a ""tax burden"" of $1,402 for an average Austin household, in a year when HUD gives Austin’s median family income as $58,900.

In 2011, according to the same sources, one of Austin’s 333,815 households would have paid $453 in city sales tax, $407 in utility transfers and -- if the home’s taxable value was $254,328, the average for Austin in 2011 -- a city property tax bill of $1,224.

That’s a total $2,084 ""burden"" in a year when HUD estimates Austin median family income was $74,900.

The real estate group, by way of contrast, got a ""tax burden"" of $1,368 for 2000 and $2,030 for 2011. So our results were $34 higher for 2000 and $54 higher for 2011.

In all cases, however, the percentage of change held up: That ""tax burden"" rose 48 percent from 2000 to 2011, whether calculated by us or by the real estate council.

City budget officer Ed Van Eenoo told us by email that he had a few concerns with the index. Dividing sales tax revenue and utility transfers by the number of Austin households inflates the apparent ""burden,"" he said, because it’s not just city residents paying into both of those pools. The utilities serve an area larger than the city, and business-to-business sales as well as out-of-town visitors contribute sales tax dollars. He also objected to calling the utility transfers a ""tax.""

Engelking said sales tax, utility transfers and property tax are the three largest revenue streams going into the city’s general fund. She agreed that utility transfers aren’t a ""tax,"" but said that the goal of the index is to track the ""costs of government,"" as indicated by its name. If utility transfers were excluded, she said, ""you’d be missing really important money that people do pay to fund city government.""

Chavez drew on a calculation that checks out, though the city’s suggested caveats seem worthy of consideration. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD36580>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/dominic-chavez/dominic-chavez-says-austin-tax-burden-more-40-perc/

Tim Kaine says pre-kinderdarten program expanded 40 percent when he was governor
","
Democratic Senate hopeful Tim Kaine says a key step in building a workforce trained for the future is to ensure all children are prepared to enter kindergarten. And he offers his record as governor as proof of his commitment to that goal.

""The research clearly demonstrates high-quality early childhood opportunities help children succeed,"" he wrote in a paper laying out his economic policies. ""That’s why we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent...""

We checked whether Virginia’s early childhood programs really did grow by 40 percent during Kaine’s term as governor from 2006 to 2010.

During his gubernatorial campaign, Kaine proposed making Virginia’s pre-kindergarten program available to all 4-year-olds -- not just those from families living close to the poverty line. The universal access was estimated to cost $300 million a year.

Once in office, Kaine scaled back that ambition in the face of a recession that eroded state revenues. But he did seek increases preschool programs every year during his term.

Budget records show he proposed an extra $4.6 million for the 2007-08 fiscal year to add 1,250 children to the program. In his full biennial budget, which covered 2008 through 2010, Kaine sought $56 million in additional funding, according to reports. The request was pared to $40 million, then $22 million, as lawmakers sought to cope with the recession.

Over the course of Kaine’s term, the Virginia Preschool Initiative saw a steady rise to its annual budget from $46.3 to $58.6 million. (That trend has continued into the recently approved budget, which provided $68.2 million for 2013 and $68.5 million for 2014.)

Virginia Preschool Initiative teaches social and learning skills to 4-year-olds who will become eligible for free or reduced lunch programs when they enter public schools. The pre-K program is open to at-risk children who live above the poverty line. Children below that line qualify for the federal Head Start program.

In the 2005-06 school year, when Kaine took office, 11,343 children were enrolled in Virginia’s preschool initiative. By the time his term ended, in the 2009-10 school year, the program had 15,901 children. The increase is 40.2 percent.

Our ruling
Kaine claimed that he was part of expanding participation in early childhood programs in Virginia by nearly 40 percent. The numbers confirm that.

We rate Kaine’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB47A00>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-pre-kinderdarten-program-expanded-4/

Paul Bettencourt says voting threshold he championed stopped $100 million Dallas schools tax hike
","For almost any elected official, a $100 million item funded by taxpayer money is a big deal. So we sat up when state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, took credit for stopping such a Dallas tax hike. Bettencourt said in an Aug. 24, 2016, press release: ""Stopping a $100 million... tax increase will be a record that will stand for some time."" We wondered if indeed a Bettencourt-backed change in law stopped the described hike. Bettencourt, who chairs the Senate Select Committee on Property Tax Reform and Relief, said that during the 2015 legislative session, he offered a revision to a measure authored by state Sen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe. The adopted tweak, Bettencourt said, imposed a higher voting threshold for ""local taxing units to assess property tax increases in their jurisdictions."" And, the release indicated, the Dallas school board recently failed to approve the described tax hike because advocates didn’t clear the higher threshold. We checked: In 2015, Creighton authored and Bettencourt amended Senate Bill 1760, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott on June 15, 2015, and became law on Jan. 1, 2016. The Texas Association of School Boards spells out how a tax ratification election, or TRE, works: ""Texas law requires school districts to calculate two taxes rates -- the effective tax rate and the rollback tax rate... Generally, if a school board adopts a tax rate above its rollback tax rate, it must hold an election to ratify that rate."" The TASB guidance continues: ""If a majority of the votes cast in the election favor the proposition to approve the rate, then the tax rate for the current year is adopted by the board. If the proposition is not approved, the board may not adopt a rate higher than the rollback rate."" But before the question can get to voters, thanks to the new state law, it takes a 60 percent vote from the school board to put it on a ballot. Voter may then approve the tax increase with a majority vote in an election. Through 2015, state law required a simple majority vote of the school board and voters alike. Upshot: Local taxing authorities must secure a supermajority vote, or 60 percent, whereas to adopt a new tax rate higher than its rollback tax rate. Through 2015, state law required only a majority vote of a local board. So, what exactly happened in Dallas? On Aug. 19, 2016, the nine-member Dallas Independent School Board voted on whether to ask Dallas County residents to consider a 13-cent property tax increase, which supporters said would raise about $104 million to fund early childhood education programs and other initiatives in the district. According to a briefing the trustees received that month, the estimated $104 million would have been spent three ways: -- $40 million for expanding access to early childhood education, including full-day pre-kindergarten -- $32 million for teacher compensation -- $32 million for expanding college preparation programs at district high schools After the vote, some board members said they remained committed to finding the money elsewhere in the district’s budget. ""Our hope is to do our best with the money that we have to expand all three of those programs, but that’s a challenge given that there was $105 million on the table with the TRE that we won’t have access to this year,"" board member Dustin Miller said after the vote. ""We’ll be looking for possible cuts in other areas in order to free up money to fund those programs."" Five trustees voted to put the question on the November 2016 ballot, called a tax ratification election, and four trustees voted against it. The 5-4 vote did not meet the supermajority threshold, per the new law. Residents of Dallas ISD will not see the tax increase question on their ballots in November, and several trustees have said they will go back to the drawing board. Miguel Solis, a board member who voted to send the measure to voters, said the new threshold was single-handedly responsible for killing the TRE idea. Voters likely would have approved the tax increase, though it would have been a tight race, he said. ""We discussed (before the board’s vote) whether or not we would be able to pass this thing,"" Solis told us by phone. Todd Williams, executive director of Commit! Partnership, said the Dallas district is the only one in North Texas not to achieve the requisite supermajority vote needed under the revised law. He leads a consortium of area business, nonprofits, school districts and foundations who focus on local education issues and who supported the TRE.

""In the Dallas County area, we’ve seen several districts go for a TRE,"" he said. ""(Commit! Partnership) polled it and it looked like, after we informed voters of the structure and the outcomes, it was going to win about 58 or 59 percent."" Also in August 2016, voters in Frisco rejected a similar 13-cent tax increase in a tax ratification election, but in that case, the school board had a super-majority to send the question to voters. According to a WFAA-TV news story, much of the new revenue would have covered an increase in teacher pay and helped address an estimated $30 million shortfall in the district’s 2017-18 budget. Since the law took effect, 33 of the state’s more than 1,000 school boards have cleared the higher hurdle set in place at Bettencourt’s urging and sent the question of a tax increase to voters, according to the education website TexasISD.com. In all but three of those instances -- in the Yantis, Marlin, and Frisco districts -- voters went on to approve the proposed hike, the website said. Our ruling Bettencourt said a change in law he carried stopped a $100 million tax increase in the Dallas school district. You bet your calculator it did though it’s also so that more than 30 other school boards cleared the higher threshold singled out by Bettencourt, each time sending a tax-hike proposal to voters.

Sylvester Turner calls Houston nation's most diverse city
","Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner unveiled 60 welcome signs destined for the city’s airports, libraries and convention center via a tweet saluting the city’s diversity. ""Welcome to #Houston, the most #diverse city in #America. New posters up at City Hall and the airports,"" Turner said in July 2016. The Bayou City is known for a few things. Its size as the nation’s fourth-most populous city, for one. The constant one-two punch of heat and humidity for much of the year could be another. And the city’s diversity comes to mind. Still, with other U.S. cities having similar reputations, we wondered how Turner determined Houston ranks No. 1. Turner cites Kinder Institute study By email, Janice Evans in the mayor’s office told us Turner relied on a 2012 report from the Kinder Institute for Urban Research, a Rice University think tank, stating that based on the 2010 U.S. Census, the Houston metropolitan area--taking in Harris and adjoining Fort Bend, Montgomery, Brazoria, and Galveston counties--was the most racially and ethnically diverse of the country’s top 10 most populous metropolitan areas. The report, we found, relied on a statistical calculation known as an Entropy Index which a 2004 U.S. Census Bureau paper calls a measure of ""evenness,"" in this instance how ethnic groups are distributed across Houston-area neighborhoods. The index, devised by Dutch econometrician Henri Theil and others in the early 1970s, compares the population of individual groups to the general population. Kinder’s analysis counted the population of four major ethnic groups (white, black, Latino and Asian) and calculated how close the total population was to having balanced percentages across the groups. In the end, Houston had an entropy score of 0.874, narrowly edging New York, which had a 0.872 score. ""All but two of the 10 largest metropolitan areas, Boston and Philadelphia, have a higher entropy score than the national average of 0.709,"" the report said, ""meaning that in general the large metropolitan areas are more diverse than the nation as a whole.""
  Metro Areas Entropy Index Scores Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX 0.874 New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island NY-NJ-PA 0.873 Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV 0.859 Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana, CA 0.855 Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX 0.822 Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL 0.820 Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL-IN-WI 0.806 Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, GA 0.786 Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD 0.686 Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA-NH 0.570 The Houston metro area stood out, the report said, because ""unlike the other large metropolitan areas, all four major racial/ethnic groups have substantial representation in Houston with Latinos and Anglos occupying roughly equal shares of the population."" City versus region? But when talking about diverse cities, it’s worth mentioning that neither diversity nor ""city"" has a consistent definition. John Logan, a Brown University sociologist whose research we spotted online, explained by email that researchers often prefer to look at metro area populations rather than limiting their focus to residents within city limits, since in many urban areas people live beyond the city limits. Jack Fong, a sociologist at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, told us that historically, the definition of any city or metropolitan area has proved fluid, even ambiguous, with no exact consensus among experts. We reached out to Fong after he was cited as an expert in a May 2016 diversity study on the online financial planning website WalletHub. That study pegged Houston as the 23rd most diverse city in the nation--though 10th among cities with a population exceeding 300,000. Fong said that often in diversity studies, researchers decide on the physical boundaries first and then derive data on the population within those boundaries, instead of surveying people to see how they self-identify. He said people connect to a city very much based on emotion, and ""don’t care what the map says.""    In an urban sociology textbook, Fong noted the many ways a city has been defined, across regions and throughout history, ""given that almost 200 countries on the planet have different approaches toward identifying the boundaries of their urban areas."" Both the WalletHub analysis and a May 2015 article posted by FiveThirtyEight focused on cities rather than metropolitan areas. The FiveThirtyEight study went this route because cities matter ""especially for questions of urban planning and city-administered services like schooling and policing,"" the story read. Houston comparatively looks less diverse, we determined, if you look at cities by themselves, not sweeping in adjoining areas. The Kinder Institute report also found two suburbs of Houston, Pearland and Missouri City, were more diverse than Houston itself. ""There’s no perfection, no precision, no exactness in how diversity can be measured,"" Fong said. The lack of one singular definition of what a city or metro area is, along with analyzing the population based on different categories, will lead to varying outcomes. When local leaders tout their city’s diversity, however, Fong would recommend following up to find out how they reached those conclusions. Other research Web searches and interviews helped us identify other studies, not all of them placing Houston first in diversity. For instance, a clickable analysis by the Institute for Child, Youth and Family Policy at Brandeis University makes it possible to gauge the diversity of metro area populations based on a variety of factors for the years 2000, 2010 and 2012. Among options: The data can be analyzed to look at only the population under 18 years of age, or over 65 years old, or to compare native-born and foreign-born residents. Houston ranked 11th for its 18 and under population and 97th for its 65 and older population among the 100 largest metro areas, and sixth nationally for its foreign-born and 39th for its native-born populations. Another resource, the US2010 Project from Brown University and Penn State University, allowed us to gauge the ""diversity index"" of the nation’s major metro areas for 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010. By this analysis, the greater Houston area in 2010 landed eighth nationally, trailing areas including San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York and Las Vegas. It looked to us like Houston didn’t rank first because the project took into account five racial ethnic categories, the additional one being other, which mainly accounts for the Native American population; Kinder considered four.  Bingo, Logan told us by email, further noting that when people identified as more than one race, they were not counted in both categories but instead assigned to one in the US2010 rankings. ""These choices naturally have some impact on the diversity measure,"" Logan said. We shared our diverse findings with Turner’s office. In reply, spokeswoman Janice Evans pointed out by phone that however Houston ranks, it’s ""very diverse. Anyone who lives here knows that.""   Our ruling Turner tweeted that Houston is the most diverse city in the country. While the Kinder Institute report lists Houston as the most diverse out of the country’s biggest metropolitan areas, other metro area rankings, such as the US2010 Project, place it high but not at the very top. Rankings that compare only cities rank Houston lower nationally. Experts acknowledge diversity can be calculated in a multitude of ways, which makes it difficult to come to one singular conclusion.

Conservative website wrongly ties Clinton Foundation to bad HIV/AIDS drugs
","For the most part, Republican attacks on the Clinton Foundation have raised questions about its donors, but now an article from the conservative Daily Caller website challenges one of the foundation’s signature efforts, getting affordable HIV/AIDS drugs to patients worldwide. In a story headlined as an exclusive, a Daily Caller reporter wrote ""Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ‘watered-down’ HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa."" The primary goal of the Clinton Health Access Initiative when it began in 2002 was to bring down the price tag of AIDS medicines. If the initiative were tied to distributing ineffective drugs, that would be a serious offense. We decided to drill into the details. HIV/AIDS Drugs and the Clinton Health Access Initiative The Daily Caller article is based on a draft version of a report on the Clinton Foundation from the office of Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a conservative Republican from Tennessee. Blackburn’s staff focused on the Clinton Health Access Initiative’s dealings with the Indian generic drugmaker Ranbaxy. The initiative has become a key player in the worldwide supply chain of the antiretroviral drugs used to fight HIV/AIDS. In one fashion or another, it is tied to the treatment of about 11 million people facing the immune deficiency disease.  While the details of the initiative’s role get complicated, at the bottom of it all is a simple idea: It brings together drug buyers (governments, nonprofits and multilateral aid bodies) that buy in large volume and generic drug makers who agree to price caps. The model has worked. The price of HIV/AIDS treatment plunged and low-cost Indian drugmakers remain an essential part of the equation. Ranbaxy was one of the original group of Indian firms that signed on with the Clinton initiative in 2003. Questions about non-HIV/AIDS drugs But Ranbaxy has faced serious problems with American regulators. In September 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter against Ranbaxy, citing the ways it was cutting corners in the production process at two facilities in India. The FDA’s main complaint was that the company had falsified test results on the stability (think shelf life) of a handful of drugs, none of which however were aimed at treating HIV/AIDS. To be safe, government regulators issued an import alert that blocked 30 drugs at the U.S. border. That longer list included two antiretrovirals used to treat HIV/AIDS. In 2013, the Justice Department filed charges, but again, none of the counts involved HIV/AIDS drugs. In 2013, Ranbaxy agreed to pay $500 million in fines and civil penalties. It admitted that it lied on its paperwork and that it allowed defective batches of drugs to treat acne and epilepsy into the U.S. market. The head of the FDA’s criminal investigations said his team had found evidence that those drugs ""were defective, in that their strength differed from, or their purity or quality fell below, that which they purported to possess."" The government calls such drugs adulterated, or, as the Daily Caller put it, ""watered down."" The FDA said in its original 2008 press release ""FDA has no evidence to date that Ranbaxy has shipped defective products."" FDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Meyer told PolitiFact that applied to HIV/AIDS drugs. Were the drugs safe? So to recap: the Clinton Foundation was using HIV/AIDS drugs from a Indian company that was part of a U.S. government investigation. The company eventually admitted that it had falsified records for several drugs and paid a $500 million fine, but none of the drugs included in that group were HIV/AIDS medications. So what do we know about Ranbaxy’s HIV/AIDS drugs? The FDA said there were no grounds for a drug recall, and on that point it had plenty of company. The World Health Organization had been keeping tabs on Ranbaxy since 2004, including testing Ranbaxy’s finished products. That year, inspectors found problems with Ranbaxy’s drugs and decertified three of its HIV/AIDS medicines. The company then withdrew all of its HIV/AIDS drugs from the WHO’s approved drug list. There was a drug recall in South Africa. (At the time, the Clinton initiative did little work there.) In 2005, the WHO restored seven Ranbaxy medications to its list of prequalified HIV/AIDS drugs. In a 2013 summary report, WHO said, ""Since 2004, international cooperation between stringent regulators and WHO-Prequalification Program has been enhanced to allow early sharing of regulatory intelligence and to facilitate coordinated action, when necessary. At present, there is no evidence that any of the Ranbaxy products currently included on the WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products are of unacceptable quality."" Put simply, since 2005, no regulator has found its HIV/AIDS drugs defective or issued a recall of its products. That list includes agencies in the United Kingdom and South Africa, where HIV/AIDS is an enormous problem. South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Through our partnership with Africa Check, reporter Vinayak Bhardwaj confirmed that South Africa’s Medicines Control Council had been conducting random tests of Ranbaxy products. In 2013, the council declared the drugs ""safe and effective."" Even Blackburn’s report, which is the evidence for the Daily Caller’s claim, added a key qualifier, saying the ""Clinton Foundation likely facilitated the distribution of watered-down HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa through its Clinton Health Access Initiative"" (emphasis ours). Given that many regulators had declared those drugs safe, we asked Blackburn’s office for evidence that proved the foundation likely distributed watered-down drugs. We have yet to receive a response.(Deeper in its article, the Daily Caller wrote of ""the possibility"" that the Clinton initiative distributed diluted drugs.) Ellen 't Hoen, the former point person at the charity group Doctors Without Borders for HIV/AIDS drugs, told us this allegation is not new. ""It is a nonsense story circulated by right-wing groups,"" 't Hoen said. This is not to say that Ranbaxy has not continued to run afoul of international standards. Since 2012, the FDA has dropped three additional Ranbaxy drugs from its approved list. But generally, it’s violations tend to cluster around failures to follow the best manufacturing methods. Serious allegations that Ranbaxy sells shoddy drugs have come from several quarters. The American government said that when it filed charges against the drugmaker in 2010. So did several former Ranbaxy executives, according to a Fortune magazine article. They told Fortune, ""Ranbaxy had used ingredients that failed purity tests and blended them with good ingredients until the resulting mix met requirements. Such a mélange could degrade or become toxic far more quickly than drugs made from the high-quality materials required."" The Clinton Health Access Initiative and Ranbaxy Still, the cloud around Ranbaxy was enough to force the Clinton Foundation’s hand. In 2008, it offered a two-pronged response. Except for two specialized compounds designed for children, it stopped buying any Ranbaxy drugs itself. It also warned sub-Saharan governments and others in its buyer network to take extra steps to confirm the quality of Ranbaxy’s products. It told them to switch to other manufacturers where possible, and if they had to buy from Ranbaxy, they should step up testing of every batch and toughen up the quality control requirements in their contracts. It continued to list Ranbaxy’s products in its menu of approved generic drugs. Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for the initiative, told us the nonprofit ""left the decision to the governments as to what they should do."" Lachapelle said the Clinton initiative limited its buying of Ranbaxy drugs to the pediatric medications (all of which it tested) to be ultra cautious. But it didn’t push governments to do the same because neither the FDA nor WHO said the drugs were unsafe, nor did they recall any products. Lachapelle said this created a dilemma for sub-Saharan African governments. ""If patients taking antiretroviral drugs suffer an interruption in the drugs they are supposed to take every day, there is a danger that they can develop resistance to the drugs which reduces their effectiveness when they re-start them,"" Lachapelle said. ""They can also suffer an increase in viral load and a decline in the strength of their immune systems which can lead to severe illness and death."" In its 2008 memo to governments, the Clinton initiative said ""CHAI believes that either decision — to continue purchasing these products from Ranbaxy or to purchase from alternative sources — is potentially reasonable depending on a country’s specific circumstances."" Our ruling The Daily Caller said that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative distributed ""watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa."" At the most literal level, the statement is a misreading of a report from a conservative Republican who said the foundation ""likely facilitated"" the distribution of watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs. Neither version of the claim -- centering around the drugmaker Ranbaxy -- is proven. In fact, a host of regulatory agencies have found the drugs in question to be safe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said there was no evidence the drugs themselves were substandard. The World Health Organization, South Africa’s Medicines Control Council and the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency tested the Ranbaxy drugs and found them to be safe. Such testing dates back to at least 2005. We rate this statement False. Update and correction (Sept. 29, 2016): After this item posted, we heard from Mark Tapscott, executive editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization that says it provides investigative reporting for the public benefit. The group does not publicly list its donors. Tapscott listed what he called nine factual errors in our story. We reviewed his claims and found most of them without merit, as they failed to distinguish between Ranbaxy’s HIV/AIDS drugs and its other products. Tapscott, however, correctly noted that in 2004 WHO decertified three of Ranbaxy’s HIV/AIDS drugs. Ranbaxy’s HIV/AIDS drugs were recertified the following year. The story now reflects that information, as well as the correct year in which the Justice Department filed charges against Ranbaxy. Our rating remains unchanged. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19ee7189-664a-4b8e-869b-f11f5b211c33",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFA8780>],/factchecks/2016/sep/23/daily-caller/conservative-website-wrongly-ties-clinton-foundati/

Donald Trump claim on Israeli profiling misses broader security context
","In the wake of two bombings in New York, Donald Trump repeated his call for profiling as a way to deter terrorism, citing Israel as a role model. Trump first made the proposal on CBS’ Face the Nation in June 2016, in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando. He suggested it again in two Sept. 19 interviews on Fox News. ""Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they’ll profile. They’ll profile. They see somebody suspicious. They will profile,"" Trump said on Fox and Friends that morning, adding. ""If somebody looks like he’s got a massive bomb on his back, we won’t go to that person and say, ‘I’m sorry’ — because if he looks like he comes from that part of the world. We’re not allowed to profile. Give me a break."" ""Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel does it. And Israel does it very successfully,"" Trump said to Fox’s Bill O’Reilly that night. ""I am saying, you go in to profile people that maybe look suspicious. I didn't say they were Muslims."" The Trump campaign told us Trump did not say ethnic or racial profiling, but this denial is misleading. Trump said ""we have no choice"" when O’Reilly asked him how profiling ""Arab or Muslim men"" would work. Israel does perform different types of profiling, but they have other security measures in place as well that experts say are crucial to their success in deterring terrorism. And, the two countries’ security infrastructure are strikingly different.   Profiling in Israel Israel practices both predictive profiling and ethnic profiling. The former looks for red flags and suspicious behavior (i.e. arriving for an international flight with no bags) while the latter targets populations seen as more likely to pose risks (i.e. Arab and Muslim men). Amotz Brandes is a former intelligence officer in the Israeli Defense Forces and a security agent and profiler at El Al Airlines, Israel’s flagship carrier. He is now a managing partner at the international security firm, Chameleon Associates. Brandes told PolitiFact that Israeli security almost exclusively profiled Arabs and Muslims until the Lod Airport massacre of 1972. That year, a radical Palestinian group recruited gumen from the militant Japanese Red Army for the terrorist attack that killed 26 people at the airport in Tel Aviv. Using non-Arab, non-Muslim gunmen exploited and exposed a weakness in exclusively focusing on someone’s race or ethnicity, Brandes said. Israeli security now consider a much more comprehensive and specific set of indicators to locate potential threats. But Israel ""never really stopped risk-based profiling. They just added threat-based profiling,"" Brandes said, adding for a Jewish state located in a ""very unsafe neighborhood,"" it’s necessary. ""They treat those with Arab ethnicity as higher risk. It’s not a secret. It’s done in many, many ways."" For example, Ben Gurion International Airport (formerly Lod Airport) labels passengers with numbered stickers, one representing low risk and six very high risk. All fliers are questioned and searched, but those with higher numbers undergo more intensive security screening. According to Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky, one’s, two’s and three’s are reserved for Jewish Israelis, Jewish non-Israelis and friendly internationals. Arab Israelis and questionable internationals are given a four or higher. Palestinians and Muslims are typically classified as six.  The Arab American Institute has documented numerous cases of detentions of Arabs and Muslims lasting upward of 10 hours. In 2014, Ben Gurion installed an automated system for checking bags that some say has improved access for Arab and Muslim passengers. This prompted the Israeli High Court to toss out a lawsuit from the Association of Civil Rights in Israel over ethnic profiling, a decision that the human rights group says didn’t result in the actual prohibition of discrimination.   The U.S. State Department’s country profile for Israel warns that Palestinian-Americans and ""U.S. citizens of Arab or Muslim heritage have experienced significant difficulties and unequal and hostile treatment at Israel’s borders and checkpoints.""   The efficacy of ethnic profiling Whether ethnic profiling is actually productive to counterterrorism is a debated question. ""I think it is fair to say that the jury is out and that it would be incorrect to suggest that profiling has been successful in deterring terrorism,"" said Bernard Harcourt, a law and political professor at Columbia University who specializes in penal law and security.   In a much-cited 2006 paper, Harcourt found no empirical evidence that racial or ethnic profiling is an effective measure. (Similarly, William Press, a computer scientists at the University of Texas, Austin, has demonstrated that racial profiling is just as effective as random sampling.) Harcourt argues that profiling one group diverts resources from examining others outside the group. So while it may help detect attacks in the short term, profiling could backfire in the long term as ""it may well encourage the recruitment of terrorists from outside the core profile and the substitution of other terrorist acts."" Michael Chertoff, Homeland Security secretary from 2005-09, offered a similar take in an Intelligence Squared debate (around the 49:15 mark) over racial profiling, which he called the ""lazy man’s way out."" After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, ""there was a unanimous belief that racial and religious profiling would be not only ineffective, but counterproductive from a security standpoint,"" he said. ""The fact is it would be an engraved invitation to al-Qaida to recruit exactly the kind of people who don’t fit the profile."" In Israel, analysts noted a shift in who was carrying out attacks as early as a decade ago. ""At first, suicide terrorists were all religious, militant young men recruited from Palestinian universities or mosques. In early 2002, however, the profile began to change as secular Palestinians, women, and even teenage girls volunteered for suicide missions,"" wrote Jonathan Tucker, an influential national security analyst and expert in nuclear nonproliferation, in a 2003 paper. ""Suicide bombers have also sought to foil profiling efforts by shaving their beards, dyeing their hair blond, and wearing Israeli uniforms or even the traditional clothing of orthodox Jews."" For these reasons, Chertoff and most national security analysts prefer predictive profiling, based on behavior. This approach led Israeli security to thwart a planned terrorist attack by an assailant who didn’t fit the profile and who didn’t even know she was carrying out an attack. In 1986, Anne-Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish woman, was cleared by Health Airport security, but El Al guards found her suspicious and discovered a false bottom in her carry-on bag with 10 pounds of explosives planted by her Jordanian boyfriend. Murphy thought she was travelling to Israel to get married. Why Israeli security is effective Ben Gurion is widely regarded as one of the safest airports in the world, and El Al one of the safest airlines. But even barring ethnic profiling, to suggest predictive profiling is the reason ignores the full scope of Israeli security. Israel’s entire security apparatus is much more comprehensive than just profiling, experts told us. For starters, the vigilance of the Israeli public is key to how the country prevents terrorism, and ordinary Israelis foil more than 80 percent of attempted terrorist attacks in Israel, according to Tucker. Israel’s intelligence gathering agencies are also more coordinated and specialized than U.S. agencies, expert said. Yoram Schweitzer, an international terrorism expert at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, listed a number of security measures beyond behavior profiling: Israeli airports are much smaller; their perimeters are monitored and screened around the clock; and the entire system is constantly being assessed and improved. There’s also the rigorous selection process for security officers. The personnel are military recruits who must pass intelligence and personality tests. Then they undergo nine weeks of behavior recognition training. Also, the sheer disparity in scale between Israel and the United States is a hurdle to implementing the type of concentrated, high-skilled security apparatus in Israeli airports. Israel has 47 airports, while the United States has more than 13,000, according to the CIA Factbook. While low-risk fliers at Ben Gurion, Israel’s only international airport, are cleared within a few minutes, the average checking time is 57 minutes. The airport saw about 16.3 million passengers in 2015, while more than 100 million moved through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport that year. Brandes also sees institutional differences in how the two countries approach security. For one, Israel’s ""entire methodology is based on terrorism"" while U.S. law enforcement ""is geared towards crime and property crime,"" he said. For another, average Israelis are proactive about not only reporting suspicious activity but engaging with it, while ""everyone in the U.S. holds and waits for the police."" And finally, it’s perplexing for Trump to suggest that the United States isn’t ""allowed to profile."" (Our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker rated this claim Four Pinocchios.) The United States does ""profile people that maybe look suspicious,"" and the Justice Department allows airport security and border patrol to consider race in security screenings. When the TSA attempted to adopt Israeli-style behavioral profiling through a program known as SPOT, the results were less than ideal. Former officers in the program reported in 2012 that 80 percent of passengers targeted at Boston’s Logan Airport were minorities. And a year later, the U.S. Government Accountability concluded that SPOT was ineffective and recommended the program be defunded. ""I think there is a lot to learn from Israel,"" said Brandes, who questioned Trump’s grasp of Israeli security. When he suggests emulate the profiling, ""Does he know that means?"" Our ruling Trump said Israel profiles based on ethnicity and ""does it very successfully."" This is misleading. Israel takes ethnicity into consideration in their security screenings, but it also takes many other clues into consideration. While Israel is successful at deterring terrorism, profiling is not the sole reason. The country’s robust security apparatus and vigilant population are just as, if not more, key its safety.

Suozzi passed major tax hikes in Nassau County
","Nothing, the saying goes, is as certain as death and taxes. Now both are campaign fodder in the race for a congressional seat on Long Island. Republicans are using Democrat Tom Suozzi’s record on taxes as Nassau County Executive in the 3rd Congressional District race. One claim followed a newspaper report that two of the voter signatures collected to help get Suozzi on the ballot are from people who had already died. ""Long Island voters who are actually living and breathing are clearly still unhappy with Suozzi raising taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Chris Pack of the National Republican Congressional Committee said. Suozzi served as Nassau County Executive from 2002 to 2009. Before that he was the mayor of Glen Cove. He wants to succeed Democrat Rep. Steve Israel, who’s not seeking re-election. He faces Republican Jack Martins, who has served in the State Senate since 2011 and also was mayor of the village of Mineola for eight years before that. So is the NRCC correct? Did Suozzi raise taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars when he was county executive? Raising taxes in Nassau County When Suozzi took office in 2002, Nassau County was in rough financial shape, riddled with debt amid a hiring freeze for non-essential workers. The county was trying to figure out how to recover from a fiscal crisis that started under the previous administration. The county received a bailout from the state, which also created an independent authority to monitor the financial condition of the county. That authority, the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, has released reports on the county’s finances since its creation in 2000. To restore the county’s financial footing, Suozzi pitched an unusually large tax increase of close to 20 percent. The county legislature approved it,and property taxes increased by more than $125 million for residents that year. Though steep, the increase helped stabilize the county’s finances, at least in the short term, said E.J. McMahon of the Empire Center for Public Policy. Suozzi kept taxes mostly flat for the remainder of his time in office until 2009 when there was an increase in property tax revenue of close to 4 percent, or about $40 million. Suozzi also proposed a tax on energy use for Nassau County residents during his second term. It passed the legislature and took effect in 2009. It was repealed after Suozzi lost re-election. The tax generated close to $40 million for the county before it went off the books in the second half of 2010, according to documents from the county’s budget office. Two years after Suozzi lost the county executive’s office, the state took control of the county’s finances again. Our ruling  The National Republican Congressional Committee said in an online post that former Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi raised taxes by ""hundreds of millions of dollars."" During his time in office, Suozzi raised taxes by more than $200 million by collecting more in property taxes and instituting an energy-use tax. The $40 million collected from the short-lived energy-use tax combined with the $160 million increase in property taxes brings the total above that threshold.

Do 6 of 10 Americans back legalizing marijuana, as presidential candidate Gary Johnson says?
","In a TV interview during a campaign visit to Milwaukee, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson was asked about his support for the legalization of marijuana. He replied by making a claim we want to check. ""And let’s see, 60 percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana,"" Johnson said on the Sept. 4, 2016 edition of the ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" public affairs show on WISN (Channel 12). Only a month earlier, the former Republican governor of New Mexico had made a less aggressive claim, saying ""most"" Americans supported legalization. PolitiFact National’s rating was True, as multiple polls generally showed support in the low 50s. It seems unlikely that in a few short weeks it would jump to 60 percent. But let’s take a look. Previous factcheck When Johnson made his earlier claim, our colleagues found that in 12 of 14 national polls taken since the start of 2014, 50 percent or more of Americans supported legalization. The information, covering a period of more than 2.5 years, was taken from the PollingReport.com database As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent. In the three latest polls in the database, the numbers crept closer to 60 percent, with support at 54 percent, 56 percent and 58 percent. But averaging the 14 polls, legalization led 53 percent to 44 percent. Another poll Johnson’s campaign, however, pointed us to another relatively recent poll that wasn’t included in the database. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, conducted in February 2016, found that 61 percent of Americans said the use of marijuana should be made legal. (Interestingly, 53 percent said marijuana use in their communities was a moderately serious, very serious or extremely serious problem, compared to 45 percent who said it was not at all serious or not too serious.) Reporting on the poll, the Washington Post’s Wonkblog said the 61 percent support, a notch above Johnson’s claim, was an all-time high. A parting note, though it doesn’t bear on our rating of Johnson’s claim about national numbers:   In a July 2016 poll of registered voters in Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll asked: When it comes to marijuana, some people think that the drug should be fully legalized and regulated like alcohol. Do you agree or disagree with that view? The results: 59 percent agreed, 39 percent disagreed.
  Our rating Johnson said: ""Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana."" A March 2016 poll found 61 percent support, but that is the only recent survey we could find showing support that high. Fourteen other polls going back more than two years show a majority of Americans back legalization, but generally support was in the low 50s. We rate Johnson’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8BA300>],/factchecks/2016/sep/23/gary-johnson/do-6-10-americans-back-legalizing-marijuana-presid/

Rubio would take away right to abortions for rape or incest victims, Murphy says
","U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy said Sen. Marco Rubio has a zero-compromise position on abortion. In a new campaign ad that started appearing Sept. 20, 2016, Murphy’s campaign said Rubio, the Republican incumbent, refuses to give ground on the issue, even in extenuating circumstances. ""Marco Rubio would take away a woman’s right to choose for victims of rape or incest,"" the ad said. It included video of Rubio saying, ""I don’t require there to be an exception for rape or incest."" Murphy has faced criticism that he’s a conservative in Democrat’s clothing, so his ad touted his own support for abortion. The ad goes on to say Rubio wouldn’t allow the procedure for pregnant women with Zika. Rubio has previously confirmed he would oppose allowing a woman who has contracted the virus to abort a fetus that potentially had severe microcephaly. He said he preferred ""to err on the side of life"" rather than allow the procedure. But what has Rubio said about allowing exceptions for rape and incest victims? We checked his record and found that even though Rubio strongly opposes abortion, his stance on granting exceptions is a bit more nuanced than Murphy described. Rubio’s record Rubio’s history against abortion is well documented. He has advocated for further restrictions on abortion, including banning the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. But allowing abortions for rape and incest victims is a trickier subject, which came up while Rubio was running for the GOP presidential nomination. During an Aug. 6, 2015, Republican debate in Cleveland, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pointed out Rubio favored a rape and incest exception to abortion bans, which Rubio refuted. ""I have never said that. And I have never advocated that,"" Rubio said. ""What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States."" Rubio reiterated this view after that debate on Glenn Beck’s radio show, saying he personally supported banning abortion unless the mother’s life was endangered. ""Now I recognize that other people don’t hold that view, and in order to save lives in this country, I have supported bills that had to have exceptions in them,"" he told Beck. Now back to running for re-election to the U.S. Senate, Rubio has supported legislation that contained rape and incest exceptions at least twice. Back in November 2013, he was one of 40 cosponsors for a Senate bill called the ""Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act."" The bill, which stalled in committee, banned abortions at 20 weeks or greater but includes exceptions, including rape and incest. Rubio also cosponsored a similar version in 2015 that required adult women to obtain counseling or medical treatment for the rape 48 hours before the abortion, with separate criteria for minors about reporting the rape to law enforcement. We also found examples of bills Rubio supported that did not appear to contain a rape exception. In 2000, then-state Rep. Rubio voted for a Florida ban on late-term abortions. The original version of that bill didn’t contain a rape exception, though it allowed a doctor to take steps to save the life of the mother. It became law in May 2000, but court decisions ended state enforcement of the ban. Another example is a 2013 U.S. Senate bill Rubio cosponsored that was similar to those earlier proposals but pertained to the District of Columbia. That bill made an exception to save the life of the mother, but not for rape or incest. Rubio’s own ""Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act,"" which he introduced in 2015, would have made it illegal for a minor to cross state lines for abortions to get around parental notification laws. Rubio’s bill included an exception in order to save the mother’s life, but not if the mother was a victim of rape or incest. Recent rhetoric Rubio’s clear preference is that an abortion not be performed, but he is willing to support anti-abortion legislation that includes an exception for rape and incest. He says as much in the very soundbite Murphy’s ad uses. The clip is from a November 2015 event with pastors in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. If you review it in full context, Rubio says he prefers essentially all abortion to be illegal, but is willing to vote for legislation containing exceptions. It begins with Rubio stating his position, referring to the aforementioned Cleveland debate (the words plucked out by the Murphy campaign are in bold): ""I’ve taken great criticism for it. You know, I stood up on a debate stage and was challenged about the fact that I don’t require there to be an exception for rape or incest, and this is a tough position,"" he said. Rubio stresses the word ""require,"" and then continues: ""And I’ve said, listen, I will vote for bills that have exceptions, because they save lives, and (a) 20-week abortion ban has exceptions. And I’ll vote for anything that saves lives. But I don’t require. That is not a majority position, even in the Republican Party. But I just don’t feel this is a political issue, I really don’t, but I will support those that have exceptions, because I’m in favor of anything that protects life."" That same month, he told the Associated Press,""I, as president, will sign a bill that has exceptions,"" he said. ""I've supported bills that have exceptions."" Rubio has often repeated similar statements, sometimes turning the subject to falsely accuse Hillary Clinton of supporting late-term abortions. But his Republican primary opponents continued to attack him on the issue into 2016. In February, he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that as president, ""if they pass a law in Congress that has exceptions, I’ll sign it because I want to save lives."" But he still thought the unborn always deserved protection, even in the event of a ""crisis pregnancy."" Still, he understood that was not the popular position among the general electorate. ""That’s why any law that limits abortions that passes will almost certainly have exceptions. And I’ll sign it with exceptions,"" he said. Our ruling Murphy said, ""Marco Rubio would take away a woman’s right to choose for victims of rape or incest."" Rubio has been a staunch opponent of abortion for years, but his position is subtly shaded. He thinks abortion should not be allowed unless the mother’s life is endangered. But he is willing to support legislation that contains exceptions allowing the procedure for victims of rape and incest. He has backed measures both with and without exceptions. Rubio has said if he had his way, he’d prefer to ban almost all abortions. But his record shows he’s willing to give at least a little ground on the issue, which Murphy has obscured in his ad.

Gingrich spins Clinton's words on Trump and terrorism
","The recent terrorist incidents in New York City, New Jersey and Minnesota immediately became part of the backdrop of the 2016 president campaign. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton jumped into the fray along with their surrogates, including former Georgian and U.S. Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich, who is backing Trump, said Hillary Clinton had tried to somehow blame the attacks on Trump. Gingrich was making a larger point about how the war on terror began with the Iranian hostage crisis in the late 1970s and accelerated up through the growth of ISIS. All of this, Gingrich said, was before Trump came on the political scene. ""How deranged does Hillary Clinton have to be to say, with a straight face, that the terrorist attacks this weekend were caused by Donald J. Trump,"" Gingrich wrote Sept. 29 on a Facebook post accompanied by video of his speech.  ""We're in a life and death struggle with extremists who seek to destroy us, and this is Hillary's response?"" The rhetoric was indeed flying fast and furious in wake of the weekend attacks. But did Clinton really say Trump caused the bombing? PolitiFact decided to take a look. We contacted the Clinton campaign and got this response from spokesman Josh Schwerin: ""She never said that."" The Gingrich camp said Gingrich based his comments on Clinton’s statement at a press event on Monday,  which focused on the terror attacks over the weekend.  A bomb exploded in New York City injuring several dozen people. Pipe bombs were also found in New Jersey and a man stabbed several shoppers at a Minnesota mall by a man who asked several if they were Muslim. The Minnesota stabber was shot and killed. A suspect in the New York and New Jersey incidents, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was shot by police and taken into custody. Gingrich spokesman Joe Desantis emailed that in the aftermath of the attacks Clinton launched into a ""tirade"" at a press event in which she connected Trump to terrorist recruiting and by inference to the attacks. ""We know that a lot of the rhetoric we’ve heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular ISIS, because they are looking to make this into a war against Islam rather than a war against jihadists, violent terrorists, people who number in the maybe tens of thousands, not but tens of millions,"" Clinton said. She added that some of Trump’s incendiary comments about Muslims have been used as an online recruiting tool for terrorists. PoiltiFact has looked at that allegation previously and ruled it True. Desantis said the specifics of what Clinton said connected to the context in which they were said backs up Gingrich’s statement. ""She is clearly arguing that Mr. Trump is making it easier for ISIS and other terrorist groups to recruit and conduct attacks on the United States like the ones carried out in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota  this weekend,"" he said.  ""Hence she is blaming Trump for the attacks this weekend."" We ran both arguments by a couple of  political scientists types with no dog in the fight, including Kerwin Swint of Kennesaw State in metro Atlanta. ""Typical politics, from both sides,"" Swint said.  ""Although Clinton didn't use those exact words, she has pretty clearly said that Trump's words are helping ISIS and leading to greater danger. Gingrich's comments, although exaggerated, are not inaccurate, especially when all of Clinton's comments are put into context."" Political scientist Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia, said Gingrich veered off base when he used the verb ""caused."" ""Her point was that Trump’s call for a ban on Muslims and other statements (such as his preferred policy of killing the family members of terrorists and using waterboarding) hand ISIS some propaganda arguments to employ in their recruiting and communications with Muslim populations,"" Sabato said. Our ruling Trump surrogate and former Georgian Newt Gingrich recently posted on Facebook that Hillary Clinton said the  New York terrorist attacks were caused by Donald J. Trump. She certainly did not say that directly. Clinton did link past Trump comments about Muslims to recruiting efforts that aid terrorists in a general sense.  Gingrich takes Clinton’s attack and  applies a bit of political spin to come up with the charge that Clinton accused Trump of causing the recent attacks.

In U.S. House race, Republican accused of backing cuts to two-thirds of Social Security recipients
","According to one conservative columnist, the race for an open seat in a competitive congressional district in central Wisconsin could be telling. If Republican Mike Gallagher defeats Democrat Tom Nelson, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Christian Schneider says, ""it would be a signal that traditional Republicans might be able to insulate themselves from Donald Trump's record-level unpopularity. But if things head south for Republicans, even their record-high majority in the House of Representatives could be in jeopardy."" Gallagher, a  former U.S. Marine, and Nelson, the Outagamie County executive, are running in the Nov. 8, 2016 election to succeed Republican Reid Ribble, who decided not to run for a fourth term. On Sept. 1, 2016, Nelson hit Gallagher with a TV ad with a popular line of attack: Social Security. After images of senior citizens appear on the screen, the narrator declares: ""Mike Gallagher’s plan would cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors."" So, has Gallager proposed a plan that would make those cuts? Not exactly. The Biggs plan When the claim is made in the ad, a notation on the screen refers to a Nov. 4, 2015 article in the conservative National Review. In a news release announcing the ad, the Nelson campaign said the reference was to an article on Social Security by Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Biggs proposed changes in benefits, saying: Beginning immediately, Social Security would pay every long-term U.S. resident a minimum benefit pegged at the poverty threshold of $950 a month, regardless of the retiree’s work history or earnings. This minimum benefit would take the place of both the redistributive aspects of Social Security and the Supplemental Security Income program, but do so with greater protections against poverty and no prohibition on work and saving. In fact, the Social Security payroll tax would be eliminated at age 62 to encourage longer work lives. But over several decades, the maximum Social Security benefit would be scaled down so that eventually every retiree will receive the same flat dollar benefit from the government. For the bottom third of retirees, benefits would increase, but for middle and upper income Americans, benefits would decline relative to currently promised levels. This makes sense. At any given time, higher-income Americans are less dependent upon government than lower-income households. As incomes rise over time, Americans should gradually become less dependent on the government for income in retirement and more able to build their own savings. So, under Biggs’ proposal, Social Security benefits would decline for the two-thirds of recipients who have higher incomes, though it’s important to note the changes would take place over several decades. Is the Biggs plan Gallagher’s plan? To back the second part of Nelson’s claim, campaign aides cited an answer Gallagher gave to a question about Social Security on the campaign trail on July 9, 2016. Gallagher said he would favor changes such as means testing for people earning above $250,000 and gradually raising the retirement age. Then he added that on Social Security he is ""most influenced"" by Biggs, saying: And he talks about a two-part payment structure where you simplify the program. One would be like a thrift savings plan where your employer matches your contributions and it's what people who work for the federal government get to have access to, but the rest of us don't.  And the other would be a flat universal payment to everyone at the poverty line to bring the program back to its original limits.  But the bad part about all of this is that it's going to be up to people like you and I, 34-year-olds and below, to do that and to bear the brunt of it.  But my argument is that nobody expects it to be there, so I'd rather have a program that's there and more efficient and effective, even if my benefits are slightly reduced by the time I can actually collect Social Security. That’s support for Biggs’ approach to Social Security, but it’s short of Gallagher proposing a plan to change Social Security that explicitly cuts benefits for two-thirds of the beneficiaries. Our rating Nelson said: ""Mike Gallagher’s plan would cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors."" Gallagher has not made a proposal on Social Security that would cut the benefits of two-thirds of the recipients. However, he has praised a proposal that would make those cuts, saying he is most influenced on Social Security by the proposal’s author.

Experts say Donald Trump's 'policies' dovetail with what Vladimir Putin would like for Russia
","Concerned by Donald Trump's secrecy about his dealings with other countries, 55 former government, military and national security officials — Democrats and some Republicans — have signed a letter urging him to reveal his international business relationships and foreign investments, and to pledge to divest himself of all overseas business interests if he wins the presidency. The letter was drafted in part by Michael Morell, former acting director and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. It says that the limited amount of information available to the public — Trump has refused to release his tax returns — suggests business relationships that ""would be problematic"" and might influence his policy positions as president, particularly when it comes to Russia. ""On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list. He has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia, and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies. He even encouraged Russian espionage to interfere with our election, a tactic Putin has deployed across Central Asia and Europe to boost his preferred candidates. In addition, he has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization."" For this fact-check, we were interested in whether Trump has outlined ""policies that read like a Kremlin wish list."" We talked to Russia experts who signed the letter as well as those who didn't.  We emailed several people in the Trump campaign asking for reaction and information to dispute the assertion. We received no reply. We contacted Morell and more than a half dozen of the signers to get details on the claim. Their focus is on the issues mentioned in the letter: NATO, Ukraine and the lack of support for economic sanctions against Russia. Let's review them separately. NATO: In July, Trump told the New York Times that he wouldn't automatically come to the defense of a NATO ally that hasn't paid its expected contribution. ""I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will be defending yourself,' "" he said. NATO was created as deterrent to the former Soviet Union, of which Russia was the key player. Putin has strongly objected to attempts to expand NATO because of Russian security concerns, so anything that weakens NATO could strengthen Russia. ""This is exactly what Putin wants — to sow the seeds of doubt in those countries on his periphery over whether the West will be there for them,"" Morell told us in an email. ""This kind of talk forces those states to be more accommodating to Russian interests."" Trump's potential unwillingness to defend NATO members who don't contribute enough financially to the alliance is ""essentially undermining unconditional nature of our commitment to their defense,"" said a cosigner of the letter, Richard Nephew, a former principal deputy coordinator of sanctions policy for the State Department who is now at Columbia University. Crimea and Ukraine: Russia annexed Crimea, and Putin supported an uprising in eastern Ukraine, sending in fighters after a revolution removed a pro-Russian president in 2014. Putin said annexation was morally and legally justified. The United States and the European Union disagreed. Trump had a different attitude. ""The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,"" he said in a July 31 interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. He also called Putin’s grab ""so smart"" in an April 12, 2014 Fox News interview. As PolitiFact reported in August, Trump’s comments actually echo the official Kremlin position that Crimea is now Russian and its citizens prefer it that way. ""Trump has sided with Putin on all these issues,"" said Samantha Vinograd, another co-signer and former director for international affairs and Iraq at the National Security Council. ""If you look at how Trump will not condemn Russia's military takeover of Crimea, that's something that literally Putin was probably jumping up and down over when he said that."" ""This lets Putin off the hook for the first land grab in Europe since World War II,"" said Morell. ""That gift to Putin even has a bow on it."" Sanctions against Russia: The European Union and the United States responded to the situation in Ukraine by issuing sanctions against Russia. They affect Russian banks, arms makers and energy companies, and have both limited Russia's access to Western markets and hindered its ability to deal with a recession caused by the sharp drop in oil prices. Clearly, Russia would like to see those sanctions lifted. Trump has said he would consider removing them. ""That undermines sanctions as a tool,"" said Vinograd. ""You don't just remove them without proof that a country has met its international obligations."" What other Russia experts say Experts we consulted who didn't sign the letter agreed that many of Trump's comments line up with actions that Putin would probably like to see. ""I think Trump's foreign policy is the most pro-Russian policy we've seen from a major presidential candidate, at least since World War II,"" said Matthew Kroenig, associate professor at Georgetown University and a senior advisor on the Marco Rubio campaign who signed an anti-Trump letter last spring. ""With talk of tearing up NATO and positive talk about President Putin, it seems to be a very sympathetic Russian foreign policy,"" ""Putin and the Russians would be delighted to see him elected,"" Kroenig added. ""To be more supportive of the Kremlin, Trump would have to scrap America's nuclear arsenal and sign a treaty to give the Ukraine back to Russia."" Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, made additional points in an Aug. 17, 2016, Washington Post commentary. For example, a political battle over building a wall on the Mexican border, would be a major distraction in this country and ""a United States convulsed by infighting over Trump's deeply divisive policy proposals gives Putin more freedom to act around the world."" But Peter Feaver, a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University, said the claim that Trump's policies read like a Kremlin wish list is ""hyperbole to be sure, because it's looking at some of Trump's statements and not others."" For example, the candidate's pledge to reinvigorate the United States military would not be part of a Russian wish list. He said the idea that NATO allies aren't paying their fair share for the defense of Europe is a longstanding United States complaint. It's just that Trump is the first to threaten to take action by not defending a country that's attacked but is not paying. ""And he described the situation in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in a way that was favorable to Russia's interpretation of what's happening,"" said Feaver. ""So I wouldn't say his comments are are on the Kremlin's wish list, but they were certainly reinforcing Putin's approach and undermining NATO, which is a way of achieving one of Putin's goals, which is to weaken NATO."" He also cautioned that it can be hard to tell what Trump really thinks, given all the things he says in off-the-cuff remarks. Only the other hand, he noted, Trump seldom backtracks on an outrageous statement he's made. The claim that Trump's policies read like a Kremlin wish list ""has a lot more to do with Donald Trump's overall statements about Russia than it does with any concrete policies, and that's because Donald Trump doesn't really have many concrete policies,"" said Emma Ashford, a defense and foreign policy research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Trump tends to be quite inconsistent on a lot of things"" such as working with Russia to fight ISIS,"" she said. ""So with Donald Trump's inconsistency, it's really really hard to tell what he would do on some of these issues."" Our ruling Morell and others said Trump has outlined ""policies that read like a Kremlin wish list."" Trumps comments on backing away from NATO, supporting Russia on the Ukraine and rethinking sanctions against Russia certainly qualify as statements that dovetail with what the Putin administration would like. But not all of his opinions, such as wanting to increase military spending, are in lockstep with policies the Kremlin might favor.

"['Pensions', 'Illinois', 'Leslie Geissler Munger']","
Munger claims Mendoza double-dipped on public pensions, salaries
","As Illinois grapples with more than $111 billion in unfunded pension debt, Republican Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger has sought to tie her opponent, Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza, to the problems that have contributed to the state’s pension crisis. During a Chicago Sun-Times editorial debate on Sept. 15, Munger said: ""My opponent… was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years."" Mendoza fired back, saying the statement was Munger’s ""latest false allegation"" and one that previously has been disproven.  But the Munger campaign since has doubled down on its ""double-dipping"" claim that Mendoza took two government salaries and paid into two public pension systems, and now is calling on the Chicago Democrat to forgo one of her pensions. With Munger making Mendoza’s pensions and city/state salaries prominent issues in the comptroller race, we wanted to find out if her allegation of double-dipping is true. Mendoza’s pensions In 1998, Mendoza began working for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development as a project coordinator. Two years later, she was elected to the General Assembly, where she served as a member of the Illinois House from 2001-2011, before winning the election for Chicago City Clerk in February 2011. To support Munger’s claim, Phillip Rodriguez, Munger’s campaign manager, provided documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests that show Mendoza’s pension contributions into the Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and the General Assembly Retirement System. According to these records, Mendoza contributed $66,035 into the state pension fund and $34,943 into the city pension fund between 2001 and 2010 -- the time she served as a state representative while also working for the city. As of Aug. 15, 2016, Mendoza’s contributions into the city pension fund totaled $101,736. Mendoza contributed 9.5 percent of her lawmaker salary and 8.5 percent of her city salary, meeting employee contribution requirements for both retirement systems. In 2010, Mendoza’s legislative salary was $67,836 and her base city planner salary was $75,036, or a monthly rate of $6,253. Double dipping? While Mendoza has acknowledged collecting paychecks from both the city and state and paying into the two public pension systems, she has produced documents that challenge the allegation she was double dipping on taxpayer-funded salaries. In a Jan. 8, 2002, memo to the planning department, Mendoza provided her legislative schedule and requested she not be paid by the city of Chicago on days the Illinois House was in session. ""As you are aware, it is extremely important that during the days that I am in session, I not be paid by the City as well,"" Mendoza wrote. ""It is of utmost importance to me that my records be perfectly clear regarding this matter.""  Mendoza listed a total of 44 days between January and May 2002 to reflect her legislative schedule. This 2002 memo is the only such documentation in which Mendoza explicitly asked not to be paid on days when the General Assembly was in session, but her pension contributions into MEABF also show hours were docked over her entire legislative tenure. While it’s difficult to discern from the MEABF document exactly how many hours were docked, it does show deductions in both wage earnings and pension contributions during her entire time in the House.  Stacey Ruffolo, a spokesman for MEABF, noted unless requested, employees usually have their hours docked for disciplinary reasons. In defending her pensions during the editorial board debate, Mendoza said her city pension will be less because she wasn’t paid for the days she was in session. Mendoza also said she will fold her two pensions into one as GARS and MEABF are reciprocal retirement systems, though records show she has not yet applied for reciprocity. ""I also chose to not take the more lucrative pension that I could have taken when I was elected city clerk; I just went ahead and continued to be in the regular Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund pension instead of the Cadillac plan pension,"" Mendoza said during the debate. Our ruling  Munger said: ""My opponent… was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years."" Although Mendoza did request not to be paid by the city on days the House was in session, records from both GARS and MEABF show she still paid the full required rate for employees into both retirement systems. In addition to the 2002 memo that identifies the days she would be in session, the document from MEABF reflects deductions in earnings, hours and pension contributions, which coincide with the General Assembly’s normal legislative schedule. Munger is correct when she claims Mendoza was on both the state and city payroll, and that she fully funded two different pensions, but she is incorrect in saying Mendoza collected her full salary from the city. Records show a deduction in earnings during her tenure as a state lawmaker. For these reasons, we rate Munger’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE4B740>],/factchecks/2016/sep/22/leslie-geissler-munger/munger-says-mendoza-double-dipped-pension-salary/

Trump's Pants on Fire claim that black communities 'are absolutely in the worst shape' ever
","In his continuing efforts to court African-American voters -- a group that overwhelmingly backs Hillary Clinton -- Donald Trump took a moment at a rally in Kenansville, N.C., to reiterate his call for African-Americans to turn against the Democratic Party, arguing that the party has poorly served black Americans’ interests for decades. ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever,"" Trump said. ""You take a look at the inner cities. You’ve got no education. You’ve got no jobs. You get shot walking down the street."" The comment quickly sparked criticism on social media, with many accusing Trump of having no sense of American history. We analyzed Trump’s comment that black American communities are ""in the worst shape"" ever, using history and data. We’ll note here that African-Americans continue to trail white Americans in many important quality-of-life measurements, among them economic, health and criminal justice metrics. Being better than the past is ""a pretty low bar,"" said Bruce Levine, a historian at the University of Illinois-Champaign Urbana, who has authored books about slavery and the Civil War. Not only do African-Americans currently trail whites in many economic measures, but they ""continue to face major discrimination in hiring, access to housing, mortgages, and decent schools and — as almost weekly headlines from around the country demonstrate — death, while unarmed, at the hands of police."" A Trump surrogate, New York City council member Joseph Borelli, said something similar on CNN. ""I don't think he's talking about the days of Jim Crow, even the days of the civil rights movement of the '60s and obviously not slavery,"" Borelli said. ""But he's saying the African-American community is at times being outpaced by other communities."" If Trump had simply pointed out the ongoing discrepancies between blacks and whites in economic, health and educational data, he would have had a point. But that’s very different from what he actually said. (His campaign didn’t respond to a request for clarification for this article.) Slavery and Jim Crow The clearest counterpoints to Trump’s statement are more than two centuries of slavery for African-Americans, followed by another century of discrimination, disenfranchisement and lynchings in the South, the region where most blacks lived at the time. ""African-American communities are suffering from many social ailments, including poor schools and high unemployment, and it is important that candidates address these problems and offer specific ways of ameliorating the situation,"" said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian who has written numerous books on slavery and post-Civil War reconstruction. ""However, it is absurd to say they are in the worst shape they've ever been. Putting slavery aside, go back to the Great Depression, or the crack epidemic of the 1970s and 1980s."" Herbert S. Klein, a historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who has written several books about slavery in the Western Hemisphere, agreed. ""Not to say that color is not a fundamental marker today of comparative health and well-being — African-Americans are still the poorest and least healthy of the U.S. population,"" he said. ""But it’s still much better than in previous decades."" Trump ""needs a history lesson — or two — desperately,"" added Harold Holzer, a historian at Hunter College who specializes in slavery and the Civil War. He’s also wrong for the past half century There’s solid statistical evidence that the black experience in America has been on an upward trajectory over the past half century or more. Here are some examples: • Unemployment rate Unemployment for black workers has zigzagged up and down with recessions and recoveries, just as it has for whites. But historically, the present day is a relatively strong period for black employment. In August 2016, the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 8.1 percent. While that’s almost double the rate for whites -- 4.4 percent -- it’s only been this low for black Americans in 5 percent of months since 1972, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began specifically tallying monthly black unemployment. Here’s a full chart showing the unemployment rate month by month:  • Poverty rate Nationally, the black poverty rate is 24.1 percent, which is much higher than the 9.1 percent percent it is for whites. But that’s still lower than it has been in the past. The annual black poverty rate never fell below 30 percent between 1966, the first year it was tracked consistently, and 1994. And it has only been lower than it is now in four previous years, starting in 1999 and ending in 2002. Here’s a chart showing the data from the late 1970s until 2014. The green line shows the rate for African-Americans.  • Life expectancy Shortly after 1900, black men could expect to live from birth until their early 30s, and black women could expect to live until their mid 30s. Since then, life expectancy for African-Americans has essentially doubled. Today, a black man has a life expectancy from birth in the low 70s, and for black women it’s the high 70s. Here is a chart from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing life expectancy trends from 1900 to 2000. It shows that whites have outpaced blacks in expanded lifespan, but it also shows that both whites and blacks have risen substantially:  And here are the figures from 1970 to 2013, showing a similar pattern.  • Educational attainment African-American graduation rates from high school and college have risen over time. The following chart shows black rates of high school graduation (the top lines) and black rates of college graduation (the bottom lines). Both have been climbing since the mid 1970s, when the data series began.  • Crime On multiple occasions, Trump has said that crime is rising. There is evidence of an uptick for 2015 and 2016 -- neither of which is a year with final federal data available -- at least in certain cities, such as Chicago and Baltimore. But as we have previously noted, the homicide rate and the violent crime rate have fallen to such an extent over the past quarter century -- both in big cities and in the country at large -- that it would take many years of significant increases to return to the ""record levels"" of the early 1990s. African-Americans have also experienced a drop-off in the incidence of being a crime victim, at least through 2014, the last year final data is available. In 2005, for instance, 32.7 per 1,000 African-Americans age 12 and older were the victim of a violent crime. In 2013, that fell to 25.1, and by 2014, it had fallen further, to 22.5. Rates peaked in the early 1980s at nearly 40 per 1,000. Our ruling Trump said, ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever."" Trump’s emphatic statement lacked any nuance. There is no comparison between the situation today and slavery, or the situation today and the Jim Crow era. Meanwhile, over the past half-century, African-Americans, despite consistently trailing whites, have made significant strides in life expectancy, educational attainment and other measures, and currently have unemployment and poverty rates that are near historical lows.

Patrick Murphy attacks Marco Rubio for voting against gun ban for people on no-fly list
","When U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio unveiled a gun safety bill Sept. 15, his Democratic rival for re-election attacked him for failing to support important gun safety legislation months earlier. ""After the tragedy in Orlando, Rubio used the deaths of 49 innocent Floridians to run for re-election while voting against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe,"" U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy said in a campaign statement. ""He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns."" Rubio, a Republican, has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Murphy has been endorsed by the Pride Fund to end Gun Violence, an LGBT group formed after the June 12 Orlando mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Rubio voted for and against gun bills following the shooting, including those related to the no-fly list, a subset of the terrorist watch list. One vote was a procedural move against a Republican-sponsored compromise effort that failed. Gun safety bills in the Senate On June 20, the Senate voted on four amendments aimed to strengthen background checks and make it harder for terrorists or suspected terrorists to buy guns. All four were rejected largely on party lines. Rubio voted against the legislation written by Democrats — a background check amendment by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy and an amendment by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein to ban known or suspected terrorists from buying a gun. He voted in favor of the Republican versions: a background check amendment by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and an amendment about the terrorism watch list by Texas Sen. John Cornyn. Unlike Feinstein’s bill, which would have placed a blanket ban on gun purchases by people who are terrorists or suspected terrorists, Cornyn’s measure would have placed a three-day hold on such sales, allowing the government to make a case in court against the sale showing the person is involved in terrorism or will commit terrorism. Rubio said he supported Cornyn’s legislation because it would ensure ""Second Amendment rights are not denied unless terrorism suspicions are adjudicated by a court, following actual notice and a hearing."" Murphy's campaign  argues that Cornyn's bill requiring the federal government to show probable cause in court sets an unworkable standard of proof for law enforcement in court.  (Under current law, being on a government terrorist watch list is not an automatic reason to be denied the right to buy a gun; however, the FBI is notified. There have to be other disqualifying factors, such as a felony conviction or being an undocumented immigrant.) These were not the bills Murphy was talking about. Murphy was referring to a compromise crafted by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Collins’ amendment proposed to ban people from buying guns if they were on the no-fly list or the ""selectee list,"" which means they undergo additional screening before boarding a plane. Those who were banned from buying guns could appeal in court. The amendment had 12 cosponsors: seven Democrats, four Republicans and one independent. On June 23, a motion to table the legislation failed with a 46-52 vote. That left the amendment still pending, but it showed that her legislation was short of the 60 votes required to advance — and it never did. The question was a motion to table, so when Rubio voted ""yea"" he was voting against the amendment. Eight Republicans voted against tabling the legislation. Rubio cosponsored another Republican alternative from Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. That proposal would have also blocked those on a terrorist list from buying guns but delayed the sale for three days with the possibility of an extension to allow for an investigation. Then it required a hearing before a judge to block the person from buying a gun. It failed 67-31. A day before the vote on the Collins amendment, Rubio told reporters that it was a ""difficult balancing act"" to bar terrorists from getting guns while protecting constitutional rights. ""They’re trying to do it all in a hurry here, and I think we need to get it right,"" he said. After the vote, Rubio told CNN that he was concerned about how much money a gun buyer would have to spend on an appeal. ""If you erroneously end up on a no-fly list, or a selectee list, unless you can come up with $10,000 or $15,000 to hire a lawyer, even if you get your fees back upfront, it’s going to be hard and intimidating to go to a federal court,"" he said. On Sept. 15, Rubio unveiled his own bill that would allow the U.S. attorney general to delay a firearms' purchase for up to three days and file an emergency court petition if someone previously investigated for terrorism tried to buy a gun. The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had previously been placed on a terrorist watch list in 2013 and was investigated by the FBI but he was never charged and later removed from the list. After the gun legislation in the Senate died in June, the House didn’t take the bills up for a vote. Murphy cosponsored a bill requiring the FBI be notified when individuals under a terrorism investigation and those formerly under investigation purchase firearms or explosives. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., introduced a similar version in the Senate, but neither bill has reached a vote. Was Collins’ amendment bipartisan? Murphy called Collins’ amendment bipartisan, and in many ways it seems as though it was: It was written by a Republican, drew four Republican cosponsors along with seven Democrats, and attracted eight GOP members’ support in the procedural vote against tabling it. The U.S. Senate has 54 Republicans and 45 Democrats (including one independent, Bernie Sanders, who pursued the Democratic presidential nomination). There is no pure definition of what can be called a ""bipartisan"" piece of legislation but you know it when you see it, said David Hawkings, senior editor of CQ Roll Call, a publication that tracks votes and legislation. ""It’s an evolving definition -- as Congress gets more and more polarized on party lines even a handful crossing going against the grain makes it bipartisan,"" he said. ""It’s situational."" Hawkings said he would consider Collins’ amendment bipartisan. ""In that case it was an effort by Collins, obviously a Republican, who was trying to put together enough Republicans to go against the wishes of their own leadership and go with Democrats to advance this,"" he said. Laurel Harbridge, a political scientist at Northwestern University who recently wrote a book about bipartisanship, says that a bill is ""bipartisan"" if at least 20 percent of a bill's cosponsors hail from the opposite party as the sponsor. So Collins’ amendment would meet that definition. ""In today's polarized Congress any measure that picks up any support from the other side of the aisle might be deemed bipartisan -- especially on a particularly salient and charged issue like gun control,"" George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder said. Our ruling Murphy said Rubio voted ""against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns."" Murphy overstates the situation when he says Rubio voted against ""every"" bill that came up after the Orlando massacre. Rubio voted for Republican-sponsored legislation about background checks and adding restrictions to individuals on the terrorist list.  Murphy has a point that Rubio voted against a Republican-sponsored, bipartisan measure to ban people on the no-fly list from buying weapons. However, this ad omits that Rubio supported a separate Republican measure that also banned people on the no-fly list from buying guns but required a court hearing before the person was banned from buying a gun. Murphy's statement contains an element of truth but omits important facts to create a misleading picture. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a7895d6b-db52-4212-8f81-a9a54a7976ba",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD3A840>],/factchecks/2016/sep/22/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-attacks-marco-rubio-votting-against/

Hillary Clinton overstates impact of New START on Russia's nuclear arsenal
","Democrats and Republicans working together were able to get Russia to cut their nuclear arms, Hillary Clinton said in a recent television ad. In the ad, Clinton criticized her opponent, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, for claiming to be able to fix the country’s problems himself. She then touted her record as first lady, senator and secretary of state. ""Donald Trump says he alone can fix the problems we face,"" Clinton says into the camera. ""Well, I don't believe that's how you get things done in our country. It takes Democrats and Republicans working together. That's how we got health care for 8 million kids, rebuilt New York City after 9/11, and got the treaty cutting Russia's nuclear arms. We've got to bring people together. That's how you solve problems, and that's what I'll do as president."" The ad, called ""Only Way,"" has aired in seven states, beginning Sept. 9. We wanted to look at ""the treaty cutting Russia’s nuclear arms,"" which led us to Clinton’s foreign policy record while secretary of state from 2009 through early 2013. Clinton is referring to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, an agreement between Russia and the United States designed to limit both countries’ deployed strategic nuclear weapons. The original START treaty was in force from 1994 until it expired in 2009; New START was signed in April 2010 and went into force in February 2011. Clinton’s claim that New START cut Russia’s nuclear arms is imprecise and overstates the treaty’s impact. ""Russia is not expected to rapidly or dramatically reduce its nuclear weapons holdings,"" said Lisa Koch, a professor and nuclear proliferation expert at Claremont McKenna College. ""New START could be characterized as a modest, rather than a sweeping, arms control treaty."" What’s in the treaty? New START has three primary limitations on vehicles capable of launching nuclear weapons and the nuclear warheads themselves. By February 2018, Russia and the United States each have to meet these restrictions: 700 deployed ballistic missiles and heavy bombers: intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons; 800 total deployed and non-deployed launchers: intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers, and nuclear-capable heavy bombers; 1,550 total deployed nuclear warheads on these missiles and bombers. It’s accurate that these limits are more restrictive than prior treaties. For example, START I limited deployed nuclear warheads to 6,000, and the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty limited them to 1,700-2,200. But it’s questionable whether it has, in practice, reduced Russia’s nuclear arsenal for two main reasons: First, Russia was actually below New START limits in two out of the three categories right when treaty implementation began in February 2011. The State Department publishes where both countries stand on these requirements twice a year, starting with an initial exchange of data when New START took force in February 2011. At that time, Russia had 865 deployed and non-deployed launchers for strategic missiles and heavy bombers, meaning it would have to reduce that fleet by 65 to meet the limit of 800 by February 2018. However, Russia had 521 deployed missiles and heavy bombers out of 700 allowed, and 1,537 deployed nuclear warheads out of 1,550 allowed. So Russia could actually increase its deployed missiles and heavy bombers, as well as its deployed nuclear warheads, beyond that initial February 2011 count and still be within treaty limits. ""It is true that the treaty has lower limits than previous treaties, but since Russia was already below the New START limits for deployed forces when the treaty entered into force in 2011, it is not correct to say that the treaty is ‘cutting Russia's nuclear arms,’ "" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, which supports arms control. In fact, the latest State Department report shows that as of March 2016, Russia has 1,735 deployed nuclear warheads, about 200 more than the treaty allows. At first glance, this might seem like Russia is building up its deployed nuclear arsenal in spite of the treaty. However, experts told us that this spike is actually a result of Russia modernizing its nuclear program. Essentially, they’re sending out new missile launchers and submarines that can hold more nuclear warheads per vehicle without having yet retired the old ones, so there’s some doubling up for the time being. Because New START doesn’t set limits during this interim implementation period (February 2011-February 2018), Russia still has a couple years to bring its deployed nuclear warheads within the limits set out by the treaty. Experts expect it to do so. ""Russia’s compliance is not in doubt at this point,"" Kristensen said. Before New START passed, it was clear Russia intended to modernize its nuclear arsenal in a big way, said Steven Pifer, director of the Brookings Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative. Now, their modernization efforts have to fit within the New START limits, and it’s unclear if they would have grown beyond those limits absent the treaty. ""I would say that New START does reduce and limit Russian strategic arms, but I would not overly hype the depth of the reduction,"" said Pifer, a Clinton supporter who testified before Congress in favor of New START. Second, New START only limits a portion of the nuclear arsenals. New START mainly counts strategic, deployed weapons. But it doesn’t limit nonstrategic weapons, nor weapons that have been stockpiled or retired. The treaty ""does not require either government to destroy non-deployed warheads,"" Koch said. ""Both governments can still stockpile warheads beyond the agreed-upon limit of 1,550 without violating the treaty."" Excluding the thousands of warheads that have been retired and are awaiting dismantlement, Russia currently has about 4,500 nuclear warheads, including stockpiles and the 1,735 deployed warheads reported for New START, according to Federation for American Scientists estimates. Russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline since the 1990s. That decline has nearly stagnated during President Barack Obama’s presidency, hovering at around 4,500 since 2012, according to Federation for American Scientists data. Throughout Obama’s tenure — and Clinton’s term as secretary of state — Russia has shrunk its total nuclear arsenal far less than it did under the past three presidents. And it would be difficult to attribute any reduction in Russia’s nuclear stockpiles to New START, given that the treaty only limits deployed weapons. ""The end of the Cold War, the financial crisis in the 1990s and the START I treaty had a much greater effect on shaping Russia's current and planned nuclear posture than the New START treaty,"" Kristensen said. It’s worth noting that some experts no longer consider stockpiles a serious threat to security. Under New START’s deployed weapons restrictions, the effectiveness of a large stockpile is limited, especially because Russia only produces about 10 missiles per year, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Thus the treaty might make it so that Russia does not feel the need to stockpile as many weapons. Our ruling Clinton said New START, passed while she was secretary of state, was a ""treaty cutting Russia’s nuclear arms."" The treaty hasn’t cut Russia’s nuclear arms yet. But if it does in the future, after the treaty is fully implemented in 2018, it seems that any reductions would be minimal rather than sweeping. New START has a limited impact in that it focuses on one portion of Russia’s nuclear program: deployed strategic weapons. The treaty does place tighter limits on these weapons than any past treaty. But Russia was actually already meeting the treaty’s limits, for the most part, when treaty implementation began. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons. We rate her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE6F300>],/factchecks/2016/sep/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-overstates-impact-new-start-russia/

Donald Trump says he never called for profiling Muslims
","During an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, Donald Trump pleaded innocence when asked whether he supports profiling Muslims as a way of preventing terrorism. O’Reilly asked Trump, ""When you say that you're going to profile certain Muslims, are you ever worried that the peaceful Muslims, and there are millions of American … are you worried that sometimes when you say these things, (that) peaceful Muslims will be the victim of backlash, the victim of people just lumping everybody into the terror jar?"" Trump responded, ""Well, first of all, I never said that they were Muslims. You did. You told me Muslims. I didn't say that. I am saying ... people that maybe look suspicious. I didn't say they were Muslims."" Is it true that Trump didn’t suggest profiling Muslims as a security measure? We checked Trump’s past comments and concluded that he’s correct only in the narrowest sense. The O’Reilly interview The strictest way to interpret Trump’s comment is that he only denied saying those words in O’Reilly’s interview. But even this limited claim has some problems. Earlier in the interview, O’Reilly had asked, ""You want to profile Arab or Muslim men. How would that work?"" Trump responded, ""Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel does it. And Israel does it very successfully."" This wasn’t the first interview in which Trump had accepted a question premised on the idea that he wants to profile Muslims. In a June 19, 2016, interview with John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation, Dickerson asked, ""Are you talking about increasing profiling of Muslims in America?"" Trump responded, ""Well, I think profiling is something that we're going to have to start thinking about as a country. And other countries do it. And you look at Israel and you look at others, and they do it. And they do it successfully. And I hate the concept of profiling. But we have to start using common sense, and we have to use our heads."" Previous statements A more common pattern we found in Trump’s past comments was to talk explicitly about the specific security measures he would consider for Muslims, but without using the word ""profiling."" A good example is surveillance of mosques, which seems like an obvious case of a policy that targets a security procedure to people of a specific religion. For instance, in an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Nov. 16, 2015, Trump was asked about shutting down mosques. ""Well, I would hate to do it, but it's something you're going to have to strongly consider."" He repeated the call in another appearance that day, saying, ""You're going to have to watch and study the mosques, because a lot of talk is going on at the mosques."" He echoed this call five days later in remarks at a rally in Birmingham, Ala., saying, ""I want surveillance of certain mosques if that's okay. We've had it before."" And on two more recent occasions, he revived the call for mosque surveillance. One came on June 13, 2016, in comments on Fox & Friends: ""We have to be very strong in terms of looking at the mosques, you know, which a lot of people say, 'Oh, we don't want to do that. We don't want to do that.' We're beyond that."" The other came in the interview we cited earlier with John Dickerson on June 19, 2016. Dickerson asked, ""And you said you would check respectfully the mosques. How do you respectfully check a mosque?"" ""Well, you do as they used to do in New York, prior to this mayor dismantling,"" Trump said. ""By the way, if you go to France right now, they're doing it in France. In fact, in some instances, they are closing down mosques. People don't want to talk about it. People aren't talking about it. But look at what they're doing in France. They are actually closing down mosques."" Then there was the statement from the campaign on ""preventing Muslim immigration,"" personally signed by Trump on Dec. 7, 2015. ""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,"" the statement said in part. We should note that we found one case in which Trump expressed caution about a kind of special security treatment for Muslims -- access to guns and ammunition. In the interview with CBS’ Dickerson, the host asked Trump, ""When you talk about political correctness, should a Muslim buying ammunition and weapons get extra scrutiny?"" Trump answered, ""I don't know about that."" The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump told O’Reilly that he ""never said"" Muslims would be subject to profiling under his policies. On two occasions -- including once earlier in the same O’Reilly interview -- a questioner asked him about his proposal to profile Muslims, and Trump did not object to that description. He has also repeatedly suggested other types of security policies that would specifically target Muslims, including mosque surveillance and an ban on Muslims entering the United States. The statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE0EF80>],/factchecks/2016/sep/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-never-called-profiling-muslim/

John McCain claims Democratic challenger walked out on constituents
","Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., won his Aug. 30 primary and has since shifted jabs to his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff, ahead of November’s general election. A recent political advertisement attempts to portray Kirkpatrick as dishonest -- noting that she mostly votes along party lines (a pro-McCain PAC made this same claim, we rated it Mostly True) -- and turned her back on the state. ""Kirkpatrick betrayed Arizona on Obamacare, walking out on constituents when questioned about it,"" the ad, which was published Sept. 6, says, showing Kirkpatrick walking out of an Aug. 6, 2009, meeting in Holbrook, Ariz. We wondered -- did Kirkpatrick really walk out on constituents who had questions about the Affordable Care Act? The event in question was pegged as one of several ""Chats with Ann."" A press release before the event notes that these chats, held at Safeway grocery stores, were meant for people who wanted to ""discuss their concerns and issues."" McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero pointed out that Kirkpatrick said in a subsequent interview with the White Mountain Independent that the chat was to give folks a chance to talk about ""health insurance reform and getting our economy back on track."" But why did Kirkpatrick walk out? Politico reported that the event was overrun by protesters, noting that conservative interest groups had organized opposition to similar events across the country. Conservatives for Patients’ Rights, an anti-health care reform group, did have the Kirkpatrick’s event listed on their website. The same White Mountain Independent article also notes people were upset because ""she wasn’t addressing the crowd as a whole."" ""Ann was trying to answer questions, and was shouted down,"" Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell said. We were unable to find a full video from the 2009 chat, but an extended clip does appear to show several people shouting. Other members of Congress faced similar disruptions across the country in August 2009. NPR reported that some congressional town halls ended in ""fistfights, arrests, and even hospitalizations."" The ad fails to mention that Kirkpatrick went back to Holbrook for a town hall meeting on health care a month later. ""I think a key component is competitiveness and choice, but I also think we need to take personal responsibility for our health,"" Kirkpatrick said during the town hall.   From The Associated Press: ""Kirkpatrick returned to Holbrook weeks after she walked out of a one-on-one ‘Chat with Ann’ event at a local grocery store. Protesters had urged her to make it more of a public forum and called her a ‘nitwit’ as she left."" Our ruling The ad claims, ""Kirkpatrick betrayed Arizona on Obamacare, walking out on constituents when questioned about it."" While Kirkpatrick did walk out of the Holbrook grocery store, the ad fails to mention the protesters -- and that she returned for a health care town hall a month later.   On balance, we rate the ad’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01289094-4b0e-48d1-a2a4-2c778cdee694",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE0E040>],/factchecks/2016/sep/21/john-mccain/john-mccain-claims-democratic-challenger-walked-ou/
"['Pennsylvania', 'John Taylor']","
The surprising truth about a Philly Republican’s Harrisburg muscles
","State representative John Taylor is the rarest of Philadelphia’s elected officials: He’s a Republican. More than that, he’s a Republican liked by the unions, a Republican liked by Mayor Jim Kenney.   Taylor told City & State PA last week he’s done something that makes him stand out even more among Philadelphia’s politicians: ""In Harrisburg, I passed more bills than all the Democrats combined, in terms of legislation affecting the city."" We’re talking about one representative versus 23 Democratic representatives. Could he really have passed more bills than all of them combined? First, we asked Taylor what time frame he was referring to. He said he meant this two-year term, from 2015 to present, given the article in which he was quoted focused on his bid for re-election against Democrat Joe Hohenstein. To test Taylor’s statement, we turned to the Legislature’s website, which tracks every bill sponsored by members of the state House and Senate. And it turns out Taylor is dead on. This term he’s been the primary sponsor of five bills that have passed into law, four of which have at least some relevance to Philadelphia. All 23 Philly Democrat representatives have been the primary sponsor of a combined two bills that have passed into law.   The only two Democrats to sponsor bills that passed are Kevin Boyle and Bill Keller. Keller’s bill was about renaming portions of highways and streets in the area. Boyle’s had to do with emergency vehicles. Democrats Ed Neilson, Dwight Evans and Lynwood Savage haven’t even been a prime sponsor for a bill, period.   ""I don’t how far back that statistic would hold up,"" Taylor said of his passing more bills than the Democrats, ""but it is certainly true for this term. And frankly it would be true for the next term."" With that reference to the future, Taylor refers to the likelihood that Republicans will continue to hold power in the Senate and House. He said Republican leadership, which dominates the various committees, tends to emphasize their members ahead of the other party, meaning Republican-sponsored bills have a better chance of passing than Democrat-sponsored bills.    ""I was in the minority for 10 years,"" Taylor said. ""You could come up with the cure for cancer and it would get put aside or it would come out with the Democratic name on it."" Taylor said he attends most Philadelphia Delegation meetings and describes he and the Democrats from here as ""kind of one big, happy family."" And as one of three Republicans representing Philadelphia (Martina White is the other; Thomas Murt has a slice of Philly in addition to Montgomery County), he said he’s in the best position to act as a voice for the city. ""For us to make things happen in a Republican-dominated body,"" Taylor said, ""we need that."" Our ruling In an article about Republican state Rep. John Taylor’s bid for re-election against Democrat Joe Hohenstein, Taylor emphasized the need for Philadelphia to have a prominent Republican by saying, ""In Harrisburg, I passed more bills than all the Democrats combined, in terms of legislation affecting the city."" According to the Legislature’s website, Taylor has been the prime sponsor of five bills that have passed this term. The 23 Philly Democrats have been prime sponsors of two bills that have passed. We rule the claim True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB959C0>],/factchecks/2016/sep/21/john-taylor/surprising-truth-about-philly-republicans-harrisbu/
