Palumbo says R.I. gives undocumented pregnant women free health insurance and hundreds of dollars for food and other expenses
","
On the hot-button issue of immigration, there are few figures as outspoken about Rhode Island's policies as state Rep. Peter Palumbo, a Democrat from Cranston.

Two years ago, Palumbo released a set of figures he compiled estimating what undocumented immigrants cost the state each year, how many murders they commit and the strain they put on our health care system. The report was never substantiated, but Palumbo continues to cite these and other similar  figures.

Palumbo and Republican state Rep. Joseph Trillo, of Warwick -- who also supports stricter enforcement of immigration laws -- went to Arizona earlier this month to see for themselves the problems that the state is having with illegal immigration.  While there, they appeared together on Fox News' ""On the Record With Greta Van Susteren"" to discuss Rhode Island immigration policy.

Criticizing the state's social service programs, Palumbo said: ""We have something called the anchor embryos. We have such liberal programs where we take care of you. If you're an illegal woman you get to Rhode Island, you go to the Department of Human Services, they give you either Neighborhood Health [Plan], United[Health] or Blue Cross. They give you a card with $400 a month on it and allow you to spend it on anything but food because, sit tight, we're going to give you another $250 a month or $275 a month to spend on food.""

We asked Palumbo about his source for such exact dollar figures. He said he got each piece of information from Gary Alexander, the head of Rhode Island's Office of Health and Human Services, in a lengthy conversation they had about two years ago when Palumbo first became interested in the issue.

Alexander told us he recalls briefly discussing the topic of benefits for undocumented pregnant women with Palumbo at some point, but he said he never cited any of the specific figures that Palumbo lists, nor would he, because they're just not accurate.

 ""I don't even know how he would get totals like $400 or $250,"" Alexander said.

Health care policy for undocumented pregnant women
So what do state and federal policies say about benefits for pregnant women who are in Rhode Island illegally? 
First, they are eligible for health insurance under RIte Care, the state's health insurance program for low-income families, according to state officials.

And federal law dictates that they must be given a choice between providers, Alexander said. Until just a few weeks ago, those choices included Neighborhood Health Plan, UnitedHealthCare, or Blue Cross & Blue Shield. In August, Blue Cross announced it would no longer participate in the program.

Women who are pregnant are not required to declare their immigration status when enrolling in RIte Care, assuming they meet the income eligibility requirements.

The way Alexander and federal officials explain it, the rationale is this: because the child will be born in the United States, he or she will be an American citizen and therefore eligible for health benefits. Prenatal care is considered an extension of those benefits.

""It's not based on the mother, it's based on the child who will soon be a citizen. If we don't give [the mother] prenatal care, something could happen to the child,"" leading to even greater costs for the state, said Alexander, who was appointed by Governor Donald Carcieri, a Republican.

Even if the DHS did not offer health benefits, state law would still require hospitals to provide emergency care to anyone, Alexander added. The mother's health benefits end three months after delivery.

Palumbo is therefore correct on what he says about free health care.

Cash assistance policy
Next Palumbo says undocumented pregnant women get ""a card with $400 a month on it"" that they are ""allow[ed] to spend [on] anything but food.""

Sounds a bit like a state gift certificate to us, but Palumbo says he was referring to cash assistance welfare benefits. Again, he said Alexander told him that every undocumented pregnant woman who seeks state help gets $400 a month.

Not so, said the DHS secretary, who said he couldn't imagine where Palumbo could  have gotten such specific figures. Pregnant women who are in Rhode Island illegally are not eligible for welfare benefits and even if they were, how much they get would depend on their income, said OHHS Associate Director David Burnett.

Under the Bush-administration's Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, anyone seeking cash benefits or other federal assistance must provide identifying documentation proving their legal status, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

It's important to note that, as with healthcare benefits, once the child is born, as a citizen, he or she will be eligible for welfare benefits, which would presumably be delivered to the mother on behalf of the child. But the mother herself does not qualify for any subsidy. So Palumbo is incorrect to say pregnant women get welfare benefits.

Food stamps policy
The same is true for the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, more commonly known as the food stamp program.  Despite the figures Palumbo cites, undocumented pregnant women are not eligible for ""$250 a month or $275 a month,"" or any other amount.

Under the federal Deficit Reduction Act, without proof of citizenship, they can't receive the benefit. Once born, their children will qualify to enroll in the SNAP program. According to the University of Rhode Island's Feinstein Center for a Hunger Free America, the maximum is $200 a month per qualifying member. But the subsidy will not cover the mother.

Again, Palumbo is wrong.

Finally, there is a clear implication in Palumbo's statement that Rhode Island's benefits are more generous than those in other states. At one point in the Van Susteren interview, Palumbo suggested that undocumented pregnant women from elsewhere are ""headed to our state"" to take advantage of these programs.

Federal law now dictates that undocumented people -- pregnant or otherwise -- are not eligible for either welfare assistance or food stamps here, or anywhere.

By the same token, undocumented pregnant women in Rhode Island are eligible to receive health care benefits, but that is also true in some other states. While federal law won't cover undocumented people, in general, it gives states the option to use federal CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) to cover prenatal benefits.

To imply that Rhode Island is the only state where this is the case is not correct.

In all, two of the three facts Palumbo offered to Van Susteren were wrong. Worse, he cited as his source an official -- Gary Alexander -- who said he never said any of those specifics, in part because they are not true.

Palumbo used very exact numbers on national television and he stated them with the kind of confidence that could lead viewers to believe he had done his homework and knew what he was talking about.

He didn't and he doesn't, at least in two of three counts. We'll give him a Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C59EC0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/19/peter-palumbo/palumbo-says-ri-gives-undocumented-pregnant-women-/

Russ Feingold says opponent Ron Johnson’s business benefited from a government loan
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson is a big-time skeptic when it comes to government ""picking winners and losers"" through subsidies and aid programs.

So when WKOW-TV in Madison reported Johnson’s manufacturing company, Pacur Inc., benefited from government loans and a federal grant, it was a natural line of attack for Democrats.

Partisans love the smell of hypocrisy in the morning.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, locked in a tough battle with Johnson, quickly launched a TV ad that portrays Johnson as a hypocrite on the issue.

The ad splices together bits of TV news reports and newspaper headlines, which use a variety of terminology -- ""government loan,"" ""special aid,"" ""government aid,"" and ""federal grant"" -- to describe the support Pacur received to add on to its plant and hire more workers.  

Creating more confusion, the ad twice shows Johnson telling an interviewer:  ""I have never lobbied for some special treatment or for a government -- government payment."" As the ad winds down, it uses clip of a WKOW reporter saying: ""Ron Johnson loves to say that government doesn’t create jobs, but in the case of his own business that doesn’t seem to be true.""

There are no words spoken by Feingold or a narrator other than the boilerplate at the end, where Feingold approves the message.

There is no question the ad is misleading in its presentation.

WKOW officials asked Feingold to take down the spot because it could be confused with a newscast and took statements out of context. The Feingold campaign refused.

For instance, the ad creates the false impression Johnson is responding directly to revelations that his business got government help. The question he was answering was whether a Milwaukee-area company deserved tax credits touted by President Obama.

But there is an important point about the ad to be settled here beyond its insinuation of hypocrisy. That question is whether Johnson in fact received government aid or subsidies. It’s a point Johnson disputes and in this item we will confine our review to that.

So what did Pacur Inc. get, and who did the company get it from?

No one disputes the transactions at the heart of the ad.

In 1979, a company that months later would morph into Pacur got a $75,000 federal grant to build a rail line to the new plant. Johnson says he was not part of the company when the grant was approved, but helped get the firm off the ground months later.

And in 1983 and 1985, Pacur received a total of $4 million in low-interest loans through a government program that offers help to businesses in the form of industrial revenue bonds. The savings from reduced-rate loans of that size would save the borrower hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to the state Department of Commerce.

Feingold’s senior campaign strategist John Kraus said the ad used a media report calling the  aid ""government loans"" because the program is run by the government.

It is true government administers the program: Both the City of Oshkosh and the state Department of Commerce had to decide if Pacur qualified for the loan and to sign off on how the loan would be used.  And government issues the bonds.

Each year, about 23 manufacturing firms get a loan, Commerce Department records from 2000 to the present show. During that time, some firms failed to qualify, or when money was tight in 2000, were rated too low to merit a loan, according to Zach Brandon, deputy secretary of the department.

Johnson acknowledges the government’s role and benefits to his company. But he says it’s misleading to call what Pacur received ""government loans"" because the money ultimately comes from private funds -- not the government -- and the local municipality is not on the hook if the company were to default.

We turned to two outside experts, who agreed on the use of private funds and that taxpayers are not at risk.

""A loan is an actual transfer of funds,"" said Adrian Moore, an economist and vice president of research at the Reason Foundation, a Los Angeles-based libertarian think tank. ""Nobody took taxpayer funds and gave it to this guy.""

Moore, who has studied industrial revenue bonds extensively, says: ""Essentially the government is loaning the industrial project its credit rating, not its money.""

But Moore and Verlane Endorf, an attorney and partner in the public finance group in the Minneapolis law firm of Dorsey & Whitney, said government nevertheless clearly subsidizes the program.

That is, there is an interest rate subsidy, with a resulting loss of tax revenue to the federal treasury under the structure. Banks can offer the loans to companies at lower rates because of the federal role, Endorf said.

""Government-subsidized loan is the right way to say it,"" Moore said.

Federal reports by the Congressional Budget Office refer to industrial revenue bonds as a subsidy program. Over the years, the approach has faced criticism from the right (interference in free markets) and left (corporate welfare).

The $75,000 grant is a bit easier to sort out.

It came from the federal government and did not have to be repaid. 
But the March 1979 grant did not go to Pacur, rather to Pacur’s predecessor firm, Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies, Inc. WISS changed its focus and name to Pacur Inc. in late August 1979, five months after the grant approval. It’s unclear when Johnson went to work for Pacur, but it was some time after mid-July 1979, based on pay stubs that show he was still working in Minnesota at that point. 
Johnson, who says he worked as Pacur’s accountant and co-founder, says he knew nothing of the grant to WISS. Both companies were headed by Pat Curler, Johnson’s brother-in-law and his initial boss at Pacur.

Johnson is now the owner of the company.

Let’s review the evidence.

When it comes to describing Johnson’s company as getting ""government aid,"" the Feingold ad is correct.  Independent experts and the federal government itself label the industrial revenue bonds a government subsidy. So the message about Pacur getting government help is on target. But a prominent reference in the ad’s mish-mash of wording -- ""government loan"" -- is off. It may be from the mouth of a TV reporter, but the Feingold campaign chose it and is responsible for its use.

The $75,000 grant is clearly government aid. And the rail line it helped create clearly has helped Pacur from its earliest days. But the grant apparently predated Johnson’s arrival in Oshkosh, and there is no evidence so far -- if more comes to light, we may revisit this ruling -- that Johnson was involved in it. Using Johnson’s out-of-context soundbite, as if he is responding to this point, makes the ad even more misleading.

We rate the statement about government aid Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809700C440>],/factchecks/2010/sep/18/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-opponent-ron-johnsons-business-/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
Allen West says Ron Klein repeatedly voted for amnesty
","Perhaps one of the few points Democratic U.S. Rep. Ron Klein and his Republican opponent Allen West agree on is that they disagree on a long list of policy issues.

On his campaign website the morning of Sept. 16, 2010, West compared his views on several topics with Klein including immigration and the border.

West wrote that he ""supports the rights of states to secure their border, such as in Arizona. Protecting US citizens must come first."" For Klein he wrote: ""Repeatedly voted in favor of amnesty for illegal immigrants, even as violence on our southern border is increasing rapidly.""

In this Truth-O-Meter item, we will explore whether Klein repeatedly voted in favor of amnesty for illegal immigrants. Illegal immigration has become a hot topic nationwide including in Congressional District 22, which spans parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties in South Florida.

First, some background on amnesty.

It was Republican President Ronald Reagan who ""did the A-word,"" as PolitiFact stated in a 2008 ruling about Rudy Giuliani's claim about Reagan and amnesty.

Here is what PolitiFact wrote then:

""In 1986, Reagan signed an immigration reform bill, the first in 20 years, that legalized the status for 1.7 million people. Some defenders of the law dispute the term 'amnesty.'

But here's how Edwin Meese, Reagan's former attorney general, characterizes what his boss did: 'President Reagan called this what it was: amnesty. Indeed, look up the term 'amnesty' in Black's Law Dictionary, and you'll find it says, 'the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty for undocumented aliens already in the country.' ""

Various other recent bills have been linked to the idea of amnesty.

Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain made waves when he teamed up with Democrat Edward Kennedy on a bill during the 2005-06 session that PolitiFact wrote ""would have granted legal status to most of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the country, as well as toughen border security and require employers to verify the legal status of workers."" But that never made it into law, and was introduced before Klein was sworn into office in January 2007.

McCain was also one of the co-sponsors of the DREAM Act in 2007 that would have let Homeland Security give legal resident status to some illegal residents who were students, according to the New York Times 2008 election guide. Klein was not one of the 86 co-sponsors on a related House bill that never made it to a vote. Opponents denounced that effort as amnesty.

The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S.1348) sponsored in May 2007 by Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, stalled in the Senate and was not voted on in the House.

Getting back to West's claim, what did Klein vote on? First we reached out to West campaign manager Josh Grodin in the morning Sept. 16 to ask for his evidence. Grodin said the campaign would respond.

While we were waiting for Grodin, we did a Nexis search for Klein and ""amnesty"" in the past five years.

When Klein ran against Republican Congressman Clay Shaw in 2006, the Miami Herald wrote on Aug. 18, 2006, ""Klein does not support amnesty or a guest worker program, for example."" Klein won that race.

When West ran against Klein the first time in 2008, West made a similar claim about amnesty. Shortly before election day, West released a TV ad that criticized ""Klein for raising taxes, giving amnesty to illegal immigrants and taking millions from special interests,"" according to an Oct. 29, 2008, Broward Politics blog in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Klein campaign spokeswoman Melissa Silverman was quoted as saying ""This ad contains blatant falsehoods about Congressman Klein's long record of public service, and lacks any documentation or backup to support its claims. Among other outrageous claims, it includes the charge that Congressman Klein supports so-called 'amnesty' for illegal immigrants, which he has consistently and strongly opposed."" The blog does not explain in detail what West was referring to; the blog's link to the ad was no longer active and we could not find the ad on YouTube.

In our Nexis search, we found no reference to Klein voting for a bill that included amnesty.

Klein's campaign told us that in August, Klein voted for H.R. 6080, which provided emergency supplemental appropriations for border security including, according to the U.S. Library of Congress website, paying for salaries, training and expenses and ""construction of up to two Border Patrol forward operating bases along the Southwest Border."" The Library of Congress website shows that passed on a voice vote.

Grodin got back to us in the evening of Sept. 16 and he told us that the West campaign had made an error.

""We made a little bit of a mistake and we corrected it,'' he said. ""We changed it on the website. Obviously there haven't been any amnesty bills voted on this session. .... For the record the campaign made a little bit of a mistake and we corrected. It's nothing like flat-out lying on a TV commercial.""

Here is the new claim by West on his website about immigration and the border: ""Ron Klein received a 'C' from Numbers USA, which grades Congress on their positions on immigration. Klein has not publicly supported Arizona's Immigration Bill."" Note there is no longer any mention of ""amnesty.""

We pointed out to Grodin that West's amnesty claim about Klein wasn't new -- he made it in an October 2008 ad. But Grodin said he did not work on that campaign and wasn't familiar with that ad.

We asked Silverman to comment about West's amnesty claim:

""Congressman Klein's position has been consistent and clear: this is a nation of laws, and immigration laws that are on the books have to be fully enforced. For Allen West to accuse Congressman Klein of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants is nothing more than an outright lie."" Our conclusion here is crystal clear: West's campaign admits that it wrongly characterized Klein's views on amnesty, and it had done so in the 2008 campaign as well. Illegal immigration is a hot-button emotional topic. We give the West campaign credit for changing the website on the same day we asked questions, but the claim about amnesty was flat-out wrong. We rate this Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A1E00>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/allen-west/Allen-West-Ron-Klein-repeatedly-voted-amnesty/

Bill Maher says that some natural gas pipes are made of wood
","When a natural gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno, Calif., on Sept. 9, 2010, killing four and destroying almost 40 houses, officials asked many questions, most important, how did it happen and how could it have been prevented. But in a Sept. 14 interview on CNN's Larry King Live, comedian and social commentator Bill Maher brought up an issue we would have never thought to raise. ""That fireball ticks me off, because we spent $787 billion dollars on a stimulus program when Obama got into office,"" Maher said. ""Now, why couldn't he have said, 'Look, there's a lot of people out of work in this country, and our infrastructure is crumbling and needs repair. Let's just take all that money and put those two thoughts together. Let's have those people who are out of work repair the infrastructure.' Right? What happened to all that money? Why didn't they fix that? An entire town blew up. Do you know that we have pipes carrying natural gas in this country that are made of wood? I'm not joking."" Are there really wood pipes for natural gas in use today? We decided to check. First, some background on the main types of piping used to carry natural gas. ""Transmission lines"" carry gas for long distances, such as from the point of extraction to a regional distribution center. Once the gas arrives at such a facility, it is fed to homes and businesses through narrower branches called ""distribution lines."" Different types of materials may be better for one type of pipeline than another, depending on such factors as the diameter and pressure of the pipe, the nature of the local terrain and the cost and difficulty of installation. In the early 20th century, wrought or cast iron prevailed in many contexts, but in the 1950s, steel replaced it for many uses. Since the 1980s, engineers have increasingly turned to cheaper, non-corroding plastic pipe where feasible. According to the American Gas Association, plastic now accounts for almost 51 percent of the pipe used in the U.S., while various types of steel account for 46 percent and cast or wrought iron account for about 3 percent. So what about wood? Well, it did have a place in the history of natural gas distribution. According to the website petroleumhistory.org, ""wood pipe was used at a very early date in the natural gas industry. In 1821, gas from an excavated gas spring on Canadaway Creek in Fredonia, N.Y., was conveyed in a wood pipe to a nearby user. ... In 1823, gas found bubbling up through joints in the organic shale cropping out along the south shore in Lake Erie was captured and piped to the Barcelona Harbor lighthouse through pine logs. ... There were other early gas occurrences in the Appalachian basin that were utilized by piping through wood pipes."" The author of that post, a late petroleum geologist and historian named Samuel T. Pees, recalled attending a 1972 auction of merchandise from a hardware store near the northwestern Pennsylvania oil fields -- the nation's earliest hub of oil extraction dating from the 1850s. ""A large number of square joints of wooden pipe (the round hole was drilled in the center) were among the items sold,"" Pees wrote. ""These had probably been on the shelf for many years."" So the heyday of wood pipelines -- if there ever was one -- came more than a century ago. They are never installed today, and only rarely are old sections unearthed. When it happens, it's by accident. Officials from both the Association of Oil Pipelines (which represents the petroleum pipeline industry) and the American Gas Association (which represents natural gas companies) said that, on occasion, routine maintenance digs sometimes unearth old sections of wooden pipe. Typically, the wooden pipe that is found is no longer used and simply lies next to active lines made of more modern materials. There's one relatively recent instance we could locate in which an active wood pipeline was found. That occurred in Pennsylvania (though, oddly, it wasn't in the western part of the state, where the oil boom took place in the 1800s, but rather in the Philadelphia area). The pipe was uncovered about a decade ago, encased in clay and incorrectly marked in utility records, said Jennifer Kocher, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, a state regulatory agency. We suspect that this episode is the source of Maher's claim. A Sept. 14, 2010, Associated Press story written in the wake of the San Bruno disaster, said that ""a few places in Pennsylvania still had wooden gas pipes as of last year, according to officials there."" But that line is in dispute. Kocher, the spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, told PolitiFact that she was interviewed a year ago by an AP reporter but that the article didn't quote her accurately. Kocher said she told the reporter the story of the wooden pipe discovered 10 years ago, but she also emphasized that no wooden pipe has been found since and that none is believed to be in use today. The oldest pipe in use in the state is 120 years old, Kocher said, but it's made of metal, not wood. A spokesman for the AP responded, saying, ""The AP’s reporting accurately reflects what we were told by Ms. Kocher last year and we have received no evidence from the state to counter that admission."" In a subsequent e-mail, the spokesman elaborated that Kocher had told the AP that Pennsylvania had about 13,000 miles of cast-iron and steel natural gas pipes, and ""even a smidgen of wooden pipe.'' For the purposes of our ruling, it matters less what Kocher said last year to the AP than what she told us today -- namely, that there is no known wooden pipe being used in Pennsylvania. That conclusion was seconded by Terry Fitzpatrick, president of the Energy Association of Pennsylvania, which represents electric and natural gas utilities. The group's member companies believe there is none, he said, and to the extent the group focuses on upgrading materials, it looks at replacing unprotected metal pipes with plastic. ""There isn't even a discussion of wooden pipe,"" Fitzpatrick said. Rick Kessler, vice president of the Pipeline Safety Trust, an independent advocacy group formed after a deadly 1999 pipeline explosion, told PolitiFact that his group has not been able to verify that there are wood pipes in use today. Kessler said it verges on being an urban myth. We tried to contact Maher through his network, HBO, but did not receive a response. Our best guess is that Maher or an assistant read the AP report, which was available for at least several hours before the live taping of the Larry King interview. However, our reporting suggests reasons to be skeptical of the claim that wood natural gas pipes are still in use today. A state regulatory agency and several national industry officials told us they were unaware of any functioning wooden pipe anywhere. It's almost inconceivable that any gas company would have installed them in the last century, and any wooden pipe that was still working today would have had to remain unnoticed, in good working condition and never replaced through many decades since. Does this establish conclusively that there is no wooden pipe currently in use? No -- it's impossible to prove that without exposing every inch of the 2 million-plus miles of natural gas pipe in the country. We also can see why Maher would have trusted an AP report (if that's what he did) since we, too, tend to give the AP a high degree of credibility. Still, if you eliminate the AP's claim of existing wood pipe, since Kocher now disputes it, we see no evidence that wood pipe is currently being used. And since the burden of proof for the Truth-o-Meter falls on the speaker, we rate Maher's claim False. CORRECTION: The initial version of this story stated incorrectly that the co-author of the Sept. 14, 2010, AP story, Garance Burke, had been the AP reporter who spoke to Kocher the previous year. In fact, the reporter for the 2009 AP story was Jennifer Peltz.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D661C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-some-natural-gas-pipes-are-made-wo/

Ad from Sen. Barbara Boxer attacks Carly Fiorina for layoffs at HP
","In a race to represent California in the U.S. Senate, Republican Carly Fiorina has emphasized her ""real-world"" business experience as chief executive officer of one of the world's largest tech companies. But Fiorina's controversial six-year tenure as CEO of computer-maker Hewlett Packard has also been used by Democrats to attack her.

The latest attack ad from Sen. Barbara Boxer picks up on a thread introduced in the primary -- accusing Fiorina of laying off tens of thousands of workers at HP, shipping jobs overseas and all the while padding her own bank account and toy box.

Here's what the announcer in the Democratic incumbent's ad says: ""As CEO of HP, Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers. Fiorina shipped jobs to China.

""And while Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets ... Carly Fiorina. Outsourcing jobs. Out for herself.""

Fiorina was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard in July 1999, the first woman to lead a Fortune 100 company. She reorganized the company's structure and pushed for a controversial 2002 merger with Compaq Computer Corp., in an attempt to get a greater share of the personal computer market. The merger succeeded, but HP's board fired her anyway in February 2005 (with a $21 million severance package), primarily due to the company's sluggish stock price and missed earnings targets.

Fiorina has numerous detractors, but she also has defenders of her time at HP. In fact, the Fiorina campaign set up the ""Hewlett-Packard and Carly"" website, where a number of former HP employees and executives tout her tenure as HP's CEO.

But the issue for us is the Boxer ad's claim that Fiorina layed off 30,000 workers and shipped jobs to China.

That HP laid off about 30,000 workers while Fiorina was CEO is largely undisputed. The larger context very much is.

In an interview with InformationWeek on Oct. 16, 2006, Fiorina talked about the merger with Compaq. ""When we combined the R&D budgets of HP and Compaq, we didn't have to have two R&D teams working on industry standard servers, for instance. We could have one. That's why the merger was such a great idea. We could decrease the cost structure by billions and billions of dollars. In the course of my time there, we laid off over 30,000 people. That's why I understand where the anger came from.""

And Fiorina has not been shy about acknowledging that many jobs were outsourced overseas. In January 2004, Fiorina provocatively told Congress, ""There is no job that is America's God-given right anymore.""

In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal the following month, Fiorina wrote that while ""attention has focused on a handful of companies, like HP, which have sourced some jobs to other countries"" the U.S. ""must focus on developing next-generation industries and next-generation talent"" rather than following Japan's attempt at ""protectionist proposals to limit or prohibit the practice.""

Moreover, Fiorina contends that over the entire course of her tenure at HP, the company created more jobs than it cut.

She explains this in an exchange with Chris Wallace in a Fox News interview on June 13, 2010.

""But, Ms. Fiorina, if the issue is jobs, Senator Boxer says your record is what you did as the head of Hewlett-Packard, ""Wallace said. ""And the record shows, according to her -- and it's not just her, the facts are that during that time you laid off more than 30,000 American workers, and many of those jobs went to India and China.""

""It is true, I managed Hewlett-Packard through the worst technology recession in 25 years,"" Fiorina said. ""And in those tough times, we had to make some tough calls.

""It is also true that, net-net, we created jobs,"" she said. ""We doubled the size of the company from $44 billion to $88 billion. We tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day. We quintupled the cash flow. We improved the profitability in every product segment and ...

""What about the 30,000 American jobs that...you laid off?"" Wallace asked.

""You know, every family and every business in California knows what it means to go through tough times,"" Fiorina said. ""And every family is cutting back, and every business is laying off right now. I don't say that with delight. I say that with sorrow. But yes, it is true that jobs are being taken out of California. By the way, China fights harder for our jobs than we do. Texas fights for our jobs. Nevada fights for our jobs. North Carolina fights for our jobs. We have to start fighting for our jobs in this nation and in our state.""

Let's take a look at that ""net-net"" claim. Or, as she told the Los Angeles Times in a May 20, 2010 story: ""We had more employees by the time I left HP than either pre-merger HP or pre-merger Compaq had, combined.""

Here's the math: According to SEC filings, HP had 84,400 employees worldwide in 2001, the year before the merger. In 2001, Compaq had 63,700 full-time employees. That comes to a total of 148,100 workers. In 2005, just after her departure, HP's worldwide workforce reached 150,000. Net gain?

In the Los Angeles Times story, reporter Robin Abcarian said that claim is dubious, because ""in that same period, HP bought more than a dozen other U.S. companies with at least 8,000 employees, according to company filings, press releases and news reports.""

Moreover, the proxy reports are for worldwide employment figures. They don't tell you how many American jobs were lost or gained.

In its response to the Boxer ad, the Fiorina campaign claims the only numbers that are relevant are the ones that show that in October 1999, HP had about 84,400 employees worldwide; and in October 2005, the company had 150,000 employees worldwide -- so that under Fiorina's leadership HP nearly doubled its number of employees worldwide.

It's not that simple. For one, there was the Compaq merger. Pre-merger, the companies had a combined workforce of 148,100.

It's clear that Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers as a result of the merger with Compaq, as she said in the interview with InformationWeek. And it's clear that by October 2005 the merged company employed more workers than the two separate companies had pre-merger (Fiorina had been forced out seven months earlier in February 2005). But some of those jobs may have resulted from acquisitions, and some may have been abroad. A company as large as HP is very dynamic, so it's possible that the initial layoffs resulted in a stronger company that contributed to job growth in the long run. That's good in the macro sense, but it doesn't cancel the fact that 30,000 workers lost their jobs. So we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4B65C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/barbara-boxer/ad-sen-barbara-boxer-attacks-carly-fiorina-layoffs/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Taxes', 'Sharron Angle']","
Sharron Angle calls Harry Reid ""the best friend an illegal alien ever had""
","
The relentlessly negative Senate race in Nevada that pits incumbent Democratic leader Harry Reid and Republican challenger Sharron Angle continued with Angle's release of a new ad on Sept. 14, 2010.

The ad targets Reid's record on illegal immigration, calling him ""the best friend an illegal alien ever had.""

In this item, we'll focus on the part where the narrator says, ""Harry Reid -- he votes to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens...."" We'll check whether Reid voted ""to give illegals Social Security"" in a separate item.

The ad itself doesn't list citations or other supporting evidence for the claim about tax breaks, but the Angle campaign provided us with a backup document after we asked for one. Here are the key pieces of evidence they cite, all of which are votes on amendments to bills.

1. A May 25, 2006, amendment by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., that was offered during the debate over an immigration reform bill that would have created a path to legal status for illegal immigrants. Sessions' amendment was designed to prohibit illegal immigrants, and illegal immigrants who would have secured legal status under the bill, from claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit. The EITC is a three-decade old provision of the tax code that encourages low-income Americans to work by giving them refundable tax credits when they earn money from being employed. It is available to taxpayers whose income falls below a certain threshold.

The amendment was defeated, with just 37 votes in favor. Reid voted against the amendment, along with 21 Republicans.

However, this amendment was not actually targeted directly at illegal aliens, as the ad suggests. It targeted two groups -- illegal immigrants (who were already barred by existing law from collecting the EITC) and former illegal aliens who would have been able to secure legal status under the bill (and thus would not have been illegal any more). 
This vote also carries with it a separate problem for Angle. It's not clear to us that the vote was about providing ""special tax breaks,"" as the ad termed it. To us, a ""special tax break"" implies a special status granted by the government. In reality, what the amendment said it would do is take away a right for which these taxpayers would have otherwise qualified -- creating a ""special tax penalty,"" if you will. You can disagree over the merits of the amendment, but we don't buy that Reid's vote against it amounted to supporting a ""special tax break.""

2. Another amendment offered on May 25, 2006 during the immigration debate, this one by Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev. This amendment was designed to bar illegal immigrants applying for legal status from receiving ""any tax refund for any taxable year prior to 2006, or to file any claim for the Earned Income Tax Credit, or any other tax credit otherwise allowable under the tax code.""

The amendment passed, 50-47, with Reid -- and 11 Republicans -- voting against it.

This amendment comes closer to the ad's claim of being aimed at illegal immigrants: It affected illegal immigrants who would have been able to apply for legal status had the bill passed, and who then might have eventually become legal.

But the amendment has the same problem of not really being a ""special tax break."" In addition, Vote 2 did something else entirely -- it prevented illegal immigrants applying for legal status from receiving a refund, which means they would be unable to get back from the IRS the money that they had overpaid as taxes.

3. An amendment offered during the following year's immigration debate by Reid himself. The June 6, 2007, amendment was intended to clarify that nothing in the immigration overhaul or its amendments would change the Internal Revenue Code's prohibition on illegal aliens qualifying for the Earned Income Tax Credit.

The amendment passed, 57-40, with Reid, and eight Republicans, voting for it.

This amendment seems to reiterate the existing prohibition on illegal immigrants earning the EITC, countering the Angle camp's claim rather than supporting it.

4. Finally, an amendment offered on June 6, 2007, by Sessions. The amendment would prohibit those who were granted ""Y"" visas under the bill's temporary guest worker program from claiming the EITC.

The amendment passed, 56-41, with Reid, along with six Republicans, voting against it.

This amendment was aimed at people who had been granted legal status as temporary work visa holders -- not illegals, so it doesn't seem very relevant to a discussion of votes that aided illegal aliens. (We should add that neither the 2006 nor 2007 immigration reform bills became law.)

So, how persuasive are these four examples of Reid voting ""to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens""? They didn't persuade us.

We'll agree that it's fair for Angle to paint Reid as something less than Draconian in his stance toward former illegal immigrants. However, we find little to support the charge that Reid voted to ""give special tax breaks to illegal aliens."" Most of the Angle camp's cited votes were actually aimed at people in the U.S. legally (even though they may formerly have been illegal), and in at least two cases, we disagree that what was being voted on represented a ""special tax break"" at all. The combination of these concerns lead us to rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973AC640>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-calls-harry-reid-best-friend-illegal/

Sharron Angle says Harry Reid wants to give illegals Social Security benefits
","
We’ve rated one claim in an ad by Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle as False. That was a claim that Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid voted ""go give special tax breaks to illegal aliens.""

The second charge in the ad is that Reid voted ""to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally.""

Until a change in the law in 2007, illegal immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number. As much as several billion dollars a year are typically collected from illegal immigrants by the Social Security system.

Reid voted twice to uphold this system.

During a Senate debate over immigration reform in 2006, Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number -- a provision that would mostly if not entirely affect illegal aliens. On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted on a motion to table -- that is, to stop consideration of -- the Ensign amendment. By a bare one-vote majority, the chamber voted to table the amendment. Reid's was one of the 50 votes in favor of tabling.

Then, on July 19, 2007, Ensign tried again, proposing a similar amendment to the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Under the rules in effect, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass but only got 57, so it failed. Reid was one of the senators who voted against the amendment.

So the fact that Reid voted ""no"" twice provides support for Angle's claim. But it isn't foolproof.

First, Reid also cast another vote on this issue that Angle's camp doesn't mention. On Oct. 23, 2007, during another immigration bill debate, Ensign offered a similar amendment. This time, the Senate passed it by an overwhelming 92-2 vote. Reid was one of 92 senators to support the amendment.

But that's not all. We also see problems with the ad's explanation of what was being voted on. For one thing, the vote wouldn't have given current illegals Social Security benefits, as the ad implies. Instead, Reid's votes affected the policy for former illegal aliens who were later made legal. For another, the vote was not about giving benefits but rather on whether to change the calculation process so that former illegals could get credit for money they had paid into the system years before, when they were illegal.

We consider these descriptions misleading, and in combination with the ad's decision to ignore Reid's contrary vote, we feel the this part of the statement deserves a rating of Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B4040>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-says-harry-reid-wants-give-illegals-/
"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'Ted Strickland']","
Strickland administration figures for one-time money used in state budget don't measure up
","
The fine print tucked among the hundreds of pages of Ohio’s state budget that details how state programs are paid for doesn’t normally make for a very hot political issue.

However, this is no ordinary state budget that is paying the bills in Ohio. The current budget relies heavily on federal stimulus money and other nest eggs.

Ohio is now relying on an unprecedented level of one-time money in its budget. Those sources include: 

  
Ohio’s Office of Budget and Management attempts to tackle this controversial subject on its website with an estimate of exactly how much one-time money is used. A chart there totals the one-time resources affecting the general revenue fund at $4,887,844,809 — we’ll call it $4.89 billion -- a numerical statement that we are attributing to Gov. Ted Strickland since the cabinet-level office ultimately answers to him.

That number is billions of dollars lower than estimates some other analysts have provided, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a closer look at the state’s accounting of one-time money.

One-time money is simply funding that won’t reoccur in the next budget cycle, and it’s being used to make ends meet in the $50.5 billion general revenue fund budget.

Think of it this way: If you find a $50 bill in the alley you might use it to pay your cell-phone bill this month. Next month you won’t have that $50 coming in to use on the bill, thus it’s one-time money to you.

Republican lawmakers seized on the heavy use of the one-time money during last year’s budget debate. They accused Gov. Ted Strickland of promoting an unsustainable budget that would steer Ohio off a budgetary cliff when the next state budget rolls around. This was a key argument for Republicans, as only six of 67 GOP lawmakers voted for Strickland’s budget in the House and Senate.

The implication is that the more one-time money used in the current state budget, the bigger the structural imbalance will be when that money isn’t there to prop things up next time. And next time is soon -- the next budget will be rolled out in the spring of 2011.

Strickland spokeswoman Amanda Wurst quickly put us in touch with David Ellis, the state’s assistant budget director, to explain the details on how his office compiled its one-time number.

Ellis said that the $4.89 billion figure only includes all of the one-time money contained in House Bill 1, the state’s primary budget document that passed in mid-July 2009. He said it doesn’t encompass any changes to the state’s budget made in subsequent pieces of legislation since the bill was signed into law more than 14 months ago.

However, since House Bill 1 was passed, as Ellis knows, the state has felt the impact of other spending-related provisions that have come into effect. The biggest change was the delay of an income tax cut worth $844 million contained in House Bill 318, but that delay is supposed to end after this budget.

Additionally, the OBM one-time list does not include an increase in the reimbursement rate for prescription drug coverage under Medicaid Part D, worth $152 million, that happened in Feb. 2010 long after the state budget was enacted; nor a raid on the state’s tobacco fund, worth $627 million, in combined state and federal funds still tied up in court.

Tally those figures and the state’s use of one-time money in the general revenue fund portion of the budget rises from $4.89 billion to $6.51 billion.  

Ellis said budget officials see no point in updating the one-time number. ""We’ve not felt compelled to update it at each turn of the page,"" Ellis said. ""It’s not been updated because it has no bearing on the day-to-day operations of the office or the day-to-day operations of the budget.""

Wurst, who serves double duty as the budget spokeswoman, noted that reporters who ask budget questions are told the one-time figure doesn’t include any changes made after mid-July 2009. ""We always make that clear to reporters, such as yourself, that the figure hasn’t been updated,"" she said.  

Wurst argues that the public isn’t being misled by the number because to get to the chart depicting the one-time money requires clicking on a previous tab titled ""budget highlights."" Therefore, she argues, it’s clear that the context of the one-time money is from within the state budget bill passed some 14 months ago.

What Wurst doesn’t mention is that the one-time money chart is the only place that such a figure appears anywhere on OBM’s website. And, of course, it wouldn’t require a major programming overhaul to more clearly label the chart so that the public realizes that the one-time figure only includes items passed in House Bill 1.

A second argument advanced by Ellis is that the $627 million related to the state’s raid on the tobacco fund shouldn’t be counted as one-time money because it remains tied up in court. The Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments on July 6 about whether the state should be allowed to use money from Ohio’s settlement with Big Tobacco on ""optional"" Medicaid services and human-service programs. A ruling has not yet been issued.  

""We absorbed those costs into our budget,"" Ellis said. ""We didn’t have the money to spend.""  

That’s true — to a degree. While money shifted from underspending in other Medicaid areas is plugging the hole made by the tobacco funds currently held up by the Supreme Court case, the Strickland administration still hopes the court will give it the green light to use those dollars. And even if you don’t count those funds, the budget office’s one-time number is still off by about $1 billion.  

So let’s go to the scorecard and add it up: 
Whether you count the $647 million in tobacco money tied up in court or not, it’s clear that the $4.89 billion one-time money figure is off by at least $1 billion. The fact that reporters are apprised immediately by Wurst that the figure is incomplete shows that the administration realizes that it isn’t an accurate representation of how much one-time money is used in the state budget.

That suggests to us that the Strickland administration knows that continuing to use the $4.89 billion one-time money figure on its website could mislead the public.

That’s why we rate the statement as False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CDBDC0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/ted-strickland/strickland-administration-figures-one-time-money-u/
"['Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says the stimulus didn't create a single private sector job
","
For Rick Scott, a Republican businessman running for governor, distinguishing himself from a Democratic competitor who also focuses on jobs is simple: He ties her to ""President Obama’s agenda.""

So at a Sept. 3, 2010, appearance before Tallahassee reporters, the Friday before Labor Day, he described how he differs from Alex Sink on job creation by mentioning Obamacare, the Bush tax cuts and the federal stimulus. When a reporter asked for specifics, he said:

""I think it's very simple. Higher taxes kill jobs. Regulations kill jobs. Obamacare is an unbelievable job killer. It's going to be devastating for our state. That by itself is going to make it very difficult for people to do business in our state. And the taxes, the increase in taxes for that is going to be devastating to our state.

""On top of that, my background is I put my money up. I took the risk. I stood up for what I believed in starting businesses. And that’s a whole different background than other people. But she clearly believes in higher taxes. She clearly believes in Obamacare. She clearly believes in the stimulus, and we know the stimulus has not created one private sector job.""

We'll set aside for now his various claims about taxes, regulation and health care to focus on his parting blow: ""The stimulus has not created one private sector job.""

He's treading dangerous ground. In February, PolitiFact looked at a similar statement by Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, that the stimulus bill ""didn't create one new job,"" and found it so ridiculous it earned a Pants on Fire ruling.

But Scott said ""one private sector job."" Does it help his case?

Since Scott's running to govern Florida, we'll focus on the stimulus' impact in his state, familiar ground. By stimulus, campaign spokesman Joe Kildea confirms, Scott means the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. That federal money comes in three broad categories, such as funds to federal agencies spent through grants and contracts, funds for benefits such as unemployment and Medicaid, and tax relief, according to Don Winstead, the state’s stimulus czar.

For funding in the first category, there's a federal reporting system. Those who get funds must report how much they spend, and how many jobs are created or saved. According to the latest figures on the federal Recovery.gov website — just roll your mouse over Florida — the number of full-time equivalent jobs created or saved in the state just for the April to June quarter is 40,604. That number represents 79,365 actual workers, a state summary says.

While the reports don’t break out private sector jobs from public ones, it’s clear some of the jobs — and in some cases, most — end up with private sector contractors, said Winstead, special adviser to Gov. Charlie Crist on the economic stimulus.  He produces the summary of Recovery Act information for the state. A table listing 2,951 full-time equivalent jobs created or saved under the U.S. Department of Transportation would largely represent private sector highway construction jobs, he said. On the other hand, the 27,815 listed under education would be largely public school employees. Public and private, the cumulative job impact for the state including tax relief is 167,000, his summary says. Meanwhile, a non-government analysis by data company Onvia at Recovery.org estimates the stimulus’ effect on jobs at 206,000.

That's certainly more than one! But wait ...

Scott campaign spokesman Kildea is quick to jump on such figures, pointing out that since the government tracks jobs ""created or saved,"" it's hard to say how many have been ""created,"" which is the word Scott used.  

Additionally, the Recovery.gov reporting has acknowledged flaws. A May report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office says that while data from recipients of stimulus money are improving, ""errors and reporting inconsistencies remain.""

So we examined a specific stimulus-funded program, Florida Back to Work. It's paid for with funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program -- established by the stimulus bill -- which may be spent on subsidized employment.

The program is operated by the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation, which administers other benefit programs and tracks the unemployment rate. It got its federal funding in March, and reimburses employers for most of the costs of a new employee through Sept. 30, 2010. As of Sept. 10, it had paid for jobs for 5,324 new employees. It has also worked with employers to create 4,053 positions posted at employflorida.com and open to job-seekers.

So, are any of those private-sector jobs?

A summary from the agency lists more than 1,000 Florida employers who've agreed to create jobs using the program. Some are public, such as the Department of Children and Families in Okaloosa County. Others are nonprofits, such as Goodwill Easter Seals of the Gulf Coast. And yes, there are plenty of private companies, for example, Riviera Beach pharmaceutical manufacturer Sancilio & Co.

Alex Sancilio, a principal in the Palm Beach County company and director of human resources, has used the Back to Work program to make 27 new hires and keep 15 full-time employees.  The company produces drugs and supplements, including children's vitamins and fish oil pills. She worked with the local workforce board to get resumes, and used the money to speed up hiring she might have otherwise spread out.

That's how she came to hire Billy Weston as an account executive. Weston, 48, was a car salesman who had been unemployed two months, which helped qualify him for the program. Sancilio says she wouldn't otherwise have invested in retraining someone who didn't have a pharmaceutical background.

""If we hadn't had the funding, we never would have given him the time to learn the skills,"" she said. ""We're very, very happy.""

So what does Scott's campaign have to say about Weston, a guy with a job in the private sector because of the stimulus?

""It's a ridiculous assertion that the stimulus has created jobs,"" Kildea said. ""That's exactly the reason Floridians are so upset with the direction of the economy. No matter what sort of intellectual gymnastics used by Obama liberals, the fact is that when the stimulus was first signed, Florida's unemployment rate was 9.2% and today it is 11.6% and the state lost a net of almost 200,000 jobs.""

So, because more jobs were lost overall than gained, that's the same as saying not one job has been created?

Not according to Rebecca Rust, senior economist for the Agency for Workforce Innovation. In fact, it's standard to talk about jobs gained, even when jobs lost may be greater.

""There's churning in the job market,"" she said. ""Employers are adding and cutting at the same time. … Just because we have a job loss, you can't say we haven't gained any stimulus jobs. What you could say is that the job losses could have been greater.""

Sean Snaith, a University Of Central Florida economist who has been critical of the effect of the stimulus, agrees that saying ""the stimulus has not created one private sector job"" is inaccurate.

""I think that's an exaggeration of the reality, which is that it didn't do very much for private sector hiring,"" he said. ""But surprise, surprise, in politics there's hyperbole sometimes.""

It's more than hyperbole to Billy Weston. Here’s his reaction to Scott’s statement:

""I disagree. I have to. Even though, you know, I'm a devout Republican, that's absolutely wrong,"" he said. ""I'm living proof that this helped out, tremendously. I couldn't agree with that statement whatsoever. I know, due to this program, I have a job at Sancilio & Co. That's the reality of it.""

Beyond Florida, there are examples Scott ought to be familiar with. Take telecommunications company XFone, which announced in March that it received $63 million in federal stimulus money. Scott owns about 15 percent of the company, campaign spokesman Chad Colby said. On Sept. 13, 2010, a Louisiana subsidiary, Pride Network Inc., got approval for $36 million in additional stimulus funding — money it estimates will create 1,300 jobs.

Colby says Scott’s a minority investor, doesn’t sit on the board, and doesn't control any operations of the company. ""His position on stimulus hasn't changed,"" Colby said. ""If the argument is that the stimulus is the only way to create jobs, it's false.""

But that isn’t Scott’s statement. In the face of Billy Weston and now 1,300 jobs at a company Scott partly owns, his campaign still hasn’t moved from its stance that ""the stimulus has not created one private sector job.""  He may disagree that the stimulus is the most effective use of funds, or argue as Snaith does that ""it didn't do very much."" But those aren’t the words he chose.

With thousands of Floridians employed because of stimulus-funded programs — not to mention jobs for a company in which Scott owns stock — we rate his statement Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4988C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-stimulus-create-single-private-job/

Jerry Brown raised taxes? Not overall
","The California governor's race between Republican Meg Whitman and Democrat Jerry Brown has turned into a political retrospective of the '70s, '80s and '90s, with a special guest appearance from Bill Clinton.

Our story begins with an ad from the Whitman campaign and goes on to check a claim in a campaign ad by Brown.

""Jerry Brown's good old days -- but what really happened?"" asks a narrator in the Whitman ad.

Cut to Clinton himself in his 1992 prime. ""CNN -- not me, CNN -- says his assertion about his tax record was quote, just plain wrong. Jerry Brown went out there and took credit for the fact that the people of California voted for Proposition 13, which lowered taxes, which he opposed. And now he's going around and taking credit for it. He raised taxes as governor of California. He had a surplus when he took office and a deficit when he left. He doesn't tell the people the truth.""

Clinton's words were from the 1992 Democratic primary for president, when Brown and Clinton ran against each other and regularly traded barbs. Today, of course, Clinton is the former president considered to be one of the best at getting the Democratic base to turn out in elections.

Brown responded to the new ad with the old footage at a meeting with his supporters on a Sunday just days after the ad ran. Either the ad touched a nerve or maybe Brown didn't know there was a camera in the room, but he lashed out -- not at the Whitman campaign, but at Clinton himself.

""I mean, Clinton's a nice guy, but who ever said he always told the truth?"" Brown said on Sept. 12, 2010. ""You remember, right? There's that whole story there about 'did he or didn't he.' ... I did not have taxes with this state, so let's be clear about that."" That's a not-so-subtle reference to Clinton's impeachment.

It's not clear that Brown knew he was being taped that Sunday. He apologized to Clinton on Monday, and Clinton endorsed Brown on Tuesday. In a statement, Clinton said the ad is misleading because the CNN report he cited was ""erroneous.""

""Moreover the tough campaign we fought 18 years ago is not relevant to the choice facing Californians today. Jerry and I put that behind us a long time ago,"" Clinton wrote. Brown defended his record on taxes again in his own ad.

His ad says, ""Wouldn't it be nice if every time Meg Whitman told a lie her nose would grow? Newspapers report that claims in this Meg Whitman ad are false, and she knows it. Taxes went down under Jerry Brown. But Whitman's nose keeps growing by the millions."" Here, we're checking Brown's statement that, ""Taxes went down under Jerry Brown."" We started by going back to Clinton's statements in the Whitman ad and then looking at the former governor's record. The metric that the CNN report used was a calculation put together by the California Department of Finance showing the tax burden per $100 of income. In 2010, for example, the tax burden was estimated at $6.48 per $100 of personal income. (See the historical chart here.)

Back in 1992, CNN's fact-check looked at the wrong years and reported that taxes went up. The most recent data shows that the tax burden went down. Factcheck.org's Brooks Jackson -- who worked for CNN back then -- explained the issue with the data in a post at the Factcheck.org website.

The budgets Jerry Brown oversaw were for fiscal years 1975 to 1982. The tax burden during that time started at $6.95, increased to a high of $7.74 in 1977, then declined to $6.56 in 1982.

There were no major laws passed increasing taxes during that time, so what made the collections rise and fall? We had a hard time finding consensus on this 20-year-old question. Property values were rising, which led to Proposition 13 in 1978, which lowered property taxes and made it harder to increase other taxes. But there's a dispute over whether Proposition 13 affected state tax revenues that much; some say that it curtailed local taxes, not state taxes. The reason for the state tax decline, according to this view, is that a poor economy depressed tax revenues.

We also wanted to check and see if Brown had signed any major new tax changes into law while he was governor. We looked through old news stories and found that Brown approved a two-cent per gallon gasoline tax for highways toward the end of his term. But he also approved a measure to index income tax brackets for inflation, a move that had the effect of reducing taxes for some. We also found news coverage of various business-related taxes; Brown signed measures that both increased and decreased taxes for some businesses.

In fact, Brown oversaw large state surpluses in his early years as governor, which happened without any new tax increases. Some people blame Brown for sitting on the surpluses, which allowed the tax revolt movement for Proposition 13 to gain steam. Brown opposed Proposition 13 before it passed, but after it did, he became an ardent defender. Los Angeles Times columnist George Skelton wrote about Brown's reversal in a column recently, reminding Californians that Brown called himself a ""born-again tax-cutter"" after the vote, and won the endorsement of Howard Jarvis, the proposition's chief backer.

In this year's race, Brown says there should be no tax increases without a vote.

We found that when Brown was governor, he signed an increase to gas taxes, a decrease to income taxes through indexing, and various increases and decreases for business. He had significant surpluses for the first part of his governorship and in all likelihood didn't need to raise taxes. The most significant evidence in favor of Brown's statement are the state numbers that show taxes per $100 of resident income. By that metric, taxes went up, and then down under Brown, and finished a little lower than when he started. Those numbers sway the meter in a positive direction. We rate the statement ""Taxes went down under Jerry Brown,"" as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACD0C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-raised-taxes-not-overall/

Republican Governors Association says Tom Barrett “voted for the largest tax increase in history”
","
In the battle for the Wisconsin statehouse, Republicans are working overtime to tar the Democrat who would be governor as ""Tom the Taxer."" It’s a common tactic on the campaign trail, and may be especially potent this year amid massive job losses and economic uncertainty.

In an ongoing series of TV ads set in a noisy sports bar, the Republican Governors Association blames Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett for business closings and hits him for raising taxes as mayor as well as in Congress.

In the first version of the ad, the bartender says:

""An ongoing argument around here is what makes Tom Barrett the all time worst ... more taxes or less jobs? Barrett has raised taxes every year he’s been mayor, and before that he voted for the largest tax increase in history ... raising taxes on gas and Social Security.""

Barrett was indeed a member of Congress in 1993, when lawmakers passed and President Bill Clinton signed a giant revenue bill. The measure squeaked by 218-216 in the House. It’s known as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

Barrett voted for the bill, part of a party-line vote in the Wisconsin delegation.

And, yes, the measure increased gas taxes 4.3 cents per gallon, and increased the taxable portion of Social Security benefits.

No dispute about any of that.

But was it really the largest tax increase in history?

We started with the Republican Governors Association, which produced the ad.

RGA spokesman Mike Schrimpf cited a New York Times story from 1996 that touched on tax increases while analyzing debates in the Clinton-Dole election. He told PolitiFact Wisconsin: ""According to the New York Times, ‘the 1993 measure was the largest tax increase in American history.’ ""

The Times story does say that, but the full sentence contains a key phrase ignored by Schrimpf and the RGA. Here’s the full sentence (italics added): ""So in actual dollars, the 1993 measure was the largest tax increase in American history.""

And here’s the next sentence: ""But adjusted for inflation, it was smaller than the one in 1982"" -- a measure signed by President Ronald Reagan.

The Times story took no position on the wisdom of comparing tax laws passed 11 years apart based on raw dollars unadjusted for inflation.

But we do.

As PolitiFact National has noted in previous items on similar statements on the size of tax increases, economists prefer calculating tax increases as share of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product. The GDP is the value of a country’s overall economic output of goods and services at market prices.

It’s common sense, experts say.

U.S. Treasury spokeswoman Sandra Salstrom notes the political discourse over taxes and spending very seldom mentions actual dollar figures.

""Why not? Because, even after accounting for inflation, federal spending has increased in almost every year,"" Salstrom told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""So almost every year the federal government sets a postwar high in spending.""

But each increase does not have the same effect, she noted. A tax change of $10 billion, for example, would affect taxpayers much more in 1970 than in 2009.

The federal government, in the widely cited Treasury Department study on more than six decades of tax increases, says that of several possible approaches, the GDP measure is probably the best is because it eliminates the effects of inflation, real economic growth and the size of total federal receipts.

That study compares major revenue bills from 1940 to 2006, measuring each tax bill’s predicted share of GDP after four years.

The clear winner:  the Revenue Act of 1942, one of several major tax bills enacted to pay for World War ll. It’s more than twice the size of the runner-up, a 1941 act.

The 1993 hike that Barrett backed and Clinton signed comes in as the ninth-biggest increase in the period, significantly below the 1982 act signed by Reagan, which ranked fifth.

Partisans have tussled for years over what constitutes the all-time biggest tax-boosting bill. And we expect that barroom arguments will persist.

But the evidence is clear: While Barrett voted for a big tax bill, it’s not the largest in American history, based on its actual share of economic output, which economists and the Treasury Department say is the most valid approach. The increase is evidently the largest in raw dollars, though, so the Republican Governor’s Association has at least one barstool leg to stand on. We rate the RGA’s claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C68C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-tom-barrett-/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Economy', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Texas', 'Bill Flores']","
Bill Flores says he created more than 500 U.S. jobs
","
In a bid to unseat nine-term U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, Republican Bill Flores touts his prowess in creating private-sector jobs. 
In a TV ad that started airing Aug. 26, the narrator says: Bill Flores. ""He's a businessman, not a politician. Bill helped build successful energy companies and created over 500 American jobs. Now Bill Flores is running for Congress."" 
Flores chimes in: ""Washington is out of control and it's time for Texans to stand up and stop them."" 
Edwards fired back in an ad that started airing a few days later. In it, the narrator says Flores helped run a company that laid off over 3,000 workers, a statement we rated False earlier this week. 
Now we're looking at whether Flores indeed created more than 500 U.S. jobs, as his ad says. 
As evidence, Flores provided us with a spreadsheet he created detailing changes in the workforce over the years at the five companies he helped steer as chief financial officer. Accounting for some job losses at the companies, Flores said he created 1,431 jobs from 1980 through 2009. First, we wondered why his ad doesn't boast about creating more than 1,400 jobs. Flores told us that he picked an estimate that was ""bulletproof accurate."" More than 500 jobs ""gets the point across,"" he said. 
Keyes Offshore, September 1980 - March 1990 
Flores told us that according to his notes, he created 356 jobs at Keyes before it was sold to Marine Drilling in 1990, where Flores was appointed CFO. We weren't able to independently confirm Keyes' payroll after searching news archives and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with which companies must file financial information. 
Marine Drilling, March 1990 - August 1997 
Flores said Marine Drilling had a net loss of 582 jobs during his tenure, which he attributed to a downturn in oil and gas prices in 1991 and 1992. 
""Marine Drilling was forced to execute significant financial and operational restructuring in order to survive,"" a note on his spreadsheet says. 
Flores said Marine Drilling had 1,495 employees when he started there in 1990. The SEC only has company filings available starting in 1994, so we weren't able to confirm that. 
By February 1994, the company had about 700 employees, and by March 1997, it had 800, according to its SEC filings. By March 1998, the company employed 942 people. Flores left Marine Drilling halfway between those two headcounts; he estimates it had 913 employees at that time. 
Western Atlas, August 1997 - August 1998 
This period proves key to Flores' overall claim because, by his count, Western Atlas gained 1,607 employees while he worked for the company. 
As of December 1996 — before Flores came on board — the company had approximately 14,000 full-time employees, including 8,900 in oil field services and 5,000 in industrial automated services, according to the company's SEC filing. Flores was in charge of the company's oil field services division, which became an independent company under the Western Atlas name in October 1997, he said. 
By December 1997, the company employed 10,600 people — an increase of about 1,700. 
The employee counts in the SEC filings don't jibe precisely with Flores' tenure because they were taken eight months after he joined and also eight months after he later left the company. Flores said his estimate of the company's job growth — about 100 jobs less than the SEC suggests — is supposed to account for that. Flores told us he accounted for about 105 Western Atlas jobs that were lost as a result of its merger with Baker Hughes Inc. 
Gryphon Exploration Company, November 2001 - August 2005 
Flores said he created five jobs here, boosting the payroll to 29 employees before the company was acquired by Australian-based Woodside Petroleum. We couldn't find an SEC filing for Gryphon. Meantime, Caran Crooker, the company's former controller, said she couldn't remember precisely how many jobs were added during Flores' tenure but said that five sounded about right. She said the company at least hired a couple people in the finance department, a receptionist, and two engineers. 
Phoenix Exploration Company, November 2005 - December 2009 
Flores, who helped found Phoenix Exploration, told us he had created 45 jobs by the time he left in 2009. 
Two news reports back him up. 
In August 2006, a few months after Phoenix opened for business, the company paid $340 million for all offshore Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana assets owned by Houston-based Cabot Oil and Gas Corp., according to a March 2007 article in the Houston Business Journal. ""Even though I had put together a great team, we only had 12 people on the payroll at the time, so it kept me awake at night,"" the Journal quotes Flores saying. 
By March 2007, the headcount totaled 44, including management like Flores, according to the Journal. 
In May 2009, six months before Flores departed, the Houston Chronicle ranked it number 61 of its top 100 private companies, noting Phoenix employed 48 people. Crooker, now a controller at Phoenix, said there are 45 employees on the books. 
We wondered how much personal credit Flores can rightly claim for the job growth at Phoenix and the other companies. 
Miguel Quinones, a management professor at the Southern Methodist University Cox School of Business, said: ""To say he personally created (jobs) would be a stretch. It'd be like him taking credit for the price of oil or gas going up. What creates jobs is demand for products and services. Unless he opened up a new product line, or somehow opened up a new market ... you can't claim (credit for creating all jobs)."" 
When we asked Flores why he, as the CFO, deserves the credit, he said his ad ""says the companies that Bill Flores helped create, it doesn't say Bill Flores anywhere takes personal credit for it."" When we pointed out that the narrator flat out says Flores created the 500-plus jobs, Flores said: ""That's not the way it was intended to be read. It was intended to be read that these companies created over 500 American jobs."" 
Indeed, a message on his campaign website says Flores ""helped create"" more than 500 jobs. And in April, his campaign debuted a TV ad saying ""his energy companies created 500 American jobs."" 
Flores told us: ""What we've tried to always say is, 'I was a leader at a company that helped create jobs.'"" 
Where does this trail wind up? 
Our research is by no means perfect, since the payroll numbers we found didn't precisely line up with the months Flores started and stopped working at each company. As far as we can tell, significantly more than 500 jobs were added to the payrolls at growing companies where Flores worked as a CFO. But as he acknowledged to us, the statement's wording overstates that achievement — leaving viewers to conclude he personally created the jobs. 
We rate his statement as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACF900>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/bill-flores/bill-flores-says-he-created-more-500-us-jobs/
"['Georgia', 'Economy', 'Gambling', 'J.B. Powell']","
Candidate says Georgia could cash in with horse racing
","
Georgia agriculture commissioner candidate J.B. Powell is willing to make a bet on the ponies.

He wants the Peach State to allow horse racing.

""Georgians deserve to have a commissioner of agriculture who will fight for common-sense ideas that will help lead Georgia out of the economic challenges we face,"" Powell, the Democratic Party's nominee for commissioner, said in a Sept. 9 news release.

Powell believes horse racing could increase the state's struggling economy by $1 billion a year and create at least 10,000 jobs. Bugle player, begin the first call song please.

Powell is in a three-man race to replace Democrat Tommy Irvin, who has been Georgia's agriculture commissioner since 1969. Gary Black is the Republican Party's nominee. Kevin Cherry is running as a Libertarian.

So can this plan create as many jobs as Powell says and bring in that much money to Georgia?

The idea is not new in Georgia. State lawmakers have discussed it before, but some conservatives have been reluctant to support another form of gambling. The state constitution must be amended to allow gambling on horse racing, also known as pari-mutuel betting.

The candidate's evidence in support of horse racing is a 2006 study done for the Washington, D.C.-based American Horse Council by Deloitte, a well-known financial advisory and auditing firm. Horse racing generates an annual economic impact of $26 billion and nearly 147,000 jobs in the United States, according to the study. The Powell campaign based its estimate on Georgia's potential on how horse racing is performing in Florida. The Deloitte report found Florida sees an annual total economic impact of $2.2 billion from horse racing. The report said horse racing is responsible for 22,000 direct jobs and 51,700 total jobs.

Graham Balch, Powell's campaign manager, noted that the Sunshine State has 18.5 million residents. Georgia's population is about 9.8 million. Since Georgia's population is about one-half of Florida's, Balch believes it is reasonable to conclude Georgia could see 50 percent of the economic impact from horse racing. Another advantage Georgia has is Atlanta ranks only behind Ocala, Fla., and Lexington, Ky., in the number of horse owners.

""Given Georgia's level of horse ownership and climate and size, it is a realistic projection to say Georgia could at least have an economic impact of $1 billion or more like eight states around the country,"" Balch wrote in an e-mail to AJC PolitiFact Georgia. ""All fact based information leads us to believe that $1 billion in economic impact and 10,000 to 20,000 jobs is the best estimate possible and in our research we have not seen any information to contradict the projections for Georgia.""

Powell believes Georgia can get to the $1 billion mark, but it will take time -- at least three years.

Georgia would be beginning in the horse racing business while Florida has a head start, said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of Public Sector Consulting, a nonpartisan research firm that did a study on the economic impact of horse racing in Michigan in 2002.

""I would be very careful when looking at a neighboring state and say 'They do x and we can do y,' "" Williams said.

The Michigan study found horse racing had an economic impact of $1.2 billion in 2001. Michigan had a population of nearly 10 million residents in 2000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Regulated pari-mutuel horse racing has been in existence in Michigan since the 1930s. Michigan had seven racetracks at the time. Public Sector Consulting used revenue from racetrack operations as the primary factor to determine the economic impact.

Williams said Georgia must examine how many people would come for horse racing from outside the state. He said spectators and bettors from Georgia could be taking away revenue from other in-state leisure activities.

Williams also issued another warning: Horse racing in Michigan was suffering economically at the time of the study. The industry, he and others noted, is now in a more precarious state financially across the country.

Some say the answer is combining horse racing and casino gambling. Arthur H. Anderson, a consultant for a committee attempting to bring racing to Georgia and South Carolina, said places such as Hoosier Park in Indiana show the idea can work. Anderson, who is involved with the Georgia-South Carolina Horse Racing Committee, estimates a casino/racetrack with a ""funplex"" for children and destination shopping can generate about $500 million a year. The committee would use the revenue to support the state's education system.

Anderson supports running two tracks in Georgia, which he says can bring $1 billion to the state. A casino would need state approval, and Georgia's leaders have been against the idea. The Indianapolis Star reported in May that money wagered on horse racing in Indiana has dropped from $190 million in 2005 to $147 million in 2009. Money from slot machines has been used to supplement lagging horse racing revenue, the Star reported. The American Horse Council study found the economic impact of horse racing in Indiana in 2005 was $294 million.

Powell's proposal would not include casino gambling, his campaign manager said.

We looked at Virginia because it is a Southern state, its population of nearly 8 million people is closer to Georgia's and its one pari-mutuel racetrack, Colonial Downs, opened in 1997. One report from about five years ago shows the annual economic impact of the horse industry is $1 billion, which includes recreation equine activity. Virginia equine leaders note the horse racing business there has suffered in recent years.

The Deloitte study on Florida found about 40 percent of the horse industry's economic impact in that state comes from racing. At that rate, the annual impact for horse racing in Virginia would be about $400 million. Virginia officials are working on an economic impact study.

We believe there are some problems in using Florida to determine the potential economic impact of horse racing in Georgia. For example, Florida draws more tourists, some of whom are inclined to visit the racetrack. Some well-respected economists, such as the University of Georgia's Jeff Humphreys, said Powell's estimate may be correct, but more information is needed. We agree and rate the candidate's statement as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809756FEC0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/17/jb-powell/candidate-says-georgia-could-cash-horse-racing/

More than a million Texans would become Medicaid-eligible under Obamacare expansion
","Visiting Dallas on Nov. 6, 2013, President Barack Obama sought to allay worries about his signature health-care law and assert Texans’ need for more health coverage. Texas could have helped many immediately, he said, by accepting the law’s offer of federal dollars to help pay for expanding Medicaid, a key Obamacare initiative. ""Across this state, you've got a million people -- because this is a big state -- a million people, citizens, who don’t have health insurance that could get health insurance right away if the state of Texas decided to take advantage of it,"" Obama said at Temple Emanu-El to volunteers who helped people enroll via the act’s insurance marketplace on Healthcare.gov. Texas consistently has the nation’s highest percentage of residents without health insurance. The Census Bureau estimated 6.4 million Texans in 2012 had no health coverage. The state Health and Human Services Commission estimated that in January 2013, Texas had about 1 million adults on Medicaid. Under the health care law, the federal government offered to pay expansion costs during the first three years for states that extended Medicaid to adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Texas Gov. Rick Perry rejected that deal July 19, 2012. Medicaid is a federal-state insurance program that targets children and low-income families, elderly and disabled people, pregnant women and children in foster care. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the state commission, which administers Medicaid in Texas, told us by email, ""We estimate that almost 1.4 million Texans would become eligible for Medicaid if the state opted to expand."" The Urban Institute, a non-partisan research institute in Washington, D.C., reached a slightly larger figure in a July 2012 report that said, ""State decisions regarding whether to expand Medicaid under the ACA will directly affect the 15.1 million uninsured adults with incomes below 138 percent of FPL (federal poverty level) who are not currently eligible for Medicaid. Of these newly eligible uninsured adults ... 1.7 million live in Texas."" The institute said its estimates were made using data from the Census Bureau’s 2010 American Community Survey. In a March 18, 2013, report, the state agency contrasted how Texas’ uninsured population might differ in two different Obamacare scenarios using Current Population Survey census data from March 2012. ""Current state"" populations included 19.5 million insured and 6 million uninsured (24 percent uninsured), the report said. The implementation of Obamacare alone, without Medicaid expansion in Texas, would shift that rate to 16 percent uninsured (4.2 million Texans), the agency estimated. Under Obamacare implementation with full Medicaid expansion, 12 percent (3.1 million Texans) would remain uninsured. Not all the newly eligible adults would be expected to sign up immediately, Goodman said, citing 2012 estimates from the agency that show Medicaid adult enrollment rising by 341,000 in 2014, by 776,000 in 2015 and by just over 1 million in 2016:   Our ruling Obama said, ""A million people … could get health insurance right away"" if Texas expanded Medicaid as encouraged by the Obamacare law. Estimates show some 1.4 million to 1.7 million would be eligible immediately. We rate his statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Larry Elder says government takes almost 50 percent of the American people's money
","CNN’s Crossfire stacked its panel with Republicans this week to talk about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and how the say-what-he-wants, does-what-he-wants governor divides the GOP. Conservative talk radio host and panelist Larry Elder criticized Christie for accepting the ""architecture of the welfare state,"" pointing to Christie’s embrace of billions of dollars in federal aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In pressing his point, Elder made a head-spinning claim that our governments take almost $.50 of every $1 we earn. ""In 1900, at all three levels of government, federal, state and local, government took less than 10 percent of the American people's money,"" Elder said. ""Now we're talking about 35 percent, and when you add a dollar value to mandates, you're talking almost 50 percent. Where’s the outrage on the part of the Republican Party?"" Elder’s figures certainly are eye-popping, and his general point -- that the government consumes a lot more money than it did more than 100 years ago -- is true. But on the merits of his specific stats, experts we consulted urged caution. Elder is essentially putting together two separate calculations to get to 50 percent. He’s taking the direct cost of government as a percentage of the economy, then adding to it the cost of government regulations. The first half of this equation is straightforward; the second half is not. Previously, PolitiFact has addressed the question of how large a portion of the economy is accounted for by government expenditures. We’ll recap some of what we found here. For 2012, the gross domestic product -- the size of the nation’s economy -- was $16.2 trillion, according to the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Meanwhile, the expenditures by all levels of government was $5.3 trillion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Using these figures, government at all levels accounted for 32.6 percent of gross domestic product. Given the way Elder phrased his claim -- using as the denominator ""the American people’s money""  -- it’s possible to use a different calculation. If you replace gross domestic product with personal income (which was about $13.7 trillion in 2012), then the percentage is a few points higher -- 38.5 percent. Neither of these figures gets Elder to ""nearly 50 percent."" So the cost of regulations has to add an extra 10 to 16 points. Is the cost of regulation high enough to do that? Elder cited 1980s-era work of free-market economist Milton Friedman, though Elder said even Friedman called estimating the burden of regulations ""a difficult, if not impossible thing to quantify."" Elder pointed us a 2009 report from Americans for Tax Reform Foundation that said the combined cost of government spending and regulatory burdens at all levels totaled ""a whopping 61.34 percent"" of national income. In 2013, the cost of government was down to 53 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product, according to the anti-tax group, which was founded by Grover Norquist. The data, Elder said, suggests that, if anything, ""I understated it."" But even economists sympathetic to the notion that government is too big are unwilling to say Elder’s definitively right. They say the numbers are simply too squishy. Government mandates ""do have a large burden,"" said Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute. ""But the estimates shouldn’t be treated with precision."" William McBride of the business-backed Tax Foundation said Elder went ""out on a limb"" with his 50 percent figure. In addition to the softness of the regulatory cost estimates, experts pointed out a few other question marks about the evidence Elder is using. First, the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation analysis only attempted to calculate a gross cost of regulations, so it ignored any benefits regulations might have. (We reached out to Americans for Tax Reform but did not hear back.) ""Gross rather than a net cost of regulations analysis is pretty much intellectually indefensible,"" said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in taxes. ""Once we get into the net, who knows where it comes out. And, compared to what?"" In addition, saying the government ""took"" your money is misleading. Some of the money government collects comes back to you in the form or Social Security or Medicare, or any of a number of other government programs. While Republicans such as Elder may advocate that Americans should have more control over their money from cradle to grave, suggesting government simply takes $.50 on every $1 someone earns isn’t the whole story. ""If Elder wants to talk about mandates as increasing the percentage of government ownership, it’s only fair to consider the other side,"" said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor. ""I pay money in payroll tax during my working years, then I get money back in my retirement years (from Social Security)."" ""The whole exercise is rather silly (and pointless) because it does not take into account what the U.S. gets for its tax dollar,"" added Thomas Hungerford, a senior economist and director of tax and budget policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. All in all, said Bryan Camp, Texas Tech University tax professor, ""Mr. Elder’s statement is too vague to be useful for any purpose other than generating ‘hallelujahs!’ from the choir he is preaching to."" Our ruling Elder said, ""When you add a dollar value to mandates,"" government took almost 50 percent ""of the American people’s money."" It’s easy to get to the mid-to-high 30 percent range. But getting the last 10 to 15 percentage points to get to ""almost 50 percent"" is less certain. Regulation does have a cost, but the exact cost is hard to pin down. Because his larger point -- that government spending has increased, and that mandates have a cost -- is valid, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097087100>],/factchecks/2013/nov/08/larry-elder/larry-host-says-government-takes-almost-50-percent/
"['Elections', 'States', 'Texas', 'Guns', 'Greg Abbott']","
Davis not pushing gun control, but like Bloomberg has favored gun show checks
","Austin political consultant Steven Rivas drew our attention to a claim on a donation web page for Greg Abbott’s gubernatorial campaign saying state Sen. Wendy Davis is ""fighting to bring California values to Texas"" including ""Bloomberg-style gun control."" Setting aside how much California agrees with New York’s gun-control advocate mayor Michael Bloomberg, we thought Texans would want to know Davis’ views, as her bid to become governor is the first statewide campaign for the Fort Worth Democrat. Davis hasn’t, so far, focused on gun control in her campaign. Abbott, a Republican who’s served as Texas’ attorney general since 2002, says on his campaign site that he’ll fight federal limits on gun rights. Abbott campaign spokesmen Matt Hirsch and Avdiel Huerta told us by email that Davis, a former Fort Worth City Council member elected to the Senate in 2008, had ""voted twice against campus carry,"" ""voted to prohibit gun shows in Fort Worth,"" supported background checks for gun buyers and had opposed a measure to remove cities’ abilities to restrict guns in municipal buildings; they also provided citations and backup materials. Asked for specifics on ""Bloomberg-style,"" Huerta sent a March 26, 2013, PolitiFact fact-check that said, ""Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases."" In addition, Bloomberg, a powerful advocate for gun control both locally and nationally, has long urged and in some cases helped enact measures including strengthening punishments for those who illegally possess guns, registering gun offenders and banning military-style weapons. He also focuses on ""straw"" purchases -- those made by people who intend to re-sell the weapons to illegal buyers -- and has been criticized for his city administration’s sting operations in other states to uncover such transactions. Bloomberg co-founded and co-chairs Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that launched a $12 million, 13-state ad campaign March 23, 2013, promoting expanded background checks. Group spokeswoman Erika Soto Lamb told us by email that ""Bloomberg-style"" could fairly be defined as ""common-sense gun reforms that will save American lives by keeping guns out of dangerous hands."" Universal background checks -- requiring private sellers everywhere (not just at gun shows) to run background checks -- are a prime example and the group’s priority, she said.   Davis on gun shows   Hirsch of Abbott’s campaign emailed us citations from news stories saying that as a member of the Fort Worth City Council in 2000, Davis supported making sure all buyers faced background checks at gun shows in city-owned facilities and that she recently told the Texas Tribune she still held that view. A Sept. 11, 2013, Tribune news story Hirsch emailed to us said Davis was a gun owner and quoted her as saying of the gun show restrictions, ""I haven’t pursued it as a senator because I know it’s like spitting in the wind"" and ""But I still believe it’s the right thing. And if I were governor and a bill came to my desk that provided for background checks at gun shows, I would sign that."" Hirsch also cited a Sept. 18, 2013, commentary by Georgia writer Brandon Howell, posted on the conservative Daily Caller website, that went further, saying Davis also ""sought banning gun shows on city-owned property."" A Fort Worth ordinance Davis proposed in 2000 could have barred some gun shows from city property, but was tabled along with a related proposal, according to news stories starting in 2000 about a months-long city government debate on gun control that year. An Aug. 9, 2000, news story in the Dallas Morning News said her ordinance would have placed restrictions on shows ""including provisions that would allow only licensed dealers to sell firearms on city premises."" According to the story, Davis said that another option was requiring background checks on gun buyers at the shows. A July 19, 2000, News story said Davis also supported the other tabled proposal, a resolution by which the council would have asked the federal government to require background checks of gun show buyers. Bloomberg supports background checks on gun show buyers, evidenced notably when he sent New York investigators to gun shows in states as far away as Nevada in 2006, 2009 and 2011 to find evidence that private dealers would sell to buyers who wouldn’t pass background checks. In a July 25, 2012, fact-check, PolitiFact gave a Half True rating to his claim that ""you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, forty percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet.""   Davis on campus carry   Legal gun owners’ ability to take their weapons onto college campuses doesn’t appear to be an issue Bloomberg emphasizes, based on our check of the Nexis news archive. Mayors Against Illegal Guns has supported college leaders calling for tighter gun restrictions on campuses nationwide, but doesn’t name the issue among its principles or in the primary categories on its scorecard for lawmakers. New York state bans weapons on campuses. Hirsch, turning to Davis’ tenure as a state senator, cited her 2009 vote against a proposal to allow Texas concealed-handgun license holders to carry handguns on college campuses. That proposal passed the Senate by 20-11 and cleared a House committee, but it died toward the end of the legislative session short of reaching the full House. Hirsch also specified Davis’ 2011 vote on legislation intended to let such license holders carry guns inside campus buildings. Senators including Davis voted 19-11 not to bring the proposal up for floor consideration, and it then died (a similar measure failed to pass in the 2013 session). To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña told us by email that Davis voted for three pro-gun measures, supported two others and was quoted in a Jan. 13, 2013, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story as saying, ""Americans have the right under the Second Amendment to own firearms, and that is not going to change."" Acuña said Davis wants to protect Second Amendment rights on firearms ""for honest citizens by assuring that they are kept out of the hands of criminals."" One of the Senate votes Acuña cited was related to campus carry issues. In the 2013 session, Davis was among the ""yea"" votes when the Senate approved, 27-4, a proposal to allow college students with concealed-handgun licenses to store handguns in locked vehicles on campus. The measure became law and took effect Sept. 1, 2013. The Daily Caller item Hirsch provided to us described that as ""an easy vote"" for Davis because the proposal passed by such a wide margin. Davis told the bill’s author, according to an April 30, 2013, Star-Telegram news story, that ""she planned to support his bill but said she wanted his assurance that ‘you will not allow that opening, that broad opening to become a part of what you’re passing out of here today.’ … ‘You understand that there are many of us in the Senate chamber who are concerned about the broader impacts of carrying on campus.’ "" The story said Davis later issued a statement saying that ""it is important that the local control of colleges and universities over their campuses be preserved with regard to carrying guns on campus.""   Davis on concealed-carry measures and cities’ abilities to restrict guns   Bloomberg and his group have long opposed letting states recognize out-of-state concealed-carry permits. New York City, where Bloomberg is nearing the end of his 12-year stretch as mayor, issues concealed-carry permits in limited circumstances. And Bloomberg favors expanding at least some concealed-carry restrictions; after the Feb. 26, 2012, death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, Bloomberg said in an April 11, 2012, speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., that George Zimmerman, who shot Martin, should never have been allowed to carry a concealed weapon because of his legal history. Huerta sent us part of a May 24, 2001, Star-Telegram news story in which council members including Davis ""criticized a bill passed by the state Senate that would ... give the Legislature the sole right to regulate whether"" concealed-handgun license holders ""can take their weapons to such locations as city halls, libraries or parks."" The story quoted Davis as saying, ""I think it's a terrible idea"" and ""Once again, it's an example of the state getting involved in an issue that should be within the city's jurisdiction."" Acuña cited Davis’ 2013 votes on three measures simplifying the process to get a concealed-carry license. Davis voted for a proposal to prohibit state officials from requiring applicants’ Social Security numbers that became law and takes effect Jan. 1, 2014, and for two measures that became law effective Sept. 1, 2013, cutting the number of instruction hours needed and eliminating the need to take a proficiency test. The Senate approved the measures by votes of, respectively, 25-6, 29-1 and 27-4. Acuña also noted that Davis voted for a measure allowing the state’s attorney general to get an injunction against a city or county that breaks state law by restricting ownership, transport, licensing or other actions regarding firearms, ammunition and supplies. The Senate approved it 24-6; it became law and took effect June 14, 2013. It’s not a new restriction on cities, but rather a specific way to enable the enforcement of existing state law that bars such local restrictions.   So is Wendy like Mike?   The mayoral group’s spokeswoman named universal background checks as ""Bloomberg-like."" So does the NRA, it turns out. Spokesman Andrew Arulanandam of the NRA’s lobbying arm told us by phone, ""AG Abbott is correct in his assessment,"" based on Bloomberg’s federal-level push for expanding background checks and Davis’ remarks to the Texas Tribune favoring ""background checks at gun shows."" At the Texas State Rifle Association, which is affiliated with the NRA, spokeswoman Alice Tripp told us by phone that she agreed with Abbott based on Davis’ 2000 push for background checks at gun shows. ""Bloomberg seems to attack firearm ownership in that kind of parental way,"" she said. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, told us by email her group hopes Davis ""will come out in support of common-sense gun reform, including background checks,"" and said that to her group, ""Bloomberg-style gun control"" is not a pejorative term. The groups did not have scorecards or endorsements for specific candidates this far ahead of Texas’ Nov. 4, 2014, general election. Our ruling Abbott said Davis is ""fighting to bring"" ""Bloomberg-style gun control to Texas."" Like Bloomberg, Davis supports background checks for all buyers at gun shows. She has opposed campus-carry measures, but voted to allow concealed weapons locked in vehicles while warning the author not to take it any farther. She has opposed letting the state tell cities or colleges they can’t regulate guns on their property, but voted to let the state pursue injunctions against cities that overstep limitations currently in state law. She joined most of the Senate in voting for three laws simplifying concealed-handgun permit applications. Davis has taken some actions Bloomberg might approve, and others he might not. However, she doesn’t appear, so far, to be ""fighting"" for tighter gun control if elected governor. We rate Abbott’s partly accurate statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

By one measure, UT poised to be first major university to open a medical school in nearly 50 years
","A University of Texas official declared that the Dell Medical School slated to open in Austin in time for students to enroll in 2016 happens to be the first one to debut at a top-notch research university in decades. Steve Leslie, the university’s special assistant to the president for medical education, prefaced the claim to history by telling Austin-area residents at the Oct. 29, 2013, town hall that the school will shine. ""We will follow through on making this an outstanding medical school that all of you expect us to deliver for Austin and Travis County and for the state of Texas and more broadly than that,"" Leslie said. ""This is the first medical school at a major Tier One public research university, major Tier One university public or private, in the last 50 years; these are big deals to start."" Other U.S. universities have opened medical schools more recently, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. By email, spokeswoman Lesley Ward listed about half a dozen examples including Florida State University. But the UT official made a more nuanced claim by referring to UT’s uniqueness among major ""Tier One"" institutions. Leslie's descriptive, ""Tier One,"" has nothing to do with UT’s famous Main Building or, for that matter, big cakes. But it’s familiar to us because in 2012, we rated as Mostly True a group’s statement that Austin ""is the biggest city in America with a Tier One research university (UT-Austin) but without a medical school."" That claim could have been clarified with the detail that Texas A&M University has a medical college in nearby Round Rock that it wants to develop into a full-blown school. And in that story, we explored how to define a Tier One university, partly by considering the suggestion that about five dozen institutions that are members of the Association of American Universities should be considered Tier One schools. The association says it chooses members ""based on the high quality of programs of academic research and scholarship and undergraduate, graduate, and professional education in a number of fields, as well as general recognition that a university is outstanding by reason of the excellence of its research and education programs."" Leslie’s claim, a UT spokesman told us, was based on institutions that were AAU members before they opened their medical schools. He noted by email that AAU membership also was the indicator relied upon in a Jan. 8, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news blog post stating that Texas had three Tier One universities: UT, Texas A&M University and Rice University. Leslie did not mention the AAU-first distinction in his town-hall remarks. Susswein said by email that if Leslie had done so, audience members might not have understood, so he ""used the common shorthand"" of Tier One. ""Any way you cut it, it's been a long time since a medical school has been started at a top-tier AAU university,"" Susswein wrote. Susswein also emailed us a spreadsheet showing when AAU-member institutions have opened medical schools since 1955 and when those institutions became AAU members. UT has been an AAU member since 1929. The spreadsheet indicated that two other institutions opened medical schools about 50 years ago after they were AAU members or the year they joined that group. Penn State University, an AAU member since 1900, opened a medical school in 1963, while Michigan State University opened a medical school in 1964, the year it joined the AAU. The spreadsheet indicated four institutions opened medical schools between 1966 and 1977 before becoming AAU members. These were the University of California Davis; the University of Arizona; UC San Diego; and Texas A&M University. We confirmed that each of those universities joined the AAU after their medical schools opened, according to university web pages and a list of AAU member-institutions. Then again, we became aware of a wider way of identifying Tier One universities during our 2012 look at that classification. At the time, AAU spokesman Barry Toiv said by telephone that in exploring how to define such universities, he would defer to a list of 108 doctorate-granting universities with ""very high research"" activity as designated by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which traces its classification of colleges and universities to work by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. And our check of institutional web pages indicated that among the universities designated by Carnegie as having ""very high research"" activity, several opened medical schools in the latest few decades. Specifically, the University of South Florida enrolled its charter class in 1971; the University of South Carolina opened its medical school to students in 1977; the Florida State University College of Medicine welcomed its first students in 2001; and the University of Central Florida established its medical school in 2006. By email, Susswein said he recognized ""that others may use a broader definition for ‘Tier One’ universities. Under that broader definition, we are one of a handful of top-tier universities to launch a medical school in the past 50 years."" Our ruling Leslie said UT is starting ""the first medical school at a major Tier One"" university ""in the last 50 years."" As Leslie did not say, UT is the first institution that was already in the prestigious AAU to plan a medical school launch since Michigan State and Penn State opened schools 49 and 50 years ago, respectively. Several other AAU-member universities opened medical schools from 1966 to 1977, but none was a member of the association at the time their medical school opened. Another way of identifying top-tier universities, the Carnegie approach, places UT among more than 100 very high-research institutions. We identified four universities considered high-research entities--though none of them is in the AAU--that opened medical schools from 1971 to 2006. We rate Leslie’s claim, which would have benefited from these clarifications, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Did public subsidies for the Oregon Convention Center hotel jump $100 million in closed-door sessions?
","Plans for a large upscale hotel to boost business at the Oregon Convention Center have floated around for years. So has opposition, in part from downtown hotels concerned that any public subsidies could unfairly undercut their businesses. Momentum surged again early last year behind a project calling for a 600-room hotel that would be privately owned and operated. Metro, the regional planning government, asked developers for proposals in February 2012 and spelled out only a relatively small public investment -- a $4 million loan from the Portland Development Commission. ""We recognized there were limits to other potential (public) financing tools, and we didn’t know what that number would look like,"" said Teri Dresler, general manager of Metro’s visitor venues, such as the Oregon Zoo. ""We wanted developers to tell us: What are you willing to invest?"" Of the two proposals submitted, Metro chose Mortenson/Hyatt’s to move ahead. But opponents remain frustrated, saying they were shut out of what should be a far more open process and what ended up as being a much more lucrative deal. One of the opponents’ claims, published on the website of OUCH  -- (""Our Unfortunate Convention Hotel"") caught our eye: ""Taxpayer subsidy for OCC hotel jumps $100 million in closed-door sessions. $8 million to $130 million with zero public input. OUCH, that hurts."" PolitiFact Oregon decided to see whether a $197.5 million project rolled out as minimalist in public investment ended up getting significant subsidies in ""closed-door sessions."" We called Bashar Wali, president of Provenance Hotels, who belongs to the group fearing that public subsidies could unfairly tip the market toward a new Hyatt Regency. Wali, it should be noted, served on the committee that ultimately recommended that Metro go with Mortenson/Hyatt’s proposal. Early on, he said, the amount of public money committed to the project began rising. It started with the $4 million PDC loan, then doubled to the $8 million cited on OUCH’s website when Metro agreed to chip in a $4 million grant. But almost as soon as Minneapolis-based Mortenson Development was selected to build the hotel, Wali said, three things happened: The committee was disbanded, communication to outsiders stopped, and the public commitment to the project swelled. He cited a $10 million commitment of lottery proceeds approved this year by the Oregon Legislature. Then Metro upped the ante by agreeing to sell $60 million in revenue bonds to aid construction. The total project cost of the bonds, including interest, is $121 million over the 30-year life of the bonds, according to a Metro fact sheet. ""And all of the negotiations between Metro and Hyatt have been conducted in secret,"" said Wali, who belongs to the Coalition for Fair Budget Priorities that opposes the project. ""The transparency Metro promised has simply not been there."" Metro’s Dresler responded to both of Wali’s main points. Yes, she acknowledged, negotiations between Metro staff and Mortenson/Hyatt team members have been conducted in what OUCH characterized as ""closed-door sessions."" ""But real estate transactions are always conducted that way,"" she said. ""Often, there are trade secrets being discussed, things that companies such as Hyatt want protected until any deal is signed and delivered."" She got agreement on that point from Tim Ramis, a Portland attorney whose firm has helped represent downtown hotels opposing the deal. ""The negotiation aspect of this is typical to the way these things are usually handled,"" he said, adding that, ""What’s unusual is that the outcome isn’t being disclosed."" The amount of public money involved has definitely increased from Metro’s original request for proposals, Dresler said, but that was always a possibility. We tracked the document down. In the ""Public Investment and Resources"" section, it reads, ""Metro and its partners recognize that some level of public investment may be necessary to achieve the type of convention hotel required by this"" request for proposals. Among the financing options listed is Metro’s willingness ""to consider additional"" monetary support and ""site-specific transient lodging taxes ‘rebated’ to the project for a period of years."" The latter -- more commonly known as room taxes -- are what Metro plans to use to pay off the $60 million in revenue bonds, Dresler said. The figure was chosen, she added, not based on what Mortenson requested but on the gap between construction cost and the revenue consultants said the hotel could generate over the next 30 years. Finally, Dresler said, the $60 million in bonds shouldn’t be regarded as a public subsidy since it will be paid off entirely using money plunked down by conventioneers staying at the new hotel. OUCH’s claim rests on two pillars -- a $100-million jump in taxpayer subsidy in ""closed-door sessions."" On the first point, all agree that at least $18 million in public money is on the table: a $4 million PDC loan, a $4 million Metro grant and $10 million in Oregon Lottery proceeds. So should the $60 million in revenue bonds be considered a public subsidy? We called Robert Whelan, senior economist at ECONorthwest, who said yes. We also referred to a recent New York Times financial article, in which analysts say such bonds amount to public subsidies because they divert money that could otherwise go toward public projects to help pay for a private project. The ultimate projections dance around a bit, given the 30-year pay-off period at stake, but even Metro agrees that the bond sale will end up requiring about $121 million to satisfy. So we find that OUCH is on the mark in stating that the total public stake involved grew substantially, at least in specifically outlined amounts, from the original request for proposals. All also agree that the negotiations took place behind closed doors. Some opponents think that was improper or unfair, though others agree that real estate negotiations between public agencies and private developers are routinely held in private. But that’s a separate issue. So we also find OUCH accurate on that point. We rate the statement on OUCH’s website True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC03C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/08/coalition-fair-budget-priorities/did-public-subsidies-oregon-convention-center-hote/

Americans For Prosperity says Sen. Kay Hagan supports Obamacare waivers, special treatment for Congress
","President Barack Obama’s health care law is bound to be a central issue of the 2014 midterm elections. In North Carolina, first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, is already facing attacks about Obamacare. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, released an ad against Hagan. It starts out with a series of claims praising women for being breadwinners and job creators. Then, it pivots: ""But Kay Hagan just doesn’t get it."" ""Hagan supports waivers for friends of Obama and special treatment for Congress and their staffs,"" the video continues. Hagan did vote to pass Obamacare in 2010, but does the law include ""waivers for friends of Obama"" and ""special treatment for Congress and their staffs""? We’ll look into both parts of this statement. Waivers We’ve already fact-checked the claim that the president handed out waivers to his friends. The law did lead to the granting of more than 1,000 waivers, but they weren’t issued to groups on the basis of being Obama’s friends or political allies. Part of the law allowed for groups to apply for an exemption so that they can keep their cheap insurance plans, even though they don’t typically cover the ""10 essential benefits"" like maternity care and mental health care that Obamacare touts. These waivers expire on Jan. 1, 2014. Some but not all of these groups could be considered Obama’s political allies, so using the term ""friends"" is at the very least misleading. Many unions, which typically lean Democratic, made the list. They make up about a third of the waivers. But the recipients also include groups like the Baptist Retirement Homes of North Carolina, Pepsi and McDonald’s. The common denominator with most of those who received waivers seems to be low-wage workers. As far as we can tell, there’s no reason to think that ""friendship"" played a role, or that these companies are Obama’s political allies. More than 100 groups, including several unions, were denied waivers. There’s also a sizable number of groups that were denied waivers, then were accepted the second time around. Health and Human Services issues these waivers. Hagan and other legislators don't have a say. Hagan's spokeswoman told us the senator has never spoken out in favor of the practice. Special treatment for Congress PolitiFact has also looked at claims similar to Americans For Prosperity’s assertion that Congress gets ""special treatment."" That implies that legislators and their staffs aren’t subject to the health care reform’s individual mandate when in fact they are. It’s more accurate to say that Congress is one of several special cases under the law. However, this exception actually requires Congress to buy insurance on the marketplace instead of keeping employer-provided benefits from the federal government. Lawmakers still get a subsidy toward their policies. Without the subsidy, the change in coverage would have effectively been a pay cut of thousands of dollars per year. In other words, the law singles out Congress and forces members off their employer-provided plan in favor of the marketplace options, even though all other Americans with employee-provided health coverage can keep it. In defense of the ad, Americans for Prosperity wrote, ""The ‘subsidy’ is not the problem. … Congress and its staff are enjoying an option not available to the rest of the nation."" They cite the fact that businesses with more than 50 employees can’t yet access group plans on the Small Business Health Options Program, the marketplace the legislators will use. But this policy allows legislators to experience Obamacare's individual mandate alongside their constituents. We don't see a case that they're getting special treatment. Our ruling More than 1,000 companies have received Obamacare waivers, but there’s no evidence to suggest that those groups are all Obama’s ""friends."" Meanwhile, Congress and their staffs do have to adhere to the reform’s individual mandate, and in a key way are treated worse than other Americans by the law, which is a curious definition of ""special treatment."" We rate Americans For Prosperity’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966D5080>],/factchecks/2013/nov/07/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-says-sen-kay-hagan-supports-o/

Florida GOP says Alex Sink supported $5.2B debt increase
","The Republican Party of Florida has wasted no time launching attacks against Democrat Alex Sink, the former state CFO who just announced her run for the late C.W. Bill Young’s congressional seat. There’s a lot of different claims out there, most of which are summed up in a YouTube ad: ""As Florida’s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state’s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida’s debt."" We’ve already checked Sink’s ties to the pension fund. In this fact-check, we’ll look into her relationship to the Florida debt. First things first: We broke down the state debt level at the end of each fiscal year, according to a report by the Division of Bond Finance. Dollar figures are in billions.     The GOP subtracted the 2006 number from the 2010 number, which does give us a difference of $5.2 billion. But since Sink took office in January 2007, the first budget she was in office for was fiscal year 2008, and the last would’ve been 2011. When we take that difference, we get $3.4 billion. It’s still a significant amount of debt, to be sure, but it’s not quite as high as the ad made it out to be. As we’ve noted in similar fact-checks, the implication here is that Sink in particular played a large role in increasing Florida’s debt. As chief financial officer from 2007 to 2011, her duties included accounting, auditing and managing Florida’s finances, in addition to serving on the State Board Administration with the governor and attorney general. In Florida, legislators are required to balance the budget each year, unlike in the federal government. But the state can issue bonds to pay for capital improvement projects like road improvements and the construction of educational facilities. A significant part of the debt during Sink's term was $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds to add class space to the state's schools, brought about by a 2002 amendment to the Florida Constitution that reduced class sizes. Additionally, while the CFO oversees finances, it's the state Legislature that passes a budget. ""It’s the Legislature who decides how much bonding is going to be done,"" said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues. The Cabinet and the governor sign off on the Division of Bond Finance’s bond issues after the Legislature appropriates money for projects. The Cabinet consists of three members, including the the CFO, the attorney general and the commissioner of agriculture. Neither the Republican Party of Florida nor the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee could point us to an instance where Sink voted against issuing bonds. But approving the bond issues is business as usual for the governor and Cabinet, so it’s routine for the vote to pass without disagreement. It is considered acceptable for the CFO to disagree with the governor on financial matters, said Susan MacManus, University of South Florida state government professor. But the fact that so many Cabinet and legislative officials (many of whom were Republicans) get a say in appropriations means the financial blame doesn’t fall to Sink alone. ""You can’t say that she has no responsibility for it,"" MacManus said. ""You could probably say that it’s shared responsibility."" The CFO also doesn’t have the same veto power the governor does over bond appropriations, said Khi Thai, Florida Atlantic University public budgeting professor. ""Alex Sink can express her ‘support’ but cannot ‘vote down’ the Legislature's bond appropriations,"" Thai added. Aside from that distinction, it’s worth remembering that the entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink’s term as CFO, not just Florida. The state’s trends of increasing debt are consistent with the nation’s. Florida government, be it the Legislature or the Cabinet, shouldn’t shoulder all the blame for a widespread recession. Our ruling As CFO, Sink did watch the debt increase over her term, but by $3.4 billion, not $5.2 billion. Plus, the Legislature, not the Cabinet, has most of the say in bond appropriations. Not to mention there was a nationwide recession that took its toll on the Florida economy, which is out of the hands of state officials. Given all these hefty clarifications, we rate the Florida Republican Party of Florida’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3A3E00>],/factchecks/2013/nov/07/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-alex-sink-supported-52b-debt-incr/

Charlie Crist says he stopped layoffs of 20,000 teachers during recession
","Former Gov. Charlie Crist wants voters to see a stark contrast between himself and Republican Gov. Rick Scott on public education. In his announcement speech in St. Petersburg on Nov. 4, 2013, Crist took credit for protecting teachers’ jobs when he was the Republican-elected governor from 2007 to 2010. (He switched to independent while running for U.S. Senate in 2010 and now he is running as a Democrat.) ""I am proud of my record as the governor investing in public education, and stopping the layoffs of some 20,000 school teachers during the global economic meltdown."" We will tackle this fact-check in two parts: Were 20,000 layoffs of Florida school teachers prevented during the recession, and does Crist get credit for that? Stimulus act The Crist campaign told us the basis of his claim was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the $787 billion federal stimulus bill pushed by President Barack Obama and passed by Congress in 2009. The Florida Department of Education published information in 2010 about how many ""instructional personnel"" the Recovery Act affected. The department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affecting a total 31,003 employees for the quarter ending June 30, 2010. Instructional personnel included elementary and secondary classroom teachers as well as guidance counselors, librarians and audio-visual workers, to name just a few. Many news reports stated that without the stimulus funds, the state would have had to make massive cuts including to education. Crist’s campaign cited a 2009 Miami Herald article which paraphrased the state’s education commissioner at the time, Eric Smith, saying that the stimulus dollars saved 26,000 teacher jobs. (Smith was appointed by Crist.) The stimulus money was paid out over two years: In 2009-10, nearly $908 million went to K-12 education, and another $873 million the year after, said Ruth Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association. ""The infusion of this federal cash was tremendously important in keeping school districts solvent during the recession,"" Melton said. We can’t say with certainty that without the stimulus dollars, 20,000 teachers would have been laid off, because each district could have made different decisions about how to make their budgets work. ""It could have meant actually more teachers than reported,"" Melton said. At the other extreme, some districts could have laid off more expensive teachers who were close to retirement -- so that could have lowered the number. ""A lot depended on the financial condition of the district before the recession hit – some districts had healthier reserve balances than others,"" Melton said. Crist’s role in the stimulus act Crist didn’t get to vote on passing the stimulus bill -- that was up to Congress. But Crist skipped a Florida Cabinet meeting to campaign with Obama for the stimulus in Fort Myers, and he went on national talk shows and across the state selling the plan. He lobbied members of Florida’s congressional delegation from both parties to pass the stimulus. ""We know that it's important that we pass a stimulus package,"" Crist said on Feb. 10, 2009, amid ""Yes, we can!"" cheers as he introduced the Democratic president in Fort Myers, the Tampa Bay Times reported. ""This is not about partisan politics. This is about rising above that, helping America and reigniting our economy."" Crist and Obama exchanged a friendly hug, an image that came back to haunt Crist when he ran for Senate in 2010. While many governors accepted the stimulus money, Crist was one of the few prominent Republicans to actively and publicly support the stimulus, a choice that won him accolades from Obama. Crist defended his choice to accept stimulus dollars when he faced heat from his own Republican Party. Still, in accepting the money, Crist did the same thing as many governors across the country, including those who weren't cheerleading the stimulus. Nationwide, the stimulus doled out more than $93 billion in education funds, including $50.9 in money for elementary and secondary schools to close gaps in state funding. A map on recovery.gov shows all the states taking these dollars. Overall, the stimulus funded about 368,000 school employees’ jobs nationwide during the 2009-10 school year, according to a February 2011 article the Hechinger Report, a respected publication about education. States didn’t go on a hiring spree, but used the money to prevent mass layoffs and backfill other funding losses. It wasn’t a cure-all, though: Some teachers were still laid off, depending on the individual school district. Our ruling Charlie Crist said that he stopped ""layoffs of some 20,000 school teachers during the global economic meltdown."" Crist was referring to the 2009 federal stimulus, which included education money to keep teachers and other education workers on the job. Without stimulus dollars, there could have been massive layoffs, though it’s difficult to pinpoint the precise number of teachers. Crist was a big-time cheerleader for the stimulus, urging members of Florida’s congressional delegation to support it. There was also that manhug with Obama that was used against him in his race for Senate. But Crist didn't have much of a role in getting the actual stimulus passed; that credit goes to Congress and Obama. And, many governors took the stimulus money to save teaching jobs. In all likelihood, Florida would have gotten the money without Crist's high-profile support.

","New Jersey Republican Gov.

""Cut a billion dollars out of the system, fire 6,000 teachers, and just tell everybody I'm an expert."" Did Christie’s policy lead to the firing of 6,000 teachers? We decided to dig a little. We reached out the Ed Schultz Show and didn’t hear back, but the state count of teachers undercuts the claim. Christie took office in 2010. Over the next two years, the number of teachers fell by about 4,500. Year Number of teachers Change from year before 2007 110,964 2008 111,786 822 2009 114,450 2,664 2010 114,704 254 2011 110,301 -4,403 2012 110,229 -72 Source: New Jersey Education Dept. Now, while 4,500 is less than 6,000, it’s still a lot of teachers, and Schultz could claim that he was in the ballpark. Except we know that not all those teachers were fired. "" 'Firing' is an incorrect term,"" said Steve Wollmer, director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association. Wollmer said Christie backed a budget cut of $1.3 billion for schools. It produced a mix of layoffs and retirements. Wollmer said layoffs were more common than retirements, but he said he has no hard data on how many people fell into each group. Plus, the cuts led to reductions in the ranks of both teachers and support staff. Wollmer lumps both groups together. ""I’m more than comfortable saying Christie was responsible for over 6,000 layoffs, due to his cuts,"" Wolmer said. But that raises another wrinkle in the story. We need to assess whether responsibility for the loss of teachers rest solely on Christie’s shoulders. Gordon MacInnes, a former Democratic lawmaker and now head of a left-leaning think tank, New Jersey Policy Perspective, said two things happened after Christie took office. ""Christie and the Democratic Legislature cut $1 billion in state funds from school aid and the stimulus aid expired,"" MacInnes said. A multi-billion dollar state budget deficit made 2010 a very contentious year for school funding. Christie proposed deep reductions in aid, and local school boards tried to fill the gap with property tax hikes. Then local voters shot down those plans in record numbers. Those local decisions complicate the picture, ""Yes, funding cuts do appear in many cases to have led to staffing reductions,"" said Bruce Baker, professor of education at Rutgers. ""But I'm not sure of a good data source you could use to identify what share of those reductions were from ‘reduction in force’ policies invoked by local public school districts claiming fiscal stress."" On the other hand, as a deadline loomed for passage of a state budget, Christie refused concessions to the Democratic-controlled Legislature and the state’s smallest budget in five years passed with a minimum of Democratic support. The initial cuts were so deep, a judge reversed a portion of them. The loss of stimulus dollars also played a major role. According to the federal government website, Recovery.gov, New Jersey received over $1.6 billion in one-time education grants through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. In April 2010, Christie’s administration said schools needed to manage a slightly smaller loss of about $1 billion in stimulus funds but in either case, schools were losing a significant amount of money due to the end of the federal program. Overall, Christie gets a fair degree of responsibility for the school funding cuts, although the way those cuts translated into reductions in staff might be indirect. Our ruling Schultz said Christie firied 6,000 teachers. There are two problems with Schultz’s claim. First, the number is closer to 4,500, and even the teachers’ union would not say that all the people that held those jobs were fired. Some of them retired and were not replaced. The number of teachers declined but not necessarily through being fired or laid-off. Second, while Christie pushed hard for steep cuts to school funding, he also got help from local voters. Because of those caveats, we rate Schultz's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097493700>],/factchecks/2013/nov/07/ed-schultz/schultz-says-gov-christie-pushed-fire-6000-teacher/

Gov. Scott Walker says typical Wisconsin homeowner will save $680 in property taxes over four years
","After Republican Gov. Scott Walker proposed a $100 million measure that state officials said would shrink property tax bills by $33 over two years, top Democrats said it was too little bang for the buck. Walker painted a much different picture when communicating with Wisconsin residents Oct. 25, 2013 through his regular email newsletter. ""This week, I signed a bill bringing $100 million in property tax relief to Wisconsin’s families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses,"" Walker’s e-update said. ""With this bill, the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680 over four years."" A recipient of the governor’s email wrote us saying he had tried in vain to find fiscal estimates that back up Walker’s claim and asking us to investigate. So we did. This turns on a commonly used benchmark: The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s annual estimates of the size of the property tax bill for the owner of a property at the median value statewide. For example, under the policies in the 2013-’15 state budget, that tax bill was estimated at $2,974 on a $151,000 home. We wondered: Since the fiscal bureau’s official savings forecast is the aforementioned $33 over two years, where does the governor’s claim of $680 come from? Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster told us it’s from a hypothetical scenario. The governor compared the median tax bill expected during each of his four years to what they would have looked like if one assumes the trend line from 2006 to 2010 under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle had continued into Walker’s term. (The median bill went up 8 percent in Doyle’s last term.) So, the $680 is not actual money this median taxpayer ""will save"" on his or her property tax bill during the Walker years. It’s based on the assumption that another governor, faced with the same deficit Walker inherited, would have continued to allow local governments to raise property taxes at that 8 percent clip over an additional four years. Maybe, but maybe not. Problems in analysis One problem with this is that Walker strongly links the $680 ""savings"" not to some hypothetical thing -- but to something very concrete: the $100 million relief legislation. It’s an even more bodacious claim, given that the $100 million in relief does not mean that the median tax bills will be lower in 2014 than in 2012, the period covered by the bill. That’s because the budget approved back in June resulted in a net increase (1 percent) in the projected median property tax bill over two years. The subsequent $100 million in relief trimmed the size of that increase -- but the median bill still goes up slightly. We’ve been down Hypothetical Road before with the governor. In July 2011 we rated a very similar claim False. Walker said then that under his first two-year budget, ""the average property taxpayer will save $700."" Not only was he comparing real results to hypothetical results, we found, there was an obvious flaw in the hypothetical scenario that puffed up things in Walker’s favor. In the current case, another problem is that Walker’s email to residents doesn’t disclose that the $680 figure is a hypothetical one. When we asked Webster about this, she expressed frustration, saying that Walker and his office had disclosed in several other venues that the $680 number is based on a hypothetical scenario and made it clear that the savings is not due just to this 2013 legislation, but also to prior actions. True, Walker did point out the hypothetical scenario at the Capitol news conference announcing the $100 million bill and displayed a large chart explaining it. Same for two news releases the office sent out presenting the $680 figure in a broader context, linking it to ""property tax controls"" earlier in his term. But even the governor’s press events and announcements of the $100 million relief law have reflected confusion over his message. The evidence is in the wildly divergent media coverage. A Green Bay TV station said: ""Depending on the value of your home, the average homeowner will save between $13 and $20 in December and $680 over the next 4 years."" A La Crosse TV station reported that Walker’s $100 million cut ""will save homeowners about $680 over four years."" A Milwaukee TV station said the legislation is expected to save $680 million over four years. None of those descriptions hit the mark. Four-year bottom line Walker did give one small clue in the e-update that his analysis wasn’t just on the two years covered by the $100 million legislation. Walker refers to ""$680 over four years."" According to Webster, the ""four years"" was used because the savings reference is not just to the recent legislation, but to four years of reforms and belt-tightening that included freezing or greatly restricting how much school districts and local governments could collect from local taxpayers. With that in mind, we compared the four-year change in the median property tax bill under Walker vs. Doyle. Hard numbers, not a hypothetical. The median bill was $2,963 when Walker came in, and is projected to be $2,954 in year four of his term, based on decisions already made. That’s a drop of $9, the result of three years of annual declines followed by an increase in 2014 that is projected to eat up most of the earlier cuts. By contrast, the four straight annual increases in Doyle’s last four years resulted in a net increase of $230 in the median tax bill. Our rating Walker said that with a bill bringing $100 million in property tax relief, ""the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680 over four years."" The claim in an e-newsletter strongly suggests $680 in hard savings from that tax relief bill, or at the very least during Walker’s four years, but we found nothing to back up that number or anything close to it. You can only get to it using a rough hypothetical scenario based on some big assumptions, and can make a case for $239 in four-year savings compared to the four years prior to his term. But Walker’s newsletter doesn’t disclose that his number is hypothetical, misleading the reader into thinking that the median tax bill actually has dropped by $680. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

Conservative group says Mary Landrieu backs Obamacare even as it decreases full-time employment
","Heading into the 2014 elections, Republicans have targeted several U.S. Senate seats in their bid to flip partisan control of the chamber. One of these targeted incumbents is three-term Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. A full year before the election, one conservative group -- Americans for Prosperity, founded by billionaire libertarian brothers David and Charles Koch -- has already begun to air a 30-second spot critical of Landrieu. The ad ties Landrieu to President Barack Obama’s health care law. As ominous music plays in the background, a narrator highlights Landrieu’s past support of the law and an on-screen headline flashes on the screen: ""New mandates are already reducing full-time employment."" ""Louisianans told Mary Landrieu to vote ‘no’ on Obamacare. Instead she sided with Barack Obama,"" the narrator says. ""Now we’re paying the price."" The mandate in question is a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires companies that employ 50 or more full-time workers -- those that work 30 hours a week -- to provide health insurance or else face a penalty. This provision of the law has led some to speculate that large companies will cut back on hours, or on employees, to avoid incurring the added costs. But is there evidence that ""new mandates are already reducing full-time employment,"" as the ad says? We took a look. Economy looms large The headline used in the ad came from an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, which has been critical of Obama’s health care law. The unsigned editorial, published in February, is largely based on anecdotal evidence from companies, mostly in the fast food sector, that have said they plan to reduce employee hours in the wake of the mandates. However, independent analysis suggests that the recession and the slow recovery are a bigger culprit than Obamacare, at least so far. As we noted when we checked a recent claim by CNBC’s Maria Bartiromo, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco puts the current situation into context. The recession drove up the fraction of part-time workers from about 17 percent in 2007 to a peak of 19.7 percent in 2010. It has declined since then. As of the latest data, it stands at 19 percent. The study’s bottom line is that recessions drive up the fraction of the workforce who are in part-time jobs when they would rather be working full-time. The 1983 recession pushed the share of part-timers to 20.3 percent. That’s significantly higher than the peak for the most recent recession. What’s different this time though is that the part-time employment rate has remained higher for many more months than in past recessions. The authors put the cause squarely at the feet of the overall economy. ""The U.S. labor market has recovered only about three-fourths of the jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath, which leaves finding a full-time job still challenging for many workers,"" they said. ""General labor market slack remains the key factor keeping part-time employment high."" The report considers whether the Affordable Care Act could be shaping employers' hiring decisions, but concludes that other factors -- including long-standing IRS rules -- suggest the ACA has not made a significant change. ""Before the law was passed, most large employers already faced IRS rules that prevented them from denying available health benefits to full-time workers. These rules gave employers an incentive to create part-time jobs to avoid rising health benefit costs."" Indeed, a Wall Street Journal article published by the paper’s news side,  titled ""Don’t Blame Health Law for High Part-Time Unemployment,"" concurs with this analysis. When we contacted Americans For Prosperity, the group pointed us to an article in Investor’s Business Daily that catalogs all the companies that are curbing hours to less than 30 a week as a result of Obamacare. But the data is less convincing than it appears. Most of those employers, many of them in the public sector, are cutting back the hours of workers who already aren’t considered full-time -- a development that wouldn’t provide full support for the contention that ""new mandates are already reducing full-time employment."" Of the 350 employers listed, about 200 said they will be limiting the hours of their part-time work force, and dozens others were cutting hourly workers or positions for student teachers, adjunct professors, or similar jobs that would not have been counted as full-time workers anyway. Our ruling In its ad, Americans for Prosperity said that new mandates from Obamacare ""are already reducing full-time employment."" It’s a plausible scenario, but as of now, it’s largely speculative, with the evidence anecdotal rather than statistical. Across the economy as a whole, part-time employment is high, but independent observers say that has to do with the recession and the weak recovery rather than Obama’s health care law. We rate the Americans For Prosperity claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096728980>],/factchecks/2013/nov/06/americans-prosperity/conservative-group-says-mary-landrieu-backs-obamac/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Glenn Beck']","
Glenn Beck says Barack Obama knew that 50% of Americans would lose health insurance
","The attacks continue against President Barack Obama for saying ""if you like your plan, you can keep your plan."" Latest up: Conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck, who claims Obama knew what was going to happen all along. ""They had the studies that showed that up to 80 million people would lose their health insurance,"" Beck said Monday on his radio show, which is syndicated on more than 400 stations. ""Now we find out this week that number is actually 125 million. Half of the population in the United States, they knew half of the population of the United States would lose their doctor and their health insurance? ""And yet he went on the road over and over and over and over and over and over again and said, ‘You'll be able to keep your doctor if you like him, you’ll be able to keep your health insurance,’ when they knew half of the population the United States would lose their health insurance."" That’s a hefty claim. Not only is Beck saying half of all Americans will lose their health insurance because of the health care law, but that Obama knew about it in advance. (Fox News had a more limited version of this claim with millions of Americans losing coverage.) The Glenn Beck Show told us that the claim came from an article in the Daily Caller, a conservative news website.The item cites the work of Christopher Conover, a scholar at the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. (The American Enterprise Institute and its scholars have generally been critical of the health care law.) Conover, in his work, looks ahead to the end of 2014 and makes a few predictions. ""Of the 189 million Americans with private health insurance coverage, I estimate that if Obamacare is fully implemented, at least 129 million (68 percent) will not be able to keep their previous health care plan,"" Conover said. That’s where Beck gets his 125 million figure, which for the record, is about 40 percent of the population of the United States, not 50 percent. Conover continues, ""But of these (129 million), ‘only’ 18 to 50 million will literally lose coverage, i.e., have their plans entirely taken away. ... The rest will retain their old plans but have to pay higher rates for Obamacare-mandated bells and whistles."" Whether you believe Conover or not is irrelevant when considering Beck’s claim. Conover says 18 million to 50 million people will lose coverage -- Beck said 125 million, a gross exaggeration. But that’s only one issue. Conover himself takes issue with Beck’s use of his estimate. ""In my view, ‘lose their health insurance’ without any further qualification has a different connotation than ‘not be able to keep their previous health plan’,"" he told PunditFact. ""Absent any further explanation, many might interpret ‘losing’ health coverage as becoming uninsured."" What they did know So Beck’s claim is obviously wrong as to the number. But he also indicated Obama knew that millions of people would lose their health insurance. What evidence is there of that? It is not as though the White House was unaware that the Affordable Care Act would change business as usual, in both the individual and group health insurance markets. (The individual market is where people buy insurance on their own; the group market is when an employer does the buying and tells workers what their options are.) An NBC report cited four administration sources who said that early on, they expected that up to three-quarters of people in the individual market would get cancellation notices. And back in 2010, analysts from three federal departments, Labor, Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service, looked at the number of employer-based plans that would change to the point that they would lose their grandfathered status. But that study did not try to account for a very common situation -- plans that changed, but already met the new health care law’s standards. According to a 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, about three-quarters of all employer-sponsored health plans already meet the criteria of the Affordable Care Act. In other words, employers plans may have changed, but it’s not directly and unilaterally attributable to the health care law. Beck’s staff offered a narrower view -- that any plan that changes means you have lost your insurance. If so, then many employees have been losing their insurance every year as plans change, premiums increase, or co-pays swing one way or the other. Conover said part of the point of his analysis is that plans will change but coverage would remain. The best way to describe his analysis, he said: ""Half of those with private insurance would be unable to keep their pre-ACA plans."" Other experts PunditFact spoke with agreed that there’s a big difference between losing your health insurance and seeing your plan change. ""It does not mean that someone is losing their insurance plan,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""The situation is different in the individual market, where plans (many of which offer limited coverage) are being canceled by insurers. But the individual market only represents about 5 percent of the country."" Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, was equally emphatic. ""Losing grandfathered status does not mean that you lose your health insurance,"" Harrington said. Our ruling Beck said that when Obama promised that people could keep the plans they like, he knew that half of all Americans would lose their health insurance. Beck is wrong in every respect. The primary study he relied on contradicts his number, saying that at most 50 million people would lose coverage, not 125 million. Beck’s staff said they believe that any change in a plan means you have lost your health insurance. Not even the author of the study Beck cites agrees with that, nor do the other health policy experts we consulted.   On top of that, the government estimate of the number of plans that would be fully exposed to the new insurance requirements actually says little about the law’s impact. The law’s requirements would only matter for plans that did not measure up; many of them already did. Lastly, there is no evidence that Obama knew or believed that a calamity of this magnitude was in store. The claim needs a checkup. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097250D80>],/factchecks/2013/nov/06/glenn-beck/beck-says-obama-knew-50-americans-would-lose-healt/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says that what he'd said was you could keep your plan 'if it hasn’t changed since the law passed'
","President Barack Obama’s attempt at explanation has only fanned the flames of controversy over his campaign line, ""If you like your health care, you can keep it."" Obama was already dealing with a troubled rollout of the healthcare.gov website when reports of health insurance cancellation notices for many Americans started arriving. Such notices have been common only for people purchasing insurance on the individual market, which accounts for about 5 percent of Americans, a small minority. But the existence of people in that situation struck many critics as contradicting his like-it, keep-it promise on its face. Obama’s speech on Nov. 4, 2013, at a meeting of Organizing for Action, his campaign organization, seemed to offer a new, and confusing, wrinkle. ""Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" Obama said. The way we read that comment -- and, judging by the contentious White House press briefing the following day, the way other Washington journalists read it -- was that Obama was saying that people had been misreporting the pledge he had made. It wasn’t that he said ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" -- it was ""if your plan hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" you can keep it. We wondered whether there was any evidence that Obama had used this particular caveat in the past. Some background on ""grandfathering"" First, a brief reminder of why some Americans are getting cancellation notices. Under the new law, policies must cover a comprehensive set of benefits, including emergency care, maternity care, mental health or prescription drugs. If they don’t, they can be ""grandfathered"" in, but only if the plans have not been changed at all. To be grandfathered, the plans must have operated continuously since before the law’s enactment in 2010 and have made no significant changes. This means the insurer can keep the insurance plan essentially as is, without having to implement many (though not all) of the new law’s requirements. But the regulations defining what constitutes a significant change are tight -- and if it’s breached, the plan is on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policy holders 90 days notice, as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering. That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders are receiving in the mail. We should note that Obama’s comments often were aimed at the general public. And most people do get to keep their health plans under his law, especially those who get insurance through work or Medicare. His plan specifically left the existing health care system in place while reducing the ranks of the uninsured. Here at PolitiFact, we noticed last year that Obama’s comments were too sweeping and that it was unlikely that all Americans would be able to keep their insurance through thick and thin.    Obama’s comments before the law passed We decided to look back from all the public statements we could find about people being allowed to keep their plans. We found at least 37 times where Obama made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it. (See all 37 mentions.) Obama used the phrase 26 times between his inauguration and when the law passed. Here are four representative samples. • Town hall in Green Bay, Wis., June 11, 2009: ""No matter how we reform health care, I intend to keep this promise:  If you like your doctor, you'll be able to keep your doctor; if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan."" • Remarks at the American Medical Association, June 15, 2009: ""I know that there are millions of Americans who are content with their health care coverage -- they like their plan and, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor. They trust you. And that means that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what."" • Presidential weekly address, July 18, 2009: ""Michelle and I don’t want anyone telling us who our family’s doctor should be – and no one should decide that for you either. Under our proposals, if you like your doctor, you keep your doctor. If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance. Period, end of story."" • Remarks in Fairfax, Va., March 19, 2010: ""If you like your doctor, you’re going to be able to keep your doctor. If you like your plan, keep your plan. I don’t believe we should give government or the insurance companies more control over health care in America. I think it’s time to give you, the American people, more control over your health."" Obama’s comments after the law was signed We found 10 instances after the law was signed when Obama made the pledge again. In remarks in Portland, Maine, on April 1, 2010, Obama said that ""if Americans like their doctor, they will keep their doctor.  And if you like your insurance plan, you will keep it.  No one will be able to take that away from you.  It hasn’t happened yet.  It won’t happen in the future."" After the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations for the law on June 14, 2010, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius blogged: ""The bottom line is that under the Affordable Care Act, if you like your doctor and plan, you can keep them."" Obama then repeated the remarks during several campaign events in 2012, as well as at the first presidential debate in Denver on Oct. 3, 2012: ""If you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around."" Finally, as recently as a few weeks ago, Obama was playing down the impact. ""Now, let’s start with the fact that even before the Affordable Care Act fully takes effect, about 85 percent of Americans already have health insurance -– either through their job, or through Medicare, or through the individual market,"" he said in a speech in Largo, Md., on Sept. 26. ""So if you’re one of these folks, it’s reasonable that you might worry whether health care reform is going to create changes that are a problem for you -- especially when you’re bombarded with all sorts of fear-mongering. So the first thing you need to know is this: If you already have health care, you don’t have to do anything."" Overall, we didn’t find one instance in which Obama offered a caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn’t changed after the law’s passage. What the White House says The day after Obama claimed that he’d said ""you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" reporters grilled White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Carney claimed Obama was referring to the rules that Sebelius issued in June 2010. ""When the rule was issued, Secretary Sebelius and others spoke to the press about it … if insurance companies changed their plans or canceled their plans, they would give up the opportunity to grandfather those plans in June of 2010. There was a fair amount of coverage of that in major newspapers."" The White House pointed us to a June 14, 2010, telephone news conference with Sebelius on the rules. ""If you have a plan that you like, you keep it, but if indeed insurers or employers decide to make dramatic shifts, to the detriment of employees, huge cost shifts, huge increases in deductibles, slashing benefits, whatever, they then no longer qualify for the grandfather status, because that's really a change in the plan, and that isn't a plan that most people like very much,"" she said. The White House also offered several news articles published at the time that reported Sebelius’ comments. Of these, the one that offered the most critical assessment of the grandfather provisions, in the Washington Post, got most of its ammunition from Republicans, quoting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying on the Senate floor, ""This is not only bad news for the vast majority of Americans who like the plans they have. It also flatly contradicts the president's repeated promises."" By contrast, what Sebelius told the Post focused on the positive rather than the negative aspects of the change. She said Obama ""wanted to make sure as much as possible that if people had plans that they liked they got to keep them and balance that with, you know, some overall protection for consumers,"" the Post reported. Finally, the White House provided a series of other comments in which the administration offered a more nuanced formulation of the like-it, keep-it policy, but they were all in the past month, during the time when such criticism was already emerging. Our ruling According to Obama, ""What we said was you can keep (your plan) if it hasn’t changed since the law passed."" But we found at least 37 times since Obama’s inauguration where he or a top administration official made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it, and we never found an instance in which he offered the caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn’t changed after the law’s passage. And seven of those 37 cases came after the release of the HHS regulations that defined the ""grandfathering"" process, when the impact would be clear. While Sebelius’ teleconference with reporters did provide that sort of caveat, in other instances, such as her blog post, she focused on the upside, not the downside. Her one mention of the extent to which grandfathered plans might be doomed strikes us as the equivalent of the fine print on a television commercial running in heavy rotation. Obama is ignoring the overwhelming majority of times he addressed the issue, where most people would have heard it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809767C500>],/factchecks/2013/nov/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-what-hed-said-was-you-could-keep/

The district seeks tax money from local governments along the proposed rail route, including from the city of Austin, and has said it’s working with Union Pacific on building an alternate freight rail line so the passenger line could use existing tracks. Covington summed up: ""There’s not enough concrete and available real estate for adding new lanes"" ad ""in finitum."" We’re not judging how to relieve congestion. But did a presentation really envision 26 additional lanes on I-35? As of November 2013, the highway had up to four lanes in each direction in Austin, not counting frontage roads. Also, perhaps surprisingly, I-35 through Central Austin had about 4 percent less traffic in 2012 than it had in 2002, according to a Sept. 12, 2013, American-Statesman illustration, though it indicated the highway had as much as 65 percent more traffic in other portions north and south of downtown. To our initial inquiry about this multi-lane statement, Joseph Black, the district’s rail director, told us by phone the column got the forecasted lane counts backward. Black said the described presentation indicated a potential need for a dozen lanes southbound and 14 lanes northbound. By email, Covington then guided us to the relevant May 25, 2012, presentation to the Transit Working Group, whose membership included Austin City Council members and people from the greater community. The presentation, which we watched on the city’s online video, is dense. We promise some unpacking around the bend. At the meeting, Doug Allen, then an executive with Capital Metro, Austin’s regional public transportation provider, prefaced the lane-count detail by saying that officials worked with CAMPO’s ""travel forecast model"" to estimate how much additional capacity would be needed on I-35 and MoPac Boulevard through 2035 assuming both highways had ""unlimited capacity."" An assumption was that each highway lane would be capable of moving 2,000 people an hour, he said. Allen said the analysis, tied to projected automobile trips, suggested  that six additional lanes would be needed in each direction on MoPac between U.S. 290 on the north side of the city and 38th Street, or a dozen total. He said the model indicated that 14 northbound lanes would need to be added to I-35 from Texas 71 to East Oltorf Street. That’s (gulp) 26 lanes of additional highway. Then again, Allen said that if the hoped-for passenger rail and other people-moving infrastructure comes to be instead, the described MoPac expansion would not be needed and I-35 would need only four additional northbound lanes, according to the research. By telephone, a Capital Metro administrator, Todd Hemingson, made a run at clarifying the presentation. We wondered, for starters, about the references to MoPac crossing 290 in North Austin and East Oltorf in South Austin, which it does not. Hemingson said the presentation used the equivalent of 290 and Oltorf as if they were invisibly extended to cross MoPac and I-35. And why did the calculations assume the highways had ""unlimited capacity?"" It’s an ""all or nothing"" scenario, Hemingson said. ""In the transportation planning world, the purpose is to give you a suggestion of how much demand is actually out there without regard to the physical reality of how much could be carried by the highways available. Basically that’s it. It’s just a high-level look at the total demand for transportation in the"" I-35 ""corridor."" But isn’t that assumption unrealistic? ""Sure,"" Hemingson said. ""In the real world, people would take alternate routes"" if congestion grew overwhelming on the highways. ""Over time, they would choose to live or work in a different locations. If it really took three hours to commute from Round Rock to downtown"" Austin, ""people wouldn’t do it. They’d choose to live in a different way."" And was the point of the presentation that if the rail district’s passenger lines don’t happen, the highways will have to expand by that much? Negative, Hemingson said, the message is that the only way the Austin region will get close to ""getting a handle on the congestion coming our way given the amazing amount of population growth that is coming is by doing all of the above,"" Hemingson said, meaning highway expansions, changes in commuting patterns, car pooling and passenger rail, with necessary funding still to be corraled. ""It’s not reasonable to accommodate growth only by building more lanes,"" he said. Later, we asked Maureen McCoy, CAMPO’s executive director, to interpret the forecast. She stressed that the projection assumed traffic would never be stop-and-start on the highways. She then said the indicated additional lanes are ""probably a nonstarter because of the magnitude,"" a reference to the destruction of buildings potentially needed to add so many lanes. ""I don’t even know what you would have to wipe out to make that happen,"" McCoy said. The University of Texas has buildings on both sides of I-35 including a football practice facility and the UT Press. Also, hundreds of residents live near the two highways. Of late, McCoy said, there are no additional lanes contemplated for I-35; no funding has been identified. On the other hand, American-Statesman transportation writer Ben Wear wrote in an Oct. 28, 2013, commentary that the state and city of Austin have been studying the addition of a lane on each side of the highway. ""Odds are they will be ‘express lanes’ like what is about to be added to MoPac north of Lady Bird Lake,"" Wear wrote, adding that this means the lanes would be tolled. Finally, we asked Hemingson to elaborate on the traffic projections feeding into the lane forecasts. He replied by email that the calculations were based on travel demands for 2035 in CAMPO’s long-range transportation plan. He also added that two Capital Metro employees who worked on the ""thought experiment"" are no longer at the agency, ""so recollecting the exact details is difficult at best."" He also emailed us a drawing he attributed to Allen, the staff member who made the 2012 presentation. The drawing, which we’ve posted here, shows that under the ""all-or-nothing"" scenario, the number of lanes on MoPac, which had up to four lanes in each direction as of November 2013, would reach seven between Texas 71 and downtown Austin, topping out at five from Lady Bird Lake to 38th Street. The drawing shows I-35 lanes topping out at 10 between 290 and 38th Street and running from seven to nine lanes on other stretches between Texas 71 to the south and U.S. 183 to the north. It all adds up to 26 lanes, the drawing indicates. Hemingson also said that ""while vehicle miles traveled per capita in the region (and nationally) are down, that would not be reflected in this analysis because at the time it was run the CAMPO model inputs were based on a 2005 ‘base year,’ and so would not have been updated to reflect lower driving rates from that time to present."" By phone, Covington agreed that his claim misstated the direction of the declared highway lanes and left out MoPac. It’s ""nitpicking,"" he said, to note that his statement also didn’t mention that the projections assumed both highways could expand without constraints. Our ruling Covington said that a presentation indicated that to meet anticipated traffic demands by 2035, I-35 between Austin and Round Rock will need a dozen additional lanes going north and 14 additional southbound lanes. Those tallies reflect what a working group was told in May 2012, but the presentation by a Capital Metro official (using a CAMPO modeling system) projected 26 additional lanes on I-35 as well as MoPac; Covington’s column did not mention the second highway and also flipped the predicted number of northbound and southbound lanes. Perhaps more significantly, these lane counts were rooted in the assumption that both highways would have unlimited capacity, presumably including space enough to be widened dramatically despite the existence of major facilities along I-35 and hundreds of homes near both highways. We rate this partly accurate claim, which leaves out critical details and draws on a projection with an unrealistic assumption, as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Brad Blakeman says 90% of farm bill goes to food stamps
","The expiration of a piece of the 2009 federal stimulus bill means a $5 billion cut this month to the federal food stamp program, called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. That has some lawmakers scrambling to restore the funding, and others fighting to stop it. Count pundit and former George W. Bush aide Brad Blakeman among those who wants to see the cut stand. Appearing on Fox News Channel, Blakeman criticized efforts to restore food stamp funding as part of an agriculture bill. ""When is a farm bill not a farm bill? When 90 percent of it is for food stamps,"" Blakeman said. In this fact-check, we look at whether food stamps, now called SNAP, really amountsto such a large share of spending in the farm bill. Blakeman referred us to data from the U.S. Agriculture Department that shows average yearly participation in SNAP and total federal spending rising every year since 2007. Back then, about 26 million people relied on the program. Today, the number is closer to 47 million. Spending in 2012 reached about $75 billion. Blakeman also sent a link to a Reuters news article that estimated that about two thirds of the farm bill went to nutrition programs. Blakeman told PunditFact his point was that while the farm bill might sound like it deals with agriculture, it largely funds an entitlement program. He’s largely right. Let us explain. A bit about the farm bill The farm bill is second only to the weather in shaping agriculture in the United States. It determines how many billions of dollars will flow to farmers and companies that grow and distribute basic crops such as corn, wheat, sugar and soy beans. It touches subsidies, crop insurance, land conservation, organic agriculture and rural development. But it also serves as the mechanism by which low-income Americans receive nutrition assistance. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, estimated the 10-year cost for the Senate farm bill at $955 billion and the House version at $921 billion. The nutrition component, according to the CBO, is 80 percent in the Senate and 79 percent in the House. That’s close, but a little short of the figure Blakeman used on Fox News.   2013 farm bill budget: CBO score FY2014-23 Senate proposal Percent of total House proposal Percent of total Commodities $41B 4% $40B 4% Nutrition $760B 80% $725B 79% Crop Insurance $89B 9% $93B 10% Total $955B $921B   The House in particular has had a difficult time achieving consensus on farm policy. Hard-line conservatives have wanted deeper cuts in subsidies to producers and SNAP. Liberals have objected to the many ways that the Republican plan would make SNAP less generous and make it harder to qualify for benefits. The House and Senate are now hammering out a version both bodies can pass. Funding for SNAP remains a significant dividing point. Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, notes that regardless of congressional action, SNAP spending is projected to decline as the economy improves. ""The reason spending went up is because the program did what it’s supposed to do,"" Rosenbaum said. ""When people lose their jobs, they need more help."" The Congressional Budget Office says that with no change in the law, the number of recipients could be about 35 million by 2022. That is less than the 47 million people today, about half of whom are children, but still more than the total in 2007. A final note: When we told Blakeman that 90 percent was too high, in large measure, he did not object. ""In the future I will say  the ""vast majority"" or 80-plus percent,"" he said. Our ruling Blakeman said that 90 percent of the farm bill went to food stamps. The more accurate figure is 80 percent in the legislation currently under discussion in Congress. The 10 percentage points difference doesn’t change Blakeman’s essential point, but it is enough to bring our rating down a notch. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2E2240>],/factchecks/2013/nov/06/brad-blakeman/brad-blakeman-says-90-farm-bill-goes-food-stamps/

Despite $100 million in property tax relief, Wisconsin Republicans are still raising property taxes?
","Soon it will be December and time for presents -- including your annual property tax bill. Oh, the suspense in opening the envelope: Will this year’s bill be lower or higher? But wait. On Oct. 24, 2013, Republican Gov. Scott Walker used his weekly radio address to herald a $100 million property tax relief bill he signed into law four days earlier. Relief means lower taxes, right? After we heard the opening lines of the Democratic response, put out the same day, we weren’t sure what to think. ""Last week, the Legislature passed Gov. Walker’s so-called property tax relief bill,"" Ashland state Rep. Janet Bewley said in her address. ""Lost in all the hype is the fact that the governor and Republican-controlled Legislature are still raising your property taxes."" So, is the property tax relief real? Is it somehow superseded by property tax increases? And don’t school districts and other local governments help determine how big your property tax bill is? Property tax primer We’ll start by reviewing how a property tax bill comes to be. Every fall, each local unit of government -- cities, villages, towns, counties, school districts, and technical college districts -- adopts a budget for the following year. They subtract what they expect to receive in revenue, such as state aid, license fees, tuition, etc. The remainder has to come from property taxes, which happens to be the largest source of tax revenue in Wisconsin. In total, local governments levy more than 99% of all property taxes; the state claims the last sliver, for forestry programs. Nevertheless, state government plays an important role in how much your property tax bill turns out to be. First of all, the local governments’ levies get reduced by three state tax credits, including the state lottery credit. Second, the state has imposed a variety of caps on how much money local governments can raise or spend. So, even though the locals are the ones levying property taxes, the state puts strict limits on how much they can levy. For example, school districts are limited in the amount of money they can raise in total from property taxes and state aid. On the other hand, school districts can exceed their limits if voters approve a referendum. For municipalities and counties, their levy growth, if any, is limited to the amount of property taxes generated by new construction in their communities. The new law Reining in property taxes has been one of Walker’s priorities as governor. On Oct. 10, 2013, citing growth in state tax revenue, he called a special session of the Legislature to take up property tax relief -- specifically by increasing state aid to school districts. So, the approach was not a simple across-the-board tax reduction. The property tax relief measure was approved overwhelmingly on bipartisan votes -- 82-12 in the Assembly, with Bewley among the Democrats voting for it, and 28-5 in the Senate. The law raises state aid payments to school districts by $40 million (0.92%) in 2013-’14 and $60 million (1.36%) in 2014-’15. But, as we discussed earlier, school districts are under revenue limits. So, while individual levies for school districts will vary, statewide the additional $100 million in state aid to school districts triggers a corresponding $100 million decrease in property taxes. State schools Superintendent Tony Evers pointed out that while the new law ""provides property tax relief for some school districts, it does not increase spending for public schools."" Now, to Bewley’s claim that Walker and the GOP-run Legislature are ""still raising your property taxes."" The state budget In her radio remarks, Bewley argued that despite the property tax relief, the average person’s property taxes will rise. When we asked for evidence, her office cited an October 2013 memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It takes into account not only the property tax relief, but also the 2013-’15 state budget that Walker signed into law several months earlier. In contrast to the property tax relief bill, the state budget was adopted without a single Democratic vote. It passed 55-42 in the Assembly, with three Republicans voting no; then it passed 17-16 in the Senate, with one Republican voting no. According to the fiscal bureau, the property tax for a median-valued home -- $151,148 -- was $2,943. Under the biennial state budget, the tax was to drop by $5 in the first year, then increase by $36 in the second. That put the tax bill on the typical home at $2,974 -- a net increase of $31 over the two years. But with the property tax relief law, the tax on the typical home is now estimated to go down by $18 in the first year and increase $29 in the second. That would put the tax bill at $2,954 -- a net increase of $11. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson agreed with the figures, but noted that property tax increases have been held down under during Walker's first two years in office. He cited an August 2013 Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance report that said total property taxes, not just the portion levied by school districts, rose by 0.2% in 2011-’12 and 0.8% in 2012-’13. That was the first time since at least 1946 that the total levy rose by less than 1% in two consecutive years, the report said. Our rating Bewley said ""the Legislature passed Gov. Walker’s so-called property tax relief bill,"" but the Republicans ""are still raising your property taxes."" Bewley’s right that under the Republicans’ 2013-’15 state budget, it’s estimated that property tax bills will rise, by an estimated $11 over two years for a typical home. But the increase would have been larger without the property tax relief, and property tax bills are affected by actions taken by local governments, not just the GOP-controlled state government. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Bewley a Half True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972CD9C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/06/janet-bewley/despite-100-million-property-tax-relief-wisconsin-/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'Unions', 'Portland Association of Teachers']","
Are Portland Public School teachers being left behind while administrators see raises?
","The Portland Association of Teachers and Portland Public Schools have been engaged in a tense contract battle for months. Most recently, the two sides turned to mediation to help resolve a number of sticking points. Among those differences is the union’s belief that the raise being offered to teachers is too low relative to what has been given to administrators. In a recent newsletter to members, the Portland Association of Teachers wrote that ""administrator salaries were increased to be competitive in the Metro 14; but other school employees were left behind."" (Metro 14 refers to other nearby districts that are used as measuring sticks for hours, pay and other benefits.) The note continued: ""While the Board and Superintendent are asking you to cap your insurance and add a half hour unpaid to each workday, it is only offering you a 1 percent pay increase this year. Educational Support Professionals in PPS … were only given a 1.5 percent raise or less. Their offer falls short of the increase in cost of living and puts us further behind our metro colleagues. Compare this to what administrators have received. Salaries for administrators went up an average of 3.5 percent with the range of increases generally from 1.3 percent to 7.8 percent on July 1, 2013."" There’s a lot in there, but we’re going to focus on this idea that administrators saw their salaries increase while ""other school employees were left behind."" First, let’s lay out what, exactly, was in the Portland Public Schools contract offer before mediation, because some of what was mentioned in the mailer has since changed. All teachers would receive a 1 percent cost-of-living increase. About half of them would also get raises known as step increases based on their experience level. Those would range from 2 to 5 percent. The part in the association’s letter about an extra unpaid half-hour each day has been taken off the table, according to Portland Public Schools. Two other groups of district employees have received their raises: As the mailer noted, administrators saw their salaries increase 1.3 to 7.8 percent, with an average increase of 3.5 percent. The district gave some other represented employees, such as support staff, a 1 percent raise, plus steps when eligible. We see how, based on these figures alone, one could say that teachers and support staff were ""left behind."" But, as always, we wanted some context. We knew from previous school funding coverage that administrators had not seen much growth in their salaries over the past few years. We wanted to know how salaries were increasing over the long term. Robb Cowie, a spokesman with Portland Public Schools, had district budget folks work up a five-year salary history for us. Here’s what we found: If the offer goes through, a teacher with no step increases would see about a 5 percent salary increase compared with the 2008-09 school year. Those at the lower end of the pay scale who receive step increases would see about a 22 percent increase. Similarly, support staff with no steps netted an 8 percent increase under their recently settled contract; those with steps (but at the lower end of the scale) got about 14 percent. Meanwhile, nonrepresented staff, including administrators, saw raises that range from 3.3 percent (for an elementary school principal) to nearly 6 percent (for technical positions). So, the district has been treating teachers at least as well as administrators over the longer term -- if not better in some cases. Now, there’s also the question of how teachers and nonrepresented employees are doing relative to their colleagues in other metro-area districts. This was a little tricky for us. The district thinks salaries ought to be adjusted for a slightly shorter work day because Portland Public Schools teachers are contracted for 7.5-hour workdays as opposed to the eight-hour workdays of those in the other districts. The union, however, pointed out that Portland teachers are required to be available for two hours worth of meetings each week. The district confirmed that was true though insisted those two hours aren’t used each week. The union disagreed. In the end, we decided to compare the base salaries with no adjustments. A salary comparison drawn up by Brock Logan, the district’s director of employee and labor relations, shows that the minimum average salary of 11 comparable districts for the current year is about $37,700, while the maximum average salary is $74,650. Portland falls below both with a minimum average salary of $35,886 and a maximum average salary of $73,101. We asked Cowie for similar comparisons for the nonrepresented staff. For the current year, Portland seems to be near the middle or lower end of the Metro 14 pack. With the proposed increases, they’ll wind up smack dab in the middle with most of the positions they showed us, but with some still far lower. Only middle school principals on the high end of the pay scale do slightly better than their peers (they rank fifth). When we started this PolitiFact Oregon item, we spoke with Gwen Sullivan, the president of the Portland Association of Teachers. We asked whether it was fair to say teachers were getting left behind without any of the previous years’ context. She told us that the letter sent out to members concerned only the current bargaining year and that saying teachers were getting left behind was true in that light. ""It's talking about this year. It's very clear,"" she said. ""As far as the longer term, we didn't weigh in on that to our members."" That brings us to our ruling. Under the contract being offered when the association sent out its bargaining letter, teachers would receive smaller raises than some administrators, steps not included. Additionally, compared to their metro-area colleagues, Portland teachers are coming up short while administrators are pulling even. But, it’s also true that a longer take on teacher salaries show them doing just as well as, if not better, than administrators in their own district since 2008-09 in terms of salary growth. Their statement is partly accurate. After all, teachers wouldn’t see as much of a base increase as administrators under the contract in question, and administrators are doing better when compared with their peers. But to determine whether teachers are truly behind, we think it’s necessary to look at more than one year. The statement ignores the five-year history, which shows that teachers are modestly behind peers in other districts but not Portland Public Schools administrators. We rate this claim Half True. (Note: This PolitiFact replaces and earlier version an was updated to reflect new information.)",[<zip object at 0x000002809C144E40>],/factchecks/2013/nov/05/portland-association-teachers/are-portland-public-school-teachers-being-left-beh/
