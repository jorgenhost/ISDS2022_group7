Kitty Boitnott says Virginia has cut $1.6 billion from minimum school standards
","
The Virginia Education Association says the state has been saving money by lowering public school standards.

""Since the 2008 General Assembly, we have permanently cut biennial funding for public education by $1.6 billion through changes in the Standards of Quality funding formula,"" VEA President Kitty Boitnott said in a Jan. 23 news conference.

The $1.6 billion cited by Boitnott is an eye-popping number. We wanted to know if her figure is correct and if the loss of the funding is, as she said ""permanent.""

The Standards of Quality are minimum mandates Virginia sets forth for public education on teacher-pupil ratios, benefits for educators and basic curricula. The General Assembly sets the benchmarks every two years after considering recommendations by the state Board of Education.

Virginia is required by law to pay 55 percent of the overall cost of the SOQs and local school districts must pay the rest. For this two-year budget cycle, which began July 1, 2010, the state will pay about $9.6 billion toward meeting the SOQs, and localities will pay about $7.8 billion.

Boitnott is essentially saying the state obligation would have been $1.6 billion higher if the General Assembly had not taken steps since 2008 to lower Virginia’s education standards.

Robley Jones, the VEA’s director of government relations, said Boitnott’s figures came from a report on education funding released last month by the Senate Finance Committee. The study contained a table detailing the 10 ""substantive"" reductions to public education programs approved by the General Assembly since 2008. The cuts came to a biennial total of $1.57 billion, and Boitnott rounded up.

The biggest savings came from reducing the number of support positions -- such as clerks, teacher aides and bus drivers -- required by the state. That action removed $754 million in SOQ obligations.

Lawmakers in 2010 found another $513 million in savings by eliminating certain types of equipment and travel from SOQ calculations and changing the formula for estimating health care costs for school employees.

Boitnott, however, is slightly off in her analysis of the the Senate Finance Committee’s data. The table makes no claim that the 10 cut education programs it lists were part of the SOQs, as Boitnott suggests.

In fact, four of the items were not part of the state’s minimum requirements, according to Charles Pyle, a spokesman for the Department of Education. They account for $174 million in biennial costs.

So the real reduction in SOQ mandates comes to about $1.4 billion per biennium. Jones, who provided the information for Boitnott’s statement, said he made an inadvertent mistake in computing the SOQ reductions.

That brings us down to one last question: Are the cuts to the SOQ formula permanent, as Boitnott says?

Technically, they are not. The General Assembly is free to restore the funding, but that is not likely to happen. Julie Grimes, a spokeswoman at the Department of Education, said officials there cannot recall an instance where legislators cut funding for an SOQ program and later replenished it.

When the state reduces funding for SOQ programs, localities often absorb the costs. Most school districts in Virginia are not satisfied with just attaining minimum SOQ standards and fund their schools at far greater levels than the state demands.

The SOQs allow legislators to claim they fund 55 percent of the state’s educational mandates. But a different picture emerges when total expenditures on Virginia public education are computed. The localities pay about 50 percent, the state, the state pays 40 percent and roughly 10 percent comes from the federal government.

Our ruling:

Boitnott said that since 2008, the legislature has permanently cut $1.6 billion in programs from the state’s formula for funding public schools.  She’s a bit off; the actual figure is $1.4 billion.

Boitnott said these losses are ""permanent."" The General Assembly could restore funding, but a spokesman at the state Department of Education said officials cannot recall an instance where lawmakers cut an SOQ program and later reversed themselves.

Did Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality take a disproportionate hit in the 2011-13 budget?
","
In an effort to spare the budget of the Department of Environmental Quality, the Oregon Environmental Council and the Oregon Business Association sent a letter to legislators in January, ahead of the monthlong session that started Feb. 1.

""In the 2011 legislative session,"" the letter states, ""DEQ's budget was disproportionately cut compared to other natural resource agencies. Overall, DEQis budget cuts totaled 18.5 percent, while the Department of Agriculture experienced a 1.5 percent budget decrease, and the Department of Fish and Wildlife received an 18.3 percent increase.""

Is that true? We know DEQ’s job is to make sure our vehicles aren’t smoggy and that businesses aren’t polluting our water. We also know the agency is a lightning rod for legislators who claim it over regulates. We didn’t know it had been hit disproportionately when compared with other natural resource agencies.

Andrea Salinas, legislative director for the Oregon Environmental Council, quickly clarified in an interview that she did not mean to pit DEQ against the other natural resource agencies. She also said they meant to limit the comparison to the two agencies cited -- Agriculture and Fish and Wildlife.

She called the letter a preemptive plea, with projected state revenue down roughly $300 million since the 2011-13 budget was approved in June 2011. We should note that natural resource agencies take up just a fraction -- about $300 million -- of the state’s $15 billion general fund budget. ""Natural resources in the general fund is hurting,"" Salinas said, ""and we’d like to see natural resources in the general fund remain whole.""

See how Salinas refers to the general fund. That’s the part lawmakers control most directly, and it’s what they need to re-balance this month.

In the letter, however, the environmental and business group are talking about the agency’s total budget, which includes federal money, grant money and user fee money, as well as state money.

It’s true that DEQ’s total budget decreased 18 percent in 2011-13, from 2009-11, and that Agriculture decreased only 1.5 percent and Fish and Wildlife increased 18 percent. But other natural resource agencies were harder hit in total funds, notably the Department of Energy and the Department of Land Conservation and Development.

As we’ve said, legislators don’t have control over how much money we get from the federal government, and that’s not what they’re in Salem to re-jigger.

If you look at the part they can re-balance, Fish and Wildlife took a much greater hit than DEQ: a 34 percent decrease, compared with an 18 percent decrease for DEQ. (Yes, the decrease in both DEQ budgets was 18 percent.) For Agriculture, the hit was 14 percent.

That’s a telling bit of information.

The uptick in Fish and Wildlife’s overall budget, by the way, came from a 30 percent increase in user fees and a 12 percent boost in federal money.

The bottom line is that there are other natural resource agencies that have taken greater budget hits than DEQ, whether you measure by total funds or general funds, including one of the agencies cited.

The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate the statement Half True.

One New Jersey: Chris Christie’s talk on state’s jobs situation conflicts with middle-class reality
","
In Gov. Chris Christie’s eyes, New Jersey is on a path to prosperity.

But a political advocacy group says the governor’s view is muddled.

One New Jersey, a 501(c)(4) organization that opposes the governor, criticized him in a recent news release for a lackluster record on spurring employment growth.

""Time and time again, Governor Christie uses big talk to overcompensate for limp action. In his State of the State last week, Christie repeated the catchphrase ‘Jersey Comeback.’ Rather than sprinkling the sound bite throughout his remarks and on the national television circuit, Governor Christie instead should come back to New Jersey and do his job. Because far too many residents are without a job – as the state is down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak,"" a Jan. 26 post on the group’s website states. ""And for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment.

""Governor Christie is more focused on creating additional wealth for his friends and backers in the One Percent than he is creating jobs for New Jersey residents.""

Federal data mostly supports One New Jersey’s numbers. But the statistics need clarification: more recent figures show job growth and the state’s unemployment rate -- at the time One New Jersey put out its news release -- was not statistically different than the national rate.  

The last recession started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. New Jersey hit a prerecession peak of more than 4.08 million jobs in October 2007. The state had about 3.88 million jobs in December, the most recent data available.

That’s a loss of more than 205,000 jobs.

Most of that job loss occurred while Jon Corzine was governor. Since Christie took office the state has gained jobs, adding more than 38,000 jobs since February 2010, Christie’s first full month in office.

With that job growth, is One New Jersey right to claim that ""for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment?""

That’s a reference to the difference between state and national unemployment rates, according to One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne.

""Since February 2011, for every past month for which numbers are available for both NJ and US, New Jersey has been behind the national rate every month,"" Henne wrote in an email.

New Jersey’s unemployment rate decreased slightly from 9.1 percent in December 2010 to 9 percent last December.

During the same time frame the national unemployment rate dropped from 9.4 percent to 8.5 percent.

In January 2011, both rates were at 9.1 percent. So the group’s claim is right for 11 consecutive months, not 12.

Still, those differences are not statistically significant, said Ken LeVasseur, a senior economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. LeVasseur said New Jersey’s rate may be slightly higher than the nation’s, but ""it’s effectively not different.""

To unemployed New Jerseyans, ""the difference in unemployment rates is a heckuva lot more than a question of ‘statistical significance,’"" Henne said. ""Also, a fact is a fact. Plain and simple, New Jersey lags the nation when it comes to unemployment.""

On Feb. 3, after One New Jersey made the statement on New Jersey’s jobs situation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the national unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent in January.  Updated figures for New Jersey won’t be released until March.

It’s also worth noting, as we’ve found previously, that it’s just as unreasonable to blame a state’s governor for job loss as it would be to give him or her credit for job growth. There are too many other factors at work.

Our ruling

One New Jersey said the state is ""down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak"" and ""for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment.""

It’s true the state shed more than 200,000 jobs since its prerecession peak in 2007, but the governor didn’t take office until 2010 and since then that trend has reversed.

New Jersey's unemployment rate has trailed the national rate for 11 consecutive months, not 12, the difference was never statistically significant and it’s wrong to pin blame for the state’s unemployment problem squarely on Christie.

The numbers are mostly right, but they need clarification. So, we rate the statement Half True.

Kathleen Clyde says Ohio among the leaders for provisional ballots in the nation
","
Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said last month that the state’s legislators should repeal House Bill 194, the controversial overhaul of election laws that Republicans pushed through the General Assembly last spring.

Senate Republicans began working on a new voting plan. Democrats, who had led the effort to put HB 194 on next November's ballot as a referendum, said they were prepared to introduce election legislation that would lead to more voter participation and more ballots being counted.

State Rep. Kathleen Clyde of Kent said at a news conference that the Democrats' measures would reduce the number of reasons for making voters cast provisional ballots, make election officials and not voters responsible for mistakes with ballots and require provisional ballots to be counted unless there was clear evidence of wrongdoing.

""Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and many of them go uncounted each election,"" she said.

Provisional ballots are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at the polling station. That could include not having the documentation to verify their identity as a registered voter or a question about whether they voted absentee. Poll workers allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until the problem is sorted out, and if the person is an eligible voter, then the ballot is counted.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check to see if Ohio was really among the national leaders.

We asked Rep. Clyde for her numbers and source.

""Ohio had 204,651 provisional ballots in 2008, the last presidential election year,"" she responded via email. Of that total, ""roughly 40,000 were not counted. Forty-thousand is indeed many.""

Clyde said her numbers came from the Election Day Survey Report of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We checked the report. It said that three states —
California, New York, and Ohio — reported the highest numbers of provisional ballots
cast, accounting for 59.4 percent of the nation’s total.

PolitiFact Ohio found that the numbers also coincided with a  report on provisional voting by the nonpartisan Pew Center on the States.

We also looked at the commission’s report for the 2010 midterm election. That year, too, it said, California and Ohio were the states with the largest number of provisional ballots, accounting for almost two-thirds of all provisional ballots cast nationwide. In Ohio there were 105,015 provisional ballots cast and 11,753 -- or more than 10 percent -- were rejected.

Clyde’s claim had two components.

The first part was that ""Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country."" Data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and from the Pew Center on the States backs that claim. Ohio was among the leaders for number of provisional ballots for both the 2008 and 2010 general elections. 
The second part of her claim was that ""many of them go uncounted each election.""

How many is many? We think tens of thousands of ballots can be classified as ""many.""

In 2008, nearly 40,000 provisional ballots, just under 20 percent, were rejected in Ohio.

In the 2010 election, More than 11,000, slightly more than 11 percent, were rejected. Only three states rejected more ballots. Among states larger than Ohio, Texas, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania all had fewer provisional ballots and fewer rejections.

"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Mitt Romney']","
Did Romney flip on deporting illegal immigrants?
","
In just a few weeks, Georgians will have an opportunity to choose which Republican they want to see battle President Barack Obama for the White House.

The Georgia Democratic Party isn’t waiting for the March 6 state primary to weigh in on one of the Republican candidates, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.

Titled ""Mitt Romney: Distortions,"" a Jan. 27 statement from the state party claimed candidate Romney wasn’t truthful on 10 subjects during a recent debate. The subject that caught our attention was immigration because it’s been such a hot topic in Georgia in recent years.

""Romney claimed that he opposed ‘rounding people up and deporting them,’ "" that section began. ""But just last month, he stated emphatically that people who come to the United States without documentation should ‘go back home and get in line with everyone else’ -- and he has previously made clear that includes even grandparents who have been here for decades and served in their community or in the military.""

The former governor has faced criticism that he’s constantly shifting his stance on issues to appeal to conservative Republican voters. We wondered whether the Georgia Democratic Party was accusing Romney of changing his position on deporting illegal immigrants.

Yes, its spokesman said.

""It’s part of an ongoing pattern of him flip-flopping,"" Eric Gray said.

So do Gray and the party have a point about Romney on immigration?

The Democrats base their claim on a recent interview Romney did with the Spanish-language television network Telemundo before the Florida primary, saying it’s inconsistent with statements he’s made in other interviews and on the campaign stump.

""[Romney] panders to Telemundo, and when he’s in front of Fox News, he says get in line with everyone else,"" Gray said.

By some federal estimates, there are as many as 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. The federal Census Bureau estimates the U.S. population at about 312 million people. The Republican candidates have accused Obama of not being aggressive on patrolling the U.S-Mexican border. Obama has countered that he has put more agents there than any president in U.S. history.

Romney has proposed efforts that would make it increasingly difficult for illegal immigrants to find work in the U.S. and encourage them to return to their homeland. During one December speech in Iowa, Romney used the language the Democrats quoted in their critique, but he did not mention deportation.

""For those who came here illegally, they might have a transition time to set their affairs in order and then go back home and get in line with everyone else,"" he said.

A Romney spokeswoman forwarded us two statements by the candidate, one made in 2007 and the other made last month, that propose similar ideas on immigration.

In 2007, Romney referred to what he described as a ""realistic attrition program.""

""If they, for instance, have a child in school, we may let them complete the school year, and then they return home. When they are home, they’re able to apply for permanent residency or for citizenship or anything else they’d like to apply for,"" he said.

During a debate last month in Jacksonville, Romney twice talked about self-deportation.

""I don't think anyone is interested in going around and rounding up people around the country and deporting 11 million Americans -- or, excuse me 11 million illegal immigrants into America,"" he said.

To strengthen his argument, Gray directed us to Romney’s comments during a January debate in South Carolina. In that debate, Romney said he did not support the DREAM Act, a proposal by two U.S. senators to give qualifying young people here illegally a six-year path to citizenship that must include the completion of a college degree or two years of military service.

Romney then went on to talk about the broader topic of illegal immigration: ""I think we have to follow the law and insist those who come here illegally ultimately return home, apply and get in line with everyone else.""

Now, does Romney mean when he said ""insist"" illegal immigrants return home that he would round them up and deport them?

""That’s deportation,"" Gray said. ""What he does instead of saying deport them, he uses weasel words to say one thing to Telemundo and another thing to Fox News.""

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which believes fewer immigrants should be allowed in the United States, called it ""implausible"" to say Romney has flip-flopped. Krikorian calls Romney’s position ""attrition through enforcement.""

""Romney has been pretty clear in describing a self-deportation policy,"" he told us. ""He’s been consistent on that.""

Krikorian noted that Romney threatened to veto a bill to give in-state tuition to Massachusetts colleges to students who are illegal immigrants.

A spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization that wants the federal government to stop illegal immigration and seeks stronger border patrols, said he hasn’t heard Romney talk about deportation.

""Nobody who has seriously looked at the issue has said the answer is round everybody up and deport them,"" said the spokesman, Ira Mehlman.

Mehlman said it is implausible to conduct mass deportations. He characterized Romney’s position on illegal immigration as being in the mainstream of thought on the issue.

Our conclusion:

PolitiFact Georgia found articles dating to 2006 in which Romney was quoted as saying he didn’t believe ""in rounding up 11 million people and forcing them at gunpoint from our country."" In 2007, Romney told The Boston Globe it was not ""practical"" to deport every illegal immigrant. He has consistently talked about an immigration approach of supporting policies that encourage illegal immigrants to return to their homeland. We don’t see any recent change in his position and rate this one as a No Flip.",/factchecks/2012/feb/07/mitt-romney/did-romney-flip-deporting-illegal-immigrants/
"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Housing', 'Income', 'Retirement', 'Taxes', 'Chain email']","
Home ""sales tax"" e-mail surfaces again
","
""THIS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!"" said the message that arrived in our e-mail box on Feb. 2, which warned of a ""ploy to steal billions from unsuspecting homeowners.""

""Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it?"" the e-mails says. ""That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home, etc."" the e-mail says, adding that ""under the new health care bill, all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% sales tax.""

The e-mail, circulating now in Rhode Island, directs recipients to GOP.gov, ""the Website of the Republican majority in Congress."" It also encourages recipients to forward the message to everyone in their address books.

It turns out that versions of this e-mail have been around for a few years, sparked by a provision in the new health care law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare, that is designed to cover some costs of the program.

In April 2010, Snopes.com declared it False and FactCheck.org determined that it was bogus, a massive misstatement of a tax that would fall on relatively few people.

And one year ago, national PolitiFact gave it a Pants on Fire because it was so deceptive.

Because the e-mail has gotten new life in Rhode Island, we thought we’d remind people about the facts behind this claim.

First of all, the 3.8-percent tax the e-mail cites, due to take effect next year, doesn't apply to taxpayers making less than $200,000 in the year of the sale. (The limit for couples is $250,000 in adjusted gross income.) Any profit from the house sale is not included in the income calculation.

This limitation alone excludes the vast majority of homeowners. The nonprofit, pro-business Tax Foundation estimated in 2010 that this provision alone would make the new tax irrelevant to about 98 percent of families. It would only apply to those with the highest incomes.

Next, it isn’t a sales tax at all, because it applies only to the profit from the home sale, not the sales price itself.

Third, if the property you're selling is your primary residence -- and not a second home, vacation home or rental property -- you can turn a profit of $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) before the tax kicks in.

In addition, the tax is assessed only on the amount of profit that exceeds that limit. (The median sale price for a home in the U.S. was $164,500 in December, 2011, one big reason why the vast majority of Americans won't be affected by the tax.)

(Other property, such as that second home, would incur the tax, but, again, your basic income has to be high enough for you to be hit.)

The 3.8-percent tax is in addition to the existing capital gains tax that must be paid now. That rate is generally 15 percent.

So consider a couple who sells their home for $1 million after buying it many years ago for $100,000.

If they earn $249,000 that year, they will pay no new tax.

If they earn $251,000, they will be taxed. Although the profit on the home sale will be $900,000, the first $500,000 is not taxed. They will have to pay 3.8 percent on the remaining $400,000, in addition to the usual capital gains tax.

The National Association of Realtors (Realtor.org) has an 11-page booklet, ""The 3.8% Tax; Real Estate Scenarios & Examples,"" that outlines various scenarios and shows who will need to worry about the tax.

Our ruling

The chain e-mail claim that ""if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax""  is untrue on so many levels as to be ridiculous.

It's not a sales tax because it doesn't apply to the full sale price of the home, only the profit made in the sale.

It's not going to apply to the vast majority of Americans, only those whose income is more than $200,000 ($250,000 for couples).

It's not going to apply to most people selling their home because they won't be getting $250,000 more than they paid for it ($500,000 for couples).

Because the e-mail wildly misrepresents one aspect of the new health care law, we rate it Pants on Fire.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio said ""No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008""
","
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spoke to CNN on the state's primary day and predicted that the winner of Florida -- which turned out to be Mitt Romney -- would likely be the nominee of the Republican Party.

On CNN, Rubio was asked about the many negative ads that ran during the campaign and if it was a preview of what was to come in the general election.

""I think that's been a part of every campaign,"" Rubio said. ""Unfortunately, it's only gotten worse. No candidate in American history has ever run more negative ads than Barack Obama. I don't think that will change in 2012. Unfortunately people have to get used to it. I think voters see through that."" 
Did Obama earn the mantle of running the most negative ads in American history?

Detailed data on campaign advertising has been kept since the 1996 founding of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which is part of Kantar Media, said Erika Franklin Fowler, assistant professor of government at Wesleyan University and co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. The predecessor to the Wesleyan Media Project, the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, did an analysis of that data for the 2008 campaign. 
The 2008 presidential campaign set a record for political ads; television ads totaled nearly $600 million. Combined, the candidates aired more than 1.1 million campaign ads.

Obama aired 141,541 spots and spent more than $74 million on television ads during the Democratic primary. During the Republican primary, McCain aired 19,581 ads at the cost of approximately $12 million. These are figures for candidates’ spending -- not that of other groups. 

Between June and election day, Obama far outspent McCain: Obama spent more than $226 million to McCain’s expenditure of over $162 million. Obama aired more than 436,000 ads, while McCain aired 337,000 ads. 
The report concluded that Obama bought significantly more ads, but that more of McCain's ads were negative.

""During the final presidential debate Sen. John McCain argued that Obama had ‘spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history,’ while Barack Obama accused Sen. McCain of running an entirely negative campaign,"" the report said. ""In a way, both candidates were correct. .... At certain points in the campaign Barack Obama aired nearly as many negative or contrast ads as John McCain aired altogether. As a proportion, however, it is clear that most of McCain’s ads were negative in tone.""

The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker examined the same claim and cited a study by University of Missouri professor William Benoit who is now a professor at Ohio University. We also spoke to Benoit.

""It is true (Obama) ran more negative ads or ran them more often than McCain, but if you look at the content of the ads to see what they were saying, it was really about the same,’’ in terms of what percentage were negative, Benoit said.

Benoit said he examined specific negative and positive statements in TV ads by the campaigns. One ad could have both negative and positive statements.  
During the primary election, 19 percent of the statements he examined in McCain ads were negative, while for Obama 20 percent of statements were negative.  

During the general election, Benoit found that 68 percent of the statements in Obama’s ads were attacks while McCain’s were 62 percent attacks. (Benoit did a separate analysis of Obama’s 30-minute ad near the end of the campaign and found that only 18 percent of the statements were attacks as Obama tried to end on a mostly positive note.) 
Benoit said that the difference in the general election in terms of percentages wasn’t significant, concluding that about two-thirds of both campaigns' statements in the general election were attacks.

Benoit said he has analyzed TV ads back to 1952, and the only campaign that came close to that was Dwight Eisenhower’s 1952 campaign  -- 69 percent of his statements were negative.

""Obama and a Republican -- Eisenhower -- are about virtually tied,"" Benoit said. ""Eisenhower had one percentage point more."" 
Benoit told us that Obama ran more negative ads because he ran many more ads overall, both positive and negative. 
""He ran more simply because he had more money not because of the tone of the ads he had were more negative. There was no significant difference in the tone of ads both campaigns created,"" he said. 
Rubio responds 
Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told us in an e-mail: ""(Obama) spent way more on TV ads than any other campaign in history, and they were predominately negative.""

Conant also sent a few articles that appeared during the campaign about Obama’s rampant spending including  Washington Post article that stated that Obama and Democratic Party committees spent nearly $105 million the first two weeks of October compared to just over $25 million by McCain and Republican entities.  

Our Ruling

Rubio said. ""No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008, especially in the general.’’  In sheer numbers, that statement is correct: Obama bought many more ads than McCain did, both positive and negative. Nevertheless, two studies suggest that, overall, Obama's ads were not significantly more negative than his rival. He ran the most negative ads because he ran the most ads. We rate Rubio's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-no-candidate-has-run-more-negative-ads/

White House official says 98 percent of Catholic women have used contraception
","
UPDATE: This item prompted debate about whether we correctly interpreted the Guttmacher study. We explored that criticism, and are confident in our original analysis. 
The White House, defending a decision requiring many Catholic hospitals, schools and charities to offer contraception coverage to employees, argues that most women — including most Catholic women — use birth control. 
Cecilia Muñoz,  director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, marshaled this statistic in a Feb. 1, 2012, blog post:

""According to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception.""

The Catholic Church doesn’t approve of ""contraceptive interventions"" to prevent pregnancy. We wondered: Did a reputable study say that most Catholic women have used birth control anyway?

The decision

The Obama administration decision, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Jan. 20, 2012, addressed which preventive services must be covered by most insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the patient.

Those services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012.

But the rule provides an exemption for ""certain non-profit religious employers"" -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. That’s far too narrow an exemption, the  U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops argues.

That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve Catholics — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups.

The government is giving such nonprofit religious groups an extra year to implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them.

The bishops are leading a charge to reverse the decision, but the administration so far hasn’t budged, instead citing statistics in support of its position, such as from the Guttmacher study.

The study

We found the study.  It’s been making the rounds, cited by news organizations when it was released in April 2011, referenced by the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in a January column and underpinning talking points for Obama administration officials speaking on background Feb. 2.

(The Guttmacher Institute, named for obstetrician-gynecologist Alan Guttmacher, says it advances sexual and reproductive health and rights with research, policy analysis and education. Not surprisingly, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops routinely objects to its conclusions and analysis, responding on its website, usccb.org.)

The study, ""Countering Conventional Wisdom: New Evidence on Religion and Contraceptive Use,"" is based on government data collected in the National Survey of Family Growth.

The survey has been conducted seven times since 1973 by the National Center for Health Statistics, with the most recent cycle in 2006-10. The survey includes women ages 15 to 44. Researchers conduct personal interviews to gather information on marriage, divorce, contraception, infertility and health of women and infants.

The source is regularly used for studies on contraceptives and religion, including one we found published by the Catholic Medical Association. (The 2001 article found the high rate of contraceptive use by Catholic women ""not new or surprising."")

Researchers ask women for their religious affiliation, including details about how important a role religion plays in their lives and how often they attend religious services.

Guttmacher’s study relies on data from the survey’s interviews with 7,356 women between June 2006 and December 2008, focusing on those who called themselves Catholic, mainline Protestant and evangelical Protestant.

The numbers are stark, according to the study:

""Among all women who have had sex, 99 percent have ever used a contraceptive method other than natural family planning. This figure is virtually the same, 98 percent, among sexually experienced Catholic women.""

(Interestingly, the Guttmacher study noted that ""attendance at religious services and importance of religion to daily life are largely unrelated to use of highly effective contraceptive methods."")

Bishops’ response

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops responded to Muñoz’s blog post with a post of its own Feb. 3, 2012.

It didn’t directly dispute the 98 percent statistic. But the post did argue it was irrelevant and used in a misleading way.

""If a survey found that 98 percent of people had lied, cheated on their taxes, or had sex outside of marriage, would the government claim it can force everyone to do so?"" the post said.

The bishops also argued:

• The study says 98 percent of ""sexually experienced"" women, a distinction Muñoz didn’t make. (Sexually experienced women accounted for most of the women in the sample, including 70 percent of never-married Catholic women.)

• The more relevant Guttmacher statistic would be use of ""highly effective"" methods of contraception covered by the new rule, such as the pill, IUDs and sterilization, among sexually active women who don’t want to become pregnant — 68 percent for Catholic women and 69 percent for all women.

What the bishops don’t mention is that this statistic looks only at women who have had sex within three months of the survey, and that ""highly effective"" methods don't include FDA-approved contraception such as condoms, sponges or suppositories. And the number they cite still represents most of the women in that category. But the bishops argued that this smaller group must be a minority of the general public, ""yet every man and woman who needs health insurance will have to pay for this coverage.""

So the bishops are using a snapshot in time and arguing it’s a minority of women. At any given point, women would be excluded because they’re pregnant, postpartum, trying to get pregnant or not having sex. The same women might not be excluded in a different month or year. That’s why the ""ever used"" question is relevant.

Our ruling

Muñoz said, ""according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception.""

We read the study, which was based on long-collected, frequently cited government survey data. It says essentially that — though the statistic refers specifically to women who have had sex, a distinction Muñoz didn’t make.

But that’s not a large clarification, since most women in the study, including 70 percent of unmarried Catholic women, were sexually experienced.

Catholic bishops argue it’s more relevant to note the percentage of sexually active women who don’t want to become pregnant and who currently use hormones, IUDs or sterilization — since the smaller number would provide smaller justification for spreading the cost of contraceptives to the general public.

But we think it’s reasonable to note that most women have used contraceptives even if they aren’t currently using them. It means most women would find occasion to take advantage of the new co-pay-free contraceptive rule.  Meanwhile, Muñoz used the phrase ""have used,"" which made it clear she meant women who had used contraception before, not necessarily now.

It would have been clearest if Muñoz had specified she was talking about women who have had sex — and perhaps that the statistic referred to women ages 15 to 44. But her statement was otherwise accurate. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/06/cecilia-munoz/white-house-official-says-98-catholic-women-have-u/

In ""Debbie-Spend-It-Now"" ad, Pete Hoekstra errs on unemployment rate statistic
","
On Feb. 5, 2012, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra -- a Republican seeking to unseat Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. -- released an ad titled ""Debbie-Spend-It-Now."" The ad quickly attracted public attention for its use of a young Asian woman thanking Americans, in broken English, for helping to boost the Chinese economy.

The ad directed viewers to a website that provided additional statistical details. One of the claims on the site is that ""since ObamaCare and the stimulus passed, the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased.""

We decided to see whether that claim was correct.

The stimulus was the first of the two bills to be signed into law -- on Feb. 17, 2009. That month, the national unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent.

Meanwhile, the health care law was signed on March 23, 2010. During that month, the national unemployment rate was 9.8 percent.

And in the most recent month for which figures are available -- January 2012 -- the unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent.

So, since enactment of the stimulus three years ago, the unemployment rate has -- after a rise and then a decline -- remained at exactly the same rate. And since the health care legislation was passed, it has fallen by 1.5 percentage points.

We should note some fine print. The source for the claim on the website is ""Bureau of Labor Statistics, Accessed 1/23/2012"" -- a time before the latest decline in the unemployment rate. The rate on that date was 8.5 percent, but it dropped to 8.3 percent by the time the ad aired on Super Bowl weekend. Using the December figure makes the comparison for the stimulus correct, though the comparison for the health care law still would have been incorrect. Either way, though, it’s not the current figure.

Our ruling

Neither time span offered in Hoekstra’s website checks out, based on the unemployment rate on the day the ad first aired. One shows that the unemployment rate is the same now as it was when the stimulus passed (although it went up in the interim). The other shows that the rate has fallen since the health care law passed. We rate the statement False. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: After we published this story, a reader asked us to evaluate Hoekstra’s claim from the perspective of Michigan, where he’s running for Senate. So we did. In February 2009, when the stimulus was signed, unemployment in Michigan was 12.0 percent. In March 2010, when the health care bill was signed, the rate was 13.3 percent. In December 2011 -- the most recent month available -- the rate was 9.3 percent. So the declines in unemployment over both time spans were actually steeper in Michigan than they were nationally.

Lamar Smith says online piracy and counterfeiting costs the U.S. economy $100 billion a year
","
U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, declared in an opinion column on CNN.com: ""The growing number of foreign websites that offer counterfeit or stolen goods continues to threaten American technology, products and jobs.""

His Jan. 20, 2012, post continues: ""Illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion and thousands of jobs every year. Congress cannot stand by and do nothing while some of America's most profitable and productive industries are under attack.""

Say what costs that much? A reader asked.

Smith’s $100 billion statement has weaknesses, we learned, partly because estimates of the impact of online vending of counterfeit or pirated (as in stolen) software, movies, recordings and other rip-off products ranging from handbags to shoes are hard to corral.

We’ll dip into Smith’s backup after some background.

Smith is a chief sponsor of the stalled Stop Online Piracy Act, which he described in a November 2011 Austin American-Statesman oped column as an attempt to rein in ""a vast virtual market online run by criminals who steal and sell America's intellectual property and keep the profits for themselves.""

""Movies and music are not the only stolen products that are offered by rogue sites,"" Smith’s column says. ""Counterfeit medicine, automotive parts and even baby food are a big part of the counterfeiting business and pose a serious threat to the health of American consumers.""

Smith’s November column says too that the act is intended to target such illegal activity by permitting the attorney general to seek an injunction against a foreign website dedicated to it.

Congressional action on Smith’s proposal, and a Senate approach pitched as protecting intellectual property, stalled out in the wake of a public outcry in January.

Now let’s get back to Smith’s claim that counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion a year.

His spokeswoman, Sally-Shannon Birkel, told us Smith’s figure originated in a February 2011 report commissioned by the France-based Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy, an initiative of the International Chamber of Commerce, whose declared mission is to promote trade and investment, open markets and the free flow of capital.

The report says: ""We find that the U.S. consumption-based share of counterfeit and pirated goods is between $66 billion and $100 billion (based on 2008 data)."" So that’s the origin of Smith’s $100 billion figure. It’s the high-end part of this finding.

Globally, the same report says, such goods had a 2008 value of up to $650 billion.

But Smith’s statement refers to how much counterfeiting and online piracy costs the U.S. economy.  Is the country’s ""consumption-based share"" of such goods -- which the report calls relevant to U.S. businesses -- the same as their cost to the economy?

It’s unlikely. A portion of the report pointed out to us by Sanjay Jain, a Texas A&M University professor of marketing, states that the ""study has not attempted to estimate business losses associated with counterfeiting and piracy. This is primarily because the likely variations and other difficulties associated with estimating substitution effects across substantially different countries and industries introduces an additional level/degree of variables which could undermine our aim to as accurately as possible characterize the magnitude of counterfeiting and piracy.""

After presenting the $66 billion to $100 billion range, the report says this represents ""international trade in counterfeit and pirated goods, domestically produced and consumed goods and digitally pirated products."" Broken down, the report says, this includes consumption of $45 billion to $60 billion of internationally traded counterfeit and pirated products, $12 billion to $14 billion in domestically produced counterfeit products and between $9 billion and $25 billion in digitally pirated products.

Jain and Julian Sanchez, a fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who has urged skepticism about cost estimates for online piracy, each pointed out to us that the presented range questionably assumes that any pirated product would otherwise be purchased at its retail price by the person who obtained it. That’s not always or even often so, they said.

Broadly speaking, Jain said, he has seen no convincing studies on the costs of piracy and counterfeiting to the American economy — unsurprisingly so, he said,  because it’s not an easy problem. ""I don’t know the right number,"" he said.

Sanchez, who told us he considers Smith’s proposal a ""bad bill,"" raised another issue, saying by email that most of the pirated and counterfeited products included in the its $66 billion to $100 billion range have nothing to do with online piracy targeted by Smith’s act.

""People were manufacturing fake Nikes long before the Internet became a mass medium,"" Sanchez wrote, ""so while it might be an interesting factoid to know the size of that market, it’s a red herring if we’re talking about a ‘Stop Online Piracy Act.’""

This ""whole debate,"" Sanchez said, ""has tended to lump together ‘counterfeiting’ (trademark infringement, usually involving physical goods) and ‘piracy’ (copyright infringement, encompassing both physical media sales and online digital transfers). From a policy perspective, this is misleading, if not outright deceptive. Whatever amount is spent globally on fake Nikes imported in bulk by retailers, it has very little to do with the debate over policy aimed at shutting down cyberlockers to reduce illicit downloads by individual consumers.  You might as well cite an estimate of the total economic cost of ‘crime.’ ""

The debate aside, we asked Jeffrey Hardy, director of the international chamber’s initiative, if its report’s $66 billion to $100 billion estimate for the United States’ ""consumption-based share"" for counterfeit and pirated goods is the same as the economic impact of such activities on the country’s economy.

It’s not, Hardy said, though he said the cost to the economy would be a percentage of the $66 billion to $100 billion ""share."" He also stressed that the report’s figures reflected the situation in 2008 and costs have increased since then. His speculation: ""We may already be to $166 billion"" for the U.S. share of consumed counterfeit and pirated goods, which could even turn out to be the current annual cost to the economy.

Hardy also confirmed that the range presented in the report is tied to the retail value of goods though, he agreed, it’s incorrect to assume that in all cases someone who purchases a pirated or counterfeit good would otherwise buy the product at market cost.

All told, Hardy acknowledged, there was no way to pinpoint costs to the economy. The main point was to show that counterfeiting and digital piracy are big problems. ""There is a balance between overhyping or overcooking the pie … and trying to present the fact that the magnitudes are enormous and getting bigger, especially on the digital side of things,"" Hardy said. ""It’s a very complicated process when there’s not a lot of information and (there is) a lot of educated guesses. That’s what economists do."" Hardy said the international chamber has taken no position on SOPA.

Separately, Sanchez said he agrees with an April 2010 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which states that while counterfeiting and online piracy may pose sizeable negative economic effects, they are hard to quantify.

A GAO summary of the report, ""Intellectual Property, Observations on Efforts to Quantify the Economic Effects of Counterfeit and Pirated Goods,"" says: ""Generally, the illicit nature of counterfeiting and piracy makes estimating the economic impact of (intellectual property) infringements extremely difficult, so assumptions must be used to offset the lack of data. Efforts to estimate losses involve assumptions such as the rate at which consumers would substitute counterfeit for legitimate products, which can have enormous impacts on the resulting estimates. Because of the significant differences in types of counterfeited and pirated goods and industries involved, no single method can be used to develop estimates. Each method has limitations, and most experts observed that it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the economy-wide impacts.""

After we summarized much of this research, Smith objected to Sanchez as an expert, saying in an email that  because Sanchez is opposed to the anti-online-piracy act, he ""cannot provide an objective or unbiased analysis."" He stood by his CNN.com statement, telling us: ""Since the U.S. is the largest producer of (intellectual property) that is consumed around the world, one can surmise that a significant amount of that total value is taken from the U.S. economy.""

Our ruling

Smith’s statement draws on a high-end estimate also based on flawed assumptions for the U.S. ""consumption-based share of counterfeit and pirated goods"" in 2008. The cited $100 billion figure doesn’t reflect the costs to the economy, contrary to Smith’s claim; the 2011 study did not assess such costs, which are understandably slippery.

Maybe there is no solid estimate of the cost to the economy. Smith’s CNN.com statement rates False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/06/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-online-piracy-and-counterfeiting-/

Kemp makes case for voter ID law
","
The political divide in Georgia these days often stretches as far and wide as rush-hour traffic on I-285 -- even to seemingly simple issues such as which forms of identification people can use to vote.

Some say Georgia’s stricter policies on voter ID are a way to keep the poor and racial minorities from voting. Those in charge of enforcing the law counter that it helps prevent voter fraud.

""I can attest that every year we investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election and voter fraud,"" Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp wrote The Washington Post in June.

He’s made similar statements in the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Some PolitiFact Georgia readers have asked us to fact-check such statements.

In June, PolitiFact Georgia checked out a claim by Kemp that the elections board had handed out about $275,000 in fines for violations of Georgia’s absentee ballot law. The number of cases since 2007, by our count, was 59.

Could the state really have investigated and handed out fines in so many more cases each year?

Matt Carrothers, a spokesman for the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, sent us numbers outlining how many cases the State Elections Board reviewed in 2009, 2010 and 2011, along with the number of investigations Kemp’s office has opened.

The annual totals:

-- 208 in 2009
-- 234 in 2010
-- 205 in 2011

Some of the investigations consist of multiple people, so the actual number of people investigated could be higher, Carrothers said.

""The numbers that we based that original statement on are not only factual, but the base line,"" he said. ""The real numbers are higher.""

A detailed breakdown of each investigation wasn’t available, but the cases reviewed by the State Elections Board are on its website. The board reviewed 102 cases this year, as Carrothers said. The 2010 total we calculated of people who had cases before the board was about the same as what Carrothers told us. Some 2009 board public orders were not on the state’s website.

From the information we’ve seen and what Kemp’s office shared with us, it appears Kemp’s office has investigated and penalized at least 200 people each of the past three years. That does qualify as ""hundreds"" as Kemp says.

Democratic state Rep. Fred Clark says Gov. Scott Walker cut technical college job training by $70 million
","
In the wake of six straight months of job losses, Republican Gov. Scott Walker put a priority on training workers to fill existing jobs in his Jan. 25, 2012, state of the state speech.

Two weeks earlier, Walker had announced a new council to brainstorm ways to get students better prepared for jobs.

Not surprisingly, Democrats weren’t buying what Walker was selling.

In the weekly Democratic Party radio address released Feb. 1, 2012, state Rep. Fred Clark of Baraboo pointed to the lackluster jobs numbers and criticized Walker’s policies on education. He said students are ""already experiencing the effects of Governor Walker’s damaging cuts to our universities and our technical colleges.""

Clark continued: ""Governor Walker’s talk about job training rings very hollow after he made more than $70 million in cuts to job training programs through our technical colleges.""

We’ve heard plenty about Walker’s budget as it relates to public schools and the state university system, but little about the state’s technical college system, which quietly serves 375,000 students.

Did Walker cut technical college job training programs by $70 million?

Walker’s budget, approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature, did cut more than $70 million from general state aid to the technical college system. Precisely, it was $35.8 million each year for two years, or $71.6 million, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

After years of steady state funding, Walker’s plan amounted to a 30 percent reduction in state aid over two years. The reduction put the state aid at 1989 levels, according to tech college officials. The state budget also froze for two years the amount colleges could levy in property taxes for their budgets. That added to the budget challenge for administrators.

But there are some key additional facts to put this into context.

The state money is only about 12 percent of the revenue base for the colleges. Property taxes provide two-thirds of their budgets, and tuition and fees about one-fifth. So, it was a 30 percent cut of that narrow portion of their overall budget.

And there is another set of numbers, unmentioned by Clark, that is important here.

Most of the officials we spoke with acknowledged that another Walker budget move -- the collective bargaining changes that resulted in greater public employee contributions to state-paid health insurance and pensions -- had partially offset the aid cuts.

Statewide, across the colleges, an estimated 60 percent of the aid cut was offset by those cost-cutting moves, according to Morna Foy, vice president of policy and government relations for the Wisconsin Technical College System. She noted the impact varied widely depending on the timing of labor contracts and other factors.

So the impact of the $70 million aid cut was significantly offset.

Additionally, Clark described the budget move as ""more than $70 million in cuts to job training programs.""

The tech system’s primary mission is largely ""job training"" through specialized coursework. But that’s not all those schools do. They also provide general education, career counseling and skills training for already employed workers, among other services. So it’s impossible to say the $70 million all came from job training programs.

Because nobody has catalogued the college-by-college impact of the aid cuts, we can’t rule on whether the state aid cuts have damaged tech college education, as Clark said.

But our interviews with a sample of the 16 technical college districts found a modest but significant list of program cutbacks officials attributed to the state aid cut: 
Northeast Wisconsin Technical College lost about 5 percent of its workforce, including eight instructors, made some class sizes bigger and cut back on counseling for students and extra help for students who struggle, said Karen Smits, vice president of college advancement.

Waukesha County Technical College discontinued two course programs, said Kaylen Betzig, executive vice president.

Milwaukee Area Technical College consolidated a majority of classes at its downtown campus, according to Kathleen Hohl, spokeswoman for the college. 
Officials with the state tech system officials found that closing class sections and reducing the number of instructors was a common budget-balancing tactic, as was dipping into reserve funds, said Foy.

Several officials mentioned waiting lists to get into programs such as nursing, and said the cuts have thwarted plans to try to get more students into class. In tough economic times, demand for tech classes rises, officials said. They also said Walker’s budget spurred extraordinary numbers of retirements, causing the loss of experienced teachers.

But officials said the overall impact on classrooms was pretty modest or negligible.

""Students were able to get the experience in classroom we have always offered,"" Smits said, emphasizing that outside the classroom, the guidance cuts did mean less service.

Our conclusion 
Clark correctly quantified Walker’s budget as having made more than $70 million in cuts to the technical college system. But it was a cut in general aid, not specifically to job training programs. And some of the cut was significantly offset by other changes in the budget, as was evident when officials told us the impact of the cuts was relatively modest.

Chris Christie’s proposed income tax cuts blasted by Democratic senator as the “second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years""
","
A state income tax cut proposed by Gov. Chris Christie would provide greater savings to more affluent New Jerseyans, but according to Democratic state Sen. Paul Sarlo, that’s nothing new.

As Sarlo sees it, the Republican governor has already cut taxes for the wealthy once before.

At the start of the Jan. 30 Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee meeting, Sarlo, who serves as committee chairman, provided some opening remarks about how the governor’s proposal would disproportionately benefit high-income earners.

""The proposed tax cut plan is measuring up as a potential billion-dollar gift for those who are high-income earners,"" Sarlo (D-Bergen) told his fellow legislators. ""This would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years.""

If the latest proposal would be the second tax cut, what was the first?

Sarlo told us in a phone interview that Christie cut taxes the first time when he vetoed a bill in 2010 to increase the income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million, or the so-called ""millionaires tax.""

But PolitiFact New Jersey found there’s a difference between stopping a tax increase and cutting taxes. The governor’s veto helped millionaires avoid a larger tax rate, but Christie has maintained the rates he inherited upon entering office in January 2010.

Four economic experts also told us the governor’s veto doesn’t qualify as a ""tax cut.""

First, let’s review the history behind the millionaires tax.

In 2009, then-Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat, and the Democrat-controlled Legislature approved a one-year increase in some high-income tax rates. The higher rates were effective for tax year 2009 and reverted to their previous levels on Jan. 1, 2010 -- before Christie took office.

A few months later, the Legislature passed a bill to increase the tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Christie immediately vetoed that bill and a related measure, and state Assembly Democrats later could not gather enough votes to override the vetoes.

Through his veto, Christie ""preserved the tax cut"" provided when the higher rates expired at the end of 2009, according to Sarlo.

But four economic experts argued that the governor’s veto should not be considered a tax cut.

""I don’t believe that maintaining current law by vetoing the bill should be characterized as a tax cut,"" Jim Nunns, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said in an email. ""(Likewise, vetoing a bill that proposed some tax cut relative to current law should not be characterized as a tax increase.)""

J. Fred Giertz, an economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, echoed the same argument: ""Since the tax was never in place, the veto did not result in a tax decrease. The veto kept taxes the same and kept taxes from increasing.""

But Sarlo maintained that Christie’s veto led to a tax cut.

""His actions resulted in the higher income brackets getting a reduced rate,"" Sarlo told us. ""His actions resulted in a tax cut.""

Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts argued that Democrats could have renewed the millionaires tax before it expired at the end of 2009.

""Factually, the tax surcharge (which I believe is what it technically was) expired under a Democratically controlled legislature and a Democratic Governor, before Governor Christie took the oath of office,"" Roberts told us in an email. ""Pants on fire.""

Our ruling

During a Senate committee meeting about Christie’s proposed income tax cut, Sarlo claimed: ""This would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years.""

Sarlo was referring to Christie vetoing the proposed millionaires tax in 2010. But that veto just kept income tax rates at the same levels as when the governor took office. Those millionaires actually got their tax cut under a Democratic governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature -- before Christie took office.

Yet since Christie’s veto stopped a proposed tax increase from going through, we rate the statement Half True.

Patrick Murphy attacks Marco Rubio's record on immigration, Dreamers
","U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy says that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s flip-flop on immigration reform will rip apart families. ""I worked with President (Barack) Obama on this topic while Sen. Rubio changed position,"" Murphy said in a Spanish-language ad Oct. 10. ""Now he opposes immigration reform. Worse, Rubio supports Donald Trump. His plan would deport 800,000 children, destroying families."" Murphy, a Jupiter Democrat, is challenging Rubio, a West Miami Republican, in the Nov. 8 Senate race. Murphy’s ad makes it sound like Rubio is against any changes to the immigration laws, but that’s misleading. Rubio supports a different approach than the one he initially backed in 2013. The threat of 800,000 deportations under Trump also requires further explanation. Rubio still wants changes (just not the kind Murphy wants) Rubio has called for changing immigration laws for years, from his 2010 race for Senate to his unsuccessful presidential bid. Here’s how he changed course. In 2013, Rubio and seven other senators unveiled bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The law required beefed-up border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status. But House leadership wouldn’t bring the bill up for a vote, so it died. Within months, Rubio said that a single comprehensive immigration bill was ""not realistic"" and instead called for a piecemeal approach starting with border security first. ""Such measures would include securing the most vulnerable and most trafficked sectors of the southern border, mandatory E-Verify and the full implementation of an entry-exit tracking system,"" Rubio wrote in his 2015 book American Dreams. Murphy’s spokesman argues that Rubio’s support for reform contingent on first ""securing the border"" is intangible and vague. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us in 2015 that Rubio’s piecemeal proposal is a ""stylistic rather than a substantive change.""   Daniel Costa, an immigration expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, told PolitiFact that Rubio’s approach counts as reform — but there’s concern Republicans could try to leave out the ""piece"" that includes a path to citizenship. ""If all the necessary pieces get done, there’s no problem,"" Costa said. ""But I don’t know of any good reasons to advocate for piecemeal unless you don’t want one of the pieces."" Whose plan is it anyway? The part of the ad about 800,000 deportations refers to people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, called Dreamers by advocates. Rubio spoke against the DREAM Act in 2010 when he was running for U.S. Senate but later showed interest in finding a bipartisan solution to help Dreamers obtain legal status. In 2012, Rubio was working on legislation for this group, but that came to a halt when Obama announced his executive action for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals allowing Dreamers to temporarily avoid deportation. Without the program, they could be deported. Data through June from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services show 741,546 individuals nationwide have received deferred action. Of those, almost 30,000 are from Florida. (Murphy’s ad includes the pending requests to bring the number up to 800,000.) Rubio criticized Obama for bypassing Congress. In 2015, Rubio said that he wouldn’t undo Obama’s program immediately because it would be disruptive, but he said that it would have to end eventually. In February 2016 he said that he would eliminate DACA on day one if elected president. On his Senate campaign website Rubio calls for cancelling Obama’s actions. If DACA is rescinded, Murphy argues that all of those with deferred-action status would get deported. But the particulars of enforcement would depend upon the administration. Certainly they would face a threat of deportation. Hillary Clinton supports DACA but Trump says it’s unconstitutional, pledging in an Aug. 31 speech he ""will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties."" The fate of those with DACA status would depend on whether repeal would mean immediate cancellation of status and the accompanying work permits, or simply non-renewal, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. If Trump wins and rescinds DACA, immigrant advocates point to his call for mass deportation as a sign that Dreamers, too, would be deported. But Trump has made conflicting statements calling for mass deportation, then rejecting it and then saying there is a ""very good chance"" that it would happen. Some DACA recipients could face deportation faster than others. ""Those with removal orders would be threatened with immediate deportation,"" said David Leopold, past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ""Those who don’t face immediate deportation would face a very real threat of expulsion in the ensuing months."" A lot of the DACA recipients’ personal information is on file with the federal government, including their residence, which could make them easier to track down for deportation proceedings. We asked Rubio’s spokesman to provide more details regarding what the senator would want to happen to those with DACA status. He referred us to Rubio’s comments in 2015 when he called for eventually ending DACA with hopes that by that point the government would have passed new immigration laws to include accommodating ""those people that have been in this country a long time, especially the young people."" It appears that Rubio doesn’t want those immigrants deported. However, we are fact-checking whether his plan to rescind DACA would mean deportation for them — and they would face the threat of deportation. Our ruling The ad says Rubio ""opposes immigration reform. Worse, Rubio supports Donald Trump. His plan would deport 800,000 children, destroying families."" Murphy is pushing Rubio's position too far when he says Rubio opposes immigration reform. After a comprehensive bill with a path to citizenship failed in 2013, Rubio called for a piecemeal approach with border security first. He still wants to change immigration laws, but he believes it is politically impractical to do it in one swoop. Some immigration advocates argue that Rubio’s piecemeal approach is a delay tactic and kicks a path to citizenship even further down the road. Rubio does support Trump, who has said he will overturn a program that temporarily allows Dreamers to avoid deportation, affecting about 740,000 people. That action by itself would leave those undocumented immigrants to face the threat of deportation. Rubio has said he supports a legislative replacement for DACA.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim of 'large scale voter fraud'
","Donald Trump tripled down on his baseless claim that the U.S. election system is rigged against him, capping a weekend of lashing out at the media for publishing ""fabricated"" allegations of sexual assault and at Alec Baldwin for impersonating Trump on Saturday Night Live. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans defended the Election Day process at an Oct. 15 rally, but Trump continued to blame the media for ""pushing Crooked Hillary"" and added that rigging is happening at ""many polling places.""    ""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" Trump tweeted the morning of Oct. 17. Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive! The Trump campaign reiterated Trump’s stance that the cards are stacked against Trump, pointing to a column from The Hill's media reporter Joe Concha on how the media could influence voter perceptions of Trump. To be clear, this is not the same thing as a voter committing fraud. The Trump campaign also pointed us to a 2012 Pew Center study that estimated about 24 million, equal to one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are inaccurate. But as we have previously reported, no evidence of voter fraud was found — this is about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. The other piece of evidence offered by the Trump campaign is a 2014 study that says approximately 6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent in 2010. That study has been criticized by election experts for using an unreliable database of Internet respondents. And finally, the Trump campaign forwarded us reports of voting irregularities in swing states like Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia. But these reports were either of reported and prevented cases of fraud or isolated instances. They do not amount to rampant, widespread fraud or assert that the few cases affected the outcome of an election. Voter fraud is rare. Trump talking about it is not. Voter fraud isn’t a catch-all term for any election shenanigan. Voter fraud is rare and refers to illegal interference in voting, such as ballot stuffing, voter impersonation or vote buying. Before his White House bid, Trump tweeted about dead voters delivering President Barack Obama’s victory in 2012, floated charges about multiple voting in the primaries, and suggested that undocumented immigrants ""just walk in and vote"" in some polling places. These charges do not reflect reality. News 21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found 150 alleged cases of double voting, 56 cases of noncitizens voting, and 10 cases of voter impersonation across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these allegations never led to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert on voter fraud, found an even smaller number: 31 credible incidents out of more than 1 billion votes cast from 2000 to 2014. Put it in another way: More people are struck by lightning or attacked by sharks than are accused of voter fraud. When voter fraud does occur, it’s not always intentional. Multiple studies have traced known cases not to willful deception but to clerical errors or confusion. For example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license. So, given the rarity of occurrence, the lack of intent, and a federal penalty of a $10,000 fine or up to five years in prison, experts say it would be extremely difficult to rig an election through the ways Trump has decried. ""I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on Election Day. It would be virtually impossible and a knuckle-headed way to try to corrupt an election,"" Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud, previously told PolitiFact. For double or triple voting to sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake IDs (in many states) or forge their signatures — plus commit to committing perjury the entire time. ""Campaigns don’t pay people to pretend to be people they’re not. That’s too stupid,"" said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S Commission on Civil Rights and author of Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, a book about electoral fraud. So there is no evidence of a massive attempt to rig the election on and before Election Day. Collusion confusion Trump elaborated on his voter fraud theory a few hours after his initial tweet. ""Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?"" he tweeted. His follow-up is not evidence of large-scale voter fraud, though it does bring up a separate concern revealed by Wikileaks. Trump is referring to an email obtained by Wikileaks from then-CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile with the subject line, ""From time to time, I get the the questions in advance."" ""Here’s one that worries me about HRC,"" Brazile wrote to Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri on March 12, 2016. ""Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?"" Palmieri wrote back: ""Hi. Yes, it is one she gets asked about. Not everyone likes her answer but can share it."" The next day, CNN co-moderated a Democratic primary town hall, and one person asked Clinton about the death penalty. But Brazile, who is now interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, has denied that she notified the Clinton camp of the question and says she never had access to the questions in the first place. (The Clinton campaign has yet to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails.) A CNN spokesperson told Politico, ""we have never, ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand."" CNN host Jake Tapper, one of the debate moderators, called the leak ""very, very upsetting,"" and the network has blamed debate partner TV One as the source. This is concerning, but none of it is evidence of voter fraud. Our ruling Trump said, ""Of course, there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day."" Actual instances of voter fraud — such as voter impersonation, ballot stuffing and bought votes  — are extremely rare, often unintentional and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election.

Trump says workers making less, working harder than 20 years ago
","Donald Trump attracted the most attention at an Oct. 13 rally in Florida for denying allegations that he had groped multiple women and for floating a variety of conspiracy theories. But he also offered some economic statistics. At one point, he told the crowd in West Palm Beach, ""Workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder."" When we looked at the data, we found that it wasn’t quite so simple. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) U.S. workers are actually making slightly more than they were 20 years ago, not less To understand the first part of Trump’s claim, we looked at statistics for median, weekly, inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 and over going back just over 20 years. The chart, using data compiled from from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows that between 1995 and 2015, inflation-adjusted median weekly earnings rose from $314 to $341.  The extra $27 in median weekly earnings is an increase of just under 9 percent over 20 years — not necessarily a very impressive increase, but an increase nonetheless. It’s also higher today than it was in any year other than 2009 and (barely) 2010. So on this point, Trump is incorrect. Americans are not working longer Next, we looked at data for the average number of hours worked annually. There is no data for how ""hard"" people work, so we’re using time worked as the best approximation. This chart for average annual hours worked covers 1994 to 2014, and it also undercuts Trump’s statement.  For this statistic, the average number of hours worked fell from 1,822 in 1995 to 1,765 in 2014, a decline of 3 percent over 20 years. And the only years in which the number of hours worked fell below the 2014 level came in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, when jobs and hours were slashed. So here too, Trump is incorrect. Trump may not have been far off All this said, it’s important not to give in to irrational exuberance about these statistics. Trump’s statement would have been more accurate if he had tweaked the timeframe.  Earnings have been largely stagnant since the turn of the millennium -- a somewhat shorter time period than what he had said.. ""Pretty much all the gains were in the late 1990s,"" said Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""Median earnings are almost flat since 2001, so he would have been close to right if he’d said 15 years."" Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, added that ""a more reasonable statement would be that real earnings were higher in some past years than in 2015, although that doesn’t sound as damning as the wording used by Mr. Trump."" Also, Trump would have been closer to accurate if he’d used a different statistic: median household income.  If Trump had said instead that inflation-adjusted, median household income was lower now than it had been 15 years earlier, he would be correct — it fell by 2 percent over that span, from $57,790 to $56,516. It’s worth noting that a long-running decline in the percentage of people participating in the labor force may explain the difference in the wage data and the household income data, said Jed Kolko, chief economist with the jobs site Indeed. As more Americans move from being employed to sitting out of the labor market, these non-working Americans bring down income levels for households even as those who continue to work keep wages steady or increasing. (The retirement of Baby Boomers is one reason for the decline in the labor-force participation rate, but labor-force participation is also declining among Americans of prime working age, for unclear reasons.) Burtless added one footnote: One reason that real wages have not increased faster than they might have is that cash compensation has been falling as a percentage of total compensation. Cash compensation has fallen from 71.4 percent of workers’ total compensation in March 1995 to 68.6 percent by 2015. Because of this, Burtless said, ""many labor economists would point out that total employee compensation is a better and more comprehensive indicator of workers’ pay than is the hourly wage by itself."" Our ruling Trump said that ""workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder."" Adhering strictly to Trump’s language, he’s incorrect —median, inflation-adjusted wages are higher now than they were for 18 out of the 20 previous years, and hours worked are lower now than in any previous year except for the aftermath of the Great Recession. That said, it doesn’t take too many tweaks to Trump’s language to make the claim accurate, either by changing the statistic in question or changing the time frame.

Scott Jones falsely claims judges ruled on allegations of unwanted sexual advances
","Republican congressional candidate and Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones continues to face questions about his personal conduct following allegations he made unwanted sexual advances on a 26-year-old female subordinate more than a decade ago. They came to light in court documents in July. Jones has strongly denied the accusations, which his opponent Democratic Congressman Ami Bera has used against him in campaign ads. The two are competing to represent the 7th Congressional District, which includes eastern Sacramento County and the cities of Folsom, Rancho Cordova and Elk Grove. Jones, who has a law degree, has done more than just personally deny the claims. In an August interview with Capital Public Radio, Jones said two judges had determined the allegations have no merit. ""These allegations that supposedly happened 13 years ago, but were never brought up until in this lawsuit a year or so ago, were found by two separate judges to not have merit,"" Jones said. News coverage of the case indicates the claims about sexual misconduct never advanced to trial for procedural reasons, which is far different than Jones’ assertion that they were evaluated and found to have no merit. We decided to fact-check whether any judges found the claims against Jones have ""no merit."" Claim part of larger lawsuit The accusations about sexual advances are from Tosca Olives, who, beginning as a young sheriff’s deputy, said she had about 30 inappropriate encounters with Jones between 2003 and 2005. Her claims were inserted into a larger lawsuit brought against the Sheriff’s Department by four deputies alleging workplace retaliation, sexual harassment and sexual discrimination by their supervisors. Only the retaliation claim advanced to trial. A jury sided with the deputies on that charge and awarded them nearly $3.6 million. Before the trial started, deputies used Olives’ subpoenaed testimony to support their claims of a hostile work environment based on sexual favoritism. Sacramento Superior Court Judge David I. Brown, however, did not allow the sexual harassment and favoritism claims, including Olives’ supporting testimony, to advance. He did not because the deputies ""failed to initially plead the cause of action or raise it with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing,"" according to a Sacramento Bee fact check. The Bee examined a nearly identical claim from Jones, made in a prepared statement in July, that a judge had found Olives’ allegations have no merit. It labeled Jones’ claim false and described it as ""misleading."" ""Nothing in the court record indicates the judge passed judgment on the merits of Olives’ accusations,"" the Bee fact check said. Jones’ response We asked the Jones campaign to explain the candidate’s statement. Kyle Macdonald, Jones’ campaign manager, noted that Judge Brown dismissed the charges tied to the Olives testimony before trial. He said in an email that decision ""can lead a reasonable person to conclude that the Judge found insufficient merit in them."" Once the trial started, Macdonald said a second superior court judge, David DeAlba, ruled Olives could not testify. He described this decision ""as close as Sheriff Jones can get to an exoneration in this format."" Macdonald added: ""In sum, no Judge did - or would ever - say ‘I find no merit to these allegations,’ but each of the Judge's rulings in that regard is as close as it would get, and can reasonably be taken with that meaning."" A Bera campaign spokeswoman responded to Jones’ claim saying: ""Not advancing to trial is distinct from being dismissed by a judge."" Our ruling Republican congressional candidate Scott Jones recently claimed that allegations he made unwanted sexual advances on a young, female sheriff’s deputy ""were found by two separate judges to not have merit."" News coverage, including a Sacramento Bee fact check, found the allegations by the deputy never advanced to trial for procedural reasons. It also found there’s no evidence in the court record that a judgement was made on the merits of the claims. A spokesman for the Jones campaign acknowledged that no judge has ever stated in court that the claims had no merit. Without any evidence to point to, Jones and his campaign ask the public to make a leap of faith about the candidate’s claim, and interpret what the judges might have been thinking.

Bernie Sanders says Donald Trump plan to end estate tax would give $53 billion break to Walton heirs
","Campaigning for Hillary Clinton on Oct. 5, 2016 in Madison, Wis., the runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination hit hard at the Republican nominee. On one front, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont attacked Donald Trump for his plan to repeal the federal estate tax, claiming the Walmart Walton family would ""get a $53 billion tax break."" Sanders was repeating a claim he had made on Medium, Twitter and elsewhere. We found that broadly speaking, the descendants of Walmart founder Sam Walton could face a tax bill of about $53 billion that would go away if Trump’s proposal became law. But that figure is based on estimates and without knowing the family members’ tax planning. And another Trump proposal would mean the descendants would face capital gains taxes on their inheritance perhaps in the tens of billions of dollars. The estate tax A few preliminary points before we dig into the Waltons’ wealth: The federal estate tax, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, is a tax ""on your right to transfer property at your death."" It consists of an accounting of everything you own, or have certain interests in, at the date of death. For 2016, an estate tax return must be filed if the estate is worth roughly $5.45 million or more. Trump is worth $3.7 billion, according to estimates done by Forbes for its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, although he has claimed he’s worth $10 billion. Clinton, who with Bill Clinton is worth perhaps $62 million, proposes to increase the estate tax for multimillionaires and billionaires, with rates as high as 65 percent. The Walton family Three times, twice on statements made by Sanders, we have rated claims that the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people. (Wealth being assets such as savings and retirement accounts, minus liabilities such as credit card debts and what’s unpaid on a home mortgage.) PolitiFact National in 2012, PolitiFact Wisconsin in 2013 and PolitiFact Virginia in 2016, each arrived at a rating of True. In those fact checks, we considered six people as being the Walton family. However, a seventh family member (Lukas Walton) joined the Forbes list in 2016. Here is their wealth, according to ""real time"" estimates by the Forbes 400 on the day Sanders made his claim: Jim Walton (son): $35.1 billion
S. Robson Walton (son): $35 billion Alice Walton (daughter): $34.9 billion Lukas Walton (grandson): $11.2 billion
Ann Walton Kroenke (niece), $6.2 billion Christy Walton (daughter-in-law to Sam): $5.5 billion Nancy Walton Laurie (niece), $4.5 billion That’s a total of more than $132 billion. Under current law, and if the wealth estimates are accurate, that amount would be subject to a federal estate tax of 40 percent when the individuals die -- roughly the $53 billion that Sanders said. We consulted with five experts: Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center; Howard Erlanger, a trusts and estates expert and emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School; Edward Koren, University of Miami adjunct professor in estate planning and a partner at the international law firm Holland & Knight; Texas Tech University Law School professor Gerry Beyer, who edits the Wills, Trusts & Estates Prof Blog; and Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. According to the experts, there are at least two factors indicating that the actual tax due would be less than $53 billion -- possibly much less. 1. Charitable donations Wealthy people often designate a substantial portion of their assets to be donated to charity upon their death. Those funds are not subject to the estate tax. Koren gave this example: If $100 billion of the total $132 billion were designated for charity, the estate tax owed would be $13 billion, not $53 billion. It’s also possible that some assets could be shielded by tax avoidance techniques, Viard said. 2. Trump’s other proposal In addition to proposing a repeal of the estate tax, Trump has proposed to repeal a tax rule that, if approved, would result in the Walton heirs paying more in capital gains taxes. So, under Trump’s plan, there wouldn’t be an estate tax -- under which taxes must be paid essentially right away -- but an increase in capital gains taxes, which don’t have to be paid until assets are sold. It is impossible to know exactly how much of a capital gains tax the Waltons would face under Trump’s proposed change, but it could be tens of billions of dollars. On the other hand, unlike the estate tax, the next generation of Waltons could defer paying the capital gains tax for as long as they hold onto the assets they inherit. Our rating Sanders says Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walton family would ""get a $53 billion tax break."" Based on the collective wealth of seven Sam Walton descendants, they could face a tax of about $53 billion under the current estate tax law. But that amount is based on estimates of their wealth and it would be reduced based on any charitable donations the family members might arrange for upon their death. Meanwhile, Trump also proposes higher capital gains taxes, which could amount to a tax bill of tens of billions for the Walton heirs -- although that tax wouldn’t be imposed until they sell assets such as Walmart stock For a claim that is partially accurate but needs more information, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b9673993-3e57-4e72-a28f-a546f1e4376e",/factchecks/2016/oct/17/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-donald-trump-plan-end-estate-t/

NRA weakly claims that Clinton said gun confiscation is 'worth considering'
","A National Rifle Association flier shows the jaws of a crane dumping hundreds of rifles into a landfill. ""What did Hillary Clinton say when she was asked about gun confiscation in America?"" it asks in capital letters. The flier answers the question with this Clinton quote: ""I think it would be worth considering doing it on a national level, if that can be arranged."" Next to the quote is a photo of a strident-looking Clinton speaking into a microphone. We examined whether Clinton really did say that U.S. gun confiscation is ""worth considering."" The flier was issued by the NRA’s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. It says Clinton made the statement during a town hall campaign event in Keene, N.H., on Oct 16, 2015. She was asked whether she’d support a national gun buyback program similar to one Australia instituted in 1996 after a mass shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. A month later, Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms at fair-market prices. After that, people possessing the weapons would subject to strict penalties. The buyback program resulted in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons being turned in - roughly one-fifth of all the guns then estimated to be in Australia. Now, let’s go back to the New Hampshire town hall meeting. A tape shows a man asked Clinton this question: ""Australia managed to take away tens of thousands - millions - of handguns and in one year they were all gone. Can we do that and why? If we can’t, why not? (The questioner was wrong in saying the buyback pertained to handguns; it didn’t.) Clinton replied that several nations have tightened their gun laws after experiencing mass shootings. ""In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program,"" she said. ""The Australian government, as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons, offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and then they basically clamped down going forward in terms of, you know, more of a background check, more of a permitting approach. ""But they believed, and I think the evidence supports them, that by offering to buy back those guns they were able to, you know, curtail the supply and set a different standard for gun purchases in the future."" ""Now (U.S.) communities have done that; communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering doing that on the national level if that could be arranged."" Clinton mentioned ""cash for clunkers,"" the nickname of a 2009 voluntary program in which the U.S. government briefly offered payments to people wishing to trade in old, gas-guzzling vehicles. ""So I think that’s worth considering,"" Clinton said. ""I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work. But certainly, the Australian example is worth considering."" The NRA and other pro-gun groups instantly seized on Clinton’s comment, saying the buyback program Clinton lauded is tantamount to a confiscation program, because it backed many gun owners into a corner: They either could sell their firearms to the government or risk prosecution for keeping them. It was, the NRA says, ""an offer gun owners could not refuse."" Three days after the New Hampshire event, the Clinton campaign said the candidate opposes gun confiscation and accused the NRA of distorting her comments. ""Of course Hillary does not support national mandatory gun buyback programs, including those modeled after Australia's program,"" spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote to us in an email. ""She was discussing voluntary buyback programs, which are drastically different than what occurred in Australia and are regularly run by cities across the America."" We asked the NRA if it had any other evidence that it believes shows Clinton is open to gun confiscation. A spokeswoman for the gun group’s lobbying arm questioned whether that was ""relevant"" to our fact-check and didn’t provide an answer. Our ruling The NRA says that when Clinton was asked about gun confiscation, she said ""I think it would be worth doing it on a national level, if that can be arranged."" Clinton made that statement last year at a New Hampshire campaign stop, when she was asked a vague question about an Australian program that gave gun owners one year to sell certain firearms to the government before those weapons became illegal. She left the NRA some room. But the NRA stretches her words to an almost unrecognizable form. Clinton focused her comments on voluntary buyback programs similar to those some U.S. communities have instituted for guns and the federal ""cash-for-clunkers"" program. She was ambiguous about how a U.S. guns buyback program might be structured, saying ""I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work."" And her campaign since has said she opposes gun confiscation. So there’s an element of truth to the NRA’s statement, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That makes it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e238568-ad07-4375-9b74-3a07ed468f3c",/factchecks/2016/oct/17/national-rifle-association/nra-weakly-claims-clinton-said-gun-confiscation-wo/
"['Trade', 'New York', 'Donald Trump']","
No huge impact on New York from NAFTA
","New York State has less than half of the manufacturing jobs it did in 1990, state data shows. But experts disagree about why. Speaking to Fred Dicker on Talk 1300 in September, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blamed the decline on free trade. He specifically cited the North American Free Trade Agreement, a three-country accord negotiated by Canada, Mexico and the United States. He took a shot at his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by placing the blame on her husband. ""Right now our jobs are being taken away from us like babies. They’re going to Mexico and other countries. We just can’t let it happen,"" Trump said. ""New York State has been horribly, horribly hurt by NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton."" New York State’s unemployment rate is almost half of what it was six years ago, and the state has more private sector jobs than ever. But the largest private sector employers in the state are retailers like Walmart and colleges like Columbia University according to the state Department of Labor. But is Trump right that the trade agreement ""horribly, horribly hurt"" the state? A decline in manufacturing Manufacturing jobs were already on the decline in New York State before NAFTA’s implementation in 1994. In 1990, New York State had slightly more than 1 million manufacturing jobs, according to the Department of Labor. By 1994, about 193,000 of those jobs were gone. The decline continued until 1996, when manufacturing jobs held steady for two years. Between 1998 and 2010, New York lost another 340,000 manufacturing jobs. That loss happened at the same, or slower, rate than the years immediately preceding NAFTA. Since then, the job losses have leveled off. The state has lost more than 6,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of 2010, but the rate of decline is much slower than it has been in the past two decades. Why the decline? Experts offer diverse answers on why New York State lost more than 360,000 manufacturing jobs since 1994. But none we talked to considers NAFTA the main cause. In 2011, the Economic Policy Institute released a report that found 34,300 of the state's jobs were displaced because of NAFTA.  Teresa Fort, an expert in international trade from Dartmouth College, called automation the mostly likely cause. U.S. trade with other nations has affected some industries, she said. ""International trade is unlikely to be the main cause of the aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment,"" Fort said. ""But it has negatively affected workers in certain industries and areas that were displaced by foreign production."" The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan research arm of the federal government, also said in a report last year that NAFTA did not have a significant impact on the United States economy because trade with Canada and Mexico only accounts for a small part of gross domestic product. The same report points to the benefits of the trade agreement. Exports to Canada have more than doubled since 1993, while exports to Mexico have more than quadrupled. The U.S. auto industry has seen a significant increase in exports to Mexico under the deal, for example.  The China factor Trump is right when he says increased trade most likely caused manufacturing jobs to leave New York State. Peter Schott of Yale University and Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve wrote a report last year pinning a big part of the manufacturing decline on easier trade with China. As PolitiFact previously reported, lower tariffs set by the U.S. government for China have made trade with that country easier since the 1980s. Researchers say that’s led to the rapid decline in U.S. manufacturing. ""The research evidence suggests that the impacts of NAFTA on manufacturing jobs was limited and were dwarfed by the impacts of imports from China,"" said Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. ""In addition, manufacturing in the north has been harmed by the continued migration of manufacturing jobs to the south, where unionization rates are lower."" Experts also point to the different economies of countries where we trade. Robert Lawrence of the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote earlier this year that lower wages in countries like Mexico provide an incentive for businesses to manufacture there. Wage decline In a separate analysis, John McLaren of the University of Virginia and Shushanik Hakobyan of Fordham University found wages declined in New York State during the implementation of NAFTA. They compared wages by locality from 1990 to 2000. By the end of the decade, wages had declined in New York State as a result of NAFTA, but only by a small amount. ""For me the punchline is that these are all really small numbers,"" McLaren said. ""So what we’re talking about is a change in wage growth over a decade at most around a percentage point for most workers."" Some workers were more affected than others, but on average the change was small. Our ruling During a radio interview, Trump said ""New York State has been horribly, horribly hurt by NAFTA."" Manufacturing jobs have declined in New York State and the United States since before NAFTA was established in 1994. Experts blame the decline on several factors, like increased trade with China, automation and economic incentives for businesses to move manufacturing to other countries. Trade has played a significant role in the decline of manufacturing in New York State, but NAFTA isn’t the main cause, experts say.

Pence wrongly says more than half of Hillary Clinton's meetings went to foundation donors
","Instead of focusing on allegations from several women that Donald Trump sexually violated them, the media should devote attention to the ""avalanche of real, hard evidence of corruption"" during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, Trump’s running mate Mike Pence said. ""The national media is ignoring an avalanche of real, hard evidence of corruption during the years of the Clinton administration,"" Pence said Oct. 16, 2016, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""The New York Times just a few minutes ago posted a story about — in exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. ""We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton’s meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors to the Clinton Foundation."" We looked at Pence’s claim about Qatar in another fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on his claim that ""more than half"" of meetings Clinton took as secretary of state were with major donors to her family’s global charity. Pence’s claim comes from an Associated Press story published in August, headlined, ""Many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at State."" But ""many"" does not mean ""more than half"" of all her meetings. Not even close. Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009-13. The Associated Press analyzed 154 of her State Department meetings and found that 85 of those were with Clinton Foundation donors. Those 85 gave as much as $156 million to the foundation, combined. But this is a tiny subset of Clinton’s meetings. The analysis excluded meetings with people who work for the U.S. government or foreign governments. And it does not include many meetings Clinton took in the second half of her term because the Associated Press only had access to detailed schedules from the first half. ABC reported back in 2013 that Clinton met with 1,700 foreign leaders and had 755 meetings at the White House while secretary of state. So that’s at least 2,455 meetings the Associated Press did not include in its analysis The Associated Press mischaracterized its own reporting in a post on Twitter claiming that ""More than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation."" The AP later deleted the tweet. Pence described the donors as major. According to the AP, at least 40 of the 85 donors Clinton met with contributed more than $100,000 each. Twenty gave more than $1 million, the AP reported. The Associated Press report showcases the ethical minefield that resulted from the lack of a bright line separating Clinton’s State Department from her family’s foundation. However, merely showing that Clinton met with some foundation donors does not in itself prove any substantial wrongdoing, such as undue influence over State Department policy. For example, the Associated Press article mentions meetings with foundation donors Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist from Bangladesh, and Nancy McMahon, head of MAC AIDS, which was partnering with the State Department to address gender-based violence in South Africa. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told the Associated Press that the department does not prohibit meetings with ""political campaigns, nonprofits or foundations — including the Clinton Foundation."" Our ruling Pence said, ""We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton's meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors of the Clinton Foundation."" Pence inaccurately described an Associated Press report. The report found that of 154 meetings Clinton took with private individuals over about half of her time as secretary of state, 85 were with people who had donated to the foundation. But the analysis leaves out thousands of meetings Clinton took, including every time she met with employees of both U.S. and foreign governments. It also only covers part of her time as secretary of state. We rate Pence's claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/16/mike-pence/pence-wrongly-says-more-half-hillary-clintons-meet/
"['Global News Service', 'Foreign Policy', 'Mike Pence']","
Did Qatar promise Clinton Foundation $1 million for five minutes with Bill Clinton?
","Mike Pence, emphatically denying allegations of sexual assault against Donald Trump, protested that the media hasn’t applied the same scrutiny to Hillary Clinton. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Pence said the media has paid more attention to the ""unsubstantiated"" charges against Trump than the real revelations about Clinton’s wrongdoings at the State Department. ""The national media is ignoring an avalanche of real, hard evidence of corruption during the years of the Clinton administration. The New York Times just a few minutes ago posted a story about — in exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation,"" Pence said Oct. 16, 2016. We wanted to fact-check Pence’s claim about Qatar and its $1 million donation. We found that Pence is largely accurate in his description of the New York Times account. The New York Times article, published Oct. 15, details an email to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, obtained by Wikileaks. (The Clinton camp has yet to confirm or deny the leak’s authenticity.) Amitabh Desai, the Clinton Foundation’s foreign policy director, emailed three Clinton Foundation employees and Doug Band, Bill Clinton’s personal aide on April 16, 2012, about his meetings with ambassadors from Qatar and a few other foreign countries. Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. ""Qatar — Would like to see WJC (William Jefferson Clinton) for ‘five minutes’ in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promises from WJC’s birthday in 2011,"" Desai wrote. ""Qatar would welcome our suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health. They have allocated most of their $20 million but are happy to consider projects we suggest. I'm collecting input from CF Haiti team.""    So the government of Qatar was going to give the Clinton Foundation $1 million as part of a five-minute meeting, according to this email. But Pence could have been more accurate in his description. Pence said Qatar ""was going to"" make a $1 million donation in exchange for a five-minute meeting. But according to Desai’s email, Qatar had promised the check for Bill Clinton’s birthday the previous year. The meeting was to present the check. Second, it’s not clear if the Qatari ambassador ever got his ""five minutes"" with the former president. Foreign government contributions to the Clinton Foundation have been the subject of much criticism lobbed against the Clintons. While they are legal, questions have been raised over possible conflicts of interest for Hillary Clinton while she was serving as secretary of state. As part of a memorandum of understanding between the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration, the foundation agreed to (among other things) disclose material increases from foreign donors and roll back foreign donations altogether to its global health initiative. A State Department spokesperson told the New York Times that it does not have ""a record of submission"" from the Clinton Foundation on a 2012 donation from Qatar. A Clinton Foundation spokesman told us the 2012 donation was disclosed on its website. The Qatari government has given cumulatively between $1 million to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation from 2002 to 2016. The country is controversial for its treatment of women and the LGBT community, and has been accused of being a sponsor of terrorism. Our ruling Pence said, ""In exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation."" The New York Times story shows that Qatar had promised $1 million to the Clinton Foundation for Bill Clinton’s birthday in 2011, and the Qatari ambassador requested five minutes with Bill Clinton to present the check the following year. It’s unclear of the meeting ever took place.

Barksdale cherry picks numbers to attack Isakson on trade
","The latest polls indicate Democrat Jim Barksdale has an uphill battle against two-term incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson in Georgia. Barksdale, a multi-millionaire businessman, has pounced on an issue where he thinks Isakson is vulnerable -- trade agreements and their connection to lost jobs in the state. In his latest ad, he makes a statement about Isakson’s vote on Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China. In a recent campaign video, Barksdale said, ""Johnny voted for PNTR with China costing Georgia 93,000 jobs."" Isakson, who has been in Congress since 1999, faces Barksdale and Libertarian candidate Allen Buckley in the Nov. 8 general election. Did Isakson vote for legislation that cost the state jobs? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look into the statement. We reached out to the candidate’s camps for some background. Barksdale’s campaign spokesperson Gregory Minchak said the number comes from a 2014 Economic Policy Institute study that found millions of jobs were displaced after the agreement with China, including 93,700 in Georgia. For some perspective on the state’s relationship with China in recent years, Isakson’s spokesperson Marie Gordon pointed to a 2015 Georgia Department of Economic Development study that says the state’s exports to China totaled $2.6 billion, ranking 12th among Georgia’s top exporter nations. The state’s imports from China totaled $19.7 billion, making China 7th among Georgia’s top importer nations. It may be important to note Georgia has a Republican governor and legislature, and Gov. Nathan Deal has made multiple trips to the country as governor. Isakson’s campaign also referenced a Heritage Foundation study that says the U.S. economy added over 3 million net new jobs. Isakson’s record Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China have been in effect since 2000, when President Bill Clinton signed a bill normalizing relations into law. Trade conditions with China previously had to be renewed on an annual basis. Isakson was first elected as a representative to Congress in 1999. He voted for the bill to normalize trade with China in May 2000, and it was signed into law by Clinton in October 2000. Isakson is also  in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement to reduce barriers to trade in Pacific Rim countries while curbing China’s influence in the area. The agreement still needs to be passed by Congress. Barksdale says later in the ad he will not vote for ""bad"" trade deals and is opposed to corporate tax breaks. Throughout the campaign, the investment manager has channeled the anti-establishment nature of Sen. Bernie Sanders more than that of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Isakson’s counterattack ads have called Barksdale a hypocrite, and said his fortune comes from companies that outsource jobs to China. Since then, the strongest effort to scale back trade with China came in 2005 (the year Isakson entered the Senate) when then-Rep. Sanders led an effort to repeal the bill due to jobs being lost overseas. The Math The 2014 study from the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute found ""3.2 million jobs were lost or displaced"" by trade with China between 2001 and 2013. Georgia lost 93,700 jobs, putting the state at number ten for jobs lost in the country. The report concludes, ""Since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, the massive growth of trade between China and the United States has had a dramatic and negative effect on U.S."" Experts say these are some of the most dismal jobs numbers cited in reference to trade with China. The U.S. International Trade Commission disputes the EPI’s methodology. Spokesperson Matthew McAlvanah said in an email, ""up to half of all U.S. imports are intermediate goods that go into supporting U.S. production (and U.S. jobs). Many other imports are goods we do not produce at all in the United States, which have no impact on U.S. employment."" In short, importing a good does not mean an American job is lost if the good cannot be grown or made in America. Some studies have found an increase in jobs since the bill’s passage. Most notably, the Heritage Foundation study citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers refutes the idea that trade with China has led to job loss. It says, ""from 1999 to 2011, the U.S. economy added over 3 million net new jobs."" To figure out how these relations work, a 2011 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service sums the situation up well: ""U.S. firms that use China as the final point of assembly for their products, or use Chinese-made inputs for production in the United States, are able to lower costs and become more globally competitive... On the other hand, many analysts argue that growing economic ties with China have exposed U.S. manufacturing firms to greater, and what is often perceived to be ‘unfair’ competition from low-cost Chinese firms. They argue that this has induced many U.S. production facilities to relocate to China, resulting in the loss of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs."" Additionally, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has argued in favor of PNTR with China, saying it, ""is vital to our national economic prosperity."" Our ruling Barksdale said his  opponent in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race voted for trade legislation  ""with China costing Georgia 93,000 jobs."" Barksdale is correct that Isakson voted for the bill to normalize trade with China in 2000 and cites a 2014 number that said Georgia lost 93,700 jobs. One prominent study shows that. But other studies show the state actually gained jobs over the long run. Barksdale cherry picks his studies on this issue to make a point.

Roy Cooper says Pat McCrory raised taxes on the middle class 'in 67 different ways'
","At Tuesday’s debate for the North Carolina governor’s race, Democratic challenger Roy Cooper attacked Republican Gov. Pat McCrory for pushing tax reforms that mostly helped the wealthy. Republicans gained a majority in both chambers of the General Assembly in 2011. After McCrory became governor in 2013, the state passed sweeping changes to tax law. The new GOP leaders cut personal and business income taxes and paid for it in part by expanding the sales tax base and ending some income tax deductions. ""The governor promised people a tax cut,"" Cooper said. ""He came through for the corporations and for those at the top, but everyday working people got tax increases. In 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families. And literally we’re talking about, literally, from birth to death."" We wondered if it was really true that the state’s Republican leaders, who so often tout their record on tax cuts, actually raised taxes in 67 different ways. Cooper’s campaign provided us with an itemized list of the increases it was citing from McCrory’s tenure as governor. They do include instances from birth to death — higher fees for screening newborn babies, and a new tax on tombstone installation. Many came earlier this year, in a large expansion of the sales tax base that went into effect in March bearing McCrory’s signature. It created dozens of new sales taxes applied to services and labor. Auto repair shops have long charged sales taxes on parts. Now they must also charge sales tax on their labor. There are new 43 service taxes, all listed here by the Department of Revenue. Cooper’s campaign also pointed us two dozen other instances of laws McCrory has signed since 2013 that increased taxes, created new taxes or reduced or eliminated tax breaks, incentives, deductions and exemptions. So the number is right. In fact Cooper said 67, and his campaign’s list includes 69 examples. A few of them don’t really affect middle class families, like the state’s tax credits for filmmakers that were allowed to expire, or a law that capped the sales tax refund for nonprofits at $45 million — hardly a level the local PTA has to worry about surpassing. However, nearly all of the 69 examples the campaign pointed to do directly affect middle class families. We won’t list them all, but notable examples include: --Ending the annual tax-free weekend for back-to-school shopping. --Ending deductions for contributions made to college savings accounts. --Eliminating a $4,000 deduction for government retirement income and a $2,000 deduction for private retirement income. --Taxing forgiven mortgage debt as income. ""The next time you go to a movie or you get your car repaired or you buy school supplies at a back to school weekend, you look at that receipt and the taxes are a courtesy of Governor McCrory,"" Cooper said at the debate. Cooper is right that McCrory raised taxes 60-plus ways that could affect middle class families. But that’s not the whole story. And we’ve lowered our Truth-O-Meter ratings in the past when politicians have made claims about taxes that left out important context, like this one. And our friends at the Washington Post gave Three Pinocchios to a 2014 claim that the state’s tax changes raised taxes for most North Carolinians. Does Cooper's claim face a similar fate? The GOP tax reforms Before the tax cuts, North Carolina had a three-tier system for individual income taxes, ranging from 6 to 7.75 percent. With the GOP-led changes, the income tax rate dropped to a single flat rate of 5.8 percent, and then dropped again to 5.75 percent this year. The Tax Foundation, a group that advocates for low tax rates, has frequently praised North Carolina for its income tax cuts. So has the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. In 2014 one its budget analysts wrote that ""McCrory and the legislature’s plan passed one of the most impressive tax reform packages in any state in years."" Earlier this month, McCrory was named one of just five governors with an A on the Cato Institute’s annual report, ""Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors."" The cuts, combined with a higher standard deduction – it more than doubled for married couples filing jointly, from $6,000 to $15,000 –  could lead to hundreds of dollars of savings each year for a typical middle class family. The state’s median household income is around $50,000. It’s harder to estimate, however, just how much extra the typical middle class family will be paying due to the dozens of tax increases and/or lost deductions that Cooper mentioned. That’s because many of them won’t apply to most families, or aren’t very uniform in their cost. Plumbing, vehicle repairs, car washes and tire services are pretty ubiquitous, but even there the labor costs can vary wildly from business to business. And plenty of the new tax increases – like on boat repairs, shoe shining, jewelry cleaning, bullet reloading and fire extinguisher recharging  – won’t apply to most people very often, if ever. There was one tax credit that was eliminated that many people used and we can count easily – the Earned Income Tax Credit. It ended in 2014. In 2011, more than 900,000 households in North Carolina claimed the EITC and got an average of $116 in savings, according to a 2013 study from the liberal Budget and Tax Center. Many families saved more than $116 when their income tax rates were cut. But when you start adding in the additional taxes on services, the other lost credits and deductions, and more? It’s possible some people might be paying more now than they were before the tax cuts – especially on the lower end of the income scale. A 2015 study from the liberal groups Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) and The Budget & Tax Center found that the bottom 20 percent of North Carolinians paid taxes equivalent to 9.2 percent of their income, while the top 1 percent paid taxes equivalent to 5.3 percent of their income. We here at PolitiFact also looked into North Carolina’s tax reforms in 2014 and ruled it Mostly True that the state’s tax changes ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy."" And that was before any of the dozens of new sales taxes were enacted. Those have shifted the tax burden away from the wealthy even more, since sales taxes are regressive in nature. Our ruling Cooper said that ""in 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families."" We find his tally of the tax increases to be correct, yet many of them will affect only small groups of people in any given year. And Cooper cherry-picks by leaving out the substantial reduction in the income tax rate, which applied broadly to people at all income levels, even though it did mostly help the wealthy. We rate his claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/813496b5-36a6-4835-af57-1d9dc2393194",/factchecks/2016/oct/14/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-says-pat-mccrory-raised-taxes-middle-cl/

Bruce Elfant says 90-plus percent of eligible Travis County residents have registered to vote
","Nearly every voting-eligible Travis County resident ended up registering to vote in advance of the November 2016 elections, a local official declared. Bruce Elfant, the county’s tax assessor-collector and voter registrar, told reporters: ""Since the 2012 election, we’ve added over 80,000 registered voters, which helps us get over our 90 percent voter registration goal,"" set in January 2016. As of Oct. 10, 2016, Elfant specified, his office had counted 713,871 registered voters, which he described as about 89.9 percent of the county’s citizens eligible to vote. At that time, Elfant said, another 11,000 applications had yet to be processed while more applications would come in before the voter registration deadline of Oct. 11. Elfant says he started from federal research Wondering about Elfant’s 90-percent-plus figure, we asked him to share his math. By email, Elfant replied that he started from a U.S. Census Bureau estimate indicating that in 2015, the county was home to 778,077 citizens of voting age and then adjusted that figure to get to an updated estimate. To reach the new estimate, Elfant said, he assumed the number of voting-age citizens in the county increased the same amount from 2015 to 2016 that it did, according to the bureau, from 2014 to 2015--or 18,551. But, he said, he reduced the 18,551 figure to cover just the stretch of 2016 preceding the mid-October registration deadline--getting an estimated gain of 16,232 voting-age citizens. Elfant said he then added the partial-year estimate to the bureau’s 2015 estimate of 778,077 voting-age citizens, reaching his October 2016 estimate of 794,309 voting-age citizens. Finally, Elfant said, he divided the 713,871 people registered to vote in the county as of mid-October 2016 into his estimate of voting-age citizens, getting the 90 percent result. When we heard back from Elfant a couple days later, he said the county’s tally of registered residents had reached 717,694, or 90.4 percent of voting-eligible residents by his analysis. On Oct. 14, 2016, Elfant emailed: ""With at least 17,000 voter registrations still unprocessed, it is likely that 91% or even 92% are actually registered to vote but we won’t have a final tally for another week."" Census Bureau surveys We sought to check the census bureau figures, hearing back from a bureau spokeswoman, Jewel Jordan, who pointed us to a bureau web page containing Elfant’s cited estimates of voting-age citizens in the county in 2014 and 2015. Jordan said by email the bureau nationally estimates voting-age citizens through its American Community Survey, which in 2015 entailed interviews of residents of more than 2 million U.S. households. Each person’s survey included a request for each resident’s birth date and: ""Is the person a citizen of the U.S.?"" Outside experts say estimates at play To our inquiries, experts called Elfant’s methodology sound even though he depended on estimated counts of voting-age citizens. Brian W. Smith, a St. Edward’s University political scientist, and James Henson of the University of Texas each pointed out by email that the bureau figures employed by Elfant to reflect citizens eligible to vote are estimates, not to-the-person counts. Smith said that outside of the government’s decennial census, ""population surveys are always estimates which include a margin of error. It is not a precise measure because the population is always changing because of deaths, migration, undercounts etc. For example, if Travis County grew at a much faster rate than the estimates, the results could be under 90%, but we cannot be certain,"" Smith said. That said, Smith wrote, it’s reasonable to speculate that 90 percent of eligible residents has registered because some 86 percent appear to have done so in 2014 and that was a ""low salience mid-year election."" Smith reached the 86 percent figure by comparing the county’s 655,056 registered voters as of Nov. 4, 2014 to the bureau’s 2014 estimate of 759,526 county residents eligible to vote. Smith elaborated: ""The county had two years to increase the voter registered rate by 3.8% and a lot of events in their favor"" such as competitive March 2016 party primaries including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a candidate; an antic general-election campaign period; and a surge in voters registering statewide. Days after Elfant spoke, Texas Secretary of State Carlos Cascos said a record 15 million-plus Texas citizens had registered to vote--or 78 percent of the state’s estimated voting age population of 19.3 million though that count included non-citizens. Peck Young, who oversees the Austin Community College Center for Public Policy & Political Studies, said: ""It is clear that this year 90+"" percent ""of the Citizen Voting Age Population  of Travis County has been registered."" Texas state official We also asked Alicia Pierce of the secretary of state’s office to assess Elfant’s claim; she emailed us a spreadsheet tallying registered Texas voters by county and showing Travis County with 720,186 registered voters. That count breaks out to 90.7 percent of the county’s citizens eligible to vote as estimated by Elfant. By phone, Pierce advised that the state sticks to calculating registration rates using only voting-age population estimates--rather than working from estimates of citizens of voting age. In part, she said, the agency relies on the less precise metric to ease historical comparisons. The voting-age population estimates, Pierce said, come from the Texas Demographic Center located at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Our ruling Elfant said that over 90 percent of Travis County’s eligible residents registered to vote in advance of the November 2016 elections. Comparing the more than 713,871 voters registered at the time Elfant spoke to the county’s estimated 794,309 voting-age citizens--a figure rooted in 2015 household surveys--gets you to 90 percent. Folding in registrations tallied after Elfant spoke drives the result to a bit more than 90 percent. We rate this claim True.

"['Taxes', 'New York', 'Chris Jacobs']","
The state spends more on Western New York than it receives in taxes from region
","It’s not a new tactic for upstate Republicans running for state office: link rival Democrats to New York City, where more than half of state lawmakers come from, and promise to stand against that big liberal base. Republican Christopher L. Jacobs is following a similar tack in his Senate race in Buffalo. In an ad released in September, Jacobs says Buffalo does not receive its fair share from the state. ""After how hard you work and how much you pay in taxes, New York City ends up getting the money,"" Jacobs says. ""I'm Chris Jacobs. I think it's time we have someone in Albany that's making sure our region gets our fair share."" Jacobs, the current Erie County Clerk, seeks to replace outgoing State Sen. Marc C. Panepinto. Panepinto, a Democrat who has held the seat since 2014, decided not to seek re-election. Jacobs is running against Democrat Amber Small, the executive director of the Parkside Community Association. Is Jacobs right? Does Western New York not get its fair share from the state? Where your money goes A 2011 report from the Rockefeller Institute found downstate New York typically pays more to the state in taxes than it gets back. Jacobs implies Western New York pays more to the state than it gets back. Data from the state Department of Budget shows otherwise. In total taxes collected by the state, 4.1 percent comes from the Western New York counties of Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany. Three percent comes from Erie County. And 56 percent of the state’s tax collection comes from New York City. The State Legislature passed a $147.8 billion budget in April. The Department of Budget estimates $96.2 billion of that is state spending.  The state said it could not break out total spending by region. But it did provide data showing the state receives less in taxes from Western New York than it spends in the region in major spending categories like education, economic development, roads and human services.  Economic development The Department of Budget says $5.6 billion of the state’s economic development spending went to Western New York between 2012 and 2016. That’s 10.4 percent of the spending in that category statewide. It includes funds meant to boost the economy broadly through recreation, hospital capital and more. It also includes spending on job creation and business incentive programs like the Buffalo Billion. When looking at economic programs like those alone, Western New York received about 25 percent of the state’s spending over that time. Roads and bridges State infrastructure funds are also included under the economic development category. From 2012 to 2016, the state spent $1.6 billion on the region’s infrastructure. That’s another category in which Western New York received a bigger share of the money than the 4.1 percent it contributed in taxes. The state spent 9.7 percent of its road and bridge money in the region. Education aid The same is true for education aid, one of the largest spending categories. • Western New York received 9.1 percent of the state’s school aid in the most recent budget. That came to about $2.2 billion, the state says. • Erie County received 5.5 percent. • New York City received 39.9 percent. The state puts a cap on property tax increases. New York City does not have such a cap. State foundation aid to school districts is based on a formula from the State Education Department. It’s another source of revenue. Districts receive other state funds, like reimbursement for construction or BOCES funding, but foundation aid is the largest source of funding from the state for a district. More foundation aid was spent on students in Buffalo than New York City last school year. Buffalo Public Schools received close to $465 million in foundation aid during the last school year. With some 32,165 students, according to the department, that averages out to $14,450 per student. New York City’s schools, attended by slightly more than 1 million students, received almost $6.8 billion in the foundation aid. That averages out to $6,500 per student. Human services Western New York also gets a disproportionate share in human services spending, which includes child welfare, food stamps, foster care and more. New York City also receives more than it puts in for these services. • Western New York received 6.8 percent of human services spending in the last budget. That’s about $979 million, according to the state. • Erie County received 4.6 percent. • New York City received 59.1 percent of the human services spending, a percentage that is slightly more than its percentage contribution to the state’s tax receipts. Medicaid Western New York and Erie County hold almost even in Medicaid spending. • Western New York received 4.5 percent of Medicaid spending. • Erie County received 3.1 percent. • This is another spending category in which New York City receives a bigger percentage than its percentage contribution in taxes. New York City received 58.4 percent of Medicaid state spending. What’s he talking about? Jacobs’s campaign says his ad refers to local issues like education funding and the cost of electricity. Data shows he’s wrong on education aid. His claim on electricity refers to the Niagara Power Plant. ""New York State has literally taken billions of dollars over the decades out of that plant to subsidize the other power plants that lose money and worse yet, billions have been dumped into New York State’s general fund budget,"" Jacobs said. The New York Power Authority confirms the Niagara plant ranks as the most lucrative among its 16 generating facilities. A certain amount is earmarked for Western New York, and any surplus power is sold on the open market. The power authority says its other facilities have not relied on revenue from the Niagara Power Plant. But how the power agency chooses to use the revenue is besides the point in the context of upstate versus New York City. The power plant is a state facility - not a regional one.   ""While the Niagara project is a cornerstone for the Western New York economy, it is a statewide asset,"" said Paul DeMichele of the authority.  Our Ruling In his ad, Jacobs says ""New York City ends up getting the money"" from taxes paid by Western New York residents. Data obtained from the Department of Budget shows Western New York, including Erie County, consistently receives a bigger percentage share of state spending than its residents’ percentage contribution in taxes. Jacobs implies the region is not getting its fair share. Data shows it’s getting more than its fair share in the state’s largest spending categories. There are a few categories in which New York City receives more than it puts in, but overall, the difference between how much is paid in taxes and how much is spent on services and projects benefits Western New York - not New York City. We rate this claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/324147a5-c7af-4d1b-9304-7a38f810cb0e",/factchecks/2016/oct/14/chris-jacobs/state-spends-more-western-new-york-it-receives-tax/

Donald Trump wrongly maligns U.S. chess prowess
","One of Donald Trump’s signature lines at rallies has been that the United States doesn’t win any more. ""Folks, we don't win anymore, right?"" he said in June in an event in the Woodlands, Texas. ""We don't win anymore. We don't win! We don't win on anything."" More recently, during an Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge, Pa., Trump offered a variation on that theme -- and the U.S. chess community wasn’t happy about his remarks. Trump was in the midst of criticizing international trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said he supports the idea of bilateral agreements, saying that such deals would make it possible for the United States to threaten to withdraw, then renegotiate on more favorable terms before the agreement expired. Trump went on to say that with multilateral pacts like the TPP, ""you can't terminate -- there's too many people, you go crazy. It's like you have to be a grand chess master. And we don't have any of them."" (You can see it here, around the 19:45 mark.) Trump’s statement sounded wrong to us. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry, but as it turns out, it is wrong. In fact, the comment provoked anger and ridicule within the chess community, which knows that the United States is currently on a roll in international competition. Chess grandmasters It’s literally wrong that ""we don’t have any"" chess grandmasters. That’s the correct term, by the way, not ""grand chess masters."" Currently, the United States has 90 grandmasters, counting both men and women, which is enough to rank third-highest in the world. The title is awarded by FIDE, the international governing body of chess; it’s the highest rank conferred by the group, and it is given for life. Russia, a longtime chess powerhouse, ranks first with 234 grandmasters, while Germany ranks second with 91, just one more than the United States. Here’s a list of the top 30 nations in the FIDE rankings.  Recent U.S. victories In the meantime, Trump chose a particularly inopportune moment for his comment. Most notable is the victory less than a month earlier by the U.S. men’s team at the 42nd Chess Olympiad in Baku, Azerbaijan -- which is considered the first time in nearly 80 years that the United States won the gold. To win in September, the United States bested such powerhouses as Russia, Ukraine, India and China. Chess may not be the most popular sport in the United States, but observers called the Olympic victory a watershed moment for U.S. chess. ""The 2016 win in the Chess Olympiad is huge,"" said Olimpiu G. Urcan, a Singapore-based chess writer and historian. ""The previous Olympiad was won by China, and Russia and Ukraine are extremely competitive. Having the United States finish first was a huge boost for chess in America and a moment of genuine pride. Many in the U.S. right now believe that the successes of 2016 could produce a rejuvenation of chess"" similar to what happened with the international stardom of Bobby Fischer in the 1970s. Macauley Peterson, a Hamburg, Germany-based American who serves as content director for chess24, calls it ""frankly discouraging"" that the United States team ""received so little media attention. The number of U.S. grandmasters is higher than ever, and winning the Olympiad was a historic achievement."" Urcan was among the first to notice Trump’s quote and tweeted about it. That led to none other than Garry Kasparov -- probably the most famous living chess grandmaster -- to tweet his disbelief. Kasparov is Russian but is living in exile in New York City; he has been an outspoken critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Proud to see Trump knows as little about chess as everything else. Team USA just won gold at the chess Olympiad! https://t.co/k2Y3KBect3 Hikaru Nakamura, a U.S. Olympic team member and currently the world’s No. 7 ranked player,  joined in: Wow. Just wow. What a disgrace on every level. https://t.co/aJY7haSslH In the meantime, the United States is home to 15-year-old grandmaster Jeffrey Xiong, who in August won the World Junior Chess Championship -- the first U.S. victory in the tournament in nearly two decades. And the United States is currently the only country to have three players in the world’s top 10 list -- Nakamura, Fabiano Caruana and Wesley So.  A final note: There is a long history of foreign players flocking to affiliate with the U.S. team. The victorious Olympic team includes Fabiano Caruana, a dual American and Italian citizen who had previously played for Italy, and Wesley So, who was born in the Philippines. Our ruling Trump said, ""We don't have any"" chess grandmasters in the United States. Actually, the United States has 90 grandmasters, the third most of any country, and the U.S. team recently won chess’ biggest international tournament for the first time in eight decades.

Donald Trump wildly exaggerates Amb. Christopher Steven's requests for extra Benghazi security
","The death of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens came up as a topic during the second presidential debate Sunday night. When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Donald Trump if tweeting about a sex tape between 3 and 5 a.m. reflected the discipline of a good leader, Trump denied using those words and suddenly veered onto the subject of the 2012 attack on the mission compound in Benghazi, Libya. Security was inadequate and Stevens died of smoke inhalation from a fire during an attack by insurgents. Trump, apparently thinking that the drama unfolded at 3 a.m. in Washington, started referring to a famous Hillary Clinton commercial from her 2008 run for president, which argued that she was the best person for responding to a national emergency, as represented by a hypothetical 3 a.m. phone call to the White House. Trump: ""She said, 'Who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?' Guess what? She didn't answer  because ... Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help."" It’s hard to overstate how much is wrong here. The attack on the compound actually began at 9:42 p.m. in Libya, which was 3:42 p.m. in Washington. By 3 a.m. in Washington the following day, the attacks were over, and the people involved had either left Benghazi or were less than an hour from being flown out. So for this fact-check, we're going to focus on whether Stevens made 600 requests for help. Trump's cryptic comment might be heard as suggesting that Stevens made 600 ""requests for help"" during the attack. The investigations of Benghazi show that didn't happen. In fact, when we contacted the Trump campaign, they referred us to a graph that claimed something very different. First, there's no debate that security at the mission was inadequate and that requests for improvements stalled or rejected. Some security improvements were made the year of the attack, including ""heightening the perimeter wall, installing concrete Jersey barriers, mounting safety grills on the safe area windows, and other minor improvements,"" according to a 2014 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. But while the CIA was making significant upgrades to its nearby annex, similar improvements were not being done at the Benghazi mission. The CIA annex had nine security officers, but only three officers were assigned to the mission complex. A month before the attack, with the security situation deteriorating, Army Gen. Carter Ham, who was head of U.S. Africa Command, twice offered to give the U.S. embassy in Tripoli a special military security team. Stevens declined the offer. No reason was given, but it may have had to do with the State Department not wanting to aggravate the political instability in Libya with the presence of U.S. forces. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Dan Kowalski cited this chart, which was displayed during hearings by the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi.  But there's no reference to this chart in the report itself, released months later. Democrats on the committee, in their minority report, said that, ""During our hearing with Secretary Clinton, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan) argued that the Select Committee had obtained ‘over 600 requests’ for security from Benghazi, but he refused to provide the evidence for his claim."" The minority report continues, ""Democrats have been unable to successfully reconstruct a list of 600 requests for additional security, and have been able to identify fewer than 200 requests, many of which were granted."" A few things are worth noting right off the bat. • The Republicans’ count is 569, not 600, accumulated over nine months. • Stevens wasn't sworn in as ambassador to Libya until May 2012. So even if every one of those requests/concerns originated from Stevens and went directly to Clinton, the highest number Trump could cite would be 205, not 600. • The count is supposed to be the number of security requests or concerns from Benghazi to the State Department, not from Stevens to Clinton, as Trump said. This can get ambiguous because such correspondence is often sent under the name of the ambassador, even if he/she never saw it, to the secretary of state, even though in the vast majority of cases it's handled by lower-level people and the secretary never sees it. As Clinton noted during her Jan. 23, 2013, testimony on the Benghazi attack, ""1.43 million cables a year come to the State Department. They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy."" It's also not clear if all these requests were actually for Benghazi or were security-related requests involving the U.S. embassy in Tripoli as well. Earlier this year, the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into the 600 number, which was being cited by Trump and others. He found duplication. Once a request is made it can be followed by one or more statements of ""concern"" on the same topic, so there's a lot of overlap in the count. The Post was given only a cursory look at the data used by the GOP staff to come up with their total, but he noted that one subject heading was repeated 17 times, suggesting that the same request was being repeatedly discussed. That alone may have inflated the total. To properly check whether the same security-related requests were being reported under different subject headings, the committee would have to release the documents. At the time, Kessler was reporting that the committee's final report ""is supposed to list the documents that formed the basis of the 600 figure."" We contacted the committee twice and received no response. If we get additional information, we'll update this fact-check. In any event, Kessler noted, ""few if any"" requests were likely from Stevens. He called Trump's comment ""a whopper."" Our ruling Trump said ""Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help."" There certainly were many requests for security improvements at the mission. But Trump goes way over the line, citing a graph that includes a period when Stevens wasn't even the ambassador and doesn't differentiate between actual requests for improved security and follow-up correspondence. The highest the number could be, according to that data, is 205 and there's no evidence that those ""requests and concerns"" — which may include duplicates — were even sent by Stevens. We rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63594c70-fdef-4c85-8495-89eb8f90c67c",/factchecks/2016/oct/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-wildly-exaggerates-amb-christopher-st/

Wisconsin GOP mostly misses tying Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold to Hillary Clinton
","As they try to help Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson keep his U.S. Senate seat, GOP groups and Johnson himself are striving to tie Democrat Russ Feingold to his party’s presidential nominee. They’re hitting on two controversial issues buffeting Hillary Clinton -- the Clinton Foundation and State Department emails. One such attack is made in a digital ad dubbed ""Feingold Foundation,"" released Sept. 12, 2016 by the Wisconsin Republican Party. The ad uses loaded language in making a somewhat convoluted claim. Let’s take a look. The ad The ad, which is essentially a web page, starts with this in red capital letters: ""End the Hillary-Feingold corruption."" The main text says: ""Just like Hillary Clinton, Senator Feingold has had his own run in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund -- a.k.a. The Feingold Foundation -- while plotting another run for U.S. Senate. ""After months of lawsuits related to Hillary’s emails, the State Department is now withholding Senator Feingold’s emails from public release until after the November election. Help end the Hillary-Feingold corruption by demanding Senator Feingold’s emails be released immediately."" So, the claim is that ""just like Clinton,"" Feingold had a ""run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund"" -- the ""Feingold Foundation"" -- while ""plotting"" to run for the Senate seat he lost to Johnson in 2010. Then there’s the reference to State Department emails. Let’s look at this in two parts. ‘Personal slush fund’ The ""personal slush fund"" allegation, refers to Progressives United -- a political action committee Feingold founded after he lost his try for a fourth term in the Senate. In June 2015, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watchdog columnist Daniel Bice revealed that the PAC had given a mere 5 percent of its income to federal candidates and political parties. Feingold and nine of his former campaign and U.S. Senate staffers drew salaries or consulting fees from the PAC. For instance, Feingold's longtime chief of staff was paid $317,823 by the PAC and a related nonprofit from February 2011 until July 2013, when she left to take a job joining Feingold at the U.S. State Department. And Feingold received $77,000 from the two groups. Moreover, $42,609 was spent to buy hundreds of copies of a book he authored (though Feingold did not receive royalties for those books). The Wisconsin GOP acknowledged to us that it is referring to the PAC as the ""Feingold Foundation"" and that there isn’t such a foundation. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation, an international health and development charity, has been controversial for very different reasons. Wisconsinite Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, claimed that 80 percent of the foundation’s money goes to overhead, PolitiFact National’s rating was False. But the figure was only 10 to 20 percent. The Clinton Foundation has been criticized more for potential conflicts of interest, not its spending. It has accepted millions in foreign donations, including from countries with business in front of the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Donors were able to get access to Clinton. For example, Clinton had been reluctant to grant a meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain after he made requests through official channels. But a short-notice meeting was granted to the prince, whose government gave more than $50,000 to the Clintons’ charity, after a longtime Clinton aide who helped create the foundation interceded. ‘Plotting another run’ As for the ad’s allegation that Feingold was operating a personal slush fund while ""plotting"" his 2016 run for the Senate, the state GOP told us that Feingold is ""just like Hillary Clinton"" in that there are questions surrounding his time at the State Department. But once again, the circumstances involving Feingold and Clinton are quite different. The party alleges that Feingold violated federal law by engaging in political activities as a federal employee -- that is, planning his Senate run while he worked as a special envoy for the African Great Lakes Region and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A conservative website says the State Department has agreed to its requests to provide emails Feingold exchanged with top Senate Democrats and two of his former aides, although it’s not known whether the release will come before the Nov. 8, 2016 election. Feingold has denied any wrongdoing. In contrast, Clinton has faced much more than partisan allegations over her State Department emails. It has been well established that Clinton exclusively used a private email address while serving as secretary of state. Because she didn’t use the government system, the department didn’t have her emails on hand when the House Select Committee on Benghazi asked to see them. So in 2014, Clinton’s lawyers combed through the private server and turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department and deleted the rest, which Clinton said were about personal matters. Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim incorrect. There was not enough evidence to charge her with a crime, but her email setup exposed her to hacking. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP says that ""just like"" Clinton, Feingold had a ""run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund -- a.k.a. the Feingold Foundation -- while plotting another run for U.S. Senate."" There is no Feingold Foundation. The ""personal slush fund"" reference is to a political action committee established by Feingold that spent significant sums that benefited Feingold -- for salaries and consulting fees to Feingold and his former aides, and to buy copies of a book he wrote. But the Clinton Foundation got into controversy not over its spending, but for potential conflicts of interest, given that it accepted donations from foreign countries that had business before Clinton as secretary of state. And while Clinton clearly broke State Department rules by setting up a private email system, nothing has been established beyond allegations that Feingold did anything improper with emails during his employment by the State Department. For a statement that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

Clinton says Muslims have been in America since George Washington
","A Muslim woman at the second presidential debate asked Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton how they would help millions of Muslims in the United States ""deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country."" Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said that Muslims have to report problems, because ""if they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country."" And Clinton, his Democratic rival, won’t use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" Trump said, which we have said is misleading. Clinton said she wanted Muslims to feel included in the country, ""part of our homeland security."" ""We've had Muslims in America since George Washington,"" Clinton said. ""And we've had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali."" We wondered about Clinton’s remarks about Muslims being in America since the nation’s first president, more than 200 years ago. There are about 2.75 million Muslims in America, according to estimates by Pew Research Center. Islam is the second-largest religion in the world after Christianity and the fastest growing. Muslims were singled out this election cycle when Trump in December 2015 called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" until U.S. representatives ""can figure out what is going on."" Trump’s statement came a few days after a husband and wife in San Bernardino, Calif., fatally shot 14 people and wounded more than 20 others. The woman was from Pakistan and on the day of the attack pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, a terrorist group also known as ISIS. In June 2016, Trump said he was revising his plan, and would suspend immigration from areas with ""proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats."" After the mass shooting in California and other attacks in Paris, hate crimes against Muslims spiked in the United States, the New York Times reported. Given statements about banning Muslims from coming to the United States and the attacks some already in the country are facing, Clinton’s comment about their presence in the country dating back hundreds of years seemed relevant. Muslim slaves Clinton’s campaign pointed us to a Feb. 9, 2015, opinion piece in the New York Times by Peter Manseau, who has written about American history and religions. ""No matter how anxious people may be about Islam, the notion of a Muslim invasion of this majority-Christian country has no basis in fact,"" Manseau’s New York Times piece said. ""Moreover, there is an inconvenient footnote to the assertion that Islam is anti-American: Muslims arrived here before the founding of the United States — not just a few, but thousands."" Muslims have been ""overlooked because they were not free to practice their faith,"" Manseau wrote. Manseau’s piece discusses a man called Estevanico who was raised in Azemmour, a Moroccan city that was once a ""Muslim stronghold against European invasion."" In 1528, an enslaved Estevanico and Spanish explorers were shipwrecked near present-day Galveston, Texas. Estevanico eventually escaped his Christian captors and lived in the Southwest, Manseau wrote. In the 1700s, Louisiana plantation owners ""made it a point to add enslaved Muslims to their labor force, relying on their experience with the cultivation of indigo and rice,"" the New York Times piece said. Arabs in America, a project at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, also says scholars believe Estevanico was a practicing Muslim, ""though he nominally converted to Catholicism to appease his Spanish masters."" The Clinton campaign also sent over a Q&A page on Tolerance.org about Muslims that says they arrived in America more than 400 years ago as slaves and that many practiced their faith in secret. They also pointed to a PBS feature on Islam in America that says 10 to 15 percent of African slaves were believed to be Muslims. Experts also backed up Clinton’s claim. Kambiz GhaneaBassiri, a professor of religion and humanities at Reed College, also noted that the National Portrait Gallery includes a portrait of Yarrow Mamout, identified as an African-American Muslim man and former slave. ""His portrait reminds us that Muslims have been a part of the fabric of this nation since the beginning,"" Kim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said in a July 2016 press statement when it was announced the portrait would be added as part of the museum’s annual rotations. Scholars also referred us to a post about the Founding Fathers and Islam by James H. Hutson, chief of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress. ""Readers may be surprised to learn that there may have been hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Muslims in the United States in 1776 — imported as slaves from areas of Africa where Islam flourished,"" Hutson wrote. ""Although there is no evidence that the Founders were aware of the religious convictions of their bondsmen, it is clear that the Founding Fathers thought about the relationship of Islam to the new nation and were prepared to make a place for it in the republic."" Washington said he would welcome Muslims to Mount Vernon (his home) ""if they were ‘good workmen’,"" Hutson said. Washington also ""suggested a way for Muslims to ‘obtain proper relief’ "" from a proposed bill in Virginia levying taxes to aid Christian worship, according to Hutson. The post goes on to detail how the Founding Fathers in 1780 made sure the Constitution afforded ""the most ample liberty of conscience … to Deists, Mahometans, Jews and Christians’,"" Hutson wrote. ""I think that what Secretary Clinton was suggesting by her reference to George Washington was that not only have Muslims lived in the U.S. for centuries, but that our Founding Fathers — not only George Washington but also Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, and the men who wrote the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution — believed that Muslims should be free to practice their own religion, and they tried to guarantee this freedom and protect it in some of our Founding documents,"" said Jan Ellen Lewis, a history professor at Rutgers University who has contributed $700 to Clinton’s campaign. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We've had Muslims in America since George Washington."" History scholars, studies and information from the Library of Congress say Muslims have been in the United States for hundreds of years, certainly dating back to Washington. Though Muslims were brought to America as slaves from Africa, experts believe many were not able to freely practice their religion. The Founding Fathers eventually outlined freedom of religion, among other rights.
