Rick Scott calls health care law a 'job-killer'
","
As Supreme Court justices embarked on three days of oral arguments in the historic lawsuit over the health care law, Gov. Rick Scott went on a national TV media blitz and said one of the most regurgitated falsehoods of the health care debate.

""I ran on a campaign of getting our state back to work. This will be the biggest job-killer ever,"" he said on Fox and Friends on March 26, 2012. ""I mean, think about it, the government can’t buy health care cheaper than anybody else can. And we have these unbelievable penalties, which will have to go up.""

""It will be a big job-killer because it will cost too much,"" he said.

PolitiFact has examined similar claims about the law’s job-killing effect from House Republican Leader Eric Cantor, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and former U.S. Senate candidate and former Florida House Majority Leader Adam Hasner. None fared well on our Truth-O-Meter.

We wanted to rule on Scott’s statement given renewed debate on the law. We’ll explain how we examined the ""job-killing"" rhetoric in the past before getting around to Scott specifically.

None of the folks who made the claim before now could back it up with valid projections of job losses, and instead presented partisan reports or skewed interpretations of independent reports as evidence.

One Republican document, ""Obamacare: A Budget-Busting, Job-Killing Health Care Law,"" claimed ""independent analyses have determined that the health care law will cause significant job losses for the U.S. economy."" It cites a 2010 report by the CBO, which analyzes the impact of legislation, that allegedly determined the law would lead to roughly 650,000 lost jobs.

But the report didn’t say that.

It said the reduction in the amount of labor in the economy would be ""roughly half a percent"" -- and not because of onerous regulation. Some workers around retirement age may decide to stop working earlier than they planned, the report states, pointing to the affordability of insurance to be offered outside of the workplace.

The same report says the law may also mean more people seek jobs because of a Medicaid expansion that allows more low-income people to work and still qualify for the program.

The CBO does highlight a part of the law that will likely lead to lost jobs: the requirement that businesses with 50 or more workers pay a fee if they do not offer health insurance (or if the plan they offer falls short on some criteria and at least one employee receives a subsidy from the to-be-created insurance exchange).

This fee, CBO states, will be passed on to employees through reduced wages and other compensation. Because some businesses pay a chunk of employees at minimum wage, it’s inevitable that some will take on fewer low-wage workers. They may also respond by hiring more part-time or seasonal employees.

That’s as specific as it gets in the CBO’s update. Why? Because it will take time to assess the effects of the law, most parts of which won’t be implemented for another couple of years.

Another source the Republicans have used for backup is pretty irrelevant now. The National Association of Independent Business said in a 2009 report the impact of a provision requiring businesses to offer insurance would lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs, two-thirds of which would be from small business. But the blanket employer mandate did not make it into the final law, which exempts companies with 50 or fewer employees from any mandate.

The NFIB produced a more recent study in November 2011 blasting another part of the law: an escalating annual fee (starting in 2014) on the health insurance sector that the group says will be passed on to businesses through increased premiums.

This requirement, which the lobbying group calls a health insurance tax, would lead to lost private-sector jobs between 125,000 and 249,000 in 2010, the group said. Job losses would total 4,700 through 2021 in Florida.

We’ve found a few problems with NFIB research in our past stories. For starters, it’s not really independent in the ideological sense. The lobbying group opposes policy that places a financial burden on business and sued against the health care law at the Supreme Court.

In other words, it’s not exactly our go-to source for objectivity.

Still, we dug into the substance of their claim that the law will cost hundreds of thousands of private jobs in our most recent check of this job-killing claim. Several skeptical experts told us the impact would not be that big, pointing out that employer payments under the law are small, and that the NFIB’s research doesn’t factor in new tax credits under the law for small businesses, which would actually lead to savings in premium contributions.

""The rhetorical hysteria explicit in the term ‘job killer’ is enough to make one despair for rational public debate,"" said Henry Aaron, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in a February email with PolitiFact.

Like CBO, we’ve cautioned that a discussion of what the law will or won’t do is mostly based on speculation. Even when parts of the law go into effect in 2014 (barring Supreme Court action), we won’t know if it has a drastic effect on jobs until the years that follow.

Our friends at FactCheck.org  arrived at the same conclusions we did about the job-killing threat in January 2011.

So what about Scott? Could he cite new, compelling evidence for this well-worn claim?

""It’s a prediction based on conversations with business owners and other job creators,"" spokesman Brian Burgess wrote in an email.

He didn’t elaborate.

Analyzing the truthfulness of predictions is tricky business in which we normally prefer not to delve. But the job-killing claim is widely spread, and does not carry proof.

Scott’s spokesman said this is a prediction based on anecdotal conversations with business owners. We say it’s not one steeped in credible, independent evidence -- it’s more like a scare tactic. We rule this claim False.","[('\nGov. Rick Scott’s appearance on ""Fox and Friends,"" Youtube.com, March 26, 2012\n\n""The health care law a ‘job killer’?

New Jersey GOP credit Chris Christie for New Jersey having the lowest risk of corruption in the nation
","
Soon after an article was published about a new study claiming New Jersey had the lowest risk of corruption in the nation, the state’s Republican Party told its Twitter followers the first-place finish was the result of the ""comeback"" led by Gov. Chris Christie.

""And the #jerseycomeback keeps rolling! Thanks to @GovChristie NJ now has lowest corruption risk of any state,"" according to the March 19 tweet from the New Jersey Republican State Committee.

But PolitiFact New Jersey found that the regulations behind New Jersey’s highest scores were put in place before Christie became governor. Christie, a Republican, has proposed a series of ethics reforms, but they’ve been stalled by the Democrat-controlled Legislature.

Let’s explain the corruption risk investigation.

The State Integrity Investigation was undertaken by journalists in every state, who analyzed 330 so-called ""corruption risk indicators"" across 14 categories. The analyses focused, in part, on the existence of certain laws and their effectiveness.

On its report card, New Jersey received A grades in six categories, including State Pension Fund Management and Ethics Enforcement -- two categories where New Jersey ranked first. To analyze the Republicans’ tweet, we researched the origins of regulations cited within five of those categories. No laws were cited in the sixth category.

Based on our review, all of those regulations were put into effect before Christie took office.

Here’s a few examples:

The report card points to various regulations governing lobbying activities, which Gov. Jim McGreevey updated with a series of laws enacted in June 2004.

The New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law, which covers various ethics rules, has been in effect since 1972. In January 2006, Gov. Richard Codey approved a bill to strengthen those regulations.

Codey also signed a ""pay-to-play"" reform bill in March 2005, prohibiting state contracts of more than $17,500 for certain political donors. Gov. Jon Corzine expanded on those pay-to-play rules through an executive order in September 2008.

The report card notes how Christie issued an executive order in April 2010 to specify who must file financial disclosure statements, but previous governors have taken similar actions.

Through a spokesman, we asked journalist Colleen O’Dea, an editor-at-large at NJSpotlight, who conducted the investigation in New Jersey, about whether Christie’s reforms contributed to the state’s score. Here’s what she said:

""I really have to tell you that there have been virtually none. Christie came in and has called for numerous reforms but has put through few, if any of those things our survey asked about.""

But Doug Mayer, spokesman for the New Jersey Republican State Committee, argued that Christie’s work as U.S. Attorney in prosecuting corruption cases led to an overall change in New Jersey’s political culture.

""You would be hard pressed to find anyone in New Jersey, or the entire country for that matter, who doubts Governor Christie’s commitment or actual record on prosecuting political corruption. Some people don’t like to admit it, but the Governor’s record as a U.S. Attorney is impeccable and led directly to New Jersey’s overall change in political culture,"" Mayer said in an e-mail. ""It is a fight he continues to this day with a substantial portion of his agenda dedicated to strengthening New Jersey’s ethics laws.""

However, such prosecutions did not factor into New Jersey’s score in the corruption risk investigation, according to Randy Barrett, spokesman for the Center for Public Integrity, one of the collaborators behind the project.

""We weren’t looking at people, just the structures to deliver (or not) transparency and accountability,"" Barrett told us in an e-mail.

Our ruling

Referring to a nationwide investigation comparing states for their risk of corruption, New Jersey’s Republican Party claimed in a March 19 tweet: ""Thanks to @GovChristie NJ now has lowest corruption risk of any state.""

But the regulations behind New Jersey’s highest scores were put in place before Christie became governor. As governor, Christie’s proposed ethics reforms have stalled in the Democrat-controlled Legislature.

"['Ohio', 'Energy', 'Rob Portman']","
Rob Portman says oil production on public lands was down 14 percent in 2011
","
Everyone complains about gasoline prices.

President Barack Obama says he’s trying to do something about them, including making the country less reliant on foreign oil. Republicans say he should do a lot more to spur domestic oil and gas production.

PolitiFact has reviewed some of Obama’s energy measures before, including his claim that U.S. energy production is at an eight-year high. But there’s a counter-claim by many Republicans that was ripe for exploration when Sen. Rob Portman mentioned it on March 26, 2012.

During a radio interview with Fox News Radio, Portman said:

""The president says, you know, ‘we're doing more.’ Well, on public lands, we're doing less. Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before. We should be doing more on public lands, and that's the outer continental shelf and what's going on in Alaska and so on.""

Portman’s press secretary, Christine Mangi, steered us to an article published online by Greenwire, a news service that covers energy issues. The article, posted on March 14, was on the state of energy exploration and was based on testimony and statements U.S. Bureau of Land Management director Bob Abbey made before a panel of Senate appropriators.

The article made its point in the first paragraph: ""Energy firms face fewer costs and regulatory obstacles when drilling on state and private lands than they do on public lands, where oil production fell last year, a top Obama administration official said today,"" Abbey also told the lawmakers, according to the article, that oil exploration and drilling companies have migrated to nonpublic lands for economic reasons, not because of Obama policies.

The article noted that, according to Interior Department statistics, oil production fell by 14 percent in fiscal year 2011 on federal lands and waters. That’s exactly what Portman said. ""The dip in production occurred mostly in the Gulf of Mexico, where a moratorium on deepwater drilling stunted exploration for much of 2010 in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster,"" Greenwire reported.

We wanted to drill down beneath the article. So we turned to transcripts of Abbey’s recent testimony in both the House and the Senate. There is no need to repeat it all here because Greenwire summed it up well, but we’ll point out one important part of the BLM chief’s testimony before Senate appropriators on March 14.

From a transcript:

""But no doubt the statistics would show that the U.S. oil and gas production is up and last year it's more -- last year more oil is produced in this country than any time since 2003 according to...
(CROSSTALK) And the, you know, no doubt the aggressive development of shale gas and shale oil has led to a shift to private lands in the east and to the south where there is less amount of federal mineral estate in those sections of the country.""

He added that where oil and gas companies decide to develop ""is up to them. For example, we have approved 7,000 applications for permits to drill that are not being drilled. We have over 25 million acres of lands that we've leased that are not being developed. So it's a decision that's being based and (CROSSTALK) by the market.""

As for the Gulf of Mexico, Abbey acknowledged the effect of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, and of safety measures taken that slowed the issuance of new permits. But he said permitting has speeded up -- that trend, too, has been documented -- and added that the ""administration must strike the proper balance between the speed of processing and ensuring that industry is drilling responsibly and safely especially in the context of the largest oil spill in our nation's history which we saw with the Deepwater Horizon incident.""

Putting aside the reason for the decrease, it appeared that Portman was accurate when he said oil production was down on public lands last year. But there was one more thing we wanted to check: The actual number.

For that, we turned to the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

ONRR tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands, including oil from offshore wells. Using online records of royalty revenue, it is possible to estimate the amount of oil, gas and coal produced onshore and offshore on federal property in any fiscal year.

Much more easily understood, and with similar results, is a recent report from EIA titled, ""Sales of Fossil Fuels Produced from Federal and Indian Lands, FY 2003 through FY 2011."" EIA worked with ONRR to produce the report.

These numbers go directly to Portman’s claim. In 2010, EIA data show, 726 million barrels of oil came from federal lands, including offshore wells. In 2011, it was 626. That’s a drop of 13.77 percent, which can be rounded to 14 percent.

This data, as well as a more complex measure (it involves royalties and British thermal units of energy, but we’ll spare you), would appear to render Portman’s statement accurate. Yet it’s worth noting that oil statistics can be used to make a somewhat different argument about drilling and exploration.

From 2009 to 2010, offshore oil production rose by 14.9 percent. Prior to that, before Obama’s presidency, the offshore volume fell for several years, and it was erratic even during a phase in which it rose, EIA figures show.

Yet onshore oil production generally rose on federally owned land -- and did again in 2011, by 3.7 percent.

What does this say? To the White House, it says oil production on all public land is up; that it’s getting better and better on private land, where oil companies are chasing the boom in horizontal fracking; and that even last year’s drop on federal property, chiefly in the Gulf of Mexico, shouldn’t be regarded as a lack of commitment to offshore drilling

Making this case more forcefully, the White House on March 15 issued a blog post (to which we were pointed by the Interior Department) that broke the figures for oil production on public lands and water into annual averages over three-year periods. The most recent average, during the Obama presidency, was  661.7 millions of barrels of oil. That compares with an annual average of 585.3 million barrels during President George W. Bush’s last three years. The point of presenting it this way? The White House was able to show a 13 percent improvement over the previous administration.

So did the United States produce 14 percent less oil on its public lands last year, as Portman said? Yes.

Was his statement made in a context of needing to do more, or more specifically, of this president not doing enough? Yes.

He lent his voice to the ongoing debate of whether to allow more drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, and off the intercontinental shelf of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Fair enough.

The White House points to the broader measure of all oil production, including on private land, to show an improvement. That, too, is fair. But experts agree that most big boosts in production come from years of earlier exploration and drilling. Much of the current success was seeded under a different administration, just as Obama’s actions are expected to bear fruit later.

And at least part of the drop on public lands last year was due to the Deepwater Horizon disaster and oil spill and, according to BLM, an apparent shift by oil companies to private lands ripe for fracking.

That leaves us here: Portman’s fact was accurate: There was a 14 percent drop on public lands. Everything else can be teased out and spun for either party’s purposes. Under PolitiFact guidelines, when a statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, it rates a Truth-o-Meter rating of Mostly True.","[('\nSen.

Interpretation of Obama gaffe needs better defense
","
President Barack Obama tried to make fun of his open-mic gaffe with his Russian counterpart during a recent meeting. But some critics thought there was nothing to laugh about.

They quickly accused Obama of behind-the-scenes deal-making with the Russians. The Washington-based news organization Politico carried an article about conservatives concerned about what Obama has in mind when he asked Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for ""space"" until his presumed re-election in November, when Obama would have ""more flexibility"" on objections to America’s missile-defense plan. Obama was unaware the microphone between the two men was still on.

""This is my last election,"" Obama said. ""After my election, I have more flexibility.""

Both men nodded. Medvedev said he would pass along Obama’s message to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who will become Russia’s president in May.

While some wondered what Obama was talking about, former Georgia state Sen. Eric Johnson, now a lobbyist at the state Capitol, made it clear what Obama’s plans were in a Twitter post.

""Obama tells Russia that he’ll turn over America’s defense system to them if re-elected,"" Johnson wrote a day after the comments were reported. ""Was he bowing when he did this? Unbelievable!""

This was news to us. There have been no news reports that Obama wants to turn over the nation’s defense system to its one-time Cold War foe. Johnson is well-known in Georgia politics. The Savannah Republican ran for governor in 2010. He was once the Georgia Senate pro tem and remains involved in politics.

Johnson maintained his position with us, saying Obama was ""up to something"" that could hurt U.S. allies such as South Korea if there is no missile defense system and that nation is attacked by its Communist neighbor, North Korea.

""I think I heard the same thing South Korea heard, that [Obama] is going to throw us under the bus,"" Johnson told PolitiFact Georgia.

The U.S. Defense Department has a Missile Defense Agency that is conducting research and developing technology to counter ballistic missiles of all ranges that may threaten the nation or its interests. The United States has cooperative programs on missile defense with a number of allies, including Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom, according to the MDA website.

Here’s how Bloomberg News described the missile system:

""In 2007, the U.S. started preparations for a missile defense system -- ostensibly against an Iranian attack -- with its front legs in Europe. The forward radar for the system was to be in the Czech Republic, and Poland would host the missiles that would shoot down any long-range ballistic missiles Iran might let fly. Russia, however, saw the shield as a naked Cold War power play by the U.S. and was mad as hell.""

A day after his comments to the Russian leader, Obama said he’s committed to reducing nuclear stockpiles. A national security adviser said the White House will continue to implement the missile-defense system.

""The United States is committed to implementing our missile-defense system, which we’ve repeatedly said is not aimed at Russia,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said in a statement, The Washington Post reported. ""The two presidents agreed it was best for technical experts to spend time determining their respective positions and provide space on missile-defense cooperation going forward."" 
Vice President Joe Biden also didn't signal that the Obama administration is planning to turn over America’s missile defense system, saying Sunday on Face The Nation that it also helps Israel.

Johnson is not buying the White House line.

""I think there’s evidence of [Obama] doing everything to weaken America abroad,"" he said.

Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney called Obama’s comments ""alarming.""  Romney said he wanted details about what the two leaders were discussing.

Johnson, however, took the rhetoric several steps further. His claim seems way off base from anything we’ve seen and read.

Johnson said he likes PolitiFact Georgia’s fact-checking. But he vowed to to stick with his interpretation of Obama’s off-script moment.

PolitiFact Georgia didn’t see or hear anything about Obama turning over the nation’s missile defense system. We say ""nyet"" to Johnson’s statement.

"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Frank LoBiondo']","
Frank LoBiondo says health care reform law will cost more than twice the original estimate
","
The court of public opinion has already struck down the health care law, according to one Republican.

Now, U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo said, it’s the U.S. Supreme Court’s turn.

The southern New Jersey congressman said in a letter to The News of Cumberland County that health care reform passed without bipartisan consensus. And, he said, although the tentacles of ""ObamaCare"" are not yet fully extended, the cost of the law is already increasing.

""Many of the tax increases and penalties have yet to take effect while new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office conclude the final price-tag will exceed $2 trillion — more than double what was initially reported,"" LoBiondo wrote in the letter published online a week before the Supreme Court started hearing arguments over provisions in the law.

PolitiFact New Jersey found two problems with LoBiondo’s statement: it relies on a misleading comparison and the ""final price-tag"" is marked up.

So how much will the law cost?

LoBiondo was referring to gross, rather than net, costs. The gross cost --  the cost without accounting for additional revenues the government will collect from the law  -- was estimated at $938 billion by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, two years ago. That estimate includes costs from 2010 to 2019.

In a recent report, the congressional agency updated its estimate to $1.762 trillion for 2012 to 2022.

The updated figure doesn’t ""exceed $2 trillion."" LoBiondo spokesman Jason Galanes cited other estimates the CBO released to back up the point. In those estimates, the agency tests how the costs would change in scenarios that differ from the agency’s expectation that there will be a small reduction in employment-based health insurance.

Galanes said in an e-mail that ""LoBiondo believes it is reasonable to project that the law could in fact reach or exceed $2 trillion in costs as three of the four scenarios considered by CBO suggest.""

But under the congressional agency’s current assumptions, the projected gross cost is $1.762 trillion. And that’s not ""more than double what was initially reported."" To reach that conclusion, the congressman made a misleading comparison.

The congressional agency’s original estimate of $938 billion included 10 years of data, from 2010 to 2019. In its latest estimate, the CBO projects the gross cost of the law over 11 years, from 2012 to 2022, for a total of $1.762 trillion.

So, the figures include a different number of years. Also, the latest estimate represents nine years when the law is fully implemented and,  therefore, costs more. The earlier estimate included several years when the law was not fully implemented and so costs were lower.

When the gross costs from 2012 to 2019 -- the years included in both reports -- are compared, the difference is significantly less than double.  It’s an increase of 8.6 percent, from $931 billion to $1.01 trillion.

The difference in the net cost estimate over the same time frame further erodes LoBiondo’s point. It has decreased slightly from the earlier estimate.

Two years ago, the CBO projected the health care law would have a net cost  of $777 billion from 2012 to 2019. Now, that estimate is $772 billion.  

Our ruling

LoBiondo said ""new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office conclude the final price-tag"" for the health care law ""will exceed $2 trillion — more than double what was initially reported.""

CBO recently projected the gross cost of insurance coverage provisions in the law at $1.762 trillion from 2012 to 2022. In 2010, the agency estimated the gross cost at $938 billion from 2010 to 2019.

It’s misleading to compare those two figures since they represent different years. When comparing the years included in both estimates -- 2012 to 2019 -- it’s clear the cost did not double. It increased by 8.6 percent. And during the same time, the net cost of the law decreased.

We rate this claim False.

Providence restaurateur John Elkhay says that if Rhode Island raises the state meal and beverage tax to 10 percent, it would be the fourth-highest in the nation
","
At a recent rally in Providence against a proposal to raise Rhode Island’s meal and beverage tax, restaurant owners and staff gathered with dozens of other protesters on the State House lawn and marched to Waterplace Park, where they ""dumped"" 30 pounds of tea into the Woonasquatucket River.

This was no Boston Tea Party -- the tea was sealed in a plastic bag and attached to a rope so it was easily retrieved from the river -- but the protesters at the March 21 rally shouted their message for all to hear: Governor Chafee’s plan to hike the tax from 8 percent to 10 percent would discourage people from eating out and harm the state’s hospitality industry.

Providence restaurateur John Elkhay, of the Chow Fun Food Group, was at the head of the march, leading the crowd in chants against the tax increase. At one point, he yelled out that a 10 percent meal and beverage tax in Rhode Island would be the ""fourth-highest in the nation.""

The Ocean State has developed a reputation for high taxes. We’ve already written about the property tax burden in the state, specifically Providence’s dubious distinction of having the second-highest commercial property tax burden in the country. But we hadn’t heard claims about the state meal tax before.

We left a message for Elkhay, whose restaurants include XO Cafe, Rick’s Roadhouse and Luxe Burger Bar. Then we did our own research.

Meal taxes are also sometimes known as ""restaurant taxes"" or ""prepared-food taxes"" and are generally levied on top of sales taxes. Meal taxes do not refer to taxing groceries, or ""non-prepared food."" In fact, groceries are completely or partly exempt from sales taxes in nearly all states, including Rhode Island.

The General Assembly created Rhode Island’s meal and beverage tax in 2003 as a way to tamp down local property tax increases. The 1-percent tax is imposed on top of the state’s 7-percent sales tax. Revenue from the 1-percent tax goes to cities and towns while revenue from the 7-percent tax goes to the state.

Add the taxes together and diners pay an 8-percent tax when eating out in Rhode Island. Chafee’s plan is to raise the meal tax to 3 percent for a total tax of 10 percent.

Most other states allow a similar tax but it’s more commonly levied by individual municipalities. For example, at the height of the recession in 2009 the state legislature in Massachusetts passed a bill allowing cities and towns to impose a 0.75 percent meal tax on top of the state’s 6.25 percent sales tax. By the following year, more than 70 communities had adopted the meal tax to supplement their budgets.

Elsewhere in New England, New Hampshire and Vermont both have a statewide meal tax of 9 percent. Maine’s is 7 percent. Connecticut, where the sales tax is 6.35 percent, has no special meal tax.

Because meal taxes are generally levied on the municipal level, the studies we found compared rates in cities rather than states.

The most recent study was released earlier this month by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C. It examined the tax in the 50 most populous cities in the nation (35 of which don’t have a special meal tax, just a sales tax).

At the top of the list was Minneapolis, which imposes a 3 percent meal tax on top of the city’s 7.775 sales tax for a total tax of 10.775 percent. Chicago was second with a 1.25 percent meal tax on top of a 9.5 percent sales tax for a total tax of 10.75 percent. And Virginia Beach was third with a whopping 5.5 percent meal tax on top of a 5 percent sales tax for a total tax of 10.5 percent.

Washington, D.C., and Seattle were tied for fourth with a total tax on restaurant meals of 10 percent -- the same rate Rhode Island would have under Chafee’s proposal.

We asked the Tax Foundation if it could break out the states that impose a meal tax statewide so we could make an apples-to-apples comparison with Rhode Island’s rate, but the foundation did not have that information.

The Washington, D.C.-based National Restaurant Association gave us a different national study on meal taxes, this one done by researchers at the University of Denver in 2007. Although its ranking was similar to the one done by the Tax Foundation, parts of it were outdated. So for this item, we’ve chosen to rely on the Tax Foundation study.

It’s important to note that Rhode Island’s high ranking for its meal tax is driven by the state’s high sales tax. At 7 percent, Rhode Island has the second-highest statewide sales tax in the country, behind only California.

Slap on another 1 percent  -- or 3 percent with Chafee’s latest proposal -- and you’re in double digits when it comes to meals.

Other states do assess higher taxes for meals.

In Virginia, localities are allowed a meal tax of up to 6.5 percent on top of a 5-percent sales tax. In Richmond, which isn’t large enough to have made the lists from the Tax Foundation or the University of Denver, the total tax is 11 percent. Eight other small municipalities in that state levy the full 11.5 percent tax.

When a spokeswoman for Elkhay got back to us, she said that he got the information on meal taxes in other states from the same sources we found -- the recent Tax Foundation study and the older report from the University of Denver.

Our ruling

Restaurateur John Elkhay says Governor Chafee’s proposed 10-percent meal and beverage tax would be the ""fourth-highest in the nation.""

Most meal taxes in other states are applied by cities and towns, so a comparison should take in those localized rates. And according to the most recent study from the Tax Foundation, a 10 percent rate in Rhode Island would be tied for fourth-highest in the nation.

But shoehorning Rhode Island into the list is imperfect, because it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison.

And there’s another issue, too. The Tax Foundation list considered only the 50 most populous cities in the nation, so it didn’t take into account every meal tax imposed in every locality. In Virginia alone, we found nine smaller communities that would make it to the top of the Tax Foundation list.

Elkhay’s statement is partially accurate -- increasing Rhode Island’s meal tax would make it one of the highest rates in the country. But we can’t say definitively that it would be fourth-highest. Because the claim ""leaves out important details or takes things out of context,"" we rate it Half True.

Did the state's middle managers really avoid pay cuts and layoffs?
","
Public employee compensation is always a point of contention when it comes to Oregon’s political discourse. Even so, the recession has done a good job of amplifying the complaints of those who say that government workers haven’t suffered quite as much as those in the private sphere.

Near the end of the February session, Sen. Jeff Kruse, R-Roseburg, sent out a newsletter to constituents. In it, he said  that lawmakers had not done enough to curb costs during difficult economic times. To prove his point, he brought up middle management.

""I am just frustrated by the fact the focus continues to be on government and not the people,"" he wrote. ""For the duration of this recession not a single person in government middle management has lost their job or taken a pay cut.""

Certainly, the state has managed to stave off some pretty disastrous cuts to social services and the like, but we weren’t sure he was right that there were absolutely no middle managers who lost their jobs or took a pay cut.

We called the senator to see if he had any proof to back up his claim. He said that when the Legislature looks through staffing figures, each position has a number attached to it. The government, he said, has so far not eliminated any of those numbers, so nobody has been laid off.

We weren’t sure that held up, so we called the Department of Administrative Services, which  oversees the day-to-day business of the state and its many bureaucracies.

Right off the bat, spokeswoman Amy Velez pointed out that Kruse was wrong about pay cuts.

""Managers were subject to furloughs -- everyone was subject to furloughs -- even before represented employees were,"" she said.

After some data mining, she came back to us with a more comprehensive look at government cutbacks during the recession.

Since March 1, 2009, Velez said, all step increases have been frozen. And from then until the end of June 2013, she added, managers with a salary of more than $3,101 a month will tally up nearly seven weeks worth of unpaid furlough days. All said, furloughs affected more than 5,000 management and executive service employees.

That’s one strike for Kruse -- an unpaid furlough is effectively a pay cut.

As for the no layoffs part, he appears to be off base there, too. Velez said that the number of executive branch employees has dropped by 714 between January 2011 and today. They weren’t all laid off due to budget cuts, of course -- the number represents retirements as well as voluntary and involuntary separations -- but some were.

Velez couldn’t get us the breakdown for the entire state, but she sent us a list of 16 employees laid off at DAS alone since Jan. 1, 2011 -- at least two of whom were managers. The list does not include those who retired to avoid layoff or who bumped down to other state positions.

The Department of Administrative Services is about as good as it gets, but we like corroborating sources. So, we turned to Sen. Richard Devlin, a Democrat from Tualatin and one of the co-chairs of the Legislature’s budget writing committee. We asked him whether Kruse was onto something with his explanation about numbered job positions not getting cut. His answer: no.

""During the regular, long (2011) session, we eliminated a number of positions,"" Devlin said. ""We took away the position authority and took away the money for them.

""There have been some middle managers that were laid off"" in addition to others, he said.

And more recently, the Legislature has taken steps to reduce management overhead, Devlin said. The most recent step was this year’s House Bill 4131, a law that explicitly ""requires layoffs or reclassifications of supervisory employees for the purpose of attaining"" an employee-to-manager ratio of 11 to 1.

Finally, just to cover all of our bases, we made additional calls to other parts of the government, including the Department of Human Services. There we spoke with Gene Evans. Off the top of his head, he recalled two management positions eliminated in June 2010.

Evans also forwarded us a July 2010 e-mail from Bruce Goldberg, the man who oversaw DHS before a reorganization created the Health Authority. In the e-mail, Goldberg writes, ""I also want to recognize the management service employees who received the news this week that they are being laid off as part of our workforce reduction.""

Karynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Health Authority, also confirmed her agency has seen managerial layoffs.  

We went back to Kruse as we gathered information to see if he had any additional comments.

He said the furloughs didn’t count because employees were simultaneously getting benefit and cost-of-living adjustments. (We circled back with Velez on this point. It didn’t stand up to scrutiny.  ""I have verified with our Human Resource Services Division that 1.5 percent COLA increases were offset by the adoption of 5 percent employee contribution to healthcare premiums,"" Velez wrote to us in an e-mail.)

As for the layoffs that Velez, Evans and Fish mentioned, Kruse didn’t believe them, sticking by his initial statement.

Kruse told his constituents that ""for the duration of this recession not a single person in government middle management has lost their job or taken a pay cut."" That’s blatantly false, and yet he continues to stand by his newsletter. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.","[('\nInterview with Sen.

Andrew Napolitano and chain email say Barack Obama signed controversial law ""in secret""
","
A new chain email says a bill signed by President Barack Obama raises the specter of Nazi Germany.

""Who would have believed this would ever happen in the USA . . . . .  or is this 1933, and are we in NAZI Germany . . .

""This is serious and it just was signed into law last Thursday, March 15th in SECRET!!  HR 347. Our glorious politicians on both sides, and Obama do it again!""

The email links to a Fox News segment with legal commentator Andrew Napolitano, as well as a Cincinnati TV station’s ""reality check"" on the law, and a blog post by the American Civil Liberties Union.

Because most of the material provided by the email is in the realm of opinion -- indeed, it would likely be subject to interpretation by federal courts -- we will limit our fact-check to the suggestion that the law was signed ""in secret,"" a claim made not only by the email but also by Napolitano, who in the interview said the law was ""a slow, creeping destruction of some of our basic liberties, and the president signed it in secret.""

Let’s start by taking a look at the law, and the critics’ interpretations of it.

What the law says

The Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011 was signed by Obama on March 8, 2012. The law is filled with legalese that gives only hints of its potential reach. A summary on THOMAS, the database run by the Library of Congress, suggests the law puts up restrictions for buildings when the president or anyone else protected by the Secret Service is nearby. It says the law:
  
Amends the federal criminal code to revise the prohibition against entering restricted federal buildings or grounds to impose criminal penalties on anyone who knowingly enters any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority. Defines ""restricted buildings or grounds"" as a posted, cordoned off, or otherwise restricted area of: (1) the White House or its grounds or the Vice President's official residence or its grounds, (2) a building or grounds where the President or other person protected by the Secret Service is or will be temporarily visiting, or (3) a building or grounds so restricted due to a special event of national significance. 

The punishment would be a fine or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, if it involves a weapon or results in ""significant bodily injury."" For lesser offenses, the punishment could be a fine and imprisonment for not more than one year.

The critics’ concerns

So what is Napolitano concerned about? Here’s an excerpt from his interview with Fox News’ Eric Bolling. (Napolitano didn’t respond to our interview request made through his website.)

""This is not like a traffic ticket,"" Napolitano said. ""For standing and protesting, the type of thing that for 230 years Americans took for granted because it was protected by the First Amendment - 'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech' – has actually been abridged. By legislation the president signed last Thursday, supported overwhelmingly by both parties, with very very little public debate and very little debate in Congress, basically allows Secret Service agents to decide where there are ‘no-free-speech zones’ …. And anybody by the Secret Service, protected by the Secret Service, can ask those agents to ban protests wherever they are. So I can think of three violations (of constitutional protections): speech violations, association violations, the right to petition the government for a redress of your grievances. What good is free speech if the people in the government are so far away from you that they can't hear you?""

The ACLU expressed concerns about the bill as well, but in a more measured fashion.

In a blog post, Gabe Rottman, a legislative counsel and policy advisor in the ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office, wrote that ""it's important to note — contrary to some reports — that H.R. 347 doesn't create any new crimes, or directly apply to the Occupy protests. The bill slightly rewrites a short trespass law, originally passed in 1971 and amended a couple of times since, that covers areas subject to heightened Secret Service security measures.""

Rottman added, ""Any time the government lowers the intent requirement, it makes it easier for a prosecutor to prove her case, and it gives law enforcement more discretion when enforcing the law. To be sure, this is of concern to the ACLU. We will monitor the implementation of H.R. 347 for any abuse or misuse. … Rest assured we'll be keeping an eye on how this law will be interpreted and used by law enforcement — especially in light of the coming elections.""

The 'secret' signing

So was the bill signed ""in secret""?

If it was, then how would we know about it to write this fact-check?

The strongest evidence that the bill was signed ""in secret"" was that Obama didn’t sign it in a public ceremony. The White House released a brief statement after it was signed. The statement said, in its entirety, ""On Thursday, March 8, 2012, the President signed into law H.R. 347, the ‘Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011,’ which makes it a federal crime to enter or remain knowingly in any restricted area of the White House, the Vice President’s official residence, or their respective grounds without lawful authority.""

But that statement wasn't secret. In fact, it was a statement from White House Press Secretary Jay Carney that was emailed to journalists on the White House email list -- a list estimated to include several thousand addresses, according to the White House. 
In addition, the White House told PolitiFact that the bill had been listed on a White House web page for pending legislation before it was signed. And it's important to note that most bills are signed without public ceremonies, according to Senate historian Don Ritchie.

So there wasn't the hoopla that surrounds some signings, but it was no secret.

In addition, the existence of the bill itself had been known for more than 14 months, and its passage by both chambers of Congress -- and its delivery to the president for his signature -- was public for the whole time.

The bill was introduced in January 2011 by Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla. Within weeks, it was considered by both the relevant subcommittee and the full committee. On February 28, it was debated on the House floor, in speeches televised on C-SPAN.

Rooney urged his colleagues to vote for the measure and the bill was seconded on the floor by a Democrat, Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. No one rose to speak against the bill.

The bill then proceeded to a vote, under a process called ""suspension of the rules"" -- a fast-track process used for bills considered non-controversial by the leadership. Using this streamlined process, a bill needs a two-thirds vote to pass, rather than just a simple majority. In this case, the House voted in favor of the bill, 399-3.

At that point, the bill went to the Senate, where it became stalled. In November 2011, an amended version made it through the Judiciary Committee, and on Feb. 6, 2012, the Senate announced that it had passed by ""unanimous consent"" -- a process by which Senators approve a bill without a formal vote, after all Senators have been consulted and none have offered objections.

Because the Senate passed an amended version of the bill, it had to go back to the House to be reconciled. On Feb. 27, 2012, the House began a new debate on the amended bill, in which Rooney and Johnson once again spoke on its behalf. Once again, no one rose to speak against the bill. And once again, the bill was put to a vote under suspension of the rules. For a second time, the vote was lopsidedly in favor -- 388-3.

With the House and Senate both having passed the bill, it went to the president for his signature on March 1, 2012. Eight days later, Obama signed it, and it became Public Law 112-98.

So while it’s true that Obama didn’t invite the media or other observers in for a signing ceremony, the bill had gone through a very public process on its way to becoming law. It twice received a debate (albeit brief ones) on the House floor. The House twice voted on it publicly, in proceedings aired on C-SPAN. And after the second House passage, it was hardly a state secret that the bill was headed to the president’s desk for his signature.

Our ruling

Napolitano said the law was signed ""in secret."" But the path of H.R. 347 to the president's desk was very public.

It was introduced in public, discussed in public, voted on in public, and then signed the same way as most bills. The White House says it posted the bill on its web page for legislation awaiting the president’s signature.

It’s true that there weren't cameras present, but if they had been, what would they have captured? That Obama signed the bill. That fact was announced by the White House the same day in a statement sent to thousands of journalists.

There may be legitimate reasons to question whether the law infringes on constitutional rights. But there were many occasions during its public consideration when critics could have questioned lawmakers and the White House about the law. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.","[('\nChain e-mail received by PolitiFact on H.R. 347\n\nAndrew Napolitano, interview with Eric Bolling on Fox News\n\nFox News 19 Cincinnati, ""Reality Check"" segment\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, ""How Big a Deal is H.R. 347, That \'Criminalizing Protest\' Bill?""\nMarch 8, 2012\n\nText of H.R. 347, the Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011\n\nWhite House, statement on the president’s signing of H.R. 347, March 8, 2012\n\nResults of first House vote on H.R. 347\n\nResults of second House vote on H.R. 347\n\nPolitiFact, ""Allow five days of public comment before signing bills,"" updated May 26, 2009\n\nEmail interview with Brian Darling, senior fellow for government studies at the Heritage Foundation, March 30, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Burdett Loomis, University of Kansas political scientist, March 30, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Don Ritchie, U.S. Senate historian, March 30, 2012', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKjy0PDlKV4&feature=player_embedded#')]",/factchecks/2012/mar/30/andrew-napolitano/andrew-napolitano-chain-email-say-barack-obama-si/

Charlie Baird says Travis County office has had same leadership for 30 years
","
Charlie Baird, the former district and Court of Criminal Appeals judge challenging Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg in the May 29, 2012, Democratic primary, vows to bring a freshness to the local office responsible for prosecuting felony cases in the county.

A Baird leaflet we spotted in early March says: """"We've had the same leadership in the Travis County DA's office for 30 years.""

Is that so? We recall that Lehmberg took office as district attorney about three years ago. 
So, how does Baird get to his 30 years of the office being under the same leadership?

In an interview, Baird told us Lehmberg started working for the Travis County district attorney’s office before Ronnie Earle won his first term as DA in the 1970s. Baird also specified about 10 of Lehmberg’s deputies or section chiefs who he said had been with the office for an ""extraordinarily long time.""

A day later, Baird called back to say that his leaflet statement was based only on the tenures of Earle and Lehmberg -- and not time served by any longstanding deputies.

All righty, let’s count.

Earle became the district attorney in 1977, the Austin American-Statesman noted in a December 2007 news article on his decision not to run again in 2008.

According to Lehmberg’s biographical entry on the office’s website, she left private law practice to join the DA’s office in 1976. The entry continues: ""Rosemary began her career with the district attorney working with the Grand Jury and then as a trial attorney in the 167th District Court, presided over by Judge Tom Blackwell. She later became chief of that court and then the chief of the Trial Division. She has served as the chief of the Career Criminal, Major Crimes and Public Integrity Divisions.""

The entry continues: ""In 1988, Rosemary became director of the Family Justice Division. While director, she was a founder of the Travis County Children's Advocacy Center, now the Center for Child Protection... Rosemary served as First Assistant District Attorney from 1997 until 2009, when she was elected District Attorney. She took office in January 2009, the first woman district attorney in Travis County history.""

Our ruling

The Travis County DA’s office had two elected leaders over 35 years, from 1977 through 2011. Earle was the district attorney for 32 of those years, leaving office after voters elected Lehmberg, who earlier held several leadership roles under Earle and, significantly, was his first assistant for a dozen years.

Counting her time as the first assistant district attorney, it’s fair to say Lehmberg has been a key leader of the office for 15 years. 
However, Earle -- who is no longer there -- was the office’s leader most of the leaflet’s proclaimed 30 years.

We rate Baird’s claim as Mostly False.","[('\nAustin American-Statesman, news article, ""After 30 years in job, Earle announces retirement,"" Dec. 15, 2007\n\nTelephone interviews, Charlie Baird, Austin, March 6 and 7, 2012\n\nTravis County District Attorney’s Office, web page, Rosemary Lehmberg biographical entry (viewed March 27, 2012)', 'http://www.statesman.com/news/content/region/legislature/stories/12/15/1215earle.html')]",/factchecks/2012/mar/30/charlie-baird/charlie-baird-says-travis-county-office-has-had-sa/

Westmoreland: All federal housing programs need bailouts
","
U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland thinks taxpayers may be dragged into the bailout business again, thanks to the Federal Housing Administration.

The FHA provides mortgage insurance to encourage banks to write loans to people who have little cash for a down payment. Many of these loans went bad when the housing bubble burst, and FHA officials are trying to raise money to keep the insurance afloat.  

It’s not the first time, Westmoreland said during a Feb. 29 congressional hearing.

""There’s not been one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive,"" Westmoreland said.  

All federal housing programs? We contacted a Westmoreland spokeswoman to get the story.

Leslie Shedd, the spokeswoman, said Westmoreland was referring to three programs that were started to keep the housing market stable and encourage Americans to buy homes: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA.

Here’s how the feds got involved in the housing market:

After the real estate market collapsed during the Great Depression, the feds took steps to encourage banks to make home loans and families to buy houses.

They created the FHA, which issues mortgage insurance to guarantee that banks will get their money back even if a homeowner doesn’t make payments. This encourages banks to approve mortgages for people who don’t have a lot of money or have mediocre credit.

They also created Fannie Mae, and later Freddie Mac, to help lenders raise money to make more loans. Fannie and Freddie do this by selling the mortgages lenders’ make in bulk as securities and guaranteeing they will make a return.

Other programs perform similar tasks. For instance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, like the FHA, insures home loans, but only for houses in rural areas. The Office of Public and Indian Housing backs them for native lands, while the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees them for veterans.

Ginnie Mae, like Fannie and Freddie, guarantees mortgage securities, but its securities are made up of government-backed loans by the FHA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Public and Indian Housing.

This is what our research found:

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

Fannie and Freddie were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. But calling them ""federal housing programs"" is a thorny issue.

They weren’t controlled by the government until the bailout.

Congress chartered Fannie and Freddie as ""government-sponsored enterprises,"" or GSEs. They are supposed to help the U.S. meet its housing policy goals, but they were designed as for-profit corporations with their own shareholders and boards of directors. The federal government explicitly said it did not back the GSEs’ securities.

""They are in no way categorized as federal housing programs,"" said Ted Gayer, co-director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution.

The feds estimate the bailout will cost between $220 billion and $311 billion through 2014, though some of that will be paid back.

Federal Housing Administration

The president’s proposed budget for 2013 says the U.S. Treasury might have to give the FHA $688 million in emergency funds, but whether help will come in the form of a taxpayer-funded bailout is uncertain.

The FHA hiked the cost of mortgage insurance earlier this month to raise money, and it is set to receive about $1 billion from a legal settlement over fraudulent foreclosure practices. Its officials say these measures will avoid a bailout, but critics say this won’t be enough.

Ginnie Mae

Ginnie Mae hasn’t been bailed out, and it’s not clear it’s in dire trouble.

A November 2011 General Accounting Office report found that higher-than-expected defaults could force Ginnie Mae to dip into its reserves. It also concluded that Ginnie should do better at predicting future costs and documenting its methods.  

But so far, Ginnie has taken in more money than it has spent, the GAO said.

All the rest

The remainder of the federal programs are smaller players in the mortgage markets.

As of the second quarter of 2011, the FHA backed nearly $1 trillion in single-family loans. Veterans Affairs backed less than a quarter of that, while the USDA backed some 7 percent, according to data from the federal agency that took over Fannie and Freddie.  

They have yet to run into the kinds of trouble that Fannie, Freddie and the FHA are experiencing.  

The USDA and PIH have not needed a bailout so far, but Edward Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, warns the USDA might need one, in part because it makes riskier loans.  

The FHA requires down payments of 3.5 percent. The USDA allows loans with no money down.

As for Veterans Affairs, the word ""bailout"" does not apply. Whenever one of its loans defaults, taxpayers automatically pick up the tab. The program is not expected to pay for itself.

Conclusion

Westmoreland’s claim that ""there is not one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive"" has shortcomings.  

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been bailed out. And the FHA is in need of help, though it has not been bailed out at this point.

But Fannie and Freddie did not come under federal control until 2008. They are strange creatures on the U.S. financial landscape. They were created by the government but operated independently until the housing bust. At that time, they were bailed out by the feds.

The three other federal housing efforts have not been bailed out. And it’s not clear that they will need taxpayer assistance.

Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA are much larger players in the housing market. This bolsters Westmoreland’s larger point that organizations designed to help the housing market need help, too.

Marsha Blackburn says patients’ power to control health-care decisions would be given to payment advisory board
","
As the U.S. Supreme Court, after three days of oral arguments, moves toward determining the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we note that U.S.Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., has again weighed in on one of its provisions. Like many other Republicans, she is attacking the Independent Payment Advisory Board created in the legislation and voted to repeal the provision last month. The board is intended to rein in Medicare costs beginning in 2015 with Congress required to either accede to its recommendations or act to overrule them.

Specifically, Blackburn said: ""Instead of giving patients control of their health care decisions, the President and his allies in Congress chose to delegate this power to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington.""

We asked Blackburn spokesman Mike Reynard for evidence backing the claim and he referred to Section 3403 of the law where the board is established and to an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. Ryan said the board would be ""empowered by the new health-care law to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for seniors.""

Our PolitFact Ohio colleagues took a look at a similar assertion about the IPAB by the former ""Tutti Frutti"" crooner Pat Boone on March 11 and rated it a ""Pants on Fire"" distortion of the truth.

Closer to what Blackburn said about the IPAB are the statements PolitiFact national  looked at from of U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and PolitiFact Georgia looked at from U.S. Rep. Phil G Gingrey, R-Ga., the latter an obstetrician-gynecologist. Both suggested the IPAB’s ""bureaucrats"" would make medical decisions for patients. In both instances, those assertions were rated False.

PolitiFact Georgia asked four different health experts about Gingrey’s claim that ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" would ""decide whether you get care."" All four said Gingrey was wrong. Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank usually at odds with Democratic positions, said that the assertion that the IPAB would be controlling patients health-care decisions is ""not even close to correct."" Cato scholar Michael Tanner is himself an opponent of IPAB but nonetheless said: ""It [IPAB] has nothing to do with individual care at all. It’s not making decisions on individuals.""

The letter of the law shows the board has nothing to do with individual patients or their health care decisions, but would suggest cost-savings proposals within a mandate that specifies it cannot ration care. The board might recommend, based on medical best practices, that every discharged hospital patient get guidance on wound care or that they drink plenty of cold water. They might find that surgery to install certain medical devices – like hip replacements – should not be done on Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 105. The goal is cost-savings, not micro-managing patient care.

Blackburn couches her statement about the IPAB in the context of physicians cutting back on the number of Medicare patients they treat and suggests that, with the IPAB, ""this problem will only get worse, leaving our seniors without the necessary access to physicians they deserve.""
 
This overstates the case. Some physicians are not taking on new Medicare patients for a variety of reasons, including low reimbursement rates. And it’s true the board could recommend lower rates for some procedures and discourage more doctors from taking on new patients. But the board is mandated to do so on a medically sound basis. The board exists to rein in costs, a job Congress has repeatedly declined to undertake, as this Washington Post editorial, among others, has pointed out.

Gingrey also made an assertion that the board will be stocked with ""unelected bureaucrats,"" and said it would be capable of making life-and-death decisions. That was found to be just not false but outrageous by PolitiFact Georgia. ""This claim is incorrect,"" it said ""The IPAB does not have anything close to the power that Gingrey suggests. It cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying life-saving care.""

Blackburn’s claim that the IPAB will consist of ""15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington,"" like Bachmann’s grievance that the IPAB consists of political appointees, ""leaves out a lot of detail of the law’s requirements,"" as PolitiFact National put it in its check of Bachmann’s claims about the IPAB.

The law states that the members ""shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation and a balance between urban and rural representatives.""

It also says the board ""shall also include representatives of consumers and the elderly.""

And, it says individuals who are directly involved in providing or managing health care ""shall not"" constitute a majority of the board’s members.

The president appoints 15 members, who undergo confirmation by the Senate, and there are three ex-oficio members.

Once appointed to the board, the members become full-time government employees and are not allowed to hold other full-time employment.

Our ruling

Blackburn to her credit did not mention rationing -- connecting that practice to the IPAB is what pushed Boone’s claim to judged ridiculously false. But she did say that President Obama -- through the law -- would be giving the ""power"" to control Medicare patients’ health-care decisions to ""a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington.""

Since we find that the IPAB would not control decisions made at the individual patient level, we rate it False.

"['Environment', 'Oregon', 'Energy', 'Regulation', 'Transportation', 'Lars Larson']","
Are you 15 percent more likely to die in a car that’s 300 pounds lighter?
","Talk-radio host Lars Larson went after President Barack Obama in a news post recently, claiming that the White House’s attempts to increase vehicle fuel mileage will end up killing some of us. The post is tantalizingly called, ""Obama is going to kill some of you.""

How will that happen? Well, Larson says, the auto industry will do whatever it takes to stay in business, including making cars ""very, very small."" This is how Larson explains it:
  ""They’re going to peel hundreds and hundreds of pounds of weight off the cars that you drive to achieve the government ordered corporate average fuel economy, even though America is sitting on an ocean of available oil. Every time the weight of that vehicle is reduced by a hundred pounds, your chances of dying are going to go up by about 5 percent. Peel three hundred pounds off – you’re 15 percent more likely to die in that car."" 
We need to back up here. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, regulations are intended to improve the fuel economy of vehicles so we don’t guzzle so much oil. Obama  announced last year a goal of an average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The fleet average today is about 27 miles per gallon.

Conservatives tend to argue that automakers will respond by making cars lighter and, therefore, more dangerous. But it’s important to note that the regulations set different goals for vehicles based on type. In other words, large sports utility vehicles don’t have to meet the same mileage goal as compact cars.

That’s the backdrop. We turned to Larson.

He cited a 2003 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which found that a 100-pound reduction in smaller cars resulted in a 4.39 percent increase in fatalities. The study looked at fatality data from 1995 to 2000, involving 1991 to 1999 model vehicles. Let us emphasize, the statistic applied only to vehicles weighing less than 2,950 pounds -- not all vehicles. For larger vehicles, the increase was about 2 percent. (What’s a car in the higher-risk category? A 1995 Honda Accord LX is about 2,900 lbs.)

So the statistic exists, but we wondered: Surely vehicles have come a long way since 1999?

We turned to a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, who forwarded us an updated version of the 2003 study with new numbers.

And guess what? The 2011 study shows that for lighter cars weighing less than 3,106 lbs, the chances of dying go up 1.44 percent for every 100-pound reduction, if you maintain the same vehicle size or ""footprint"" as they call it.

That’s a much smaller difference.

Tom Wenzel is a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who also studies vehicle size, weight and fatality statistics. He explained the differences in the two studies.

One, he said, the 2003 study assumed weight reduction would be accompanied by size reduction, but that’s not necessarily the case. Two, he said, vehicles have quite simply changed in the last decade, to become safer without the added weight. The later study looked at vehicles made between 2000 and 2007.

The 4.39 percent figure is one statistic at one point in time, Wenzel said. Tweak the factors that go into the model to get that figure and the numbers change.

NHTSA acknowledges the variety of opinions. At a one-day workshop on the topic of mass, size and safety the agency’s deputy administrator said that researchers have come to different conclusions: ""Some associated a significant fatality increase with mass reductions, while others associated a fatality decrease with mass reduction.""

Finally, we checked with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Spokesman Russ Rader generally agrees that larger is safer. ""All cars are much safer than they used to be, but the laws of physics haven’t been repealed,"" he said. ""So the differences are still there: that is, people riding in small, lightweight cars get less protection in crashes than people in bigger, heavier ones.""

He pointed to a 2010 analysis of driver death rates per million showing that mini-cars, like the Honda Fit, had a death rate of 70 per million registered vehicles of that size. That’s double the rate for very large cars, 32 per million. And, sure, that makes sense.

But, we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out in the same chart that midsize cars, like the Honda Accord, had a death rate of 37 per million -- which is close to the largest cars. (Rader’s response? Midsize cars do a good job, too.)

We wanted to give a variety of sources and opinions, but we have a ruling to make.

Larson cited a study figure that was largely accurate in 2003, but only as applied to vehicles under a certain weight. And those numbers have been updated by the original researcher to reflect a much smaller increase that is significantly different from Larson’s statement.

Larson argues that his statement is accurate. His point remains that increasing fuel mileage -- from the mid-20s to 55 miles per gallon by 2025 -- will have to come from reducing weight and technical advancements, but he thinks it’s more of the former rather than the latter.  

""Reducing weight degrades safety. I told the listener that it makes death or injury more likely,"" he wrote in an email.

Researchers and others in the industry are somewhat divided on how much weight to give weight in calculating safety, but they acknowledge that Obama is not demanding that all of us start driving Honda Fits.

We apologize for picking on Hondas. We don’t apologize for our ruling. We rate the statement Mostly False. It contains a nugget of truth -- it came from a 2003 report -- but the number is out of date and narrow to boot.","[('OregonCatalyst.com, ""Lars Larson: Obama is going to kill some of you,"" March 20, 2012 \nWashington Examiner, ""Higher fuel standards mean higher death toll,"" July 2011\nNew York Times, ""Obama Reveals Details of Gas Mileage Rules,"" July 29, 2011\nHeritage Foundation blog, ""Morning Bell: The Obama EPA’s Brave New Future,"" July 28, 2011\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration press release, ""President Obama Announces Historic 54.5 mpg Fuel Efficiency Standard,"" July 29, 2011\nU.S. EPA, Transportation and Climate, Regulations and Standards (website)\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, ""NHTSA Releases Study on Vehicle Weight, Safety,"" Oct. 14, 2003\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, ""Relationships Between Fatality Risk, Mass, and Footprint in Model Year 2000-2007 Passenger Cars and LTVs, Preliminary Report,"" November 2011\nTom Wenzel, ""Assessment of NHTSA’s Report ‘Relationships Between Fatality Risk, Mass, and Footprint in Model Year 2000-2007 Passenger Cars and LTVs,’"" Draft Final report prepared for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, US Department of Energy, November 2011\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, ""NHTSA Workshop on Vehicle Mass-Size-Safety"" (website)\nTom Wenzel and Marc Ross, ""Are SUVs Safer than Cars?

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Rick Santorum']","
Santorum says Americans 'overwhelmingly' oppose health law, mandate
","
Rick Santorum, in an op-ed for U.S. News and World Report, wrote about his opposition to the national health care reform law, calling it ""a dangerous precedent"" that ""should be repealed in its entirety.""

And he says the American public is on his side.

""Polls show Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare, especially the individual mandate,"" Santorum wrote in the March 26, 2012, column.

The op-ed ran the same week that the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments on the constitutionality of the law and the mandate. We decided to check if Santorum is right about how the law is currently polling.

First, the law itself

The law, commonly referred to as Obamacare, is a massive legislative package that seeks to extend health coverage to all Americans. The individual mandate is the centerpiece, requiring all Americans to have insurance, either through their employers, private plans or government programs.

We contacted Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and Robert Blendon, a Harvard University professor who studies health care polling. Both pointed us toward recent polls on the issue

Here are some highlights:

* A March 2012 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows a virtual draw, with 41 percent of respondents reporting a favorable opinion of the law and 40 percent an unfavorable opinion.

* United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll, conducted March 22-25: 43 percent favor, 46 percent oppose

* The Pew Research Center’s March 2012 poll found that 47 percent approve of the legislation, and 45 percent disapprove.

* CNN, conducted March 24-25, 2012: 43 percent favor, 50 percent oppose

* ABC News/Washington Post poll, conducted March 10, 2012: 41 percent support, 52 percent oppose.

* New York Times, conducted March 23-25, 2012: 36 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove

* Ipsos Poll conducted for Reuters, March 2012: 44 percent favor the law, and 56 percent oppose.

Bowman noted that ""although responses differ from pollster to pollster, each pollster’s trend on the legislation has been remarkably stable for the 32 months we’ve tracked attitudes."" The overall trend shows the country has remained split over the law since it passed in 2010, with negative opinion on the rise in some polls in the last few months.

Next, the mandate

The individual mandate consistently shows up as the most unpopular piece of the health care legislation, and recent polls are no different.

A brief roundup:

* Kaiser Family Foundation: 30 percent feel somewhat favorable or very favorable about the individual mandate, 67 percent feel somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable.

* Pew Research Center: 32 percent had a favorable view of the provision, while 66 percent viewed it unfavorably.

* National Journal: 28 percent of those surveyed said they supported the mandate, while 66 percent opposed it.

* The ABC News/Washington Post poll asked a slightly different question and found 26 percent of Americans want to uphold the entire health care law, 25 percent want to throw out just the mandate, and 42 percent want to get rid of the whole thing.

""In other words,"" Blendon told us, ""the Washington Post finds that 67 percent of Americans want to get rid of the mandate.""

Said Bowman: ""Nearly every poll I’ve seen (and there are dozens) shows the public opposed to the mandate. If Santorum was speaking about the mandate only, the polls show opposition (and much of it strong).""

But both our experts were more measured about the extent of opposition to the entire law.

Bowman noted that Americans like many sections of the law, such as the provision that allows children to remain on their parents’ health plan until age 26 and another that prohibits companies from denying coverage because of a pre-existing condition.

""The verdict on the law is not overwhelmingly negative, though in most polls it tilts negative,"" she said.

Blendon said, ""Santorum isn’t completely wrong with his claim because some of these polls show a majority of Americans not supporting the overall health care bill or the individual mandate.""

Our ruling

Santorum wrote that, ""Polls show Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare, especially the individual mandate.""

We consulted several recent polls and found that, in broad terms, opinion on the health care law is more unfavorable than favorable, but not overwhelmingly. As Bowman said, it ""tilts negative."" But it's also worth noting that four of the most recent polls show stronger opposition than when we have ruled on similar statements in the past.

Objection to the individual mandate, however, is resounding. Some polls found approval rates in the low 30s and disapproval in the high 60s. That fits Santorum’s description of ""overwhelming.""

We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('\nU.S. News & World Report, ""Rick Santorum: Obamacare Means Unlimited Government,"" March\n26, 2012\n\nNational Journal, ""Public Still Opposes Health Care Mandate,"" March 27, 2012\n\nResults of New York Times/CBS News Poll, March 26, 2012\n\nCNN/ORC Poll, March 24-25, 2012\n\nABC News/Washington Post poll on health care, conducted March 7-10, 2012\n\nPew Research Center, ""Public Remains Split on Health Care Bill, Opposed to Mandate,"" March 26, 2012\n\nKaiser Family Foundation, Kaiser Health Tracking Poll -- March 2012\n\nReuters, ""Poll: Idea of healthcare overhaul gets wide support,"" March 28, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Karlyn Bowman, American Enterprise Institute, March 28, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Robert Blendon, Harvard University, March 28, 2012', 'https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-supreme-court-overturn-obamas-healthcare-law/rick-santorum-obamacare-means-unlimited-government')]",/factchecks/2012/mar/29/rick-santorum/santorum-says-americans-overwhelmingly-oppose-heal/
"['Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'Kirk Cox']","
Kirk Cox says McAuliffe has vetoed more bills than last three governors
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe is way too heavy-handed with his veto pen, says Del. Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights. ""In two years, Gov. McAuliffe has vetoed more bills than the previous three governors issued in each of their four-year terms,"" Cox, the House majority leader, said during an April 20 floor speech when the General Assembly met to consider the Democratic governor’s vetoes of bills that lawmakers passed this year. We wondered whether Cox’s claim is correct. His speech, it turns out, was written by Matthew Moran, communications director for House Speaker Bill Howell, R-Stafford. Moran told us his information came from statistics kept by the Legislative Information System, a 22-year-old database of bills and votes in the General Assembly. The records show that McAuliffe vetoed 32 bills this year and 26 in 2015. That comes to 58 in the past two years. Here are the four-year totals of each of the three previous governors: •Republican Bob McDonnell, 20 vetoes; •Democrat Tim Kaine, 44 vetoes; •Democrat Mark Warner, 18 vetoes. McAuliffe offers a simple reason for his many vetoes: The Republican-led General Assembly, he says, has passed a lot of what he considers to be bad bills. Among McAuliffe’s vetoes this spring were bills that would have: •Prohibited state agencies from punishing religious organizations that discriminate against same-sex couples; •Stopped state funding for Planned Parenthood; •Allowed home-schooled children to play on public school sports teams; •Prevented localities from removing Confederate monuments; •Repealed the governor’s ban on firearms in state office buildings; •Extended coal tax credits to help struggling coal regions; and •Given legislators control over implementing federal energy regulations. McAuliffe said he made it clear to legislators that he opposed these and other measures. ""Unfortunately, they sent those bills to me,"" he told reporters. ""And I vetoed them. No surprise."" We should note that the comparisons Cox made in accusing McAuliffe of veto-mania are tightly drawn and wouldn’t hold up if Cox had extended them past the previous three governors. The two governors immediately beyond that threshold, Republicans Jim Gilmore and George Allen, issued 90 and 84 vetoes, respectively, during their four-year terms. The legislative database doesn’t go back further. It’s anyone’s guess whether McAuliffe, who enters the final full year of his term in 2017, will top those high-water marks. In addition to the 58 vetoes from 2015 and 2016 to which Cox referred, McAuliffe rejected 10 bills in 2014. That gives him a total of 68 vetoes through his first three General Assembly sessions. The role of partisanship As a side note, we wondered whether the governors with the most vetoes faced General Assemblies controlled by the opposite party and vice versa. We found a strong, but not ironclad,  correlation. Allen, a Republican who served from 1994 to 1998, had 53 vetoes during his first two years, when the legislature was controlled by Democrats; and 31 during his last two years, when the House was run by Democrats and the Senate was evenly split between the parties. Gilmore, a Republican who served from 1998 to 2002, had 60 vetoes during his first two years, when control of the House and Senate was split between parties. He issued 30 vetoes during his last two years, when both chambers were controlled by Republicans. Warner, a Democrat who served from 2002 to 2006, issued 18 vetoes over his four-year term - the fewest by any recent governor - even though he faced a Republican legislature the entire time. Kaine, a Democrat who served from 2006 to 2010, had 27 vetoes during his first two years, when Republicans ran both chambers. He issued 17 during the second half of his term, when Democrats gained control of the Senate and the House remained in GOP hands. McDonnell, a Republican who served from 2010 to 2014, had four vetoes during his first two years, when the House was Republican and the Senate was Democratic. He issued 16 during his last two years, when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate was split. McAuliffe, a Democrat, has faced a Republican-controlled legislature during his first three years and, as we’ve noted, issued 68 vetoes.    Our ruling Cox said, ""In two years, Gov. McAuliffe has vetoed more bills than the previous three governors issued in each of their four-year terms."" The record bears him out. We rate his statement True.","[('Blue Virginia, Video of Del.

","Sen. Ted Cruz, looking to gain momentum against GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump ahead of the Indiana primary, contended that Trump’s economic policies would hurt Hoosiers and Americans across the country. Cruz said on NBC’s Meet the Press that his top priority is to bring manufacturing jobs back to Indiana, and he has a ""real policy agenda"" to do it, unlike Trump.   ""Donald’s only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40 percent tax hike of a giant tariff,"" Cruz said. ""That would send us into a recession. It would drive jobs overseas. It would kill small businesses."" Is Cruz right that the only idea up Trump’s sleeve is a giant tax on imports? Trump has certainly floated the idea of imposing tariffs on goods made overseas, but it’s not the only item on his economic agenda. And though it’s not entirely clear whether the tariffs would amount to 40 percent tax hike, experts agree that the costs would be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses. Let’s begin with what Trump has proposed. Trump’s plan to correct ‘stupid trade’ First, Trump has outlined a few other economic proposals beyond tariffs like declaring China a currency manipulator, upholding intellectual property law, ending China’s export subsidies (more on this later) and lowering the corporate tax rate to incentivize American companies to stay at home. He’s also suggested renegotiating or pulling out the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But Cruz has a point that Trump has talked at length about imposing tariffs on imported goods as a remedy for trade imbalances and lost American jobs. He’s specified a 35 percent tariff on some goods coming from Mexico and 45 percent tax on all Chinese products, which he said in the last Republican debate is a ""threat"" that he’d only enact it if ""they don’t follow the rules."" Here are some of the comments Trump has made regarding tariffs: • Candidacy announcement speech, June 16, 2015: Trump said he’ll tax China ""until they behave properly"" and charge a 35 percent tax on ""every truck and every part manufactured in (the Ford plant in Mexico) that comes across the border."" • Interview with the New York Times editorial board, Jan. 7, 2016: ""I would tax China coming in, products coming in. I would do a tariff. And they do it to us. ... I would do a tax. And let me tell you what the tax should be. The tax should be 45 percent. That would be a tax that would be an equivalent to some of the kind of devaluations that they’ve done. They cannot believe that we haven’t done this yet."" • GOP primary debate in South Carolina, Feb. 13, 2016: Trump said he’ll tell Carrier, the American air conditioner company that announced a move to Mexico, ""we're going to tax you when those air conditioners come. So stay where you are or build in the United States because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers."" • GOP primary debate in Miami, March 10, 2016: ""If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs. ...The 45 percent is a threat that if they (China) don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less."" Making Americans pay for the haul Trump’s tariff proposals have been called ""uneducated,""  ""worrisome"" and ""entirely ridiculous,"" and many economists (though not all) say they would hurt Americans. However, Cruz may be overstating the impact. ""The biggest losers would be U.S. consumers and companies,"" said Scott Lincicome, an international trade law and policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Tariffs at the level Trump is suggesting would cause prices of cheap products like air conditioners and intermediate goods like auto parts to soar and could cost U.S. jobs. But as some of the costs would be absorbed by Chinese and Mexican exporters, a 40 percent tariff doesn’t translate directly into a 40 percent tax hike. ""You would have to do some analysis to determine how much of a tax hike it is, but it is probably significantly less than 40 percent,"" said Joel Trachtman, a trade law specialist at the University of Maryland. Trachtman noted, however, that the sum of all Trump’s trade proposals — including the rejection of free trade agreements — may get you to a 40 percent hike. Trump’s tariffs would also see push back from the World Trade Organization, Lincicome pointed out, as Mexico City and Beijing wouldn’t take them lying down. ""The WTO sanctions these types of duties targeting export markets with the stroke of a pen. That’s just insane,"" he said. ""It’s a blatant violation of WTO rules. He would get us involved with a bunch of litigation and retaliation."" For example, the 35 percent tariff the United States imposed on Chinese tires in 2009 cost American consumers $1.1 billion in 2011 and the U.S. chicken industry $1 billion, according to analysis by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. The price of Chinese-made car tires rose by 26 percent, so the United States imported from countries like Thailand, Indonesia and Mexico instead and paid a premium for the shift. China also retaliated by slapping a tariff on American poultry, reducing chicken exports by 90 percent. Looking ahead, Trump’s suggested tariffs for Mexican imports would significantly affect the U.S. auto industry and would-be American car buyers. For example, the base price of a Chrysler Ram pick-up truck, which is currently assembled in Mexico, would increase by $9,000, according to Reuters. And like China, Mexico could return the favor by taxing U.S. goods as they’ve done in the past. Our ruling Cruz said Trump’s ""only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40 percent tax hike of a giant tariff."" Tariffs are not Trump’s ""only"" economic proposal. But Trump has trumpeted taxing Mexican and Chinese imports by 35 and 45 percent respectively. Most economists agree that American consumers and manufactures would bear some of the cost of these tariffs, though it’s not entirely clear if prices would increase by 40 percent, as Cruz says. Cruz’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.","[('NBC, Meet the Press, May 1, 2016', 'https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/us-china-trade-reform'), ('Donald J.

Do Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton agree on Planned Parenthood funding?
","Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being a ""Democrat-lite"" candidate who agrees all-too-often with Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton. ""Donald can't criticize her policies,"" Cruz said May 1, 2016, on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""You know why? Because he supports them. Donald and Hillary, they're flipsides of the same coin. They've both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power. So Donald can't criticize Hillary Clinton on Planned Parenthood, because he agrees with her. They both say it's terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding."" Cruz has been a vocal supporter of stripping the health organization of its $500 million in government funding since an anti-abortion group released secretly filmed footage purporting to show Planned Parenthood officials selling fetal tissue for a profit. Courts have not found evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. Do Trump and Clinton, respective frontrunners of the Republican and Democratic primaries, agree about maintaining taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood? There’s no question about Clinton’s support for Planned Parenthood. Throughout the campaign, she has frequently attacked Republicans’ pledge to defund the organization. And Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in July, its first-ever presidential primary endorsement. ""I am not only against defunding Planned Parenthood, but I would like to see Planned Parenthood even get more funding,"" Clinton told Fusion in January. Trump’s position is more nuanced. Regarding abortion generally, Trump has several times raised both Republicans’ and Democrats’ eyebrows by changing position. Today, Trump says he’s anti-abortion.   As it pertains to taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood, Trump has been fairly consistent since October 2015. He has said Congress should stop providing the group with federal funding full stop as long as they provide abortions. Here’s a sampling of Trump’s comments on the subject: Aug. 4, 2015: Trump said defunding Planned Parenthood would be worth a government shutdown. When radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump if he would support this kind of legislative maneuver, Trump said, ""I would."" Aug. 11, 2015: Trump backtracked to say he might consider funding for Planned Parenthood services other than abortion. ""I would look at the good aspects of it, and I would also look because I’m sure they do some things properly and good for women,"" he said. ""The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should absolutely not be funded."" This is the closest quote we found to support Cruz’s position. We should note a piece of longstanding legislative language called the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or protecting the mother’s health. So technically, federal funding does not support Planned Parenthood’s abortion services. But people who would like to see Planned Parenthood defunded argue that the money is fungible, so any money the organization receives from the federal government frees up other funds to spend on abortions. Oct. 18, 2015: Trump wouldn’t say outright if he would be willing to shut down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood. But he said, ""Planned Parenthood should absolutely be defunded. I mean if you look at what's going on with that, it's terrible."" Feb. 13, 2016: Trump and Cruz sparred over Planned Parenthood directly at a South Carolina debate. ""Donald didn't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood,"" Cruz said. ""And Donald has this weird pattern — when you point to his own record he screams, 'Liar, liar, liar.'"" ""Where did I support it?"" asked Trump. ""Where did I support it?"" ""You said Planned Parenthood does wonderful things,"" Cruz said. ""It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion,"" Trump said. ""There are wonderful things having to do with women's health, but not when it comes to abortion."" Cruz's campaign pointed us to this exchange as an example of Trump being unwilling to say he would cut off all funding.  Feb. 18, 2016: Trump said he respects some of the work Planned Parenthood does for women’s health, but their abortion practices should prevent them from getting funding. ""I said defund. I didn't say pay. I said I have a lot of respect for some of the things they do, the cervical cancer on women,"" he said, but they should not receive tax dollars, ""not while they do abortions."" Feb. 22, 2016: Trump continued the same narrative. ""Planned Parenthood does a lot of good jobs, a really good job in a lot of different areas. But not on abortion. So I'm not going to fund it if it's doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it."" March 1, 2016: Even more of the same. ""Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,"" he said. ""But we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and I've said it loud and clear."" So to recap: Trump’s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood seems to be that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, even though he respects some of the other work they do for women’s health. Our ruling Cruz said both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton say Planned Parenthood is ""terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding."" Trump and Clinton seem to agree that Planned Parenthood does some positive work as it pertains to things like cancer prevention, and Trump has described that work as ""wonderful."" However, Clinton supports their abortion services, and Trump does not. He thinks Planned Parenthood should not receive taxpayer dollars as long as they provide abortions. Clinton, on the other hand, has said Planned Parenthood should receive even more funding than it does now.

Julian Castro claims Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect a hate group
","Housing Secretary Julián Castro, a surrogate for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, took aim at Bernie Sanders’ record on immigration during the senator’s former elected capacity as an Independent member of the U.S. House from 1991 to 2007. Sanders ""voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community,"" Castro, a former San Antonio mayor, said in a statement rolled out by the Clinton camp March 8, 2016, the day that Sen. Sanders of Vermont won an upset victory in the party’s Michigan presidential primary. Clinton leveled a similar claim about Sanders and the Minutemen at a Democratic debate in Miami the next day; PolitiFact found her statement Mostly True. Unlike Castro, she did not call the Minuteman Project a hate group. Democrats tend to support comprehensive immigration reform including possible citizenship for residents living in the country without legal permission. Sanders, an Independent, caucused with Democrats in the House and later in the Senate. So it’s arguably not helpful at the polls for him to be seen as supporting the Minuteman Project, which came into the spotlight in 2005 when its founders organized a volunteer stakeout of parts of the Arizona-Mexico border for the month of April. One of the co-founders of the Minuteman Project, Chris Simcox, parted ways with the project and established the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps in 2005. The remaining founder, Jim Gilchrist, was fired from the Minuteman Project in 2007, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.  The groups spawned a network of chapters over the years, driven by a combination of growth and internal conflict over finances and other issues. Some chapters were not close to the border and focused on anti-immigration advocacy, while others voluntarily patrolled the U.S.-side of the border with Mexico. Those patrols and confrontation with undocumented immigrants prompted then-President George W. Bush to disparage them as ""vigilantes""  and a former Mexican president to call them ""immigrant hunters,"" the Washington Post reported in 2005. But the Minuteman Project and Minuteman Civil Defense Corps websites in 2005 and 2006 explicitly described their cause as ""peaceful"" and urged members to follow the letter of the law while patrolling the border, or risk discrediting their cause. In the claim, Castro, like Clinton, was referencing a vote on an amendment to a 2006 appropriations bill. The amendment was proposed by Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia in response to rumors that the U.S. Border Patrol had been telling the Mexican government where vigilante civilian border groups were stationed. The 2006 CQ Almanac described it as follows: ""Kingston, R-Ga., amendment that would bar the use of funds in the bill to provide a foreign government with information that relates to the operations or location of the Minutemen or other private volunteer border patrol groups along the U.S.-Mexican border, unless the information sharing is required by an international treaty."" On the House floor, Kingston explained, ""What this amendment does is it clarifies Congress' position on a Border Patrol practice or a practice of the U.S. Government that tips off illegal immigrants as to where citizen patrols may be located. ... What my amendment does is simply says that the U.S. Government cannot tip off the Mexican officials as to where these folks are located."" At the time, Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., said he didn’t oppose it because it essentially restated existing Customs and Border Patrol policy. PolitiFact found that Clinton got Sanders’ vote right — he did vote with the GOP for the amendment, House records show — but downplayed what had been a bipartisan vote where 76 Democrats joined 216 Republicans in support. But unlike Clinton, Castro described the Minuteman Project as ""a hate group."" So, is the Minuteman Project a hate group — and did Sanders’ vote really protect them? Requests for clarification from Castro led to Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, reaching out via email and directing us to the Southern Poverty Law Center’s list of nativist extremist groups.  The SPLC was established in 1971 and is listed as an outreach partner by the FBI, according to the agency’s website. The SPLC list doesn’t designate the Minuteman Project a hate group, unlike some other groups on their list of nativist extremists, which are marked with an asterisk to denote that they are both nativist extremist and hate groups. We wondered what moves a group into hate-group territory. By phone, Mark Potok, a center expert, told us ""the nativist extremist groups are a step towards the center."" ""Basically, those are the groups which go beyond merely disagreeing with immigration policy and confront, personally, suspected illegal immigrants, or people who would help or hire them,"" he said, adding: ""We don't list a group just for saying they think immigration levels ought to be lower."" Potok continued, ""the thing to understand about our hate group listing is it's not based on criminality or violence. It’s based on the ideology expressed by the group, on its website or by its leaders. We ask, does it demonize an entire group? Those are the hardest line groups we cover."" The SPLC’s website defines hate groups as those that ""have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics."" Potok said that in 2006, the year the vote Castro referenced took place, nativist extremist groups were on the rise after beginning to emerge around 2005. Activity peaked in 2010, he said, when the center tallied 319 groups. In 2015, the SPLC counted only 17 such groups. ""A lot of these [extremist nativist groups] were spinoffs of the Minutemen groups,"" Potok said, ""but not all."" Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, said in a phone interview that Jim Gilchrist, one of the co-founders of the Minuteman Project, was receptive when Levin approached him to deal with neo-Nazi elements in the organization, and that differences of opinion on how to handle that issue contributed to the fissure creating the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps. ""Certainly there were entities in the border movement that were clearly racist hate groups, and certainly there were people who were in the Minuteman Project at the time who were, but I can tell you that [Jim] Gilchrist wanted those people excluded, and after I informed him, he took measures to do,"" he said. In our research, we found that coverage of the project’s offshoots has been dominated by several high-profile criminal cases that happened in the years between 2006 and today. In 2009, a former member of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps murdered a Latino man and his 9-year-old daughter after breaking into their home, CNN reported. In 2013, Minuteman Project and Minuteman Civil Defense Corps co-founder Chris Simcox was arrested for child sexual molestation, according to Univision. These incidents have taken a toll on the reputation of the groups (for instance, in 2010, the NAACP referred to the Minuteman Project as ""a nativist organization that has in the past been associated with the murder of migrant Mexican workers as part of its vigilante ""border operations""). But it doesn't make sense to judge Sanders’ House vote on incidents that came after it occurred. So what information on the project was available at the time of the vote? A report from the Congressional Research Service, dated April 7, 2006, cited many potential problems that could arise with civilian border patrols, but also said that ""apart from the widely reported incident involving Ranch Rescue [an extremist anti-immigration group that dressed in military gear and went looking for armed drug smugglers in 2002], there have been no credible reports of civilian border patrol organizations engaging in violence against migrants."" Some scholars of the Minuteman Project, like Leo Chavez, an anthropologist at UC Irvine who has written about the group, have suggested that press coverage and creating a spectacle were central to the group’s purpose (""Although monitoring the U.S.- Mexico border was Gilchrist’s immediate objective, the larger goal was to use the ""citizen patrols"" on the border to draw attention to Gilchrist’s larger aim of influencing public opinion and federal immigration policy,"" he wrote). Christopher J. Walker, an associate professor of law at Ohio State’s Moritz College of Law, echoed this view in an article in the Harvard Latino Law Review, writing, ""More than anything else, the Minutemen seek media attention."" Todd Gutnick, communications director for the Anti-Defamation League, told us by email, ""We have always referred to the Minutemen Project (of that period) as anti-immigrant extremists, who had racists/haters in their rank and file, but not specifically a hate group,"" when asked about the ADL’s view of the Project circa 2006. Sanders campaign policy director Warren Gunnels told us by email that Sanders ""did not vote to protect the minuteman. This amendment simply stated what was already law at that time. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has never shared information with the Mexican government except when required by treaty."" Although Sabo said it didn’t reflect a change in existing law, 106 out of 201 Democrats at the time still voted against it; 19 did not vote. We reached out to Kingston for his perspective on the amendment. ""It wasn’t an extremist group, they weren’t violent, they weren’t making threats, it wasn’t anything like that at all,"" he said by phone. ""It passed overwhelmingly. I may have spoken to Bernie about it at the time, I don’t remember, but it wasn’t an extremist position. To me, it was common sense."" ""It was a minor vote. I’ve gotten calls from a few other reporters that started a few months ago. I didn’t even remember the thing itself until they started asking me about it,"" he said. Our attempts to reach the Minuteman Project by phone and via its website proved unsuccessful. Our ruling Castro, a surrogate for the Clinton campaign, said: ""Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community."" Sanders, then an Independent in the House, voted with 75 Democrats to restrict the U.S. from alerting Mexico to Minutemen operations on the border. However, we didn’t see any evidence that this since-weakened extremist group was designated a ""hate group."" On balance, we rate this claim as Half True.

Facts missing behind claim that fingerprint checks of Austin drivers will cost city millions
","Austin taxpayers are in for millions of dollars in regulatory costs if voters decide not to change what the city requires in background checks of drivers for ride-hailing services, a pro-proposition group says. Ridesharing Works for Austin says in a mailer to voters: ""A completely new City-run"" criminal background check ""process will cost millions in processing fees, additional staff, and bureaucracy."" The mailer, which came to our attention from a reader, is headlined: ""Keep Taxpayers From Having to Pay."" Proposition 1, which landed on the May 7, 2016, ballot after a petition drive led by Ridesharing Works for Austin, centers on whether to require fingerprinting of drivers for popular services, like Uber and Lyft, that enable customers to summon a ride using a mobile app. Vote ""yes"" and company-provided name-based national criminal background checks would continue -- without a fingerprinting element. Vote ""no"" and driver fingerprints would be gathered and run through the FBI. Rejecting the proposal, the mailer suggests, gives ""the City a blank check to fund a takeover"" of background checks ""and sends taxpayers the bill."" So, hide your pocketbook? Not so fast, we found. Council member: Taxpayers not on barrel Before we saw the mailer, an Austin City Council member disputed the notion that taxpayers will be charged for fingerprinting drivers. An April 19, 2016, Austin American-Statesman news story quoted Ann Kitchen, sponsor of the ordinance the proposition would repeal, saying the council agreed to levy a 1 percent fee on the ride-hailing companies’ gross local revenue to go to a city fund to ""assist and incent drivers to become compliant"" with the new rules. Then again, according to an April 22, 2016, commentary by Ben Wear, the American-Statesman’s transportation writer, that’s to be charged only if companies fail to take certain steps to get drivers fingerprinted as quickly as possible. The incentive fee was created to help allay ride-hailing drivers’ concerns about the costs of the fingerprint check — expected to be nearly $40 per driver, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean told us by email. Dean added: ""This is what it costs for checks we do for other driver background checks for other vehicles for hire."" We asked if the city or council had decided to cover the costs. Dean replied: ""No."" There’s also a separate 1 percent fee, to be in place if the proposition passes or not, ""to cover the city’s administrative costs and infrastructure needs,"" the Statesman reported. Upshot: Ride-hail companies could be paying up to 2 percent of gross local revenue to the city though another April 2016 American-Statesman news story says ride-hail companies aren’t expected to owe any general fees until at least the end of 2016. The same story quoted a former council member, Chris Riley, saying that when the council approved its first ride-hail regulations in August 2014, the intent was that any such fees cover city administrative costs. Of course, all this not-so declamation comes from city-connected officials. We were curious how Ridesharing Works for Austin arrived at its millions-of-dollars’ conclusion. To our query, spokesman Travis Considine pointed out by email that prospective-driver fingerprints are to be run through the FBI, according to the ordinance adopted by the council in December 2015. Specifically, the ordinance authorizes the city or an approved ""third party"" to submit each driver-applicant’s fingerprints to the Texas Department of Public Safety for a search of state criminal records and to forward the fingerprints to the FBI for the national check. ""The results of the FBI check will be returned to the DPS,"" the ordinance says, ""which will disseminate the results of state and national criminal history checks to the City."" Next, the ordinance says, the department shall use each result to determine if the applicant is prohibited from driving for a Transportation Network Company, as in ride-hail service. Not that the city expects all of this in a hurry.  During a phase-in, the ordinance says, the city’s Transportation Department is to implement procedures to help drivers obtain fingerprints and background checks with each company expected to have 99 percent of its drivers checked by February 2017 or be subject to financial penalties. Considine suggested city reviews of each completed check will entail massive upticks in staff and spending to process thousands of reports coming back from the DPS. The services currently conduct name-based checks on their own. Uber lobbyist: 50,000 background checks will burden city Considine also put us in touch with Adam Goldman, an Austin lobbyist for Uber, who said by phone the few city workers who currently review applications for chauffeur licenses can’t possibly be expected to handle the surge in applications likely to come from ride-hail drivers seeking to fulfill the city’s requirements. If voters say ""no"" to the proposition, Goldman said, city staff stand to see fingerprint-fueled checks submitted for 50,000 drivers -- a figure he said reflects the number of Austin-area residents who have driven at least once for Uber. Hold that count. An Uber spokeswoman, Jaime Moore, previously told us it has 15,000 Austin-area drivers though that total fluctuates. Moore, informed of Goldman’s 50,000 figure, replied by email that nearly 50,000 Austin-area people went through the Uber screening process in the last year -- though many of them didn’t make it through. Still, Moore suggested we put stock in the ""50,000"" because Goldman didn’t consider Austin-area Lyft drivers. So, Moore said, ""we would expect the number"" of individuals whose background checks would require the city’s final review ""to be much higher than 50,000."" Goldman didn’t offer a calculation to back up the predicted ""millions"" in city costs. But Considine, asked for an equation behind the group’s claim, suggested multiplying 50,000 times the possible $40 charge per background check, which plays out to $2 million. Alternatively, we noted, if you go with the low-end count of 10,000 drivers, you get $400,000 in possible costs. We asked Considine if it’s fair to consider either total a city cost in that the city, far as we can tell, hasn’t said it’s funding the checks. He didn’t reply. It also occurred to us there might be fewer ride-hail drivers if the proposition fails; some might resist fingerprinting. Considine agreed, saying by phone: ""That is what happened in Houston. Uber in Houston is different than Austin; the wait times are longer, the surge pricing,"" pricing at peak travel times, ""is higher."" Houston official: No spike in taxpayer-funded costs It made sense to us to consider Houston’s experience. The Bayou City has required fingerprint-driven background checks of ride-hail drivers since November 2014, also demanding drug tests, physicals and vehicle inspections. So we reached out to the city’s Administration and Regulatory Affairs Department to ask if administrative costs spiked. By phone, spokeswoman Lara Cottingham said the city experienced an ""enormous spike"" in applicants after Uber agreed to comply with the city’s security requirements. However, she said, the department didn’t add staff for its final reviews; as before Uber arrived in Houston, a single employee looks over 200 to 300 driver background checks a day. If a background check shows any offense disqualifying a person for a license, the application is denied, Cottingham said, but the city also sets up a hearing for the driver to seek reconsideration, in accord with state law, she said. ""There’s been no real change other than she’s a lot busier than before,"" Cottingham said. Cottingham said driver-applicants are allowed to get fingerprinted by a designated private vendor or may visit the DPS in Austin to be fingerprinted. Generally, Cottingham said, fees paid by Uber, the amount of which she said the company doesn’t consider public information, more than cover city costs. Austin official: Staff can 'flex' Next, we asked Austin’s Transportation Department if the pro-proposition group’s cost claim comports with its expectations. We sought elaboration about flexing up; Dean replied that the department has 12 employees including about eight ""administrative personnel"" who could process such applications plus at least five professional staff who ""could be flexed to review reports."" Gordon Derr, an assistant director in the department, earlier said by email: ""Possibly, the number of staff may need to increase to handle large numbers of applications, but the activities overseeing vehicles-for-hire are funded by the enterprise fund for the city."" That’s not tax revenue, we recognized. By email, a department spokeswoman, Cheyenne Krause, said the ride-hail fees authorized by the council would go into the department’s enterprise fund which to date brings together parking revenue and fees paid by ground transportation service companies and drivers, funding department staff and administration. Derr earlier said: ""Possibly, the number of staff may need to increase to handle large numbers of applications, but the activities overseeing vehicles-for-hire are funded by the enterprise fund for the city,"" which applies to programs generally funded from fees, not taxes. ""Costs would not be paid from the general fund,"" which supports tax-backed activities, ""therefore the costs would not be billed to the taxpayers,"" Derr said, adding: ""It has yet to be determined who would be responsible for paying for background checks."" Derr said the city has ""engaged"" a DPS contractor, Morphotrust, to take fingerprints from prospective drivers. Once prints are taken, he wrote, ""Morphotrust works through DPS to process the background checks through DPS for the state background check and the FBI for federal background checks."" Next, Derr said, the DPS sends results to the city where staff review them. Generally, Krause later told us by email, staff don’t know ""what will be required and cannot speculate as to the number of background checks that the City will review or the resources that will be required to review the checks. Any potential costs to the City are purely speculative."" Our ruling The Ridesharing Works group said that if voters reject Proposition 1, a ""completely new city-run"" criminal background check ""process will cost millions in processing fees, additional staff and bureaucracy"" with taxpayers getting ""the bill."" This claim isn’t backed up by Houston’s avowed experience or available facts about Austin’s approach. What happens next does seem a bit unsettled. For instance, it's up in the air who’s going to pay for each background check reviewed by the city. We also found no authoritative cost estimate for the city’s oversight. Additional staff might be needed, we learned, yet the relevant department also advises it can lean on existing staff. However, we neither fielded nor found evidence the city’s contemplated reviews of background checks will cost millions. Significantly too, taxpayers aren't poised to get the bill; city costs are to be covered from a fee-backed fund, not tax revenue. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

North Carolina has had the country's fastest-growing economy since 2013
","Quarterly GDP numbers aren’t the sexiest item in political news, but when the latest state-level updates were released Thursday – for the third quarter of 2015, which ended Sept. 30 – Gov. Pat McCrory trumpeted them on both his official and campaign websites and social media pages. McCrory has dubbed his re-election campaign the ""Carolina Comeback,"" trying to focus on good economic news. He said these numbers show North Carolina is squarely on the upswing. A state’s GDP, or gross domestic product, is the total of all goods and services it produces. And McCrory said that since he took office, no state has increased its gross domestic product faster than North Carolina. He credited the state’s cuts to the income tax rate and unemployment benefits, and the outsourcing of economic development efforts. He also clarified that he was talking about the numbers since January 2013. ""We have delivered $4.4 billion in tax relief, fixed our broken unemployment insurance system and reformed our economic development strategy to strengthen North Carolina’s economy and put more people back to work,"" McCrory said in a statement. ""These efforts have positioned North Carolina as one of the fastest growing populations as well as (the) fastest growing economy in the country."" Economies are subject to a number of influences. For this fact check, we won’t attempt to say what has or hasn’t been responsible for the state’s economic growth. Instead, we will look just at whether it’s true that North Carolina has ""one of the fastest growing populations as well as fastest growing economy in the country,"" as McCrory claimed. Population growth Between July 1, 2013 – shortly after McCrory took office – and July 1, 2015, North Carolina added about 194,000 people for a total population of 10,043,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s close to a 2 percent growth rate and slightly better than the national average over that period. From 2013 to 2014 and from 2014 to 2015, five states added more people than North Carolina. Both years, North Carolina was the ninth largest state. North Carolina isn’t adding people at the country’s fastest rate, or by the largest amounts. But it has a better-than-average growth rate, and it’s on pace to continue closing the gap with larger states. McCrory is correct that North Carolina has ""one of the fastest growing populations."" Economic growth This question is a little trickier. Has North Carolina had the fastest-growing economy in the country under Pat McCrory’s administration? There are many ways to measure economic strength, and North Carolina is not the best in every measure, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. For instance, in 2015, the state was 13th in total income and 39th in per-capita income. From 2013 to 2015 North Carolina also had the 19th-fastest growth in per-capita income and the 11th-fastest growth in total income. North Carolina’s unemployment and underemployment rates are also both above the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But McCrory specifically referenced GDP growth. For that reason, and because GDP is generally considered the most comprehensive measure of an economy’s strength, we’ll look only at GDP growth for the sake of this fact check. And on that, McCrory is right that North Carolina is No. 1. Between the first quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2015 (the most recent data we have), no state’s economic output grew as fast as North Carolina’s 13.4 percent rate. Florida and California came close, at 13.3 and 13.2 percent GDP growth, respectively. The average for both the Southeast and the United States as a whole was 9.9 percent. Because economists love to do math, there are other ways of defining the same data over the same period. That 13.4 percent rate specifically refers to current (non-inflation-adjusted) dollars. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis also measures GDP’s compound growth rate in current dollars and chained dollars. Chaining is a process that adjusts for inflation, but by using different methods from the more common Consumer Price Index. In that measure, North Carolina tied for first in current dollar amounts and tied for seventh in chained dollar amounts. It’s also worth noting that right now we’re partway through the second quarter of 2016, so the data are lagging behind real time by nearly six months. So while we don't know who currently has the fastest-growing economy, the data does show that North Carolina’s growth hasn’t been as dominant recently. Looking just from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 2015 – the most recent numbers available – North Carolina’s GDP grew by 2.8 percent. That’s lower than 10 other states and tied with another seven. It’s good, but not the best. Our ruling McCrory is right that North Carolina has ""one of the fastest growing populations."" As for the economy, North Carolina did have the fastest-growing GDP in the country between the first quarter of 2013, when McCrory took office, and the third quarter of 2015. The pace has slowed recently, but that doesn't change the truth of the statement. We rate this claim True.","[('U.S. Census Bureau, ""North Carolina Becomes Ninth State With 10 Million or More People""', 'https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-215.html'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""Florida Passes New York to Become the Nation’s Third Most Populous State""', 'No link'), ('N.C.

Fact-checking Amy Schumer's 'Welcome to the Gun Show'
","Searching for a great gift for all ages? Look no further, Amy Schumer has the product for you. In a recent sketch on her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer, Schumer and fellow comedian Kyle Dunnigan play infomercial hosts pitching viewers on the perfect ""stocking stuffer"": a handgun. A hopeful buyer laments that he can’t get a gun because he has a criminal record riddled with felonies. ""Caller, you bite your tongue, you silly goose!"" Schumer’s character says. ""You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies, as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show.""  ""If you go to a gun show, you can get an unlicensed seller to sell you a gun, no questions asked,"" Dunnigan added We’ve looked at similar claims before. Because this sketch is getting a lot of attention, we wanted to recap whether a felon can actually buy a gun on the Internet or at a gun show. This isn’t the first time Schumer has tackled gun issues; she has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun laws since a gunman killed two and injured many others at a showing of her feature film Trainwreck in a Louisiana movie theater in 2015. But it is her first time on the Truth-O-Meter. The 'gun show loophole' To be clear: The kind of transaction Schumer’s character describes is illegal. Federal law prohibits felons from getting a gun unless their rights have been formally restored. Felons can theoretically get around this obstacle, however, by buying guns from unlicensed sellers who are not required to conduct criminal background checks. This is sometimes referred to as the ""gun show loophole,"" even though it refers to all private sales, and not everyone considers it a loophole. Schumer’s sketch was referring to this aspect of current gun law, said a spokesman for Everytown for Gun Safety, gun control advocacy group Schumer promotes at the end of the sketch. Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" is supposed to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, a gun show, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns. If an individual buys a gun from someone who is not required to have a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check. So a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet or at a gun show because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer’s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show. There are a few important limitations on these sorts of private transactions. First, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But private sellers ""can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,"" Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, previously told PolitiFact. So in the case of Schumer’s show, she and her co-host would not have that cushion of plausible deniability because the hopeful buyer told them outright that he is a felon. The giant ""gun show"" banner doesn’t make a difference. Second, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transaction is likely to take place in person, as opposed to the buyer entering credit card information online, and the seller shipping the gun to the buyer’s house. And third, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. With all these restrictions, how many people actually buy guns without a background check? The truth is we don’t really know. The only statistics floating around are outdated and flawed. Professors at Northeastern and Harvard universities conducted a gun survey in 2015 that isn’t yet published. The national survey of 4,000 non-institutionalized adults found that 22 percent of the people who purchased guns — at gun shows, stores or elsewhere — underwent no background check, Matthew Miller, professor of Health Sciences and Epidemiology at Northeastern and co-director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us in January. When researchers excluded purchases between family and friends, that number dropped to 15 percent, which equates to approximately 5 million gun owners whose most recent purchase did not involve a background check. One more thing: Later in Schumer’s sketch, another hopeful buyer calls in to ask if he can get a gun even though he’s a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list. ""You’re fine, sweet potato fry,"" Schumer’s character says. A March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined how many people applying for gun purchases went through the FBI’s instant background check system and also were on the FBI’s list of ""those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity."" Between February 2004, and December 2014, 2,233 people on the list applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed. Our ruling Schumer’s character said, ""You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show."" The kind of transaction Schumer described is possible, though illegal, and far more complicated than her comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they could purchase a gun from private sellers over the Internet or at a gun show without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. Schumer is doing a comedy bit, but compared with similar claims we’ve checked, her phrasing makes it sound like buying guns with a felony is easy and lawful. That is not the case.

Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte repeatedly voted against Paycheck Fairness Act
","The contention -- and the number -- seemed startling. On Equal Pay Day, Democrats said Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte had not only voted against equal paychecks for women, but she had done so multiple times. Both Governor Maggie Hassan, who is challenging Ayotte for her Senate seat, and the New Hampshire Democratic Party, blasted Ayotte in dual press releases on April 12, 2016. ""It is extremely troubling that Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help ensure that women can earn equal pay for equal work."" Hassan said in the release. Ayotte also put out out a statement about equal pay on the same day in April, which is the date that women, on average, have to work into the following year to make as much as men. In 2016, that date was April 12. Given that Ayotte has sponsored and promoted her own bill calling for equal pay, called the GAP Act, we decided to check it out. About the bill The bill in question is called the Paycheck Fairness Act, which according to its official legislative description ""amends the portion of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) known as the Equal Pay Act to revise remedies for, enforcement of, and exceptions to prohibitions against sex discrimination in the payment of wages."" Perhaps the strongest tool in the bill is the provision to ""make employers who violate sex discrimination prohibitions liable in a civil action for damages."" This language has inspired the most Republican opposition, including from Ayotte. She believes it exposes employers to frivolous lawsuits and other problematic litigation and could restrict merit pay, among other reasons, according to her office. She has therefore voted for a number of amendments and alternatives to the largely Democratic-backed bill. She’s currently supporting a piece of legislation called the GAP act, which  ""makes it clear that employers must pay women and men equal wages for equal work, while still preserving the ability to award merit pay and allow for flexible schedules,"" Ayotte and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito wrote in an op-ed for the Concord Monitor. The issue has taken on special resonance in Ayotte’s Senate re-election race, since she’s facing off against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who supports the act. The votes So let’s look at the four votes. Hassan’s campaign and the state party pointed them out to us. (The same votes were mentioned in an April 12 press release from EMILY’s list, a group that seeks to elect pro-abortion-rights women running as Democrats.) The votes were held on June 5, 2012; April 9, 2014; Sept. 15, 2014; and March 24, 2015. The first three were procedural votes, known as cloture. These are votes meant to cut off debate on a bill and bring it to the floor of the Senate for a vote. While an actual bill can pass with a simple majority in the U.S. Senate, it takes 60 votes to invoke cloture, meaning that as a practical matter, Senate passage requires a bill to have 60 votes rather than just a simple majority. Republicans often refuse to end debate on bills favored by Democrats, and vice versa. So, although Ayotte opposed the bill being debated and has said so repeatedly in public, it’s not entirely accurate -- at least in three of these cases -- to say that she voted against the paycheck bill itself. She was casting a procedural vote in these three cases, which is not exactly the same as up or down votes on the legislation. In addition, the final vote listed by the Democrats was for an amendment offered by Sen. Barbara Mikulski addressing the issue. Ayotte voted against the amendment, though she did vote for an alternative Republican amendment. The biggest omission by Hassan’s camp is leaving out a vote from Sept. 10, 2014, when Ayotte actually called for ending debate on equal pay legislation. She was one of 73 -- including a number of Republicans -- to cast votes doing so. According to her office, Ayotte hoped to change the bill but was denied the ability to do so by Harry Reid. Our ruling Hassan said that ""Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act."" Hassan glosses over some nuances -- most of the votes were procedural rather than substantive, and she leaves out a vote in which Ayotte cast a procedural vote in favor of advancing the bill. And it’s worth noting that Ayotte’s opposition to the bill doesn’t mean she’s an opponent of equal pay for women; rather, she and most Republicans have a substantive disagreement over the means to that end. Still, Hassan made her assertion specific -- Ayotte’s record on this particular piece of legislation -- and it’s clear that Ayotte has a longstanding record of opposing this bill. We rate the claim Mostly True.","[('""Governor Maggie Hassan Statement on Equal Pay Day,"" Maggie Hassan for Senate, April 12, 2016', 'http://maggiehassan.com/press-release/governor-maggie-hassan-statement-on-equal-pay-day/'), ('""NHDP Launches Petition Campaign to Hold Kelly Ayotte Accountable for Blocking Federal Paycheck Fairness Act,"" New Hampshire Democratic Party, April 12, 2016', 'No link'), ('""On Equal Pay Day, Ayotte Calls for Passage of GAP Act"", Kelly Ayotte Senate website, April 12, 2016', 'http://nhdp.org/blog/2016/04/12/release-nhdp-launches-petition-campaign-to-hold-kelly-ayotte-accountable-for-blocking-federal-paycheck-fairness-act/'), ('Correspondence with Aaron Jacobs, Communications Director Maggie for NH, April 28, 2016', 'No link'), ('Correspondence with Melissa Miller, New Hampshire Democratic Party, April 26, 2016', 'https://www.ayotte.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=2575'), ('Correspondence with Sen.

Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte has record of voting to defund Planned Parenthood
","Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces a competitive reelection bid in New Hampshire and Democrats are already taking aim at her record on abortion and women’s health. Gov. Maggie Hassan, the only Democratic candidate in the race, is one of the latest to lob those criticisms. ""She has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides healthcare to about 12,000 Granite State women,"" Hassan said in a recent interview with the Concord Monitor, referring to Ayotte. ""She’s voted to defund them six times."" Planned Parenthood, a women’s health care provider that also offers abortions, has become a lightning rod in recent years as elected officials in Washington and in New Hampshire have taken steps to cut the organization’s funding. The organization is no fan of Ayotte: Planned Parenthood’s political arm took out its first ad of the 2016 cycle this month targeting New Hampshire’s junior Senator. We decided to take a closer look at Hassan’s claim. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England runs five health centers across New Hampshire -- in Manchester, Claremont, Derry, Exeter and Keene. And roughly half of the patients who visit a Planned Parenthood clinic across the border in Vermont -- in White River Junction -- are from New Hampshire. The Planned Parenthood centers in New Hampshire all provide contraception, annual exams, STI testing and treatment, and pregnancy testing. The Manchester location, which saw 4,779 patients in 2014, provides surgical and medical abortions. The Keene location, visited by 1,871 patients in 2014, offers medication abortions, according to Kayla McCarthy, with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Altogether Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire served just over 11,000 patients during 2014, according according to Vice President for Public Policy Jennifer Frizzell. Another 1,750 were seen in the White River Junction, VT clinic. That would mean Planned Parenthood clinics together saw roughly 12,000 New Hampshire patients in 2014, in line with Hassan’s claim. Now let’s look at how many times Ayotte has voted against Planned Parenthood funding. Ayotte, elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, has been a consistent opponent of abortion and critic of Planned Parenthood. We checked with Hassan’s campaign and they pointed us to six votes. Three votes took place all on the same day, Dec. 3, 2015. 1) That day the Senate voted 52-47 to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in one bill. Ayotte voted for it.  2) Ayotte voted against an amendment that would have stripped a provision from the bill to defund Planned Parenthood. (The amendment was defeated.) 3) Another amendment, proposed by Democrats, sought to continue federal funding for Planned Parenthood, but it was tabled (that is, set aside) and Ayotte voted in favor of tabling it. (President Obama ultimately vetoed the bill.) 4) Ayotte voted to advance a bill last August that sought to prohibit federal funding for Planned Parenthood. But the legislation failed to get the 60 votes it needed to move forward. 5) Ayotte voted in April 2011 for a resolution to prohibit federal dollars from funding Planned Parenthood. It failed, 42 to 58.  6) And in March 2011 Ayotte voted for a bill to fund the federal government, that included dozens of other spending items, but blocked federal funding to Planned Parenthood. The bill failed, 44 to 56. Ayotte said at the time: ""Our country is in a fiscal crisis… Everyone is going to have to make sacrifices, including many private organizations that have relied on federal resources,"" according to her office. In all, these six votes show some level opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood. However, some of them were procedural, and not all offered a clean up-or-down funding decision, as Hassan’s statement suggests.   Ayotte’s office said she supported several other government spending bills that did not defund Planned Parenthood. And in September 2015, Ayotte voted not to move forward with a temporary government spending bill that sought to block federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Ayotte said at the time she supported defunding Planned Parenthood, but didn’t want to shut the government down to do it. ""Kelly Ayotte has voted to direct federal funding away from Planned Parenthood in an effort to better use federal dollars to fill gaps in women's health services for low-income women and preserve access to women’s health services,"" spokeswoman Liz Johnson said. Our ruling Hassan said Ayotte voted six times to defund Planned Parenthood. Ayotte has been a consistent critic of Planned Parenthood and has shown support for defunding the organization or opposition to continued funding in at least six votes. It’s worth noting that some were procedural votes and several were much larger bills that included a provision on Planned Parenthood funding. Hassan’s claim is accurate, but needs clarification. We rate her statement Mostly True.    ","[('Email interview with U.S. Sen.

Pro-McCain PAC says Democratic challenger votes by party almost 90 percent of the time
","The race for John McCain’s U.S. Senate seat is in full swing in Arizona. The senior senator already said he’s skipping July’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland to campaign for this sixth term. His challengers include fellow Republican Kelli Ward and U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz. The primary is scheduled for Aug. 30. We came across an advertisement attacking Kirkpatrick, which comes from the Arizona Grassroots Action Political Action Committee. ""She votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time,"" the ad states, as the graphic shows Kirkpatrick and President Barack Obama side by side. Although the PAC’s ad says it is not authorized by any candidate or committee, they’ve taken a pro-McCain stance, spending wise, in this Senate race. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the PAC has spent $211,547 against Ward in the last two weeks. They’ve also spent $45,050 supporting McCain. But what about Kirkpatrick and her voting record? We reached out to the PAC and did not hear back. Still, the ad’s claim checks out based on the numbers we found. According to CQ Roll Call, which tracks and analyzes congressional data, Kirkpatrick sided with her party 88 percent of the time in 2014 and 84 percent in 2013. Although, her support of Obama was 76 percent in 2014 and 77 percent in 2013. CQ defines ""presidential support"" as voting in agreement with the president’s position. We reached out to the Kirkpatrick campaign, and spokesman D.B. Mitchell did provide us with several examples of the congresswoman voting against party lines. In June 2015, Kirkpatrick was one of only eight Democrats to vote for the Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have delayed compliance with carbon dioxide emissions for states. It passed with support from 239 Republicans. And in 2009, she voted against the American Clean Energy and Securities Act, which would have allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to set greenhouse gas limits (211 Democrats voted for it). Finally, we should note that, historically, most members of Congress vote along party lines, and the partisan divide has worsened in the last 60 years. Our ruling The Arizona Grassroots PAC said that Kirkpatrick ""votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time."" The data backs up this claim. However, her campaign can point to a couple of instances where Kirkpatrick did cross party lines on votes.

Michelle Obama: Research shows educating girls can lift a nation's economy
","Among the causes First Lady Michelle Obama has championed during her time in the White House is improving the lot of girls and women worldwide. About a year ago, Obama helped kick off Let Girls Learn, an interagency effort focused on educating adolescent girls. ""Studies from the World Bank show that one extra year of secondary school can increase a girl's future income by 15 to 25 percent,"" Obama said in an interview with a U.S. Agency for International Development publication. ""And we know that when girls are educated, they are less likely to contract HIV, more likely to delay childbearing and vaccinate their children, and have lower maternal and infant mortality rates. Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country’s GDP."" We’ve seen that claim about educating girls and a rising GDP before. Is it true? Largely, yes. Research does show that a higher percentage of girls in school correlates with a higher gross domestic product. But those findings are much more limited than many people understand. Behind all the research, there’s uncertainty about whether a stronger economy leads to more girls in school, or if more girls in school leads to a stronger economy. No single rule applies everywhere. A stronger economy, for instance, provides both the resources and incentives to educate more women, who go to school, earn more and boost the economy a little higher. But it doesn’t always work that way. In the Middle East and North Africa, more women might be educated but for social and religious reasons, they can’t work, or must work in jobs that don’t fully reward their level of education. And the biggest sticking point is that what’s been called the ""girl effect"" seems to be much stronger in middle-income countries. For poorer nations, the effect is more muted. A few key studies and cautions The White House press office backed up the First Lady’s claim by citing policy reports that declared that educating girls and young women would boost a country’s economy. One from the World Bank said ""By effectively educating more women -- that is, providing more women with a high-quality education -- more will enter the labor market, and the economy will show the favorable results."" Those reports didn’t actually give the underlying research, so we’ll cover the highlights. • A 2009 article in the journal Feminist Economics compared regions of the world and measured gender gaps in both education and employment. That’s worth noting because, while the two generally go hand-in-hand, they are separate. You can educate girls, but if companies won’t hire them, a lot of the economic benefit is lost. This study’s bottom line was that between 1960 and 2000, East Asia’s growth rate was .9 percent higher than the region of the Middle East-North Africa. The difference was due to the higher fraction of girls in school in East Asia. • A 2011 World Bank study took 14 countries and teased out what would happen if every girl finished whatever level of school she was in -- either primary or secondary. Not surprisingly, the economic impact depended hugely on a country’s starting point. India and China, for example, had very low rates of girls not completing school, while on the opposite end, places like Burundi and Senegal had dropout rates over 80 percent. So the study found that getting girls and young women to complete a given level of schooling added a ""barely noticeable"" amount in India and China, while in the other countries, researchers predicted a hefty rise. One important contribution of this research is it factored in the diminishing returns of educating more women. When more people hit the job market, it tends to drive wages down. There’s still a net gain, but in this study, earnings could be about 20 percent less than you might expect. Tuck that point away and keep it in mind for the next landmark analysis on our list. It provided advocacy groups with a talking point that has gone viral. • In a 1999 World Bank paper Gender inequality, income and growth: Are good times good for women?, economists David Dollar and Roberta Gatti worked with data on 100 nations. The finding that gained the most traction was that ""in the countries with higher initial education, an increase of 1 percentage point in the share of adult women with secondary school education implies an increase in per capita income growth of 0.3 percentage points."" That might seem like a simple equation, but it actually makes two points that are often overlooked. The economic growth took place only in middle-income countries that already had a higher rate of educating women. ""For the poorer half of the observations, there is no relationship between female attainment and income,"" the authors wrote. The other generally ignored element is that the 1 percent increase in educated women applies to completing secondary education. Simply putting more girls in classrooms at any grade level wouldn’t necessarily deliver the same results. You have to get the girls all the way through high school. Specifics are important when measuring education gains Here’s where many organizations, including USAID, get into trouble. They say -- right now on their website -- that ""if 10 percent more girls attend school, a country’s GDP increases by an average of 3 percent."" That statement has three flaws. First, it treats all nations the same, whether they are low income or middle income. Second, it treats all education the same, whether it’s primary or secondary. Perhaps most troubling is it scales up the original equation by a factor of 10. Dollar, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us that doing that ""is a bit risky."" ""You would expect diminishing returns,"" he said. Which takes us back to that 2011 World Bank study we tucked away. It predicted wages would be about 20 percent lower than you would expect. Less money in women’s pockets means less economic activity, and less economic growth. Our ruling Michelle Obama said that research shows that sending girls to school can boost a country’s entire economy. That’s a fairly broad statement and broadly speaking, it’s accurate. Research from economists at the World Bank and elsewhere suggest that it’s possible that educating more girls produces a stronger economy. But researchers can’t say whether it’s the education of girls that leads to growth, or the growth that leads to more education of women. Plus, women can hit roadblocks in the job market even if they are educated. The research shows that, too. Obama’s statement is accurate but it needs additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('USAID Frontlines, Q&A: Michelle Obama, Raising Her Voice to ‘Let Girls Learn’, March 21, 2016', 'https://medium.com/usaid-frontlines/q-a-michelle-obama-raising-her-voice-to-let-girls-learn-500fba4f9689#.st12yihdg'), ('UNICEF, The investment case for education and equity, January 2015', 'No link'), ('The World Bank, Girls’ education in the 21st century, 2008', 'https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Investment_Case_for_Education_and_Equity_FINAL.pdf'), ('Global Partnership for Education, Why Educating Girls Makes Economic Sense, March 6, 2014', 'No link'), (""Brookings Institution, Today's challenges for girls' education, June 2015"", 'http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099080014368/DID_Girls_edu.pdf'), ('World Economic Forum, The Case for Gender Equality, 2014', 'No link'), ('World Bank, Gender Equality, Poverty and Economic Growth, September 2007', 'http://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/why-educating-girls-makes-economic-sense'), ('Feminist Economics, The impact of gender inequality in education and employment on economic growth: New evidence for a panel of countries, 2009', 'No link'), ('World Bank, Gender inequality, income and growth: Are good times good for women?, May 1999', 'https://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2015/06/girls-education-challenges-winthrop/Todays-Challenges-Girls-Educationv6.pdf?la=en'), ('USAID, Promoting gender equality and access to education, Aug. 24, 2015', 'No link'), ('World Bank, Measuring the Economic Gain of Investing in Girls, August 2011', 'http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2014/part-1/the-case-for-gender-equality/'), ('World Bank, 2012 World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development, 2012', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Elizabeth King, nonresident senior fellow, Center for Universal Education, Brookings Institution, April 13, 2016', 'http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTPREMNET/Resources/489960-1338997241035/Growth_Commission_Workshops_Equity_Morrison_Paper.pdf'), ('Email interview, Markus Goldstein, Lead Economist, Office of the Chief Economist, Africa, World Bank, April 12, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview, David Dollar senior fellow, Global Economy and Development, Brookings Institution, April 28, 2016', 'http://chicagopolicyreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gender-and-Economic-Growth.pdf'), ('Email interview, Christina Kwauk, post-doctoral fellow, Center for Universal Education, Brookings Institution, April 22, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Ana Maria Muñoz Boudet, senior social scientist, POverty Global Practice, World Bank, April 12, 2016', 'http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/09/01/000094946_00081906181732/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf'), ('Email interview, Tiffany Drake, senior communications advisor, White House Office of the First Lady, April 7, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/apr/29/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-research-shows-educating-girls-can-/

Paul Ryan claims U.S. purchase of heavy water from Iran is direct subsidy of Iran's nuclear program
","Since 1984, the United States has officially branded Iran a state sponsor of terrorism, partly because of its support of terrorist groups in the Middle East. Ignoring resolutions from the United Nations Security Council to suspend its nuclear proliferation activities hasn’t won Iran many international friends, either. So it was historic when the United States and other world powers reached a nuclear agreement with Iran in 2015. The deal, pushed by President Barack Obama, makes it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can reclaim some $100 billion or more of its assets that had been frozen in foreign banks. Republican critics, including U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, worry about the deal leading to terrorism. Johnson got a Half True for saying the Obama administration has admitted that money from the deal ""would go directly to terrorism"" in that the officials said they expected only some funds to end up with groups labeled as terrorists. But the Obama administration’s newly announced purchase of ""heavy water"" from Iran, in connection with the deal, brought a fresh round of attacks -- including one from another Wisconsin Republican, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. The purchase, Ryan claimed in a statement, ""will directly subsidize Iran’s nuclear program."" That doesn’t seem like something the United States would want to do. So, let’s see what this is all about. The nuclear deal As support for the nuclear deal was being sealed in the U.S. Senate in 2015, it was believed that Iran might be two to three months away from getting a nuclear bomb. But if Iran abides by restrictions imposed by the deal, scientists say, it would take at least 12 months to build a weapon. In January 2016 (despite a claim by GOP presidential front runner Donald Trump), inspectors verified that Tehran was doing enough under the deal to curb its nuclear program. That meant the roughly $100 billion that had been locked up by sanctions from European Union and the United States became available to Iran. Heavy water purchase The new controversy stems from the Obama administration’s announcement on April 22, 2016 that it would buy 32 tons of heavy water from Iran to help the country meet the terms of the nuclear deal, which limits how much heavy water Iran can stockpile. That material is a key component of making nuclear weapons and producing nuclear energy. Ryan issued his statement denouncing the $8.6 million purchase the same day. His use of the word subsidy suggests the U.S. is providing cash simply to help prop up Iran’s nuclear program. But experts told us the U.S. paid a market rate for the heavy water, which it needs for research. And by reducing the amount of heavy water Iran has, the purchase means it will take Iran longer to produce more heavy water that could be used for  a nuclear bomb. Ryan’s evidence To back Ryan’s claim, his office highlighted this portion of a Wall Street Journal article on the announcement of the heavy water purchase: Iranian officials have hinted at the heavy-water sale to the U.S. and praised it as an early step in support of the country’s ambitions to export its nuclear-related and scientific products. Tehran, in support of the agreement, already has sold low-enriched uranium to Russia and Kazakhstan. ""On the heavy water, we are among the very few developing countries which is able to produce its own heavy water and now we have entered the international market,"" the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, told Iranian state media this month. ""We have been able to sell more than 30 tons of heavy water just recently and this has put us on par with other countries."" The United States, which does not produce its own heavy water, will use the 32 tons of heavy water it is buying from Iran, which is said to be high quality, for research at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. To Ryan’s point, experts told us the purchase provides funds for Iran’s nuclear program and allows Iran to continue generating more heavy water while staying under the cap in the nuclear agreement -- either for its own use or to sell. Other aims But besides the purchase not being a subsidy, the effect of the purchase is not to make it easier for Iran to make a bomb but to make it harder, by reducing its stockpile of heavy water. Moreover, the purchase helps keep Iran will be in compliance with the part of the nuclear deal that limits how much heavy water Iran can stockpile. That, the Arms Control Association wrote on its website, is ""a clear benefit to U.S. national security, as the agreement blocks Iran’s pathways to the bomb."" Our rating Ryan said the decision by the United States to buy heavy water from Iran ""will directly subsidize Iran’s nuclear program."" There is an element of truth in Ryan’s claim about the $8.6 million transaction. Heavy water, which can be used to make a nuclear weapon, clearly is part of Iran’s nuclear program. But the fair-market-value purchase, for a material that the U.S. will use in nuclear research, is not a true subsidy. And by reducing Iran’s heavy water stockpile, the purchase helps Iran comply with a nuclear agreement that is aimed at making it harder for the country to develop a nuclear weapon.

Another lie that won't die: The multitudes say Obama has canceled National Day of Prayer
","Some falsehoods refuse to die, coming back long after they've been disproven. The latest is making the rounds on Facebook, a resurrection of the claim that Barack Obama has canceled this year's — and perhaps all subsequent — National Days of Prayer. This post was typical: ""Today President Obama said there will NOT be a National Day of Prayer in May because he doesn't want to offend anyone. If this decision offends you as it does me, we need the President to know just how many Christians are offended. If you are offended, please copy and paste. Those who name Jesus Christ as their Lord God and Savior have too long allowed the world to take Him out of everything! Once again, never worried about offending Christians. I am sick and tired of our president that does everything to offend Christians but does everything he can to appease Muslims."" When we spotted this on April 26, it was clear that a lot of people were bearing false witness, cutting and pasting the various forms of this post. One version reported that ""President Obama has decided that there will no longer be a 'National Day of Prayer,' "" suggesting he had somehow managed to kill it forever. This year's National Day of Prayer is scheduled for Thursday, May 5. A president can no more cancel it than the Grinch can cancel Christmas. It's written into law. More to the point, Obama has never shown an inclination for canceling it at all. This warning has been sounded every year since 2009, according to our friends at Snopes. The day was inaugurated in 1952, without setting a specific date. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan made it the first Thursday of May. Obama issued an official proclamation for the day in 2009 and has done so again in every subsequent year. Last year's proclamation is on the White House website. Although Obama has not publicly participated in the celebration, he been involved in other prayer events. Most notably, Obama has spoken several times at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, giving speeches that reflect upon his own Christian faith. And in 2010, when a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that the event was unconstitutional, the Obama White House nonetheless announced that the president still ""intends to recognize a National Day of Prayer."" Facebook readers didn't have to go to Snopes to find stories debunking this tenacious tall tale. FactCheck.org tried to smite it in 2010. PolitiFact New Jersey attempted to slay it when it was part of a chain email message in 2012. We were heartened that a few Facebook posters did their homework and tried to stem the tide of misinformation. ""We do a disservice to the gospel when we post inaccurate information which we have not fact-checked,"" said one person. ""We serve a God who is the Way, the Truth and The Life, the least we can do is make sure what we post is truthful as well. Again, consider the source and research a little deeper, your witness can be jeopardized if you don't."" Amen to that. Our ruling Widely shared Facebook posts contended that, ""Today President Obama said there will NOT be a National Day of Prayer in May."" For those who got on Facebook and tried to share the truth, we applaud you. If you found yourself overwhelmed by all the people who were immediately convinced that the bad information was true, welcome to our world.

"['Taxes', 'Pennsylvania', 'Katie McGinty']","
Did Sen. Pat Toomey say he wanted to eliminate all corporate taxes?
","Katie McGinty has been the Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania Senate for all of three days, but the general election campaign between her and incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey has already begun. In a press release circulated Thursday, McGinty’s campaign -- running on the ""working families"" platform -- wrote that ""Pat Toomey advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes."" It cited a 2007 CNBC interview in which Toomey, a Republican, said he was in favor of eliminating the tax burden on corporations. Eliminating all taxes didn’t sound like Toomey’s campaign platform. In fact, on his campaign website, Toomey has an entire section of his ""issues"" page dedicated to ""eliminating corporate welfare."" So we decided to check the claim. In 2007, Toomey was a congressman from Allentown and the president of the Club For Growth, a conservative group that advocates for the reduction or elimination of corporate taxes. Toomey appeared on CNBC to discuss tax reform and cutting the corporate tax rate (the top marginal tax rate is 35 percent) which, he says in the interview, would stimulate the economy. ""I would disagree with the idea that we want to have a corporate tax burden at all,"" he says in the interview, going on to say: ""All it really does is it creates this insidious opportunity for politicians to play games, to create winners and losers, to have manipulative deductions and loopholes and write-offs. We shouldn’t have any of that. Let’s have a transparent system. Let’s not tax corporations. Let’s allow them to compete most aggressively on the global economy."" When the interviewer skeptically asks Toomey if that type of reform would be possible in today’s political environment, he seems to acknowledge it’s a stretch, saying, ""a rational discussion can only lead to the conclusion that we should have a simpler tax code and rates, at a minimum, much lower. I’d prefer none on corporations. But much lower would be better."" Toomey's campaign pointed out the senator's formally proposed tax plans have included lowering the corporate tax rate -- the highest in the developed world -- in a ""revenue neutral manner by eliminating tax loopholes."" His budget proposals for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. The CNBC interview is one of the only examples of a time when Toomey advocated specifically for the full elimination of corporate income taxes; in front of Congress and in otherwise public appearances, he typically calls for a simple reduction in the tax. ""This old clip was simply a discussion about how higher taxes hurts job creation,"" Toomey's spokesman Ted Kwong said. His CNBC comments in 2007 don’t exactly jibe with what he wrote in his 2009 book ""The Road to Prosperity: How to Grow Our Economy and Revive the American Dream."" In the book, Toomey wrote about two other tax systems he’d favor over our current one: A flat tax, which would require businesses pay a 17 percent tax on income (a decrease from the current 35 percent), and a ""fair tax,"" which would totally eliminate corporate and income taxes in favor of a sales tax. Still, he writes, ""my preference lies with the flat tax."" Toomey’s campaign website notes the senator ""supports closing special-interest loopholes and lowering rates for all Americans,"" but doesn’t mention lowering or eliminating taxes on corporations. Decreasing or eliminating corporate taxes is a tough sell. A 2014 Gallup poll showed two thirds of Americans think corporations ""pay too little"" in taxes. Despite that, reducing the corporate tax rate has some bipartisan backing. In 2012, President Obama proposed reducing the rate to 28 percent. Our ruling McGinty’s campaign says Toomey ""advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes."" While he told CNBC back in 2007 ""Let’s not tax corporations"" and his book mentions it as one of his two favored tax plans, the incumbent Senator seems to know that corporate taxes aren’t going away completely anytime soon. While it's true he’s most recently advocated for a lower tax rate and a simplified system, he did tell CNBC viewers he’d prefer no tax at all. We rate the claim True.","[('Book, ""The Road to Prosperity: How to Grow Our Economy and Revive the American Dream."" Patrick J. Toomey.

N.C. NAACP president says 80 percent think the minimum wage should be $10 or more
","In the rallies against North Carolina’s new LGBT law, commonly known as HB2, protesters have represented not just gay and transgender activists. Also present Monday for the rallies outside the legislature were Latino activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter and Rise Up for $15 movements. The law doesn’t just ban transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify with. It also bans local governments – cities and counties – from raising the minimum wage that businesses within their boundaries would have to pay workers. Rev. William Barber, president of the N.C. NAACP, said the crowds of protesters were more diverse than just LGBT activists because of the wage issue. And in a speech just days before Monday’s protests, he said the bathroom issue was actually a Trojan Horse, of sorts, for what he deems the real intent of the law – stopping cities from raising the minimum wage, as such cities as Seattle and Los Angeles have recently done. ""Eighty percent of North Carolinians are for the living wage,"" Barber said. ""So if North Carolina's legislature and the governor had just put on the table a straight bill to make a prohibition against living wages, they would have been going against 80 percent of North Carolinians."" A higher minimum wage is often opposed by Republican politicians. But if Barber was right, a higher minimum wage is a true bipartisan issue – something that 4 out of 5 people support in a state where 4 out of 10 are Democrats. What is a living wage? Polling on this issue is all over the place. There are many ways to ask the question. Some polls give a specific number they test for approval; some let the respondents choose a number; some simply ask whether the minimum wage should be higher; some ask who should have the power to make that decision. But first, perhaps we should define ""living wage,"" the phrase Barber used in place of ""higher minimum wage."" It’s not just a political catchphrase; there are actual ways of calculating it. In 2004, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning created what she called the Living Wage Calculator. Accounting for location-specific factors such as the cost of food, childcare, housing, transportation and taxes, the tool determines the ""living wage"" as well as ""poverty wage"" for states, counties and metro areas. It gives numbers in both wage categories for single adults or couples, and households with zero to three children. It also assumes full-time employment of 2,080 work hours per year (40 hours a week for 52 weeks). For the purposes of this report, we’ll look at the wage for a single person with no children. Right now the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, although some states and cities have gone higher. North Carolina has not, and as Barber accurately said, the state has now forbidden any individual city or county from raising it. In Wake and Mecklenburg counties – the two largest in North Carolina – the Living Wage Calculator says a living wage would be right about $11 an hour. The state average is $10.53, and 13 of 14 metropolitan areas are above $10. A person working full time for $10.53 an hour would make $21,902.40 a year. At the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, that same person would make $15,080 a year – a difference of more than $6,800. Recent polling Now that we know what a living wage is, we can look to see whether Barber is right about 80 percent support. The topic isn’t surveyed much at the state level, but luckily two polls have tackled this topic in the last month. They’re from the left-leaning Public Policy Polling and the more centrist Elon University Poll. A spokesman for the state’s main right-leaning polling firm, The Civitas Institute, said there’s no record of Civitas ever having polled people on the topic of minimum wage. Public Policy Polling found that 76 percent of North Carolinians support a minimum wage of at least $10 an hour. That isn’t an exact confirmation of Barber’s claim, since it’s slightly lower than 80 percent and the living wage is $10.53, not $10, but it’s pretty close. However, the Elon poll found less support for a $10 or higher minimum wage, 65 percent. It also arrived at that number differently than PPP. PPP gave five choices, asking people to say if they thought there shouldn’t be a minimum wage, if it should remain $7.25, or if it should increase to $10, $12 or $15. Elon asked people to name whatever they thought the minimum wage should be. A plurality (27 percent) said $10. In total, 65 percent said $10 or higher. That’s certainly less than the 80 percent claim Barber made or the 76 percent that PPP found. But complicating matters, Elon also found less support than PPP for keeping the current minimum wage. The difference is that many in the Elon Poll (23 percent) named a number between $7.26 and $9.99 – an option that PPP didn’t give. So while the Elon poll found only 65 percent support for wages that could be called a living wage under the MIT definition, it did find 88 percent support for raising the minimum wage at least a little. Political breakdown Barber framed his claim in the context of the state’s Republican leaders trying to avoid blowback for putting restrictions on a higher minimum wage. So we decided to look at how Republicans feel about the subject. Just like they phrased their questions differently, PPP and Elon also asked about party affiliations differently. PPP found that 63 percent of people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 also support at least a $10 minimum wage, as do 92 percent of Barack Obama voters and 65 percent of others. The Elon poll found that 46 percent of self-identified Republicans support a $10 or higher minimum wage, compared with 86 percent of Democrats and with 62 percent of others. Our ruling It’s impossible to say for certain that a full 80 percent of North Carolinians want a living wage in North Carolina, like Barber said. But it does appear that a vast majority support the idea, including about half of Republicans and nearly all Democrats. One recent poll found 76 percent support for a $10 or higher minimum wage. With a margin of error of 3.4 points, Barber’s 80 percent claim would be well within reason if this was the only recent poll. But another recent poll found just 65 percent support. The average of the two polls is 70.5 percent. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Moral Monday video, April 23, 2016,\xa0""HB2: What Do Bathrooms Have to Do With Living Wages?""', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7CixPQ7Pk'), ('The Living Wage Calculator: North Carolina counties and metro areas', 'No link'), ('The Living Wage Calculator:\xa0History, formulae and sources', 'http://livingwage.mit.edu/states/37/locations'), ('NC Voter registration statistics, as of April 2016 http://enr.ncsbe.gov/voter_stats/results.aspx?date=04-23-2016', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with William Barber, NC NAACP president', 'http://livingwage.mit.edu/pages/about'), ('Email interview with Jason Husser, Elon professor and Elon Poll assistant director', 'No link'), ('Email interview with James Tynen, Civitas Institute communications director', 'http://enr.ncsbe.gov/voter_stats/results.aspx?date=04-23-2016'), ('Elon University Poll, April 10-15, 2016, minimum wage question on pg. 11', 'No link'), ('Public Policy Polling, March 18-20, 2016, minimum wage question no. 32', 'https://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/elonpoll/041916_ElonPoll_FullReport.pdf')]",/factchecks/2016/apr/28/william-barber/nc-naacp-president-says-80-percent-think-minimum-w/

Bernie Sanders says conditions in Baltimore no better than North Korea, West Bank
","Residents of some Baltimore neighborhoods are no better off than people living in impoverished North Korea and the violent West Bank, Bernie Sanders said during a campaign rally in Maryland ahead of that state’s primary. ""Poverty in Baltimore, and around this country — poverty is a death sentence,"" Sanders said April 24. He then laid out some rather unflattering and harsh comparisons: ""Fifteen neighborhoods in Baltimore have lower life expectancies than North Korea. Two of them have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank in Palestine. Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa. We are talking about the United States of America in the year 2016 — a country in which the top 1/10th of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."" While it would be wrong to take Sanders’ claim to mean that conditions overall are worse than Baltimore, we found that his specific comparisons are largely accurate. ""The comparisons fairly make the point that there are some parts of this rich country where conditions resemble those in much poorer countries,"" said Alan Berube, an expert on urban poverty at the Brookings Institution. ""This isn't isolated to Baltimore; there are neighborhoods in nearly every big U.S. city and metropolitan area, and many rural communities, that perform just as poorly on these outcomes."" Let’s take Sanders’ claims one by one. Life expectancy in North Korea The Sanders campaign referred us to a Washington Post article noting that 14 Baltimore neighborhoods had shorter life expectancies than North Korea in 2013. (The article originally said 15 but was corrected.) His number is slightly outdated.   In 2014, the latest year where there’s data on both places, the average life expectancy in North Korea was 69.81 years, according to the CIA World Factbook. That placed the impoverished dictatorship at No. 155 in longest lifespans out of 224 countries. The United States overall ranked at No. 42 with 79.56 years. Residents in 12 of Baltimore's 56 neighborhoods lived shorter lives, according to data from the Baltimore City Health Department provided to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. That’s not 15, but it’s close. (For context, just five Baltimore neighborhoods have life expectancies higher than the U.S. national average, and four of them are relatively affluent and white.) Here’s a map from the University of Maryland’s Capital News Service that compares the life expectancies of Baltimore neighborhoods in 2013 to other places in the world:  An important caveat: The city of Baltimore has a total population around 600,000 people while North Korea has a population 40 times that. That means fewer events in Baltimore neighborhood could swing the overall life expectancy of a neighborhood up or down. Infant mortality in the West Bank For this claim, the Sanders campaign referred us to a Vox article that said two neighborhoods in Baltimore — Little Italy and Greenmount East — had a higher rate of infant mortality than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela in 2013. But in his speech, Sanders only mentioned the West Bank. In 2014, 13.49 out of 1,000 babies died before their first birthday in the notorious conflict zone, according to the CIA’s World Factbook. The West Bank places in the middle of the pack in infant mortality at No. 117 out of 224 countries. The United States, meanwhile, ranked at No. 169 with a rate of 6.17 deaths per 1,000. In 2014, 11 Baltimore neighborhoods had a higher rate than the West Bank. In Hilltop and Little Italy, at least 20 out of 1,000 infants died before their first birthday. That’s not only higher than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela but also war-torn Syria and oppressive Uzbekistan. Teen health in distressed cities in developing countries Sanders claimed that ""Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa.""  The Sanders campaign cited a Washington Post article by Johns Hopkins University researchers. ""Teenagers in Baltimore face poorer health and more negative outlooks than those in urban centers of Nigeria, India and China,"" they write. Contrary to what Sanders said, the work by the Johns Hopkins researchers don’t consider economic outlooks nor do they show Baltimore conditions being worse than South Africa’s. Nonetheless, his broader point is accurate. The researchers published a comprehensive set of studies published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2014 that compared the well-being of teens in impoverished areas in Baltimore; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; New Delhi, India; and Shanghai, China.

Donald Trump says Raul Castro snubbed Barack Obama at airport, and that it's 'without precedent'
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said President Barack Obama had been disrespected during his recent trip to Cuba -- the first visit by a sitting president since 1928, as well as a landmark step in the evolving relationship between bitter Cold War enemies. ""Our rivals no longer respect us,"" Trump said during a major foreign policy speech on April 27, 2016. ""In fact, they're just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don't take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don't respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him -- perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One."" This was not the first time Trump had raised this concern. He sent this tweet the same day Obama landed in Cuba:  Is Trump right that this is an unprecedented snub? After checking with diplomatic and presidential historians, we found that Trump has a point, but his claim is far from airtight. Airport greetings aren’t only from heads of state On March 20 at José Martí International Airport near Havana, the president was ""greeted by a delegation of American and Cuban officials, including … Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, the Cuban foreign minister,"" the New York Times reported. So neither Fidel Castro, the communist government’s founding leader, or Raul Castro, his brother and successor, was at the airport to greet Obama. Fidel Castro is in poor health, but Raul Castro met Pope Francis at the airport in February. And he also met the Russian Orthodox Patriarch at the airport when he arrived that month. Trump has ""a legitimate point,"" said Paul Kengor, a biographer of Ronald Reagan. ""It did make Obama look bad, especially given that the Castro brothers should be enormously grateful"" that an American president would agree to start warming relations between the two countries. That said, Trump’s wording in his speech -- that ""no leader was there, nobody, to greet him"" -- wasn’t really accurate. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, the foreign minister, is a high-ranking official in the Cuban government. So is Cuban Ambassador to the U.S. Jose Cabanas, who was also there. Indeed, the White House said at the time said that it was never envisioned that one of the Castros would come to the airport to greet Air Force One. ""The White House says it's taking no offense that Cuban President Raul Castro didn't greet President Barack Obama upon arrival in Havana,"" the Associated Press reported. ""Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, says it was ‘never contemplated or discussed’ that Castro would be at the airport. He said the Cubans consider Monday morning's ceremony with Obama and Castro to be the official welcome event."" White House spokesman Ned Price told PolitiFact that there is ""not a standard recipe"" for how protocol of this sort is handled. ""If the official arrival ceremony is separate from the airport arrival, as was the case in Cuba, it's certainly not atypical for someone other than the head of state to greet Air Force One,"" Price said. Independent experts agreed. Nick Cullather, a diplomatic historian at Indiana University, said he doubted any snub was felt when Obama recently traveled to the United Kingdom and was met at Stansted Airport by Essex Lord Lieutenant Lord John Petre, a designee of Queen Elizabeth II. And lots of factors can play a role in who comes out to greet the president, said Alan K. Henrikson, a diplomatic historian at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. ""The time of day can be important, depending in part on the itinerary and destination,"" he said, ""If the president is traveling to several places on one trip, he might be arriving at an odd hour, late in the evening or early in the morning. … There are regional and cultural, as well as constitutional, variations."" And the fact that there were no recent visits to Cuba may have made protocol more malleable. ""There's no precedent for Air Force One landing in Cuba,"" said Price of the White House. ""The fact that the president was welcomed with an official arrival ceremony, an unprecedented press conference, and full state dinner, among other elements, speaks to the level of respect the president was afforded."" There’s at least one precedent: When Nixon went to China There is no single online clearinghouse that tracks presidential overseas arrivals, and we couldn’t find an expert who was familiar with all such historical events. However, we did find one case that serves as a precedent: President Richard Nixon’s first trip to China in 1972. Like Obama’s trip to Cuba, Nixon’s journey marked the first time an American president had visited a longstanding enemy in several decades. Both nations were communist countries, with the founding leader still alive at the time. Both were highly anticipated media events. So how was the China arrival handled? It was Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai -- not Mao Zedong, China’s top leader -- who greeted Nixon at the base of the steps from Air Force One. Here’s the official White House photograph by Byron Schumaker.  Winston Lord, the special assistant to Nixon’s National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, was instrumental in planning the trip. He shared recollections of the visit with a diplomatic oral history project, describing the arrival ceremony as disappointing. ""I remember that when we landed at Beijing Airport, maybe naively I was somewhat disappointed at what I considered the strained nature of the Chinese reception. We had expected thousands of people in cheering crowds after 22 years of hostilities. There was a very small crowd, including a Chinese Army honor guard. Looking out the window at the welcoming ceremony, I thought that it was a fairly grey day, too. This didn’t look like a monumental event, as it ought to have been. ""Of course, everyone was wondering how the first encounter would go between the President and Zhou Enlai, who was at the airport to meet him. They all remembered that Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had snubbed Zhou Enlai in Geneva in the 1950s when he refused to shake his hand. That initial handshake this time was clearly going to be important. Nixon left the plane, walked down the steps, and went over and shook Zhou En-lai’s hand. This was a famous photograph. ... Then there was a restrained reception at the airport, with the band playing, the national anthems, review of the honor guard, and so on. There were not many people there. The reception was very cool."" Our ruling Trump said, ""When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him -- perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One."" While there appears to be some variation in protocol for presidential arrivals, it’s credible to view the absence of one of the Castro brothers at the airport as something of a snub, particularly since Raul Castro had met two visiting religious leaders there just months earlier. However, Trump exaggerates here when he says ""no leader was there, nobody, to greet him,"" since Cuba’s foreign minister and other high government officials were present. And there is at least one ""precedent"" for the foreign minister greeting a visiting president -- Nixon’s trip to China in 1972, which is actually a pretty good comparison for the type of trip Obama was making. We rate the statement Half True.","[('Donald Trump, foreign policy address in Washington, D.C., April 27, 2016', 'http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4877941?4'), ('Donald Trump, tweet, March 20, 2016', 'No link'), ('Associated Press, ""The White House says it\'s taking no offense that Cuban President Raul Castro didn\'t greet President Barack Obama upon arrival in Havana,"" March 20, 2016', 'https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/711653804983361536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'), ('Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, ""Moments in U.S. Diplomatic History: Nixon Goes to China,"" accessed April 28, 2016', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Obama in Cuba,"" March 20, 2016', 'https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-03-20/the-latest-us-move-should-mean-more-airbnb-bookings-in-cuba'), ('Associated Press, ""Pope arrives in Cuba for historic meeting,"" Feb. 12, 2016', 'No link'), ('Voice of America, ""Russian Orthodox Patriarch Arrives in Cuba for Historic Meeting,"" Feb. 11, 2016', 'http://adst.org/2013/02/nixon-goes-to-china'), ('East Anglian Daily Times, ""American President Barack Obama lands at Stansted Airport before eagerly anticipated EU stance speech,"" April 21, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Paul Kengor, professor of political science at Grove City College and author of two books on Ronald Reagan, April 28, 2016', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/international/obama-in-cuba'), ('Email interview with Craig Shirley, Reagan biographer, April 28, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Nick Cullather, diplomatic historian at Indiana University, April 27, 2016', 'http://fox17online.com/2016/02/12/pope-arrives-in-cuba-for-historic-meeting/'), ('Email interview with Alan K.
