Maher: U.S. ranks fifth in the world in number of executions
","The botched execution of an Oklahoma man has renewed debate about the death penalty. Bill Maher added his mix of humor and seriousness to the discussion recently on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher. ""Why can’t we just kill people? If you want to kill them, and you want to do it humanely, you can definitely put them out. We’ve all been under,"" Maher said on his May 23, 2014, show. ""Then when you’re under … guillotine, shoot them, leave them in a room with a toddler with a gun, anything. It’s just so easy to take human life. It’s ridiculous."" David Frum of The Atlantic tried to bring the conversation back toward seriousness, saying ""we’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation."" Maher jumped right back in. ""We're fifth in the world,"" Maher said. ""Behind China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia."" Maher’s claim is pretty close. (We’re examining Frum’s claim in a separate fact-check.) It comes from a report by Amnesty International, which attempts to count the number of state-sponsored executions per country, per year. In its most recent report, which covers 2013, Amnesty International found that governments in the United States executed 39 individuals (16 of them in Texas). We corroborated the 39 total executions through the Death Penalty Information Center. The number of executions in the United States in 2013 was down from 2012, when there were 43 executions. Here's a list of U.S. executions by year: (Death Penalty Information Center) How does that rank worldwide? A majority of countries do not use or prohibit the use of the death penalty. Of those that do, exact data is difficult to find in some cases. But according to Amnesty International’s best estimate, the United States indeed ranks fifth -- behind China, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia.  (Amnesty International) The one caveat in Amnesty International’s report is that it admits that its execution totals are just estimates and that the real number of executions are not known. The group says that the countries ranked right below the United States -- Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- all could have execution totals higher than the reported number. That, in theory, could push the United States down the list. At least one country not listed likely does outpace the United States, Amnesty International says. The group did not attempt to tally the number of executions in North Korea, but believes the country executes more people than the United States. ""While reliable reports indicate that at least 70 executions were carried out in North Korea, Amnesty International believes the true figure to be much higher,"" the group wrote in its report. If true, that would make the United States sixth. ""Amnesty's numbers are reliable as minimums but understate totals for places like (China),"" said Franklin Zimring, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the death penalty. ""The fuzzy part in international comparisons is when do state killings become judicial or legal executions. You correctly zero in on the one nation that probably pushes the U.S. to No. 6 in Maher's hall of shame, North Korea."" Our ruling Maher said the United States is ""fifth in the world"" in executions. He’s for the most part accurately citing a report from Amnesty International. The only real caveat is that group doesn’t include North Korea on its list because it can’t determine how many executions were performed there (though they think there were more than the United States). That would rank the United States sixth in the world. To us, that doesn’t really diminish Maher’s point.

John McCain says five Taliban detainees freed in Bowe Bergdahl exchange 'are the hardest of the hard-core'
","When President Barack Obama announced that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl had been freed after five years of being held by the Taliban, it didn’t take long for commentators to question whether the price of Bergdahl’s freedom was too steep. In exchange for Bergdahl’s freedom, the Obama administration agreed to release five members of the Taliban from the United States’ detention facility in Guantanamo, Cuba. The Taliban controlled Afghanistan prior to the 2001 U.S.-led military operation, and even though it’s no longer in power, the Taliban continues to fight for control of Afghanistan. On CBS’ Face the Nation, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sharply questioned whether it was in the United States’ best interests to release the five Taliban members: Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, and Mohammad Nabi Omari. Under the agreement, the five are to be held in Qatar for a year without the right to travel elsewhere. The five freed detainees, McCain said, ""are the hardest of the hard-core. These are the highest high-risk people."" We wondered whether McCain had sound support for his characterization, so we took a look at the evidence. The most detailed assessment comes from once-secret U.S. government documents made public by Wikileaks. The key documents, written in 2008, were individualized assessments by the Defense Department’s Guantanamo leadership. The documents, which provide most of the direct quotes in the five capsules below, give background and risk assessments of each of the five detainees being freed. According to the documents, all five men were deemed to be of ""high"" risk to the United States and were recommended for ""continued detention."" ""From my general background, McCain, alas, is on target,"" said James Jeffrey, visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank that studies American interests in the Middle East. Here’s a rundown of the five former detainees: • Mullah Mohammad Fazl. Experts suggested to PolitiFact that, of the five, Fazl and Noori may be the most dangerous to United States interests. Fazl was an experienced commander against the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance and served as the Taliban’s army chief of staff. He’s ""wanted by the UN for possible war crimes including the murder of thousands of Shiites"" and had ""operational associations with significant al Qaeda and other extremist personnel."" The leaked documents say Fazl ""wielded considerable influence"" and that he’s become a recruiting symbol for the Taliban. • Mullah Norullah Noori. Noori was a ""senior Taliban military commander"" and the onetime governor of Balkh province who, like Fazl, is on the United Nations’ radar screen for possible war crimes. Fazl and Noori ""were responsible for ethno-sectarian massacres in northern Afghanistan, as were some of their enemies who are now in the Afghan government,"" said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation. ""They cooperated with al-Qaida, which was providing assistance to their fight against the Northern Alliance."" Leaked documents cite ties to the Taliban’s top leader, Mullah Omar, and ""senior al-Qaida members,"" including the allegation that he passed a message from Omar to al-Qaida’s Osama bin Laden. • Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa. The leaked documents say Khairkhwa was close to both Omar and bin Laden, representing the Taliban in ""meetings with Iranian officials seeking to support hostilities against U.S. and Coalition Forces"" following the start of the United States war in Afghanistan. He was governor of Herat province from 1999 to 2001 and was alleged to be one of the ""major opium drug lords in western Afghanistan."" Complicating matters somewhat, Khairkhwa was in discussions with the family of post-war Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, a longtime friend, about possibly cooperating with the new government when he was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and brought to Guantanamo. • Abdul Haq Wasiq. Wasiq was the deputy chief of the Taliban’s intelligence service and ""was central to the Taliban's efforts to form alliances with other Islamic fundamentalist groups to fight alongside the Taliban against U.S. and Coalition forces after the 11 September 2001 attacks,"" according to the leaked documents, which added that he ""utilized his office to support al-Qaida and to assist Taliban personnel elude capture"" in late 2001. He is believed to have ""arranged for al-Qaida personnel to train Taliban intelligence staff in intelligence methods."" Wasiq claimed to be offering cooperation to the United States, though the U.S. government has officially been skeptical of those claims. • Mohammad Nabi Omari. Leaked documents describe Omari as ""a senior Taliban official who served in multiple leadership roles,"" including membership in a joint al-Qaida-Taliban cell in Khowst that ""was involved in attacks against U.S. and coalition forces."" Omari also ""maintained weapons caches and facilitated the smuggling of fighters and weapons,"" the documents say. Omari, like Wasiq, was apprehended while claiming to be providing intelligence of interest to the United States. Experts told PolitiFact that each of the five detainees represented risks to the United States’ national security to one degree or another, with Fazl and Noori at the top of the list. ""They were involved in a range of Taliban operations in senior positions,"" said Seth G. Jones, associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation. After being released, the five will be able to leverage their time at Guantanamo, Jones added. ""We’ve already seen Taliban statements that they’re pretty excited about the return of these men."" There’s precedent for Taliban officials being released from Guantanamo and then going back to the battlefield. In 2007, the George W. Bush administration released Mullah Abdul Qayyum Zakir. Despite being considered less of a risk than any of the five released in exchange for Bergdahl, he rejoined Taliban forces and pushed a campaign of improvised explosive devices. Because the agreement stipulates that the five men will stay in Qatar for a year, the five released detainees won’t be able to take part immediately in battles on the ground, Jones noted. However, they might be able to provide strategic advice from a distance. ""The reason the negotiations took so long was that the U.S. insisted on very strict safeguards against the risk posed by the release of these detainees,"" Rubin said. ""No one claims there is no risk or even a low risk."" While experts said McCain is generally correct that the five released detainees are significant figures who could put American interests at risk, some added that his language might have been a bit hyperbolic. Only one of the five -- Omari -- was labeled a ""high"" risk while in detention. The other four were considered ""low"" risks while in detention, meaning that they weren’t rabble rousers within Guantanamo. Jones said he wasn’t sure it was precisely accurate to call the five ""the worst of the worst,"" saying he’d leave that description for the Taliban’s very top leaders, particularly Mullah Omar. Still, Jones said, ""several of these five are pretty senior."" Our ruling McCain said the five Taliban prisoners exchanged for Bergdahl ""are the hardest of the hard-core. These are the highest high-risk people."" It might be a slight exaggeration to place all five into the highest threat category among Taliban officials and leaders. Still, these were very senior Taliban operatives, and leaked internal documents from U.S. officials at Guantanamo generally back up McCain’s assessment. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/02/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-five-taliban-detainees-freed-bowe/

Boehner: Obama's climate change policies will kill 224,000 jobs and surge electric bills by billions
","President Barack Obama’s administration unveiled tough new regulations on existing power plants that seek to significantly curb carbon emissions in the coming decades. Moments after the proposal was released, it was widely panned by Republicans, who called it a continuation of Obama’s so-called ""War on Coal"" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. On his website, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, put it in more direct terms: ""The president’s plan would indeed cause a surge in electricity bills — costs stand to go up $17 billion every year.  But it would also shut down plants and potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" The details of Obama’s plan are extensive — the proposal is 645 pages long. So how did Republicans come up with such exact (and damning) figures so quickly after the proposal was released? The estimates actually come from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released in late May. We took a look at it last week, and noted it made several assumptions about the June 2 proposal. We warned that the findings of the study would be relatively unusable if those predictions did not come to light. And that’s what happened. The Environmental Protection Agency announced a goal of reducing carbon emissions 30 percent (based on 2005 levels) by 2030. This is achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many existing coal plants. But the chamber study that Boehner and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030 (a number Obama first suggested in 2009 during the Copenhagen international climate change talks). When it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, this is a significant difference. This is a point even the chamber made to PolitiFact now that Obama’s regulations have been released. ""We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward,"" said Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)."" Why don’t the numbers work? By assuming a much more difficult goal, the chamber also predicted that by 2022, the EPA (under a different president) will have to change course to meet the 42 percent threshold. The only means to accomplish this, the chamber concluded, was to force new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology. In September, the EPA said new natural gas plants would not need to include carbon capture in their facilities. A large chunk of the chamber’s estimated costs of the carbon rules comes from the assumption that new natural gas plants will require carbon capture technology, which they say is 50 percent more expensive to build and also more expensive to operate. Therefore, their assumption that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. Letourneau and Boehner’s office both noted media reports that said the 30 percent threshold could be increased before the final regulations are approved. (Of course, it could also be lowered, too.) There will be a 120-day public comment period before the EPA releases its final draft. There are other criticisms of the chamber study. For example, it did not factor in the cost of no action, which the EPA said is significant. The debate over the cost of these regulations will continue, and we do not dismiss offhand the idea that new regulations on existing power plants have an economic cost. For its part, the EPA says that the new rules will save consumers money on their electric bills and will spur economic growth that will surpass the expense. But even if the regulations do have an economic cost, it’s misleading to quote estimates from a study that wrongly assumed a key piece of the EPA’s proposal. Our ruling Boehner said the EPA’s plan to regulate carbon emissions in existing power plants will increase electric bills by ""$17 billion every year"" and ""potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" Those numbers are based on a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that came out before the EPA announced the regulations on existing power plants. That study wrongly assumed the administration would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030. The regulations released June 2 actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber itself told PolitiFact its estimates are not based on the goals as announced. But despite these serious flaws, Boehner used the numbers anyway. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/02/john-boehner/Boehner-says-Obama-climate-change-jobs-bills-costs/

ESPN's Schaap: Qataris don't need to work
","File this under the category of be careful what you wish for. Four years ago, Qatar emerged triumphant when the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, better known as FIFA, voted to hold the 2022 World Cup in the oil and gas rich emirate. Qatar’s bid involved massive construction plans for new stadiums, rail lines and virtually an entire new city. It would be the marquee event for a country that aims to transform itself into an intercontinental crossroads. But controversy followed almost as soon as the decision was announced. With daytime temperatures hitting 120 degrees there has been talk of shifting the games from the summer to the winter. Then last year, a newspaper exposé led to an official investigation that Qatar paid million dollar bribes to win FIFA approval. A member of the FIFA Executive Committee called the Qatar pick a ""blatant mistake."" Qatar’s treatment of foreign workers also has come into the spotlight. Amnesty International and other human rights groups report rampant abuse in the construction industry. ESPN host Jeremy Schaap went to Doha to investigate allegations of laborers from India, Nepal and elsewhere who find themselves toiling in brutal heat, dying in accidents and locked into jobs with no way to get back home because their passports had been confiscated. ""We're talking about a country that can afford to do better,"" Schaap said on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes. Schaap noted that per capita, Qatar is the richest nation in the world. ""Qataris don't really work. They don't have to work,"" Schaap said, claiming that the Qatari government offers generous benefits for the unemployed. Schaap’s statement that Qataris ""don’t really work"" struck us as worth learning more about. We asked Schaap to clarify. In his response, he dialed down his rhetoric. ""I should have said as laborers on construction sites,"" Schaap told PunditFact. He added that 94 percent of those workers are foreign -- a fact that came up during his MSNBC interview. This led to a further qualification of the more sweeping statement he made on air. ""It's not quite ‘no Qataris’,"" he said. Indeed, official statistics show that most Qataris 15 years old and up are employed. According to the CIA’s World Factbook, the country has the second lowest unemployment rate in the world, about 0.3 percent. (Definitions of employment might matter here. Cambodia comes in first and its economy is hardly as robust as Qatar’s.) According to the latest figures from the government of Qatar itself, a total of 82,000 Qataris are working out of a total population estimated at 278,000. (Oddly, the government doesn’t provide population data by nationality.) That represents 68 percent of men over the age of 15 and 35 percent of women. A large fraction of women are listed as ""homemakers"" and thus not employed. The most common job for men is clerk. The most common job for women is professional. Schaap does have a point that the government takes good care of its ciitizens. In 2008, nearly 90 percent of Qataris worked in public-sector jobs. A huge factor here is the state-owned petroleum industry. Oil exports netted the government over $55 billion in 2012 and hydrocarbons represent about 60 percent of the nation's GDP. A new college graduate with no experience can expect a job paying $65,000 or more. The country has more than 1.25 million foreign workers. About 700,000 of them are men working in trades or industrial facilities. On average, they work about 50 hours per week. That’s 10 hours more each week than the average Qatari worker. All this in a country the size of Connecticut. Following a tough assessment from the UN’s International Labor Organization, Qatari officials proposed a number of labor reforms. There would be higher penalties for employers who confiscate the passports of foreign workers and an end to a system of exit permits that gave employers control over who could leave the country. International advocacy groups called this a step in the right direction but said the proposed changes didn’t go far enough and violators might never be punished. Our ruling Schaap said Qataris ""don’t really work."" Schaap later clarified his statement, saying he should have specified that he was thinking of work on construction sites, and even with that caveat, his claim went a bit too far. We rate statements based on what was said on air. In that regard, official reports show that most Qataris of working age do work and hold a variety of jobs. In one way or another, the government provides nearly all these jobs but people still need to show up to get paid. A small fraction of the construction workforce is Qatari. The risks for foreign workers are real, but that is separate from Schaap’s assertion. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/02/jeremy-schaap/espns-schaap-qataris-dont-need-work/

Florida ACLU says state has 'the most errors and exonerations from death row'
","On May 27, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Florida’s standard for executing intellectually disabled convicts, finding that the state’s IQ cutoff of 70 is too rigid. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion that the standard, ""creates an unacceptable risk that persons with an intellectual disability will be executed, and thus is unconstitutional."" The case stemmed from a death sentence for Freddie Lee Hall, who in 1978 killed Deputy Lonnie Coburn and raped and murdered 21-year-old Karol Hurst. Hall scored between 60 and 80 on IQ tests over the decades. Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, said in a statement that Florida’s death penalty system is ""broken"" and that the Legislature must address its failings. ""Florida is the only state in the country where the vote of a simple majority of jurors can recommend that a person receive a sentence of death. This has contributed to our state’s record of having the most errors and exonerations from death row."" Does Florida hold the record for death row exonerations? Death penalty exonerations The ACLU of Florida obtained the information about Florida’s exoneration record from the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse that has written reports critical of the death penalty. The center shows the number of exonerations in 26 states that have the death penalty at any point between the 1970s through mid March 2014. The center counts an exoneration as a case where a defendant has been acquitted, pardoned or had their case dropped by prosecutors. Common scenarios that led to exonerations include cases where evidence was withheld by the prosecution, or where the defendant had ineffective trial counsel and then got a new trial that resulted in acquittal or dropped charges, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the center. More recently, DNA tests have also led to exonerations. So how do the numbers stack up? Florida was indeed No. 1, with 24 exonerations, followed by Illinois with 20 and Texas with 12. But there’s also a separate source of data -- the National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project of the University of Michigan Law School and the Center on Wrongful Convictions at the Northwestern University School of Law. Launched in 2012, the registry provides information on exonerations for several types of crimes since 1989, including in death penalty cases. The registry uses a different definition of exonerations and it starts the clock ticking later than the other database does, so -- not surprisingly -- it produces different numbers. The registry shows that Illinois had 18 death penalty exonerations while both Louisiana and Texas had 10, followed by Florida with 8. These numbers suggest that Florida isn't in a category by itself in exonerations. For instance, in Illinois, several high-profile exonerations were so embarrassing that Republican Gov. George Ryan placed a 10-year moratorium on executions in 2000. In 2011, the Legislature passed a bill to abolish the death penalty and Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn signed it. So two sources count the numbers differently. Let’s take a closer look at what the statistics say about Florida’s use of the death penalty. Florida requires a unanimous vote by a jury to find a defendant guilty. However, during the penalty phase, Florida requires only a simple majority of the jury -- seven of 12 jurors -- to recommend a death sentence. Florida is the only state that allows such a simple majority vote, ACLU of Florida spokesman Baylor Johnson said. Two other states -- Alabama and Delaware -- allow for the death penalty to be imposed by less than a unanimous jury, but they have a higher standard than Florida does. Alabama requires a 10-2 vote, while Delaware requires that a unanimous jury find aggravating circumstances. Johnson pointed to a 2006 study by Oklahoma City University School of Law, which showed that based on jurors’ reports, jury members in Florida deliberated for less time and reviewed evidence less frequently than jurors in other states. A 2006 American Bar Association study of the death penalty raised concerns about allowing a non-unanimous jury vote for capital punishment. Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which supports the death penalty, takes issue with the use of the word ""exonerate"" on such lists. ""When typical readers read that word, they think of a person who has been affirmatively shown not to have committed the crime,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. A person can be deemed ""exonerated"" if his conviction is overturned and the evidence is insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he argued. But the person could still be guilty, he argued. Our ruling Florida has ""the most errors and exonerations from death row,"" ACLU of Florida executive director Howard Simon said in a press release. According to a count by the Death Penalty Information Center, Florida has exonerated 24 death row inmates -- the most of any state in the nation. But another resource that uses a different definitions of ""exoneration"" and has a different time period -- the National Registry of Exonerations -- shows Florida had eight exonerations, fewer than Illinois, Louisiana and Texas. The ACLU's claim makes it seem like Florida is unchallenged for the most exonerations, but the data is actually murkier. So we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/02/aclu-florida/florida-aclu-says-state-has-most-errors-and-exoner/

Dave Brat says Eric Cantor voted to ""fully fund"" Obamacare
","Republican congressional candidate Dave Brat says Rep. Eric Cantor is soft on Obamacare. The two are squaring off in a June 10th GOP primary for the 7th District congressional seat Cantor has held since 2001. Cantor has repeatedly called Brat a liberal. Brat fired the l-word back at his opponent in a radio ad this month. ""He voted to fully fund Obamacare in October,"" a woman in the ad says of Cantor. Another woman says, ""and he has the nerve to call Dave Brat a liberal? Seems to me he ought to be looking at his own voting record."" The Obamacare charge caught our attention because, as House majority leader, Cantor has been at the center of dozens of Republican attempts to repeal or gut the Affordable Care Act. So we took a look at Brat’s claim Cantor voted to fully fund the law. Zachary Werrell, Brat’s campaign manager, said the statement was based on Cantor’s vote for a continuing appropriations bill that was enacted last October. The legislation ended a 16-day federal government shutdown that was caused by partisan warfare over Obamacare. The battle began as Congress faced an Oct. 1 deadline for passing an appropriations bill. House Republicans, including Cantor, initially insisted the bill strip all funding for Obamacare, then fell back to demanding delays in implementing the ACA in exchange for funding essential government programs. The White House and the Democrat-led Senate refused. The standoff ended on Oct. 16, less than two days before the federal government was scheduled to reach its debt limit and would be unable to borrow money to meet its obligations. Congress passed a measure allowing all federal programs, including Obamacare, to be funded for three months and raising the debt ceiling. The bill passed the House by a vote of 285-144. Cantor was one of 87 Republicans who backed it. Does that mean Cantor’s support for the appropriations bill was a vote to ""fully fund Obamacare""? Budget analysts we spoke with were critical of Brat’s claim. Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that ""in the narrowest sense"" the appropriations act that Cantor backed funded federal programs that included Obamacare. ""But obviously that did not mean either an endorsement of Obamacare or funding for more than a finite period,"" Ornstein emailed. ""And since it was part of a measure to reopen the government, it meant funding a host of things that might be anathema not just to Eric Cantor, but to most other members, D and R."" Maya MacGuineas, the president of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Brat’s statement ignores a key detail: the vast amount funding for Obamacare was not subject to the stopgap funding measure Cantor backed. Most of the ACA, in fact, is not even incorporated in annual appropriations bills. That’s because Obamacare largely falls under the mandatory spending portion of the federal budget which consumes about two-thirds of outlays. That category consists of entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- in which levels of funding are required under law to provide mandated services. It’s a debated question whether Congress can alter these programs through budget bills or is required to change the actual laws that established them. The remaining third of the federal budget consists of discretionary programs that were deeply affected by the shutdown and subject to annual congressional appropriations. These programs include defense, education, justice and transportation. Josh Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates balanced budgets, estimated that at least 90 percent of the health care law’s funding comes from mandatory funds that continued flowing during the government shutdown. That’s consistent with findings from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO in 2011 estimated the ACA would require about $600 billion in mandatory spending from 2012-2021. Discretionary spending for the act was pegged at $110 to $120 billion during that span. The CBO noted that most of those discretionary funds involved spending for programs that existed prior to Obamacare, such as Indian health services and grants to health centers. So the vast amount of money for Obamacare continued to flow during the government shutdown. MacGuineas said the key vote for fully funding Obamacare occurred several years earlier when Congress passed legislation establishing the ACA as ""a new mandatory spending program."" The House was controlled by Democrats in March 2010 when it narrowly approved Obamacare. Cantor and his fellow Republicans unanimously voted against the bill. Since then, the House has had 52 roll call votes on measures that would either repeal, defund or otherwise limit the ACA. Cantor voted for every one and sponsored two of the repeal bills. Brat on his website charges that Cantor as the House majority leader has scheduled ""meaningless procedural votes so that House members could pretend to be on the record opposing Obamacare."" Our ruling Brat’s says Cantor voted to ""fully fund Obamacare"" last October. He’s referring to a temporary appropriations bill that Cantor supported and Congress passed to end a 16-day government shutdown. The measure guaranteed continued funding for discretionary programs that rely on annual congressional appropriations, including defense and education. But Obamacare was only marginally affected by the shutdown and the bill Cantor backed. That’s because only about 10 percent of its costs are subject to appropriations by Congress. The bill Cantor supported to end the shutdown, among many other things, topped off the ACA’s funding tank. What Brat omits is that 90 percent of Obamacare remained funded throughout the shutdown and was unaffected by the bill Cantor backed. The legislation that mandated funding for the bulk of Obamacare was approved by the House in March 2010; Cantor voted against it and has repeatedly tried to repeal the measure.   So Brat’s statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/02/dave-brat/dave-brat-says-eric-cantor-voted-fully-fund-obamac/

Candidate's debt ceiling defense turns troublesome
","Mike Collins says some folks don’t have their facts right concerning his position on one issue. His critics say he’s talking out of both sides of his mouth and ""already acting like a Washington politician."" Collins, a Republican candidate in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District race, is trying to explain some remarks he made six months ago about his position on whether to raise the federal debt ceiling. In a December interview with Roll Call, a news site that extensively reports about the ways of Washington, Collins offered a 15-second clip concerning his thoughts about the proposed debt- ceiling increase that Congress approved in February. ""I think we need to raise the debt ceiling at a certain point that we can get business done and start working on a budget to start paying that down and get this economy back rolling,"" he said. A few days before the May 20 Republican primary, Collins put together a flier in response to criticism about what he said in the interview. Collins said, in part, that he ""has never said he wanted to raise the debt ceiling."" Is this a contradiction with Collins’ Roll Call interview? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Collins was one of seven Republicans vying for the House seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens. Broun ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Collins finished a very close second in the May 20 primary and is in a runoff in July with Jody Hice for the GOP nomination. The winner will face Democrat Kenneth Dious in the November general election. Collins is the son of former U.S. Rep. Mac Collins. Raising the debt ceiling was not a popular position among most conservatives. The U.S. Treasury Department said the United States would reach its borrowing limit by the end of February. Broun, like every other Republican House member from Georgia, voted against raising the debt ceiling. At least one of Collins’ opponents thought his remarks in the Roll Call interview could mean trouble for him.   Less than a week before the primary, candidate Donna Sheldon posted the Collins interview on YouTube. ""Mike Collins couldn't be more wrong about raising the debt limit. I will refuse to raise the debt ceiling, and I will fight to cut spending and balance our budget,"" she wrote. ""Elections have consequences. Which position do you think is right for Georgia?"" Collins responded with his flier. ""Fact: Mike has never said he wanted to raise the debt ceiling and will never say he wants to raise the debt ceiling. He had the first written plan to reduce the debt."" Sheldon accused Collins in a press release of ""a whopper of a provable untruth."" Collins said in a telephone interview with us that he never said he wanted to raise the debt ceiling. ""The debt ceiling was going up whether or not I wanted it to,"" he said. ""Did I want to (raise the debt ceiling)? No. We have to have a plan to start bringing it down."" Collins explained in more detail a few days later via email. The candidate said he was not in favor of the legislation that passed to raise the debt ceiling in February. Collins said he would only support a debt-ceiling increase with ""deep spending concessions and a path to pay the debt down."" In November, Collins articulated his position on many issues on his campaign website. On federal spending, Collins wrote: ""I am the only business professional in this race, and will work to ensure Congress passes an annual budget without raising the debt limit."" In January, Collins put together a written plan that said ""our national debt is out of control"" and Congress needs to pass a balanced budget amendment. Collins wrote that he would support a budget plan similar to those proposed by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that would cut federal spending by $5 trillion over the next decade. ""Saying that I want to raise the debt ceiling, implying that I support increasing our debt willy-nilly, is a false representation of what I believe, and I don’t think it’s a fair characterization of my stance on the issue,"" Collins said. In a follow-up telephone interview, Collins said the questions in the Roll Call interview came in rapid fire, and he conceded ""I could have given a more detailed answer."" To sum up, Collins said in an interview in December that he thought the debt ceiling needed to be increased when it was scheduled to reach its limit in February. Collins recently sent a flier claiming that he ""has never said he wanted to raise the debt ceiling."" Collins said his position was that he would only support a debt-ceiling increase in accordance with deep spending cuts. The debt-ceiling bill that passed in February did not include spending cuts. A month before the Roll Call interview, Collins had written that he would work to pass a budget without raising the debt ceiling. Collins said in one interview with PolitiFact Georgia that he could have given a more detailed answer in the Roll Call interview. Collins also could have been more detailed in the flier he sent out to defend himself. He might not have meant what he said, but his opponents have a point. He did say it. Our team had a lot of debate about this one. We believe Collins is somewhat accurate, but the claim in his flier omits some critical facts. Under our rating system, we rate Collins’ claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/02/mike-collins/candidates-debt-ceiling-defense-turns-troublesome/

Brett Hulsey says Scott Walker has made Wisconsin second in nation for job loss
","It’s well known that Gov. Scott Walker has faltered on his top 2010 campaign promise of creating 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term. With his re-election looming in November 2014, he’s less than halfway there. So when state Rep. Brett Hulsey announced he was running in the Democratic primary to challenge Walker, it would seem he had an easy issue to raise. But even when running a shoestring campaign, those shoestrings can trip you up. In an April 30, 2014 news release --  issued at a time when the state GOP was poised to vote on a resolution proclaiming the right to secede from the United States -- Hulsey declared: ""Governor Walker’s Reign of Error has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs. To create a better future for our children, we should strive to be the best in the United States, not leave it."" As evidence of his jobs claim, Hulsey cited a March 30, 2014 article from The Capital Times that discussed the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly jobs report for February of 2014. That report said Wisconsin lost an estimated 9,500 jobs in February. Only North Carolina at 11,300 was worst; Alaska at 2,300 placed third. (These figures include both private-sector and government jobs. Walker’s campaign promise focused only on private sector jobs.) So, at least in terms of the February report, Hulsey’s claim was on point. But the jobs count cited in the article was based on monthly numbers, which are derived from a small sample of employers and often subject to dramatic changes. And Hulsey did not specify a month in his claim. Rather, he expressed it as a current condition. Indeed, by the time Hulsey made his statement the estimates for March were already out, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics had also revised the February figures. Two things in those numbers stand out: -- Wisconsin’s jobs number for February actually worsened with the revision, and the state fell behind North Carolina to the top, er, bottom spot. -- But the March figures said the state added 6,900 jobs in March. As for the No. 2 loser title, that month it belonged to Virginia (-5,000) which followed Pennsylvania (-8,400) By either measure, Hulsey was wrong -- in one case slightly so, in the other wildly so. Our rating Hulsey said Walker ""has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs."" He cherry-picked a report for a single month but spoke of it as a longer-term trend. What’s more, the data was already outdated at the time, so he was wrong when he said it.

Chris Wallace: Hillary Clinton defended Syria's Assad as a 'possible reformer'
","Talk along the lines of Hillary, Hillary, Hillary dominated the network news shows Sunday, as hosts and their guests mulled Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, excerpts from her forthcoming memoir Hard Choices and her potential 2016 presidential bid. Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace countered praise of Clinton from Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., by listing some of Clinton’s troubles as President Barack Obama’s top diplomat. Wallace singled out developments in U.S. relations during Obama’s first term with Russia, Iran and Syria. ""She defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war,"" he said. PunditFact wanted to dig into Wallace’s claim. Clinton’s remarks in early days of Syrian protests Clinton’s comments in question stretch back to the Arab Spring of 2011, when government revolts erupted in Middle Eastern countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Syria, too, spun into chaos with violent clashes between government forces of Assad, who assumed the presidency when his father died in 2000, and protesters. The starting point for what became a bloody civil war came in the remote city of Daraa, where 15 schoolchildren were arrested for spray-painting anti-government graffiti on their school with messages such as ""the people want to topple the regime,"" according to CNN. The military used brutal force to address sit-ins in Damascus and Daraa over the treatment of the jailed protesters, which spurred thousands more Syrians to turn against Assad. Clinton talked about the developments Syria on CBS’ Face the Nation on March 27, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer pressed her on why the U.S. reaction would be different from its response to Libya with air strikes. Syria, Schieffer noted, is no friend of the U.S. as an enemy of Israel and ally of Iran, and Assad’s father had ""killed 25,000 people, at a lick"" in 1982. Clinton said: ""Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don't think that it's yet clear what will occur, what will unfold. ""There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer. ""What's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning, but there's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities than police actions which, frankly, have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see."" So Clinton did refer to Assad as ""a reformer."" But she crafted the line as the opinion of ""members of Congress of both parties,"" not her opinion. And she never defended (as Wallace said) Assad, instead saying in that interview that he ""exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see."" Still, Clinton’s comments were widely reported and criticized. Clinton mentioned ""both parties,"" but the Washington Post’s Fact Checker looked into Clinton’s statement and was unable to find public comments from Republicans along those lines. Two days later, Clinton addressed her comment at a press conference in London. She responded to a Wall Street Journal reporter’s question asking if it is her position that Assad is a reformer. ""I referenced opinions of others,"" Clinton said. ""That was not speaking either for myself or for the Administration."" She said the administration deplored the Syrian crackdown on protesters and that it’s up to Syria’s leaders ""to prove that it can be responsive to the needs of its own people."" Clinton went on. ""We’re troubled by what we hear, but we’re also going to continue to urge that the promise of reform, which has been made over and over again and which you reported on just a few months ago – ‘I’m a reformer, I’m going to reform, and I’ve talked to members of Congress and others about that,’ that we hear from the highest levels of leadership in Syria – will actually be turned into reality,"" she said. ""That’s what we’re waiting and watching for."" As the military crackdown on Syrians persisted and worsened, Obama and Clinton called on Assad to go. Clinton was interviewed in November 2011 for ABC News by Jake Tapper, who noted she ""at one point seemed to have optimism that Assad was a reformer."" Clinton said, ""Well, we had hoped so because there was a lot at stake, we wanted to see an agreement, for example, between Syria and Israel. That was something that people have been working on for 30 years. We heard what Assad said about what he wanted to do for reform. But when it came to it, in the Arab Spring and as people actually demanded some freedom and their rights, he responded, as we have seen, very violently. ""But he’s not going to be able to sustain what is a unfortunately growing armed opposition apparently fueled and maybe led by defectors from his army. It’s probably too late for him to change course, but there needs to be a change at the top of that government, and there needs to be an effort to engage in genuine dialogue and start on the path of reform."" Reaction and context As we researched, we found that talk of the Syrian dictator being a reformer was a popular talking point when he took power. The enthusiasm for Assad began to dissipate with his opposition to President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq and the assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri, which Syrian security officials were faulted for but Assad denied. The Bush White House also said the government was allowing members of terrorist groups to pass through his country to fight the United States in Iraq. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, opposed to the Bush administration’s foreign policy, visited Assad in Syria in 2007. She said, ""We came in friendship, hope, and determined that the road to Damascus is a road to peace."" Then-U.S. Sen. John Kerry also had a hopeful view of Assad engaging the West, saying in a March 16, 2011, appearance as the first big anti-governments protests erupted in Syria that Assad ""has been very generous with me"" and fulfilled Kerry’s diplomatic requests. (Kerry changed his tune on Assad in a March 31, 2011, press release). Another person with ""high hopes"" that were dashed was Middle East historian and Trinity University professor David Lesch, author of The New Lion of Damascus: Bashar al-Assad and modern Syria in 2005 and Syria: The Fall of the House of Assad in 2012. Lesch interviewed Assad in Syria from 2004 to 2008, writing that he probably knows him better than anyone in the West. In the newest book, Lesch says he was initially impressed by the promise that London-educated Assad seemed to bring with his presidency compared with the 30-year repressive regime of his father, Hafez al-Assad. Instead of finally implementing political reforms with the uprising, Assad listened to his military and thought he could put it down, Lesch told us by email. ""I think the Obama administration (and Secretary Clinton) were trying to give Assad some space in which to make the necessary reforms,"" Lesch told PunditFact. But Assad’s regime by then ""had chosen and was committed to forcefully putting down the revolt."" Our ruling Criticizing parts of Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, Wallace said Clinton ""defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war."" Clinton’s original comments in March 2011 were not that straightforward. The statement in question was actually, ""Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer."" Clinton was talking about the beliefs of Congress and didn’t ""defend"" Assad, as Wallace put it, instead saying that the use of force that he deployed was more ""than any of us would want to see."" Still, Clinton’s choice to talk about those members’ opinions of Assad without knocking them down suggests she may have found them credible and bolsters Wallace’s claim. Wallace’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.

Ted Cruz: 'U.S. policy has changed, now we make deals with terrorists'
","On Saturday, May 31, 2014, President Barack Obama announced from the Rose Garden that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl — America’s only prisoner of war — was freed by his Taliban captors after five years in custody. But Bergdahl’s release came at a cost: In return, the United States agreed to turn over five Taliban officials being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,  prison to the country of Qatar. By Sunday, debate over the decision spilled into the political talk shows. White House national security adviser Susan Rice, speaking on ABC’s This Week, said Obama was justified because the U.S. was at war with Bergdahl’s captors even if it wasn’t in the traditional sense. But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took exception to that characterization. ""Ambassador Rice basically said to you, ‘Yes, U.S. policy has changed. Now we make deals with terrorists,’ "" Cruz said. Later, Cruz added: ""The reason why the U.S. has had the policy for decades of not negotiating with terrorists is because once you start doing it, every other terrorist has an incentive to capture more soldiers."" The merits of the swap will continue to undergo scrutiny, but we wanted to look at Cruz’s assertion that Obama deviated from long-standing policy. Presidents throughout history have reiterated that the ""United States does not negotiate with terrorists"" (we found several instances of Obama's State Department saying as much), but do they always hold true to that mantra? Back to the Founding Fathers First, whether the war in Afghanistan is a war in the traditional sense or something much different has clouded legal and military debate since it began. Similarly, whether the Taliban, who have controlled parts of Afghanistan, is a traditional enemy or a terrorist group akin to al-Qaida, remains a contentious debate. (Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel claimed on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday that the United States wasn’t negotiating with terrorists when it secured Bergdahl’s release.) The United States has a long history of negotiating prisoner trades in times of war. But does it have a history of negotiating with terrorists, as some might classify the Taliban? According to experts we spoke with, it does. (For his part, Cruz didn’t respond to a request for comment by our deadline. We'll add their response to this item if we hear from them.) ""There’s little that’s actually new here,"" said Mitchell Reiss, who worked in the State Department under President George W. Bush and served as national security adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. ""It may be new to certain individuals. Whether it’s new or not is not as important as whether it’s sound policy and promotes national security. That’s the ground where there’s a more legitimate debate."" In his book, Negotiating with Evil, Reiss wrote that America actually has a detailed history of negotiating with terrorists and rogue regimes that support terrorist activity. How long? Even the Founding Fathers struck agreements with terrorists of the time: pirates. George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson ""accommodated what today would be viewed as terrorists,"" Reiss wrote. ""They each authorized payment to the Barbary pirates, and the U.S. Senate even ratified a treaty that enshrined the annual provision of naval supplies as ‘protection.’ "" A century later, President Teddy Roosevelt granted demands from the descendants of those pirates to secure the release of captured American resident Ion Perdicaris. Recent history To his credit, Cruz said the policy of not engaging terrorists was decades old, not centuries. But there are more recent examples where, as Reiss wrote, ""American presidents have negotiated with terrorists and rogue regimes to secure the release of hostages, to arrange temporary cease fires and to explore whether a more permanent truce might be possible."" Here’s a few, according to Reiss’ book: After the North Koreans captured the U.S.S. Pueblo in 1968, President Lyndon Johnson apologized for spying as part of negotiations to secure the release of 83 American prisoners. In 1970, President Richard Nixon pressured Israel, Switzerland, West Germany and Britain to release Palestinian prisoners after two airlines were hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. During the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 to 1981, President Jimmy Carter agreed to unfreeze $8 billion in frozen Iranian assets after more than a year of negotiations with the Iranian revolutionaries. In perhaps the most famous swap, after seven Americans were captured in Beirut, Lebanon, President Ronald Reagan agreed to send missiles to Iran in what became known as the Iran-Contra scandal. President Bill Clinton’s administration sat down with Hamas in attempts to negotiate peace with Israel. His administration also worked directly with the Taliban nearly two decades ago on several occasions to see if the group would hand over Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders. Reiss also noted that President George W. Bush engaged in negotiations with Iran and North Korea even after decreeing them part of the ""Axis of Evil."" James Jeffrey, a former ambassador to Iraq under Obama and deputy national security adviser for George W. Bush, agreed that ""there have been many cases of negotiations with terrorists or rogue regimes for the return of Americans."" But he added: ""releasing terrorists in exchange for captives, however, is rare."" One recent example came in 2010, when the United States released Shia cleric Qais al-Khazali to the militia group Asaib al-Haq in exchange for Peter Moore, a private British contractor, and the bodies of Moore’s security officers. Asaib al-Haq is a militia group allegedly funded by Iran and headed by al-Khazali and staged and executed several attacks in Iraq that resulted in the deaths of U.S. soldiers. Our ruling Cruz said Obama changed ""decades"" of policy of not negotiating with terrorists when he brokered the deal that brought Bergdahl home. Even though presidents and officials often say ""we do not negotiate with terrorists,"" it has not proven to be a hard-and-fast rule. Obama’s actions so far do not signal a change in policy, but rather the latest in a long line of exceptions presidents have made throughout recent history.

Is Milwaukee ranked second in the U.S. for number of children recovered from sex trafficking?
","More than two years before U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore described Milwaukee as one of the worst places in the country for child sex trafficking, there were reasons to think it might be so.   In the space of two weeks in early 2012, two Milwaukee pimps were sentenced to long prison terms. One, who had painted the words ""Ho Hauler"" on his van and shipped child prostitutes to Chicago and elsewhere to sell sex, got 30 years behind bars. The other, who gained fame in movies and on television as ""Pimp Snooky,"" had prostituted scores of women and girls in cities from Milwaukee to Las Vegas for at least 16 years, according to federal prosecutors. He got 20 years. Still, it was startling on May 20, 2014 when Moore spoke on the House floor in favor of a bill that aims to help underage victims of prostitution. The House passed the measure later that day. ""I’m embarrassed and I regret to report that my own hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has become known as a sex-trafficking hub for both children and adults,"" said Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat. ""As a matter of fact, the FBI reports that Milwaukee has the second-highest in the nation for recovered youth. But trafficking is now common in communities all across the country, not just urban, but suburban, rural, from coast to coast."" Second in the nation is something we wanted to check. Sex trafficking crackdown In July 2013, 10 months before Moore made her claim, the FBI announced what it described as its seventh and largest-ever child sex trafficking enforcement action. Over three days and across 76 cities, officers arrested 153 pimps and identified more than 105 children as having been sexually exploited. Milwaukee tied with Detroit for the second-highest number of children recovered, as the FBI puts it, with 10. San Francisco was first, with 12. It turns out that’s what Moore was referring to when she made her second-in-the-nation claim, according to her spokeswoman, Staci Cox. ""When reading her statement on the House floor, the Congresswoman inadvertently did not specify the context in which the statistic was based,"" Cox told us. The results of one enforcement action, of course, do not establish Milwaukee as having the nation's second-highest child sex trafficking recoveries. So, the question remains: Just how serious is child sex trafficking in Milwaukee? In May 2013, a Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission study, which was based on contacts youths had with Milwaukee police, estimated that 77 youths had been ""sex trafficked"" during the two-year period ending on Aug. 1, 2012. Those youths were in addition to those who were involved in sex trafficking cases that were investigated or prosecuted by federal authorities during the period. The study defined trafficked as minors who were ""suspected or known to have been recruited, encouraged, or obtained for the purpose of a commercial sex act or sexually explicit performance."" They were primarily African-American girls ages 12 to 17 who lived on the city's north side. But how does that level of sex trafficking compare with other cities? No one knows. There is no reliable ranking of cities in terms of child sex trafficking or, using the statistic Moore cited, the number of children recovered from sex trafficking. That’s according to the Polaris Project, which runs the National Human Resource Center Trafficking Hotline for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire. ""We have not heard of any systematic effort to count these cases and much of the effort to track this down has turned to dead ends,"" Finkelhor told us. Finkelhor noted that, even if there were more police contacts in Milwaukee than in other cities regarding child sex trafficking, it could mean the problem is worse in Milwaukee -- or it could simply mean that Milwaukee police are more proactive. As for the children being recovered from sex trafficking, it’s ""very misleading,"" Finkelhour told us. ""Police do a variety of things when they encounter youth engaged in selling sex -- from arresting them, to making referrals to agencies, to bringing them back to their families -- but most of the professionals in the field agree that large numbers of youth return to the streets or to commercial sex activity,"" Finkelhor said. ""The whole narrative on this topic is filled with problems."" Our rating Moore said ""Milwaukee has the second-highest"" number of children recovered from sex trafficking. Pimp prosecutions, FBI crackdowns and a local study have established that child sex trafficking is a serious problem in Milwaukee. But Moore acknowledges she didn’t state her claim accurately. There simply is no comprehensive data available comparing cities on the extent of the problem, nor on the number of children who are recovered from the trafficking.

Clay Pell says Rhode Island has highest dropout rate in New England, at 23 percent
","In Clay Pell’s education plan, ""Seizing the Future: A World-Class Education For All,"" and in a May 5 email to his subscriber list, the Democratic candidate for governor states that Rhode Island has the highest high school dropout rate in New England, at 23 percent. There are two parts to this claim. We’ll start with whether the dropout rate is really 23 percent. The ""Seizing the Future"" education plan, which Pell released April 30, 2014, attributes the 23 percent dropout figure to a report issued April 28 by GradNation, a campaign of the nonprofit America’s Promise Alliance that strives to lower the nation’s high school dropout rate. We checked out the report, ""Building a GradNation: Progress and Challenge in Ending the High School Dropout Epidemic (2014)."" It gives Rhode Island’s four-year ""Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate"" at 77 percent, for 2011-2012. That’s the lowest graduation rate in New England, according to the report. Comparatively, Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts have a graduation rate of 85 percent; New Hampshire is at 86 percent, and Vermont at 88 percent. You may ask, what the heck is an adjusted cohort graduation rate? And why should we care? A cohort is a group of subjects who share an event during a particular time span. The adjusted cohort graduation rate refers to the percentage of students in a given group who successfully finish high school in four years with a diploma, accounting for transfers in and out of the system. It’s a relatively new measure all states are required to use. But we couldn’t find Pell’s 23 percent dropout figure in the GradNation report. We asked Pell’s campaign manager, Devin T. Driscoll, if they arrived at that figure by subtracting the 77 percent graduation rate from 100 percent. Driscoll said yes. But guess what, class! The answer is not that simple; and the Pell folks made a basic mistake. ""The dropout rate is not an inverse of the graduation rate,"" says Marie T. Stetser, of the National Center for Education Statistics of the U.S. Department of Education. Stetser directed us to a report she co-authored, ""Public High School Four-Year On-Time Graduation Rates and Event Dropout Rates: School Years 2010-11 and 2011-2012."" The GradNation report uses these same NCES statistics. ""Counts of students who have not graduated on time with a regular high school diploma do include dropouts, but also include those who will earn a regular diploma in more than four years, and those who have or will earn alternative credentials,"" the report states. For example, students who have stayed back one or more grades in high school but eventually graduate, and students in GED programs would be included. Also, students who have simultaneously enrolled in high school and secondary school may take more than four years to graduate, and will receive a high school diploma and an associate’s degree when they finish. So how far off is the Pell campaign’s 23-percent dropout estimate? Roughly by half, according to the Rhode Island Department of Education. The state’s average high school dropout rate was 11.9 percent for 2011-12, says spokesman Elliot Krieger. He explains that the remainder at that time were in either GED programs (3.2 percent) or still in school (7.8 percent), adding up to the 23 percent figure the Pell campaign came up with. ""The key point is that each year a certain number or percentage of students graduate – but the remaining students are not all dropouts …,"" he said. Krieger notes that the state’s high school graduation rate for 2012-2013 rose three points, to 80 percent. NCES is currently working on its 2013 statistics, so we don’t know how that compares with other states. What about the second part of Pell’s claim, that Rhode Island’s dropout rate is the highest in New England? On that question, he seems to be on track. The data is a little difficult to follow, so bear with us. The NCES measures the high school ""event dropout rate,"" which is the percentage of students who were enrolled in 9-12th grade the previous year who did not return to school or graduate. It excludes those, for example, who did not return because they were temporarily absent for suspension or illness, or who transferred to another district. It is a different population than the four-year cohort. By that measure, Rhode Island, at 4.2 percent for 2011-2012, had the highest event dropout rate in New England. Connecticut’s event dropout rate was 2.1 percent; Maine: 3.2 percent; Mass.: 2.5; New Hampshire: 1.3; and Vermont: 2.5. In 2010-2011, Rhode Island’s event dropout rate was 5.2 - and still the leader of the pack. Driscoll, Pell’s campaign manager, said the campaign did more research after being contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, and recognized that the shortcut it took to find a dropout rate was in error. ""It seems fair to say that, in our efforts to draw attention to the critical problem of Rhode Island’s alarming high school graduation and dropout rates, we did not use the standard calculation of the dropout percentage,"" Driscoll wrote in an email. ""But the fact remains: Rhode Island does have the highest dropout rate in New England (and the Northeast)."" In the future, he said, the campaign plans to use the NCES statistics when talking about dropout rates. Our ruling Clay Pell said, ""Rhode Island has the highest dropout rate in New England at twenty-three percent."" The campaign made an error in calculating the dropout rate, which, according to the Rhode Island Department of Education was actually 11.9 percent in 2011-12, the latest year for which figures were available. But the state did have the highest ""event dropout rate"" in New England, according to federal statistics. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

Texas Right to Life exaggerates on claim of 'faceless hospital panel' determining treatment
","UPDATE: On May 29, 2014, we rated as Mostly False a claim by Texas Right to Life that in Texas, ""faceless"" panels can judge whether to continue a person's care. But we initially misreported a word in the group's statement. Texas Right to Life's ad referred to ""life-sustaining"" care -- not ""life-saving"" care, which is what we  wrote. Our correction of our error leads us to conclude the group's claim accurately tracked a portion of the law. Consequently, we are changing our rating to Half True. An ad targeting a Republican state senator opened with what sounded like a heartbeat and a wailing siren in the background as the narrator read words displayed on screen: ""If your loved one is in the hospital, you may be shocked to learn that a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious."" A moment later, the narrator said: ""This actually happens to families across Texas."" Death panels, Texas style? Group cites 1999 law In 2013, state Sen. Bob Deuell, a Greenville physician, unsuccessfully proposed changes in a 1999 law that had created a process for situations when there is no advance directive from a patient regarding an end-of-life decision and there’s disagreement between the primary physician and a patient's family over continuing treatment. Texas Right to Life, which describes itself as the state’s oldest ""pro-life"" group, opposed Deuell’s proposal and also created the ad, which it publicized in a press release. Deuell ultimately lost his 2014 runoff for the GOP nomination to challenger Bob Hall. Asked the basis of the ad claim, spokeswoman Melissa Conway emailed a statement from John Seago, Texas Right to Life’s legislative director, referring to Section 166.046 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, which states that a hospital review committee may align with a primary physician on cutting off or continuing a patient’s life-sustaining care. If a panel agrees on ending such care, the patient or person responsible for their care has 10 days to acquire another physician or move to another facility before the hospital is no longer obligated to provide care, the law says, though a court shall extend the 10-day period if it finds a reasonable expectation a physician or facility that will honor the patient's desires will be found with the added time. The law defines ""life-sustaining"" treatment as treatment that, based on reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient without which the patient will die. ""The term includes both life-sustaining medications and artificial life support, such as mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and artificial nutrition and hydration,"" the law says. By email, Seago pointed out the law is silent on who should serve on a review committee nor, he wrote, does it require participants to be identified to the affected family. Seago also said Texas Right to Life, which has advocated for patients, has attended review meetings in which not all committee members were revealed. Seago urged us to reach out to lawyers including Jerri Lynn Ward of Lakeway, near Austin, who said by email that none of her clients--among them, Andrea Clark, whose 2006 dying drew news coverage--knew the names of committee members before review proceedings began. ""I would call that being faceless,"" Ward said. Other views To our inquiries, others including lawyers, physicians and advocacy groups for hospitals and doctors told us the ad claim misrepresents how the Texas law has been carried out. The Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems, said the claim misrepresents elements of such extremely rare hospital committee reviews. By telephone, Carrie Kroll agreed that ""at the end of the day, the hospital can say no, we’re not going to provide care."" But review panels aren’t faceless, Kroll said, in that individuals on the panels meet with the families or guardians challenging a physician’s judgment. Also, Kroll said, most hospitals provide patient ""liaisons"" to guide families and loved ones through the reviews. The Senate-approved version of Deuell’s failed 2013 proposal mandated such liaisons during reviews, according to a Texas Medical Association summary emailed to us by association spokesman Steve Levine. On another front, Kroll said, ""we’re not talking about life-saving care. In most of these instances, it’s a situation where the person is dying. They are not going to walk out of that hospital even if they are conscious. They’re in the end of their life--maybe minutes, days, hours… But they’re not somebody who has gone in for a knee replacement and the hospital is just tired of dealing with them and is going to kill them, as an example,"" Kroll said. Hospital association spokesman Lance Lunsford, asked how often review panels must resolve such disputes, emailed us a summary of a 2012 association survey of 212 hospitals and hospital systems. In 2011, according to the summary, the review process was initiated 21 times at 16 hospitals or systems. The group’s survey for 2010 identified a single review that year, the summary says, and its survey for 2009 indicated the process was initiated twice in two systems. Kroll put us in touch with Jeanine Graf, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, who told us she has served on that hospital’s bioethics committee for at least 15 years. Once a year or every other year, Graf said by phone, the committee decides a child’s care should end because more care would be futile. Otherwise, Graf said, ""we’re just prolonging their deaths."" ""It’s not a faceless committee,"" Graf said. ""The family comes to the committee,"" which consists of nurses, physicians, religious officials and an ethicist, ""and pleads their case. There’s no anonymity. We identify ourselves."" Also, Graf said, she has never seen a patient in such circumstances who was aware of their surroundings. ""They are often the sickest patients who are expected to die no matter what we do,"" she said. After a panel decides more care is unwarranted, usually after a meeting that runs several hours, the family is given at least 10 business days to act, Graf said. ""It very rarely comes to that 10-day clock,"" Graf said. ""The person may die in the interim."" For the medical association, Levine similarly challenged the description of the review committees as ""faceless"" and said the ""rarely used dispute resolution process is used only for terminally or irreversibly ill patients."" Levine suggested we consult attorney Thomas Mayo, an associate professor of law at Southern Methodist University. By email, Mayo told us that since 1998, he’s been part of a statewide working group that regularly discusses the relevant law. By telephone, Mayo suggested the law is more complex than the ad indicates. ""Is it possible a conscious person could be denied life-sustaining treatment because of the actions of a committee? I guess… in the sense the ethics committee has to be consulted and if it is consulted and agrees with the (primary) doctor, then this doctor after a period of time is not obligated to provide that treatment."" Mayo later emailed, calling the statement ""mostly wrong. There is no ‘faceless hospital panel,’ ... and consciousness isn’t the issue. Although the statute doesn’t specify that"" the ""patient should be diagnosed with a terminal or"" an ""irreversible condition in order for this law to apply, that does appear to be the case as a matter of medical practice within the applicable standard of care."" Mayo urged us to contact Robert L. Fine, a Dallas palliative-care physician who told us he’s advised legislators about the law on behalf of his employer, the Baylor Health Care System, and the state medical and hospital associations. By email, Fine expressed skepticism about any physician or review committee employing the law to judge the condition of anyone not terminally or irreversibly ill. ""I don’t know of a single hospital ethics committee that would let that happen,"" Fine said. Affected patients are ""not going to be cured,"" Fine said. ""When these cases come up… it’s always when a patient is  terminal or irreversibly ill; typically"" when they’re suffering; often when there is ""division within the family""; and only when an attending physician says further treatment is inappropriate, Fine said, often because the nursing staff is urging that decision. Fine also said: ""I can’t promise you there’s not some rogue hospital or committee out there. But the question would be why isn’t the family taking that"" result ""public?"" Group stands by claim Next, we ran what the medical community was telling us past Seago, who replied by email that nothing  disproved what the law allows to occur, including the ""faceless"" panels. Seago pointed out, too, the law doesn’t limit review panels to considering cases involving terminally ill patients. ""Our ad was about the law and instead of looking at the law you are trusting the testimony of doctors,"" Seago emailed. Our ruling Texas Right to Life said in Texas, ""a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious."" This claim accurately tracks a portion of the law and we see how one could construe this scenario. The law doesn't specify how hospital review panels should be composed or run. But doctors and hospitals insist the law has been carried out in ways not acknowledged here. For starters, the rarely convened review panels aren’t faceless; committee members are reportedly introduced at the reviews. Also, consciousness is not an element of  the law. Finally, the law permits courts to add to the 10 days provided for families to find an alternate facility, which the ad doesn’t mention. We rate this claim, which is partly accurate but leaves out important details, as Half True.

"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Carlos Curbelo']","
Does the House tax bill make more changes permanent than Senate bill does?
","As the House and Senate were finishing the details of a joint version of the Republican-backed tax bill, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., was defending the House’s version as friendlier to Americans of modest means. In an appearance on Miami’s WPLG-TV on Dec. 10, Curbelo was asked about the pattern of Americans being projected to gain from the GOP tax bills in the first few years after it’s passed, but then paying more in taxes closer to 10 years after passage. Curbelo responded to the question by touting the advantages of the House-passed version compared with the Senate-passed version. ""The House bill does have a lot more permanent relief for middle income and even lower income families long term, permanently,"" Curbelo replied. ""The Senate bill, their budget rules are different so they had to put these gimmicks in the bill, frankly. We, in conference, are insisting on the House provisions to make the middle-class relief permanent."" We wondered whether Curbelo was correct that he House bill has ""a lot more permanent relief for middle-income and even lower-income families"" than the Senate bill does. Curbelo is correct that in the House’s version of the tax bill, several key provisions -- its replacement of seven existing tax brackets with four, the raising of the standard deduction, and an expanded child tax credit -- are permanent. All of these provisions in the Senate bill expire after 2025. There’s only one significant provision in the House bill that would expire -- a family tax credit worth $300 credit for the taxpayer, spouse, and non-child dependents. That provision sunsets in 2022 under the House bill. (A similar, $500 credit in the Senate bill would expire in 2025.) The pattern of eventual tax increases in the Senate bill is stronger than from the House bill, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found. By 2027, every income group below $100,000 would see an increase, on average. So Curbelo has a point that several key House provisions are written to be permanent, unlike the equivalent provisions of the Senate bill. It’s important to note, however, that sunsetting provisions aren’t the only cause of later tax increases. Other factors the following provisions of the House bill (and also the Senate bill): • The amount of the child credit is not indexed for inflation. By contrast, the provision it effectively replaces -- the personal exemption -- is indexed for inflation. • The rate brackets would grow more slowly from year to year because they would be adjusted by a less generous measure of inflation. • The earned income tax credit -- a refundable credit for low-income Americans who are employed -- would also increase more slowly because of the same change to the inflation measurement. Curbelo said the House tax bill has ""a lot more permanent relief for middle-income and even lower-income families."" That’s generally the case: Only one provision of the House bill that’s likely to be claimed by Americans of modest incomes, a family tax credit, would expire within the first decade, whereas many key provisions in the Senate bill would sunset early. However, it’s worth noting that the expiration of provisions is not the only reason that taxpayers are projected to pay more closer to 10 years after the bill’s passage. Another one, unmentioned by Curbelo, is changed treatment of inflation adjustments in the House bill. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/dec/14/carlos-curbelo/does-house-tax-bill-make-more-changes-permanent-se/

It's fake news that Texas morgue employee cremated while taking a nap
","In case you need an incentive to stay awake on the job, a nap cost a Texas morgue employee his life, claims a fake news story. ""Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap,"" states the headline on worldnewsdailyreport.com, a website that posts a disclaimer stating that it is satirical. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This fake article has been circulating on Facebook at least since March and a more recent version copies the story but changes the location to Macomb, Mich. The story has gained enough attention that Texas police have had to publicly refute it. The article stated that an employee of the Jefferson County morgue, Henri Paul Johnson, decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for 16 hours straight. ""While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory,"" stated the website. Jenna Davis, a morgue employee, claimed that the coworker who caused the accidental cremation was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body. The Beaumont Police opened a criminal investigation, the website stated. Actually, the police department did no such thing. Carol Riley, public information officer for the police department, told PolitiFact that her department was inundated with phone calls about the story when it first appeared months ago. ""People were sharing it on our Facebook messenger, they were calling our local media, calling to see if it had any teeth to it,"" Riley said. The story is ""absolutely fake news,"" she said. ""It did not happen."" Helga Briscoe, administrator for Forensic Medical that does autopsies for 14 counties including Jefferson County, told PolitiFact that the privately-run facility doesn’t even do cremations. A search of the photos in Google Images shows that the photos were lifted from other news stories. The photo of the alleged Jenna Davis, the morgue coworker, is actually Dr. Lisa Funte, a  forensic pathologist at the morgue photographed by the Beaumont Enterprise newspaper in 2012. But the photo of the wide-eyed smiling man who was allegedly cremated was totally unrelated to the morgue: it matches the image of a DeSoto County constable arrested for DUI in 2015, Snopes found. A worldnewsdailyreport.com headline stated, ""morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap."" The Beaumont police department confirmed that this allegation is fiction.

Bernie Sanders wrongly says Donald Trump never apologized for Access Hollywood tape
","President Donald Trump’s sexually explicit remarks on the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced during the 2016 election have received fresh scrutiny as the country reckons with a tidal wave of high-profile sexual assault allegations.

Rauner distorts Dems' message on Illinois income tax
","Speaking to reporters after a speech in Chicago on Dec. 4, Gov. Bruce Rauner predicted a re-election victory in next year’s gubernatorial race and warned of dire tax consequences if any of the three main Democratic candidates for the post win. ""You know what will happen? We will get a massive income tax hike. The candidates controlled by (House Speaker Michael) Madigan, all of them have said, ‘The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike,’ "" Rauner said, referring to Democratic candidates Daniel Biss, Chris Kennedy and JB Pritzker. All three have stated they support replacing Illinois’ flat-rate income tax with a system in which those with higher incomes pay higher rates. .@GovRauner: ""The candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, ‘The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.'"" https://t.co/hfE82jW574 #twill #ilgov   Rauner went on to list examples of other states — New Jersey, New York, Minnesota and California — where people earning $40,000 a year pay more in state income tax than the 4.95 percent rate now applied to all Illinois taxpayers. ""They will sock the middle class with a tax hike that Madigan and his puppets want and it will destroy Illinois,"" Rauner said, noting that the progressive tax movement would be deceptively labeled as a ""tax the rich"" effort. We strongly support a progressive income tax in our state to ensure that Illinois public schools are fully funded, so that every child gets a quality education no matter where they live.   Rauner’s statement contained a generous dollop of campaign vitriol — the Madigan-as-puppet-master theme is a running theme for Rauner — but it also brings up what is sure to be another key issue in the governor’s race. Would a Democratic victory for governor next year bring about a graduated-rate income tax for Illinois? And would that be tantamount to a ""massive income tax hike?"" Rauner’s statement implies a Democratic governor could muscle through a change that would replace Illinois’ current flat-rate income tax system with a multi-rate system. That overlooks the fact that the single-rate income tax is enshrined in the Illinois Constitution of 1970, establishing a high hurdle for enacting any change. ""A tax on or measured by income shall be at a non-graduated rate,"" begins Article IX, Section 3 of the constitution. To impose a progressive tax system lawmakers would have to amend the constitution. That requires approval of three-fifths majorities in both the Illinois House and Senate to put the issue on a general election ballot. Then voters must approve the amendment by ""either three-fifths of those voting on the question or a majority of those voting in
the election,"" according to Article XIV, Section 2 of the constitution. From 2013 to 2017, Democrats held three-fifths majorities in both the House and Senate yet still could not muster votes to back ballot referendums on a limited graduated income tax plan to impose higher rates on the very rich. Since then, Democrats have lost their three-fifths margin in the House, though they control the chamber. In theory that could change in the next election, but to push through a tax referendum in the House before then would require a handful of Republican votes. And that’s not likely to happen. The governor, incidentally, is irrelevant in this process. There is no veto power over constitutional amendments. If approved by voters, they become law. Under the constitution, the only path to get a tax referendum before voters is through the Legislature. Citizen-led petition drives for such a purpose are not allowed. Rauner also equates a graduated tax system to a ""massive tax increase"" on the middle class. But he tries to make the point with cherry-picked examples.   A single filer earning $40,000 annually in California pays 6 percent. It’s 5.525 percent in New Jersey, 6.45 percent in New York and 7.05 percent in Minnesota, according to 2017 tax data compiled by The Tax Foundation. Those tax rates are all higher than the 4.95 percent now imposed on Illinois taxpayers. But there are other graduated income tax states Rauner failed to cite where the numbers would undermine his premise.   Individuals earning $40,000 a year pay 3.36 percent under Arizona’s graduated-rate system. In Maryland, those who earn between $3,000 and $100,000 pay 4.75 percent. North Dakota taxes $40,000 at 2.04 percent, and its highest bracket imposes only a 2.9 percent rates on incomes over $416,700. Ohio’s top rate, 4.997 percent, applies to income of more than $210,600. Those in Ohio earning $40,000 pay 2.969 percent. Even Connecticut’s 5-percent tax on $40,000 is very close to Illinois’ 4.95 percent. (Connecticut’s top bracket, 6.99 percent, kicks in at $500,000 for individual filers.) While Democratic candidates say they support a graduated-rate system, they have been talking in the abstract and none have proposed specific rates. Given the difficulty of amending the constitution, lawmakers would be loath to enshrine tax and income brackets into it, and any rate-setting would fall to the legislature after a constitutional change. The realpolitik of that hasn’t stopped Rauner from predicting how it would all play out. ""They say, ‘Let’s tax the rich,’"" Rauner said in the same Dec. 4 press conference. ""Well, first of all, you watch business owners flood out of this state when that happens and our unemployment rate is going to go through the roof."" The last big push for a comprehensive progressive tax amendment came during the 2013-14 legislative session and it died without receiving a vote in either the House or Senate. The proposal contained no income or tax bracket figures. In 2012, the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning fiscal watchdog, created a progressive tax model in which taxpayers with incomes of less than $100,000 — 94 percent of those in Illinois — would pay the same or less than the 5 percent tax rate in effect at that time. The model nonetheless projected a 5.8 percent increase in revenue from the income tax because of higher rates on the wealthiest Illinoisans. CTBA Budget Director Bobby Otter said that model would likely hold up today because the current Illinois tax rate, 4.95 percent, is close to that used to make the projection. Raising taxes is never easy, but procedurally it is easier to change rates than change the constitution. Indeed, the Illinois tax rate has bounced around in recent years, from 5 percent in 2010 to 3.75 percent in 2015 to 4.95 percent starting last summer. When we contacted Rauner’s campaign to ask whether the Republican believed a Democratic successor would try to raise the latest rate, spokesman Justin Giorgio referred us to a recent column in The News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana. That column focused on reporting by Crain’s Chicago business about a Nov. 20 visit by Pritzker to its editorial board. During that visit, the Democrat mentioned a progressive income tax and potentially new tax revenue for the state if it legalized marijuana. Pritzker was not quoted as directly calling for a tax hike: Some will come from amending the Illinois Constitution to allow a progressive income tax, something that would require a referendum vote, likely in 2020. Pritzker said he could not estimate how much that would pull in, but he projected the state would net another $300 million to $700 million by legalizing and taxing marijuana.

Would that be enough to meet all the needs while (economic) growth accelerates?

""No. But it depends on how you prioritize,"" Pritzker replied. After the meeting, a Pritzker campaign spokeswoman issued a statement to clarify that ""J.B. does not believe we should raise taxes on middle-class families, period."" In sum, Pritzker backs a graduated tax amendment, thinks it will reap more revenue for the state and acknowledges that still may not be sufficient to meet needs. But his spokeswoman suggests only the wealthy should be asked to pay more. (The article cited by the Rauner campaign discussed only Pritzker, though Biss and Kennedy have endorsed the progressive tax concept.) Rauner said Democratic gubernatorial ""candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, ‘The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.'"" Rauner’s ""controlled by Madigan"" tag is aimed at the three highest-profile candidates, Pritzker, Kennedy and Biss, and suggests without proof they are all acting at the behest of the powerful House Speaker.  All three have advocated for a change from a flat income tax rate to a graduated-rate system in which tax rates are higher for those with higher incomes. Despite Rauner’s examples, a progressive income tax system does not necessarily mean a tax increase for the middle class. And there is no evidence that anyone in Illinois politics has a blueprint for income and tax brackets under a potential Illinois system. The closest such blueprint, from 2012, had the vast majority of voters paying the same or lower taxes. Nor is that decision up to the governor. It would take three-fifths of the General Assembly and a majority of voters to bring a progressive tax to reality. Recent history does not point favorably to this happening without significant Democratic gains in the Legislature. Pritzker was squishy when discussing immediate revenue needs with Crain’s, but Rauner cites the Crain’s article as Pritzker’s solid endorsement of a ""massive tax increase.""  We rate Rauner’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/dec/14/bruce-rauner/rauner-distorts-dems-message-illinois-income-tax/

Open FEMA case remains, but Hartzler exaggerates amount
","Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, extolled the virtues of her FEMA Relief Improvement Act on Oct. 30 after it was signed into law by President Donald Trump. The bill’s goal is to increase the reliability of services by the Federal Emergency Management Agency after disasters. In a news release, Hartzler gave an example of the problems the bill attempted to prevent: ""In Missouri, there are still (FEMA) cases pending from floods that occurred in 2013."" Relentless rain ravaged several Missouri counties in August 2013. But are there really still pending cases from four years ago? The disaster The flooding Hartzler is referring to took place from Aug. 2, 2013, to Aug. 14, 2013. Residents across Missouri were hit by pounding rain, wind and flooding. According to the National Weather Service, rainfall levels reached 8 to 10 inches. Three people died and Interstate 44 was closed in both directions between Rolla and Jerome, which is in Phelps County. On Sept. 6, 2013, former President Barack Obama declared a major disaster in Missouri. This made public assistance available for emergency work and repair of facilities damaged by severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding in 18 counties: Barry, Camden, Cedar, Dade, Dallas, Laclede, Maries, McDonald, Miller, Osage, Ozark, Phelps, Pulaski, Shannon, Taney, Texas, Webster and Wright. FEMA’s summary damage assessment noted that 381 residences were impacted by the storms: 37 were destroyed, 91 had major damage, 134 had minor damage and 119 were affected. Four years later, $18.5 million has been distributed and all of FEMA’s claims have been resolved except for one county: Pulaski. Pulaski County, the outlier Summoned by Gov. Jay Nixon, FEMA began preparing project worksheets to determine the cost of restoring the county’s damaged water crossings to pre-disaster conditions. The work was done between October 2013 and April 2014. FEMA’s Public Assistance Program helps with response and recovery following a disaster. It specifically assists with debris removal, emergency protective measures and permanent restoration of infrastructure. According to Michael Cappannari, FEMA’s external affairs director, Pulaski County appealed several projects originally denied by FEMA. Following the flooding in 2013, FEMA awarded the county $5.9 million. Pulaski County applied for additional funding again in September of that year. At the time, Pulaski County officials said at least 90 percent of roads were damaged by flooding. While other counties experienced 8 to 10 inches of rain, Pulaski saw 15. To begin the process for additional funding, Pulaski County was expected to submit design plans to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for reconstruction of county bridges. The corps denied the plans because they did not meet permitting requirements. So Pulaski County altered its requests. The Corps of Engineers was happy with the changes, but FEMA decided the plans cost too much. From October 2015 to June 2016, Pulaski County appealed the case. FEMA asked for more information and three alternatives to the plans, among other things. That didn’t work, either. FEMA found that Pulaski County had skewed its hydrological and hydraulic analysis and didn’t provide less costly alternatives. Appeal denied. The second appeal began in March 2017. In November 2017, FEMA granted the appeal for $4.4 million in federal share to the state of Missouri to assist Pulaski County in completing physical work such as bridge and road repair. While Pulaski County received additional funding in November, FEMA will continue the case until all physical repair work is completed. ""As you can see, projects from 2013 are still being worked on at this time,"" said Steve Walsh, Hartzler’s press secretary. Our ruling Hartzler said: ""In Missouri, there are still (FEMA) cases pending from floods that occurred in 2013."" While most counties in Missouri have had their resolutions to their claims involving flooding in August 2013, Pulaski County has had a long battle with FEMA over funding in the last four years. The approval for the last round of funds went out after Hartzler’s news release at the end of October. Pulaski County is awaiting physical repairs, and FEMA does not close cases until physical repairs are completed. Although what Hartzler said is true, there is only one case that was still pending when she made her comment. Hartzler’s statement sounds as though there are multiple cases that FEMA had not responded to. Her statement is accurate but needs additional information or clarification. So we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/dec/14/vicky-hartzler/open-fema-case-remains-hartzler-exaggerates-amount/

No, undocumented immigrants were not caught voting in Alabama Senate election
","Democrats used another dirty trick in an attempt to defeat Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore by having undocumented immigrants vote. At least that’s what an article circulating on Facebook claims. ""Update: van full of illegals caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations,"" states a headline on nofakenews.online Dec. 12. Moore lost to Democrat Doug Jones in a special election to replace Jeff Sessions on Dec. 12. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. Facebook users flagged the nofakenews.online post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. The article is deliberately false and comes from a website that claims to be satire. The article states that law enforcement stopped a vehicle containing 13 Hispanic men who had voted at Santa Recto Middle School. (We found no such actual school in Alabama.) The same men were spotted at multiple cities in Alabama and the State Election Integrity Board arrested 10 of them. All of the men but one were undocumented immigrants, the article says. ""Investigators determined that the men were responsible for 'dozens of fake votes' around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak,"" states the article. However, there is no State Election Integrity Board in Alabama, John C. Bennett, a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State told PolitiFact.

Claim that 99.8% of Americans wouldn't get a tax cut under the GOP tax plan fails
","Kelda Helen Roys picked an unusual way to become the latest of the major Democrats to join the 2018 race for governor of Wisconsin. She announced her candidacy on a private Facebook page. Roys, a former Wisconsin state representative from Madison, undoubtedly will be training her sights on GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term. But on Dec. 1, 2017, six days before her Facebook announcement, Roys used social media in a different way to criticize tax reform efforts by President Donald Trump and other Republicans. She posted this tweet: Never let the GOP tell you again that they support low taxes. They don’t—unless you’re already a billionaire or a massive corporation. #TaxBill (Attached was the graphic shown above.) Many have criticized the proposed GOP tax cuts as favoring the richest. But 99.8 percent of Americans wouldn’t get any tax cut? That’s not correct. Not close. The estate tax Roys told us she was referring to an April 2017 Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. That post blasted Trump’s proposal to repeal the estate tax, and it included the figures about the Waltons, the Koch brothers and Trump’s family that were part of Roys’ tweet. Sanders’ post also said ""99.8 percent of Americans would not benefit by one nickel under Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax."" So, Sanders was clearly referring to only one tax reform provision: repeal of the estate tax. We’ve rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., that what some call the ""death tax"" was paid by only ""two out of every 1,000 people"" in 2016. That’s the equivalent of 99.8 percent. The tax applies only if an estate’s value exceeds $5.45 million, or $10.9 million, if there is a surviving spouse, and is paid by only about 5,000 estates per year. But Roys’ tweet was making a general reference to Trump’s tax plan -- with no indication that the numbers referred only to the estate tax. And its bottom-line claim was that ""under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans"" get ""not one nickel"" in tax cuts. Roys told us she now realizes that what she posted did not make it clear she was referring only to the estate tax. Indeed, a reader could only assume her claim was about the tax plan generally, with the ""#TaxBill"" reference she used and the ""Trump’s new tax plan"" in the headline. As for the House and Senate tax reform plans now in play, with Republicans hoping to finalize a plan for Trump’s signature before the end of 2017, several tax-cut provisions benefit the rich specifically. But the tax cuts would be widespread: Both plans would lower individual income tax rates for the middle class, and most people in lower-income households would see cuts, as well. Our rating Roys said that ""under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans"" get ""not one nickel"" in tax cuts. Roys said she was referring to the Republican proposal to repeal the federal estate tax, which would only benefit the wealthiest and does not apply to 99.8 percent of Americans. But her tweet made no reference to the estate tax. It gave the impression she was referring to Trump’s overall tax plan. That plan has its critics, including those who believe it gives too much to the rich. Nevertheless, as has been widely reported, the plan offers widespread tax cuts. We rate Roys’ statement Pants on Fire.

Have wages failed to go up on Donald Trump's watch?
","On the heels of a generally favorable jobs report, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized Republicans for failing to boost wages for American workers. ""November’s jobs report reveals that hard-working Americans still aren’t getting the bigger paychecks they deserve,"" Pelosi said in a statement that she tweeted out. ""Even with full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have still failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families."" November’s #JobsReport reveals that even with full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have still failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families. https://t.co/vnEhG7yhSz Her talking point is a stretch: Federal data shows wage growth since President Donald Trump took office in January, though one of the two measurements shows the gains barely outpacing inflation. One of the two key statistics for judging this statement is median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 years and over. This information is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is available quarterly. For the last quarter fully under President Barack Obama -- the fourth quarter of 2016 -- this amount stood at $348. After Trump took office, it rose to $350 in the first quarter of 2017, rose again to $354 in the second quarter, and remained the same at $354 in the third and most recent quarter. The $6 increase may not seem like much, but it's still almost a 2 percent increase above the rate of inflation over the course of just three quarters, and that runs counter to the point Pelosi was trying to make. Here’s the full chart, which shows that earnings continued to rise after Trump took office (the three most recent quarters shaded in red). ""Generally speaking, earnings increase during economic expansions,"" said Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's Analytics. ""There can be some debate over how much wage growth a healthy economy should have, and who is responsible for the growth, but it can’t be debated that earnings increased under President Obama and they have continued to increase under President Trump."" We also looked for wage growth in another BLS statistic, namely average hourly earnings for all private-sector employees. This statistic shows a slow but steady rise in wages, from $25.98 in December 2016 to $26.55 in November. (The chart below shows the final year under Obama in blue and the months so far under Trump in red): There’s a reason that these two statistics can look a little different. The time period studied is different (hourly vs. weekly), as is the typical case studied (median vs. average). This statistic is also released every month rather than every quarter. The most important difference, however, is that the BLS does not adjust the hourly earnings data for inflation. When adjusted for inflation, the earnings gains on Trump’s watch shrink, though they do not disappear. When Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, ran an inflation adjustment for us, he found that in 2017, average hourly earnings rose by 0.05 percent. That’s an increase, but it’s barely outpacing inflation. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they cited a statement by Gary Cohn, the White House’s own National Economic Council director, who said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that ""we're still not growing wages in this country."" They also said that in January 2016, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., tweeted that ""wages are stagnant"" even though at the time, they were growing at least as fast as they are today. Our ruling Pelosi said, ""Even with full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have still failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families."" The two best statistics for judging this assertion both show wage growth. One of them, however, shows growth that’s barely above inflation, meaning that Americans wouldn’t necessarily keep any more of their income in their pocket.

Rosenstein oversaw the Russia inquiry at the Justice Department after Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed in March to recuse himself from all proceedings related to the Russia investigation. In May, Rosenstein wrote a memo recommending that Trump fire former FBI director James Comey because of how he handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. When Trump fired Comey, the White House made public Rosenstein’s memo. But recently, Trump has been critical of the Justice Department.

Story falsely suggests a Colgate toothpaste banned by FDA
","A headline warns consumers about triclosan, an ingredient in some consumer products: ""If you are using this toothpaste .... throw it away immediately!"" Facebook users flagged the Nov. 28 story on Shared This as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article could leave readers with an inaccurate picture about actions the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took with respect to triclosan, but it also contains some factual information. Shared This wrote that the FDA issued a warning ""this week"" that it will ban triclosan, a common antibacterial agent used in soaps, detergents, toys, cosmetics, and toothpaste. ""Apparently, the chemical poses a high-degree of health risks and side effects. Colgate Total is just one of many products that list triclosan as an active ingredient,"" wrote Shared This. The website included an image of the word ""recall"" and a photo of Colgate toothpaste showing that it contains triclosan. That could give readers the false impression that the FDA banned triclosan in toothpaste -- and that’s not the case. Here’s what actually happened: Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the FDA to take action related to triclosan. In September 2016 the FDA issued a new rule banning the use of triclosan in antibacterial soaps. ""That rule was specific to consumer hand washes,"" Sandy Walsh, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A. told PolitiFact. That means the ban doesn’t apply to toothpaste. Colgate Total Toothpaste was approved in 1997 as a toothpaste containing fluoride and triclosan, which was shown to be effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis. ""Based on the scientific evidence, the balance of benefit and risk has been shown to be favorable for this product,"" Walsh said. The New York Times reported in September 2016 that triclosan remained in toothpaste because Colgate Total convinced the FDA that the benefit of triclosan outweighed the risks. Colgate Total is the only toothpaste in the United States that contains triclosan. A spokesman for Colgate-Palmolive, Thomas DiPiazza, told the New York Times that Colgate’s product had a far more rigorous safety review than other toothpastes. When the company sought approval to use triclosan in 1997, it conducted a comprehensive evaluation of human safety. The original FDA submission for Colgate Total included more than 100 toxicology studies. DiPiazza directed PolitiFact to a statement on Colgate’s website which cited a 2013 review of 30 studies by Cochrane Oral Health Group. The review concluded that there were benefits including reduction in plaque, gingivitis and bleeding gums in using a triclosan/copolymer fluoride toothpaste when compared with one without the ingredient. ""There was no evidence of any harmful effects associated with the use of triclosan/copolymer toothpastes in studies up to three years in length,"" Cochrane reported. But a debate about triclosan has continued. Several months after the FDA’s September 2016 rule was published, an article by 200 scientists and medical professionals published by Environmental Health Perspectives raised multiple concerns about triclosan. The authors concluded that the ingredient has detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, overuse may contribute to antibiotic/antimicrobial resistance, and that potential implications for human reproduction and development merit further study. The authors recommended that people avoid the use of triclosan except if there is an ""evidence based health benefit (e.g., physician-prescribed toothpaste for treating gum disease) and there is adequate evidence demonstrating they are safe."" Colgate-Palmolive and the FDA however continue to stand by the use of triclosan in Colgate Total toothpaste. ""It has been approved as safe and effective through the U.S. FDA rigorous New Drug Application process,"" DiPiazza said. Shared This is a website that posts articles about health, beauty, news and other topics. We sent a message to the website on Facebook and did not get a reply. Our ruling Shared This stated that the FDA issued a ban on triclosan, which is an ingredient in soap, toothpaste and other products.

Convicted mining CEO and GOP candidate says official papers reveal 'Obama's deadliest cover-up'
","Don Blankenship, the convicted executive in one of the country’s deadliest mining explosions, is running for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia, and his first television ad aims to clear his name. ""Obama’s deadliest cover-up has been uncovered by MSHA’s own documents,"" the ad said. ""Documents which say the MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) Upper Big Branch internal report was fixed."" Blankenship, running as a Republican, spent a year in jail for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found that under his leadership as CEO of Massey Energy, the company systematically refused to take steps that would have prevented a deadly combination of methane gas and coal dust that left 29 West Virginia miners dead in 2010. He has always insisted that the fault lies with federal mining regulators who forced the company, he said, to use a defective ventilation system. No investigation, and there have been several, has reached that conclusion. ""The mine operation, not MSHA, caused the explosion,"" said one independent report. Multiple inquiries found that Massey Energy knew there was risk that methane gas could build up in an active mining location in the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, W. Va. The company had also been warned that it needed to do more to reduce the levels of combustible coal dust there. The company maintained two sets of records of conditions in the mine. The one it shared with government inspectors listed fewer problems than the one it kept for internal purposes. In one tragic moment, dull blades used to cut free coal created enough heat to ignite gas and coal dust. The explosion that followed killed 29 people. But Blankenship’s ad presents a series of statements to suggest foul play by the government. After saying an internal report was fixed, the ad shows an image of an internal MHSA document that says ""MSHA was responsible for a defective ventilation plan at UBB.""  The ad goes on to say ""documents were shredded,"" and that ""government corruption is pandemic."" If, as the ad says, the government’s own documents prove that the internal review was ""fixed,"" then those documents ought to be available. Greg Thomas, spokesman for the Blankenship campaign, told us this ad, along with another, refers to internal government emails the campaign received ""in the last couple of weeks from a very reliable source."" ""At this juncture, we’re not going to release the emails,"" Thomas said. When we asked why the campaign wouldn’t release the emails, Thomas at first said he didn’t know, but later explained that ""we want everybody (in the government) to come out and stick to their story."" Thomas said the emails might be shared at some point, and when they were, they would show how the government covered up its role in the mine disaster. A search of the government’s internal report, an independent assessment of that report, and the West Virginia governor’s independent panel investigation produced nothing to support Blankenship’s statement. We plugged the key quotes into the Nexis database of news reports. Again, nothing. Davitt McAteer, former head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, led the special investigation team created by West Virginia’s governor. McAteer told us that Blankenship is ""incorrect."" ""I would have known whether the agency report was fixed,"" McAteer said. ""It was not."" The agency report criticized agency staff, saying they ""did not follow established Agency policies and procedures."" Inspectors failed to spot deficiencies in some of the mine operations and didn’t look closely enough at company records of problems that had gone uncorrected. McAteer’s group took a harder line on the Mine Safety and Health Administration. ""Despite MSHA’s considerable authority and resources, its collective knowledge and experience, the disaster at the Upper Big Branch mine is proof positive that the agency failed its duty as the watchdog for coal miners,"" the report said. Another review by the U.S. Labor Department, which oversees the mine safety agency, echoed that, saying ""if MSHA had engaged in timely enforcement of the Mine Act and applicable standards and regulations, it would have lessened the chances of -- and possibly could have prevented -- the UBB explosion."" None of this points to a whitewash of the government regulator’s contributing role in the accident. However, every investigation put Massey Energy at the center of the conditions that produced the disaster. ""Massey, through its subsidiary Performance Coal Company, violated numerous, widely-recognized safety standards and failed to prevent or correct numerous hazards that ultimately caused the catastrophic explosion,"" the government’s accident report said. ""The evidence accumulated during the investigation demonstrates that PCC/Massey promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, including practices calculated to allow it to conduct mining operations in violation of the law."" Blankenship produced an ad that said the Obama administration’s internal review of the Mine Safety and Health Administration’s role in a deadly mine explosion was ""fixed."" The ad said the government’s own documents revealed ""Obama’s deadliest cover-up."" Blankenship’s spokesman claimed to have emails that proved the point, but said the campaign would not share them. An extensive review of multiple government reports, plus a search through a database of thousands of news articles produced no supporting facts. The head of an independent investigation said he had come across nothing that pointed to a fix. In fact, his group’s report along with one other sharply criticized government regulators for failing to crack down on the abuses of Blankenship’s company. There is no substance to this claim and the campaign did not provide anything that would back it up. We rate it Pants on Fire.

Donald Trump wrong that black homeownership rate is at a record high
","When President Donald Trump noticed some African-American support at a recent rally in Pensacola, Fla., he offered a statistic about black homeownership. ""Look at these guys, ‘Blacks for Trump,’ "" Trump said, quoting their sign, on Dec. 8, 2017. ""I love you. I love you. By the way, now that you bring it up, black homeownership just hit the highest level it has ever been in the history of our country. Congratulations."" He brought up the claim in the company of other boasts about enhanced 401(k) accounts, consumer confidence and job growth since the start of the year. But black home ownership hasn’t hit a new record high. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) According to Census Bureau data, black homeownership peaked in 2004 at 49.1 percent. It has fallen incrementally almost every year since. In fact, the rate is now about one-sixth lower than it was at its peak. African-Americans are less than two-thirds as likely as non-Hispanic whites to own a home, and the most recent rate for African-Americans, 41.6 percent in 2016, ranks behind each of the other four major groups -- non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and Native Americans. In fact, in 2005 the Hispanic homeownership rate overtook that of African-Americans, with the two groups diverging ever since. The only positive news is that the quarterly figures for 2017 have been a little higher than they were in 2016. In 2016, the quarterly black homeownership rate fluctuated between 41.3 percent and 41.7 percent. In 2017, the rates in the first three quarters were 42.7 percent, 42.3 percent, and 42 percent, respectively. But that’s still below the annual levels from 2004 to 2014. So why has the African-American homeownership rate fallen for the past dozen years? More than anything, it’s been the Great Recession and its aftermath. ""Blacks were hit disproportionately hard by the foreclosure crisis, in part because they were heavily targeted for subprime and other risky mortgages,"" said Alex Schwartz, a professor at the Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at the New School. Those types of mortgages were at the center of the housing crisis that helped cause the recession. As for the continued decline, Schwartz said, ""banks and other mortgage lenders adopted much stricter underwriting standards after the crisis, making it far more difficult to qualify for mortgage credit. Since black and Hispanic households tend to have lower incomes and much less wealth than other groups, they are even less likely than before the crisis to purchase homes."" Meanwhile, rising inequality and slow income growth for the bottom 80 percent of the income spectrum have made it more difficult for families to accumulate the savings necessary to make the downpayment to purchase a home. ""Our research shows that homeownership was not a conduit to wealth accumulation either in the housing boom or in the Great Recession,"" said Sandee Newman, who directs the Center on Housing, Neighborhoods and Communities at Johns Hopkins University. Our ruling Trump said, ""Black homeownership just hit the highest level it has ever been in the history of our country."" In reality, the black homeownership rate peaked in 2004 and has fallen almost every year since, due in large part to the Great Recession and its aftermath.

Fake news about Washington Post and Roy Moore accuser stems from disputed Twitter account

The allegations have become the hot topic in his Dec. 12 race against Democrat Doug Jones. Facebook users flagged the Evening World story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article is based on a since-deleted twitter account and is fake. The website based the claim that a Post reporter offered money to a woman by citing the Twitter account of @umpire43 who identified himself as Doug Lewis #MAGA. ""A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????,"" Lewis tweeted Nov. 10. One of the Post reporters who wrote about Moore was Beth Reinhard. Lewis also tweeted that the family friend had photographs of the reporter and had recorded the telephone conversation. He directed her to bring that information to her local district attorney’s office.   Lewis wrote that ""Jean"" provided evidence to the Etowah County District Attorney in Alabama. Multiple news outlets including The Daily Beast, the Post and Snopes reported in November that @umpire43 had since deleted his account. The account user had a history of perpetuating hoaxes. The Daily Beast reported that the author of the account had repeatedly invented stories about his own background claiming to be a Navy veteran, a pollster, a baseball umpire, an expert on rigged voting machines, an American consulate worker in Calgary and ""a beleaguered soul who needed time off after the 9/11 attacks when he saw Muslims ‘dancing on rooftops.’ "" The Daily Beast contacted all of his alleged employers and affiliates and found that he hadn’t held any of the positions. The Twitter account launched in 2011 peaked at around 18,000 followers by the time that the Gateway Pundit reported on his claim against the Post. Tweets from @umpire43 had drawn attention from InfoWars and other right-wing sources. The Gateway Pundit added a an update at the bottom of its story about @umpire43’s tweets: ""We have not been able to confirm these allegations by Doug Lewis.""

Chain email wrongly says Putin gave fiery anti-Islam speech
","A fake speech with explosive language attributed to Russian President Vladimir Putin is being circulated via email chains. The email said that in a speech addressed to the Duma, the Russian legislative body, Putin said, ""Russia does not need Muslim minorities,"" and that minorities, specifically Muslims, living in Russia should accommodate to Russian culture or leave. The email said Putin received a five minute standing ovation at the end of his speech. Here’s what the email claimed was the text of Putin’s speech: ""In Russia, (we) live like Russians.  Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, it should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws.  If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslims, then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law. Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'.  We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian culture.  We better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland, and France, if we are to survive as a nation.  The Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take over Russia. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture, or the primitive ways of Sharia Law and Muslims. When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the Russian national interest first, observing that the Muslim Minorities are not Russians.’ ... Snopes fact-checked a similar email in 2015, finding it false; however, this fake news is still spreading. and we wanted to address it. Snopes found a speech that Putin gave to the Board of the Federal Migration Service in January 2012 in which Putin talked about the integration of immigrants into Russian society and respect for Russian culture. But it did not have nearly as aggressive a tone that the language in the email has. Putin’s actual words were far more moderate, though he did support requiring immigrants to learn Russian. ""On the whole, the adaptation of guest workers is a separate and comprehensive issue. We must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society, learn Russian and, of course, respect our culture and traditions and abide by Russian law. In this regard, I believe that the decision to make learning the Russian language compulsory and administer exams is well grounded,"" said Putin in the speech to the Board of Federal Migration Service. We failed to find any other of Putin’s public remarks that matched up with the chain email.  Email chains can be misleading, but this fake speech did not happen, nor did the five-minute standing ovation. We rate it as Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2017/dec/11/chain-email/chain-email-putin-says-minorities-should-adopt-rus/

No, JB Pritzker did not release more tax information than Bruce Rauner
","We recently rated ""True"" a statement from Democratic gubernatorial candidate Daniel Biss that attacked the tax transparency of rivals JB Pritzker and Chris Kennedy. Biss said the other candidates had released no more information about their personal finances than did Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner--and that wasn’t much at all. 
The issue quickly flared up again as Rauner said the income Pritzker reported on his tax returns was too puny for a man whose net worth has been estimated at more than $3 billion. The governor’s campaign ran an ad questioning whether Pritzker was an ""incompetent investor"" or ""stashing his cash overseas"" and ""refusing to pay his fair share"" of taxes. Rauner offered no proof for either contention, though it is worth noting that he was attacked with similar hazy claims during his 2014 election campaign that suggested he dodged taxes by routing  investments through a Cayman Islands tax haven.   As reported in the Chicago Sun-Times, Pritzker fired back: ""It’s laughable that Bruce Rauner is complaining about my taxes,"" Pritzker said after a Democratic gubernatorial candidates’ forum at the historic Second Presbyterian Church on the South Side. ""I released way more information than Bruce Rauner has, and it’s important to recognize that unlike Bruce Rauner, who, yeah, he paid taxes, but you know how he made his money? By cutting jobs. By buying companies and firing people."" Setting aside the campaign rhetoric of Pritzker’s response, we were struck by his statement that he had released ""way more information"" about his taxes than Rauner. That’s not what we found last week, so we took another look. Rauner, a wealthy private equity investor, has made a practice of releasing 1040 tax forms that give just a hazy outline of his annual earnings and taxes paid. He released three years of tax returns -- for 2010, 2011 and 2012 -- when he first filed to run for governor in 2013 and has continued to release his 1040s every year since then. Illinois law requires no tax disclosure from candidates, but until Rauner it had been common for candidates for the state’s top office to voluntarily disclose the entire contents of their tax returns in a gesture of transparency. For wealthier candidates like Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy, the two-page 1040 is just a tiny piece of their returns. The more telling information is contained in what are likely dozens or hundreds of pages of schedules, forms and supporting documents attached to 1040s that detail how investment and capital gains income was derived, business losses or gains, and deductions for charitable donations. ""I don't know that 1040s are really all that useful without the rest of the supporting materials,"" Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, told us for last week’s fact-check. ""I suppose that they're better than nothing, except that I think you encourage further disclosures of just the 1040s."" Rauner has never released those supporting materials, nor did Pritzker or Kennedy when they disclosed the contents of recent 1040s in late November. All three candidates pitch themselves as accomplished businessmen with shrewd financial acumen, so it is significant that none are willing to release the documentation that could help voters better assess the accuracy of such claims. By contrast, Biss, a state senator whose annual income is mostly derived from his legislative salary, did make a complete tax disclosure. That’s why he sarcastically taunted Pritzker and Kennedy in a recent tweet about ""pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard"" when it came to tax transparency. These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard. Even Romney released his full tax returns. -DB Just as Rauner did as a first-time candidate in 2013, Pritzker released three years’ worth of 1040 forms when he filed his nominating petitions. They showed adjusted gross income of $14,950,446 in 2016, $9,974,627 in 2015, and $3,137,655 in 2014. His effective tax rates were 27.7 percent (2016), 24.3 percent (2015) and 37.3 percent (2014). Accompanying the state and federal 1040 forms was a brief press release listing the income and tax rates paid, the amounts in federal and state taxes paid by trusts from which Pritzker benefits ($128.97 million and $24.95 million, respectively) and charitable giving by Pritzker himself and by his foundation ($15.3 million and $53.8 million, respectively). Rauner also has regularly issued statements on charitable giving with his returns. When we asked what constituted ""way more"" on Pritzker’s returns, the Pritzker campaign pointed to a statement he also released about taxes paid by trusts of which he is a beneficiary. Pritzker is descended from a family of wealthy entrepreneurs who launched the Hyatt Hotel chain, and his fortune is derived in part from inheritances passed down through trusts. Pritzker did not release the trust tax forms themselves, however, so there is no way to independently verify the accuracy of that disclosure.   That said, holding out the trust numbers as the evidence for more fulsome disclosure than Rauner is a curious tactic. As Rauner often points out, his fortune was self-made, he inherited no money and receives no income from trusts. In short, Rauner has made no trust disclosures because he says he has no trusts. Pritzker said he ""released way more information than Bruce Rauner has"" on income taxes. But Pritzker’s three years’ worth of 1040 state and federal cover sheets are identical to the sort of disclosure Rauner released as a candidate four years ago and what he has issued each year since. Pritzker did release information about taxes paid by trusts that benefit him, but construing that as exceeding Rauner’s disclosure is something of a straw-man argument. Rauner says he has no trusts to report income from. We rate Pritzker’s statement False.  ",/factchecks/2017/dec/11/jb-pritzker/no-jb-pritzker-did-not-release-more-tax-informatio/
