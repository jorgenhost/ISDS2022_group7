Is China spying on you through Zoom? Charlie Kirk overstates report's findings
","Efforts to minimize the spread of the coronavirus through social distancing have brought video conferencing platforms more business and, with that, more scrutiny. Zoom and other providers have experienced breakneck growth as people around the world get used to working from home and communicating with family and friends online.  For Zoom, that growth has also revealed security vulnerabilities and a relationship with China that had at least one conservative pundit calling for a boycott. ""Stop using Zoom immediately,"" said Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in a tweet. ""Any tech company that aligns with China must be ex-communicated from our country. The Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizens.""  Stop using Zoom immediately.Any tech company that aligns with China must be ex-communicated from our countryThe Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizensRT! https://t.co/nylH3ltbgI   Kirk’s tweet cited an April 3 report from researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. The report spotlighted security problems using Zoom, but it didn’t look at whether China was using the tech platform ""as a way to spy on our citizens."" ""If (Kirk) is describing our findings as providing proof that the Chinese government is definitively spying on Zoom meetings, then that is inaccurate,"" said Bill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Citizen Lab and co-author of the report on Zoom’s encryption. A spokesperson for Zoom told us the company, which is based in San Jose, California, is not aware of any efforts by China to use its platform for espionage. The FBI and Defense Department declined to comment. In their report, Marczak and co-author John Scott-Railton examined the encryption scheme protecting meetings hosted on Zoom.  They found that Zoom ""uses non-industry-standard cryptographic techniques with identifiable weaknesses"" to safeguard its conferences. The app’s encryption keys — long, random strings of characters used to protect encoded data — were sometimes routed through servers in China, even when all meeting participants are outside of China. They wrote that this flaw is ""potentially concerning, given that Zoom may be legally obligated to disclose these keys to authorities in China,"" where they said the company employs roughly 700 people. The company’s website says it has more than 2,000 employees worldwide. A spokesperson for Kirk cited these findings, news reports about them and China’s history of surveillance and of spying on U.S. companies as evidence in support of Kirk’s claim. ""It’s well established that China is engaged in massive amounts of domestic surveillance and has established massive controls on any data that is routed to servers hosted in China — which is exactly what Zoom has done,"" the spokesperson said. The Citizen Lab report did conclude that Zoom is ""not suited for secrets."" It said governments, businesses concerned about cybercrime and espionage, health care providers, and activists, lawyers and journalists working on sensitive topics should all be especially careful. But Kirk’s tweet missed another conclusion that Zoom users may find reassuring. ""For those using Zoom to keep in touch with friends, hold social events, or organize courses or lectures that they might otherwise hold in a public or semi-public venue, our findings should not necessarily be concerning,"" Marczak and Scott-Railton wrote.  The Citizen Lab’s findings amplified concerns that have dogged Zoom as it has gained popularity.  Online trolls have learned to invade meetings and project graphic material using Zoom's screen-sharing feature, for example. The practice, known as ""Zoombombing,"" has led some school districts, including in New York City, to ban the platform for online learning. Zoom has since pledged to beef up its security. In a response to the Citizen Lab’s report, CEO Eric Yuan said the routing of encryption keys through China was a ""misstep"" that resulted from Zoom’s ""urgency to come to the aid of people around the world"" as the coronavirus spread.  The routing problem has since been corrected, Yuan said, adding that it was never an issue for the separate version of Zoom available to government customers. The company has also clarified its encryption practices, and Yuan said in another blog post that Zoom has paused extra features for 90 days so its engineers can focus on security fixes. ""Zoom has robust cybersecurity protection and a number of layered safeguards and built-in protections to help prevent unwanted meeting access,"" a company spokesperson told us. James Andrew Lewis, director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said concerns about Zoom strike him as ""overstated."" ""Zoom has development offices in China,"" he said. ""But its backroom functions are performed by an American cloud service provider using a very secure service located here in the U.S."" More people working from home is a ""goldmine for intel agencies"" that China will likely exploit, he said, but other technology companies may also face similar threats. The FBI recently issued a warning about cyber attacks that could come from the increased use of videoconferencing. Marczak and Scott-Railton wrote that the problems they identified make Zoom ""a clear target to reasonably well-resourced nation state attackers,"" including China.  But they never said China is spying on American citizens through Zoom, as Kirk claimed.  ""We found that the Chinese government could conduct this sort of surveillance, but our methodology cannot produce a finding one way or the other about whether this surveillance is actually occurring,"" Marczak told PolitiFact. He said their goal was to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited, not to catch bad actors. ""China is capable of conducting this kind of surveillance,"" he said. ""The question is whether they are actually doing it. If they are doing it, ordinary people are unlikely to be targets."" Other cybersecurity experts agreed that China would not likely target the average American. ""I would suspect that if Chinese intel agencies are taking advantage of Zoom vulnerabilities, and I assume they are, they are targeting government users and business users,"" said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.  In past Chinese hacks involving information on ordinary American citizens — including attacks on Marriott and Equifax — the hackers were after big data sets that could be used to spot patterns in people who might be willing to spy on China’s behalf, Segal said. ""You might be able to pull those things out of Zoom calls, but it would take much more work and be less reliable,"" he said. It’s also unlikely that China would be monitoring every U.S.-based Zoom call because of the money and manpower needed to do so, experts told us.  ""In practice, the cost to do this should be high enough that China wouldn't want to use this as a mass surveillance tool, but rather a tool for targeted surveillance,"" Marczak said. Kirk said, ""The Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizens."" The claim is based on a report from researchers at the University of Toronto. But one of the researchers told us that while they identified security issues with Zoom, whether China has exploited the platform for espionage was not something they considered. China is likely capable of using Zoom for spying, experts told us. It’s not implausible that the country has tried using it to target governments, businesses and others with sensitive information.  We don’t know whether China has done so. But there’s no proof that it has. A spokesperson for Zoom said the company isn’t aware of efforts by China to tap into meetings on the platform, and experts said most ordinary Americans shouldn’t have any reason to worry.

Since-deleted tweet claimed email ballots remain an option. Not true
","Amid the pandemonium of an off-again, on-again Wisconsin election in the middle of a pandemic, claims have been circulating online that voters can have a ballot emailed to them instead of waiting in line. Posts across Facebook and Twitter echoed this claim.  Perhaps most notably, so did a tweet from Ben Wikler, chairman of the state Democratic Party. Here’s what he sent out Monday, April 6, 2020: ""If you have requested an absentee ballot and it hasn’t arrived yet — like thousands of other Wisconsinites — then you call your clerk and as for a ballot to be emailed to you. You then find a safe way to print it out, fill it in and drop it off. Clerk then copies it to official paper."" That’s not true. And Wikler has since deleted the tweet. Here are the details: Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney said the deadline for emailed ballots was Friday, April 3, 2020 — four days before the election. Until that cut-off date, voters could request a mail or email ballot by email, fax or through the commission’s website. The only way for residents to get a ballot after that — even those who requested an absentee ballot but didn’t receive it — is by going to their local polling place in person on Election Day, April 7, 2020. Wikler did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Magney said the commission was aware of the tweet. ""He was wrong,"" Magney said. And later in the day, so was state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who made a nearly identical claim to a reporter while working as an election inspector. His staff later admitted the error. Spokeswoman Kit Beyer confirmed Vos was mistaken, saying the elections commission ""had guidance recently on that fact, which staff hadn’t briefed him on.""

NC Republican says Pelosi tried to 'block' voter ID, absentee ballot laws
","Since the coronavirus outbreak, Washington officials have offered plans to help businesses and unemployed Americans. One of those plans included proposed changes to election laws, prompting pushback from some Republicans in North Carolina. David Lewis, a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, tweeted about a proposal that he says came from Democratic U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""Pelosi tried to block voter ID/absentee ballot protections,"" Lewis tweeted in capital letters, accusing her of ""playing games."" In a second tweet, he added that Pelosi’s bill includes ""a Voter ID ban and removal of absentee ballot protections."" Voter ID and absentee ballot laws have been top-of-mind for North Carolina politicians since 2018. Through a referendum in 2018, North Carolina voters approved the idea of requiring a photo ID at the polls. But the law crafted by lawmakers is on hold because of a legal challenge. Absentee ballots, meanwhile, were at the heart of North Carolina’s voided 9th Congressional District race that year. The North Carolina elections board scrapped the contest results after witnesses testified to tampering with absentee ballots. (A special election was held in 2019, when Republican Dan Bishop beat Democrat Dan McCready.) So is Lewis right about the bill he cited? Would that bill ""block voter ID"" and ""absentee ballot protections?"" His tweet is vague and could give the impression that North Carolina’s photo ID law has been enacted, even though it’s on hold. But Lewis has a point that the bill he cited would weaken North Carolina’s existing absentee ballot laws. Lewis referenced a bill known as the ""Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act."" The bill that doesn’t list Pelosi as a sponsor. But she endorsed the bill and advocated for it when it was introduced on March 23.  Now let’s look at what the bill says. North Carolina election laws require someone voting absentee-by-mail to mark their ballots in the presence of two witnesses, or just one person who's a Notary Public.  The U.S. House bill would prohibit states from requiring those signatures on absentee ballots. (You can see this proposal under the ""Promoting ability of voters to vote by mail"" section of the bill, which Lewis referenced in his tweet.) North Carolina allows ""only the voter or the voter’s near relative"" to return an absentee ballot to the local board of elections. ""Near relative"" is defined as a voter’s spouse, brother, sister, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, mother-in-law, father-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, stepparent, or stepchild. The bill supported by Pelosi would allow ""any person to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot"" so long as that person doesn’t receive compensation ""based on the number of ballots"" they collect and return (page 830 of the bill).  The bill also says states ""may not put any limit on how many voted and sealed absentee ballots any designated person can return."" Collecting large quantities of ballots is sometimes referred to as ""ballot harvesting"" and is what happened in North Carolina’s tainted 2018 Congressional election. So Lewis is correct to say that Pelosi’s bill would eliminate some of North Carolina’s existing absentee ballot requirements. This is where Lewis’s tweets need a lot more context.  Someone reading them might get the impression that the House bill blocks voter ID laws across the country, including in-person voter ID laws. Lewis said through a spokesman that he was only referring to voter ID as it relates to absentee ballots. But that’s not clear from his tweets. His second tweet -- that the bill includes ""a Voter ID ban and removal of absentee ballot protections"" -- suggests he could be talking about two separate issues. North Carolina’s photo law is on hold, as we already mentioned. And the bill doesn’t appear to nullify in-person voter ID laws. ""I don’t see any restriction in this bill on any state identification law for voting in person,"" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor, associate dean for research and operator of the ""All about redistricting"" website. He added that he hadn’t thoroughly read all 1,400 pages of the bill. As for absentee voting, the bill would make ""no-excuse needed"" absentee-by-mail available across the country. While some states require voters to have an excuse to qualify for absentee voting, North Carolina already allows voters to request an absentee ballot for any reason. (So that part of the bill wouldn’t change anything in NC.) The bill may, however, touch a part of North Carolina’s law that requires absentee voters to present ID. It says states ""may not"" require ""any form of identification as a condition of obtaining the absentee ballot."" (page 821 of the bill) North Carolina law requires people requesting an absentee ballot to provide their driver’s license number -- or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That requirement is unique to North Carolina and only a handful of other states, Levitt said. ""In most states with an ID requirement for voting in-person and also no-excuse absentee ballots, the states undercut their own laws, which was one of the arguments advocates repeatedly made in support of the fact that the in-person ID laws were more security theater than security,"" Levitt said. That said, the bill wouldn’t leave states without a mode of verifying voters’ identities. It would require voters to sign their ballots. And would allow states to investigate the vote if the signature on the ballot didn’t match the signature on-file with the local elections office. ""The signature verification, albeit imperfect, is a means of establishing identity, and more rigorously enforced in the election context than the system we use daily for commercial transactions,"" Levitt said. Lewis tweeted that ""Pelosi tried to block voter ID/absentee ballot protections.""  The tweet is vague and could give the false impression that the bill supported by Pelosi and House Democrats nullifies an existing in-person voter ID law. That’s not the case. However, Lewis is correct that the bill would strip away some of North Carolina’s existing absentee ballot laws.

Donald Trump wrong about COVID-19 testing on airplanes, trains
","President Donald Trump said he was considering whether to stop domestic travel between U.S. hotspots for COVID-19. As he explained his reluctance to harm the transportation industry, Trump inaccurately said airline and train passengers were already being tested for the disease. ""We have to get our country back, we have to start moving again, we have to start working again,"" Trump said April 1. ""Now, they’re doing tests on airlines — very strong tests — for getting on, getting off. They’re doing tests on trains — getting on, getting off. But when you start closing up entire transportation systems and then opening them up, that’s a very tough thing to do."" We asked the White House for evidence and did not get a response. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us it is not testing passengers at airports or train stations, a spokesperson told PolitiFact. It’s possible that Trump was referring to screening of passengers, which is happening at 13 airports for international flights. That isn’t the same as testing. Screening someone for symptoms can flag someone who could potentially have COVID-19, but it’s not as definitive as a test. It is impractical to test passengers at airports and train stations, given the slow delivery of most results and limited availability for people with symptoms. The CDC screening includes a temperature and symptoms check for travelers coming from foreign countries.  Airport screenings for some international travel began earlier in the crisis. The CDC announced Jan. 17 it would screen passengers from Wuhan, China, for COVID-19 at the San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports. The screenings have expanded to include 13 airports, including Miami, Chicago, Detroit and Boston. They primarily affect American citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate families who have recently been in China, Iran, or certain European countries.  Travelers returning from international travel are advised to stay home for 14 days, monitor their health, and practice social distancing. Some states have implemented their own screening practices, with mixed results. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered screening (not testing) at Florida airports for passengers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Shortly after, some passengers told the Sun Sentinel that their temperatures were not taken and they saw no visible signs of screening.  In Broward County, officials are collecting forms from passengers on certain flights from the New York tri-state area, said Greg Meyer, a spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Representatives for airports in Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit said passengers were not taking tests as they board or exit airplanes. ""Screening may occur in airports, but testing does not,"" said Florence Brown, a spokeswoman for the airport in Philadelphia.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents are screening international travelers for visible signs of illness, such as coughing or having difficulty breathing, Brown said. International passengers from countries affected by COVID-19 may also receive a printed guide from the CDC. We contacted spokespersons for multiple airlines and did not get a response. We did not hear back from Amtrak by deadline. Trump said, ""Now, they’re doing tests on airlines — very strong tests — for getting on, getting off.  They’re doing tests on trains — getting on, getting off.""

Big boost in unemployment checks, but no pay hike for workers

It didn’t take long for this claim to appear on Facebook: ""Unemployment now pays $24/hour even if your wages were lower. Why don’t ‘essential’ people forced to still work get $24 too?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The stimulus does not specify unemployment payments at a rate equivalent to $24 per hour — though, as a result of the $600 temporary boost, some unemployed people will receive weekly unemployment payments at that rate.  Furthermore, the stimulus does not boost pay for people still on the job, including essential workers who earn less than $24 per hour. President Donald Trump signed the stimulus bill — known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act — into law on March 27, 2020.  The law includes what is known as the federal pandemic unemployment compensation provision. The temporary provision adds a bonus of $600 per week, for up to four months, to what you would already receive in state-based unemployment payments.  Self-employed people, independent contractors and gig economy workers, who were not previously eligible for standard unemployment benefits, are now eligible through Dec. 31, 2020. The same law offers the same $600 per week of federal add-on assistance for out-of-work self-employed, contractor, gig and part-time workers as it does for full-time workers. The bonuses began April 5, 2020 and are available through July 31, 2020. Here’s how Graham came up with $24 per hour, or at least close to it, according to his Senate staff: In South Carolina, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit is $326. If you add the $600 federal bonus, that’s $926 per week. For a 40-hour work week, that comes to $23.15 per hour. (In some interviews about the $600 bonus, Graham said that would amount to $23 per hour.) So that’s pretty close to $24 per hour. But again, it’s only for the unemployed in South Carolina receiving the maximum weekly unemployment payment. Regular unemployment benefits vary by state. South Carolina’s maximum is on the lower end, according to the latest Congressional Research Service report, from July 2019. The highest maximum, $1,192 per week, is in Massachusetts, which is among 11 states that add benefits for unemployed people with dependents. Nationally, regular unemployment covers half your wages, up to a cap of about $450 in regular earnings per week, Heidi Shierholz, former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor, told PolitiFact. So, a person who normally earns $450 would receive $225 in regular unemployment benefits, plus the $600 bonus, or $825 per week  — more than their regular pay. That’s about $21 per hour. Viewed another way, as of January 2020, the average weekly unemployment benefit was $385 per week, Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact. Add $600 to that and that comes to more than $24 per hour. But that’s based on an average, not a national standard. Burtless noted that unemployment payments vary not only by state, but also within a state from one recipient to another, because the benefit depends on each worker’s earnings record. Asked by Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity why the higher unemployment payments aren’t capped at what a recipient made on the job, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said state unemployment offices have 35-year-old computer systems, and a more complicated unemployment aid formula would have taken months to set up. ""The simplest way was, and the fairest way was, $600 per person,"" Mnuchin said. ""In certain states, that might be a little bit too much money; in other states, it’s less money. It’s not a perfect system, but the president’s objective was to make sure you get money in people’s hands."" The main complaint of the Facebook claim, though, seemed to be that people who are still employed but earning less than $24 per hour aren’t getting bonuses to boost them to that level. Most adults will receive a one-time stimulus payment of $1,200, which is expected to occur in April 2020. But that goes to the unemployed as well as the employed. In short, there is no additional pay from this stimulus package for people who remain employed. That includes people in essential jobs such as grocery store clerks, delivery workers, food and medical supply-chain workers, and lower-paid hospital staff. An earlier federal stimulus law — the Families First Coronavirus Response Act — gave all American businesses with fewer than 500 employees funds to provide employees with paid leave, either for the employee’s own health needs or to care for family members. That will help many workers who previously didn’t get paid sick leave from their employer. The post says, ""Unemployment now pays $24/hour, even if your wages were lower. Why don’t ‘essential’ people forced to still work get $24, too?"" This is an oversimplification. Other than a one-time stimulus payment of $1,200 that will go to most employed and unemployed adults, the latest  federal stimulus law responding to the coronavirus outbreak does not contain any additional provision to boost the pay of workers still employed, including those in essential jobs earning less than $24 per hour. In addition, the law gives a $600-per-week boost in unemployment payments, meaning that some recipients will receive payments equivalent to a $24 hourly rate. However, the law does not specify that weekly unemployment payments be the equivalent of $24 per hour. Unemployed Americans who live in states with less generous unemployment benefits will receive less.  The statement is partially accurate but needs additional context, so our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2020/apr/06/facebook-posts/big-boost-unemployment-checks-no-pay-hike-workers/

In firing of inspector general, Donald Trump falsely repeats that whistleblower got phone call wrong
","President Donald Trump repeated the 2019 Lie of the Year in explaining why he fired the intelligence community inspector general who forwarded the whistleblower report to Congress that triggered impeachment hearings. When reporters asked why he fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, Trump said Atkinson was a ""disgrace to IGs."" ""He took this terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report — right? — and he brought it to Congress,"" Trump said at an April 5 press conference. For a long time, Trump has called his chat with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky ""perfect,"" and the whistleblower’s account of that call ""fake."" But the whistleblower got just about everything right. PolitiFact deemed Trump’s insistence that he got the call ""almost completely wrong"" the most significant falsehood of 2019. We compared the whistleblower complaint with the White House memorandum of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, and the House impeachment report. Here are the excerpts from the whistleblower’s filing, followed by whether the information is confirmed. Early in the morning of 25 July, the President spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This was confirmed by the memorandum of the call. After an initial exchange of pleasantries, the President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests.  Setting aside the characterization of the purpose as ""personal interests,"" the allocation of the number of words between pleasantries and a request for help with investigations accurately reflects the memorandum. The complaint then describes what Trump wanted Ukraine to do. Initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden Confirmed, according to the memorandum that quotes Trump as saying the following: ""The other thing. There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me."" Assist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine, with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike. Confirmed, according to the memorandum. Trump is quoted as saying: ""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.  ""As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible."" Meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem.  Confirmed, according to the memorandum: Zelensky is the first to bring up Giuliani’s name. As for what Trump said, he did mention both men several times and in tandem. Trump: ""Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great."" Trump: ""I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people."" Trump: ""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.""  The President also praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his position. This is ambiguous. Trump made no reference to Lutsenko by name. What he said was, ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.""  Trump might have been thinking of the previous prosecutor general Viktor Shokin; that would fit more with a prosecutor who had been ""shut down."" The current prosecutor at the time, however, was Lutsenko. From the memorandum, which indicates that certain sections were left out and doesn’t name the prosecutor, we can’t tell for sure. I was told by White House officials that no other (corruption) ""cases"" were discussed. The memorandum shows that only the DNC server and the Bidens came up. I was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call. He was told wrong. Brechbuhl wasn’t on the call. His boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was.   Trump said that the intelligence community inspector general passed along a ""terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report."" In reality, the complaint got nearly every detail correct, as the memorandum released by the White House and the impeachment inquiry showed. It was correct on the request that Ukraine investigate the Bidens and the notion that Ukraine might have the DNC server that was hacked by the Russians in the 2016 election. It was correct that Trump aimed to connect the Ukrainians with Giluiani and Barr, even down to the detail of Trump mentioning the two in conjunction. The complaint described Trump as attempting to pressure Ukraine. In the impeachment inquiry, Democrats concluded that was correct, and most Republicans said it was wrong. But the key details the whistleblower offered to back that up were correct. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/apr/06/donald-trump/firing-inspector-general-donald-trump-falsely-repe/

Bernie Sanders repeats flawed claim about U.S. health care spending compared to other countries
","Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is on a campaign for ""Medicare for all"" — or at least something like it. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who identifies as a socialist, told NBC’s Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd to look at how much the country spends compared to the rest of the world as a reason for a single-payer system. ""We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country,"" Sanders said. It’s a striking claim, and one we heard from Sanders six years ago. We rated the claim False then, and it's still wrong now. We looked at data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), widely cited by experts as an authoritative source for this information. In 2007, the United States led the world in health care spending at $7,167 per capita, according to the OECD. Norway and Switzerland followed at $4,579 and $4,568, respectively. The United States maintained its spending lead in the years that followed. But Sanders puts the difference too strongly when he says U.S. spending is ""almost twice"" per capita of ""any other country."" According to the OECD’s most recent data, U.S. spending grew to $8,713 per capita in 2013. Switzerland and Norway came in second and third at $6,325 and $5,862 per capita, respectively. (The organization’s incomplete 2014 data set, which does not include the United States, shows no country spending over $6,500 per capita.) Had Sanders fine-tuned his talking point by claiming that the United States spends twice as much per capita as the average developed country, his statement would been accurate. Average per capita spending is less than $3,500 across the 32 countries listed in the OECD database. That’s 40 percent of what the United States spends per person. A spokesman for Sanders could not be reached for comment. Our ruling Sanders said that ""we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country."" The United States spends more on health care per capita than other countries, but not always twice as much.

Hillary Clinton tweets that Florida got an F for college affordability under Jeb Bush
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush (or at least their staffs) engaged in a snarky Twitter exchange shortly after Clinton gave a speech about college affordability. In the exchange, on Aug. 10, 2015, Clinton and Bush cheekily traded barbs about education policy. The original tweet, from Clinton’s camp, was straightforward, saying, ""Cost won't be a barrier to an education. Debt won't hold you back. Read Hillary's plan: http://hrc.io/college."" The Bush camp replied by tweaking the original visuals and saying, ""100%: The increase in student debt under this Democratic White House."" Then the Clinton camp shot back by ""scribbling over"" Bush’s graphic with the following claim: ""F: The grade given to Florida for college affordability under Jeb Bush's leadership."" It cited the the Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. So did Florida received an F for college affordability when Bush was governor from 1999 to 2007? There is some evidence to back this up, but Clinton's jab leaves out important context on the cost of Florida higher education during the Bush years. (We separately checked Bush’s claim about the increase in debt.) The claim comes from the Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, which shut its doors in 2010. The independent group, funded by philanthropies such as Pew Charitable Trusts and the Ford Foundation, graded states every two years on a variety of metrics for higher education. One was ""affordability."" In looking at this subject, the group sought to answer this question: ""How difficult is it to pay for college in each state when family income, the cost of attending college, and student financial assistance are taken into account?"" To do this, researchers considered such criteria as tuition for community colleges and public and private four-year colleges and universities; the degree of state investments in need-based financial aid; and the extent of student debt. For the year cited in Clinton’s tweet -- 2006 -- Florida did receive an F for affordability. And it wasn’t the only time: In 2004, the study also gave Florida an F. But Florida was hardly alone in flunking the affordability test. In 2006, the year the Clinton camp selected for the tweet, every state but seven received an F, and those ""lucky"" seven states didn’t do much better: Five ended up with a D while two got a C. The missing context from the tweet, then, is that Florida was not uniquely bad -- not by a longshot. Our own previous fact-checking concluded that while tuition went up under Bush, it did so at a rate slower than the national average. We found that Bush signed budgets in which the Legislature increased tuition substantially, but we also found that in-state, undergraduate tuition in Florida was still modest compared to to other states when Bush left office. Bush’s team cited several policies he helped institute on education: He put in place a First Generation Matching Grant for Floridians who are the first in their families to attend college; gave the Florida Student Assistance Grant Program a record 21.9 percent increase in 2006; and expanded the lottery-funded Bright Futures Medallion Scholarship program to cover 100 percent of community-college tuition fees. Still, the reports cannot be discounted entirely. Troy Miller, associate director for research and policy for the student advocacy group the Florida College Access Network, said the reports were important because they looked at whether state’s residents could typically afford the price tag of college in their state. ""The way the authors evaluate affordability is valid, even if their grading scale is arbitrary,"" such as the fact that most states received an F, Miller said. Miller added that Florida may have suffered in the ratings because of the Bright Futures program, which was a merit-based program, not one that was need-based. The report points out ""that Florida awards little state aid on the basis of need relative to other states,"" he said. Our ruling Clinton said that under Jeb Bush, Florida got an F for college affordability. The report on which her campaign is basing the claim confirms that in 2006 Florida received an F in this category. Still, it’s worth noting that 43 of the 50 states scored an F in 2006, meaning that Florida’s grade wasn’t uniquely bad. And while tuition did increase on Bush’s watch, the rate of increase was smaller than the national average.

Jeb Bush: Student loan debt has doubled under Obama
","In a Twitter back-and-forth with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Democrats don’t have a great track record for keeping student loan debt in check in recent years. On Aug. 10, as part of promoting her college affordability plan, Clinton tweeted a graphic that said ""$1.2 trillion, the amount 40 million Americans owe in student debt,"" accompanied by the text, ""Cost won't be a barrier to an education. Debt won't hold you back."" Bush, running for the Republican nomination, responded with his own similar graphic that said, ""100 percent, the increase in student debt under this Democratic White House. Hillary Clinton: mortgaging the future of college grads for four more years."" Has the student debt really doubled in the past seven years, and is it fair to tie it to Barack Obama’s presidency? (We also fact-checked Clinton’s response -- a third graphic that said Florida received an ""F"" in college affordability under Bush. See that article here.) The numbers, for the most part check out. But experts told us that rising student loan debt is a trend that started long before the Obama administration. ""The long term trend of colleges becoming unaffordable goes back to the mid-1980s -- when private colleges started jacking up the prices,"" said Stephen Burd, a senior policy analyst at the New America Foundation and an expert in higher education policy. ""In more recent years, it's been the publics that have seen bigger percentage increases in tuition."" Total student loan debt has increased about 86 percent since Obama took office -- a bit under the 100 percent increase Bush cited -- according to figures from the Federal Reserve. At the end of 2008, right before Obama was inaugurated, the total student loan debt was $640 billion. By March 2015, student loan debt was $1.19 trillion. This graph from the National Center for Education Statistics shows the total student loan debt from 2003 through 2012, adjusted for inflation:    Experts told us that total student debt increases when tuition increases and when more students enroll, and the 2008 recession caused both of these things to happen -- so the recent increase is more a function of the economic downturn, rather than having a Democrat in the White House. The economic downturn pushed states to cut higher education funding, so schools upped tuition to cover costs, said Donald Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University. Since 1980, private college tuition has increased about 200 percent, according to College Board data compiled by Heller. Public school tuition, on the other hand, has increased about 300 percent, with by far the biggest jump happening since 2008. As opposed to Obama, ""some critics say governors and state legislators are to blame since they didn't protect higher education funding -- and colleges, since they haven't controlled costs,"" said Joni Finney, director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania. Even with the increased tuition, more people enrolled in college, as people tend to do when employment prospects appear to dry up, Heller said. Additionally, the recession left households with fewer of their own resources to fund higher education, so they had to take out more loans. There haven’t been any big policy changes so far in the Obama administration that would have affected student loan debt significantly, either positively or negatively, said Beth Akers, a Brookings Institution fellow and an expert on the economics of higher education. ""It is far reaching to suggest that the president has had a significant impact on student borrowing during his administration,"" Akers said. The White House pointed out that the Obama administration has taken other measures to improve college affordability, such as expanding federal scholarships and implementing programs to help borrowers pay back student loans. Akers added that more collective debt is not necessarily a bad thing because higher education generally produces large and positive returns for its graduates. More collective debt means that more people are pursuing higher education -- particularly those from lower income brackets, who need loans the most. Our ruling Bush said there has been a 100 percent ""increase in student debt under this Democratic White House."" There has been a substantial increase in student loan debt over the course of Obama’s presidency -- but it’s an increase of about 86 percent, not 100 percent. Experts also told us that student loan debt was growing before Obama took office, too, and much of the increase that happened under his watch was a result of the recession and other factors out of the White House’s control.

Wisconsin is only state with a fully funded pension system, Scott Walker says
","Scott Walker fired off 13 tweets on July 26, 2015 that cite accomplishments and highpoints during his time as Wisconsin's governor. This was one of them: ""Overall bonding in latest WI state budget is at 20 year low. State pension system is only one fully funded in the country."" We decided to check the second part of the statement to see if anything has changed since we first rated it True in 2013. The fully-funded pension system is also a prominent talking point for Walker in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination. Where pension benefits come from The Wisconsin Retirement System provides retirement, disability and death benefits not only to all state employees, but to nearly all local government employees in Wisconsin. With some $85 billion in what are known as actuarial assets, it covers more than 256,000 active public employees, including teachers and municipal employees, plus 154,000 retirees and others who are no longer active employees. The funds come from three sources: employer contributions, employee contributions and investment earnings. The employer-employee split was changed dramatically by Act 10, Walker's 2011 collective bargaining reform law. Before Act 10, the state, as well as the local governments participating in the state retirement system, had agreed to make almost of the contributions that employees were required to make toward their pensions. In other words, often as a result of union bargaining, the employers were making the employer contributions to the pension fund and nearly all of the employee contributions, as well. In 2010, for example, state and local government employers made 99 percent of the employer-employee contributions to the system. As of 2013, the latest figures available, employers paid 57 percent and employees 43 percent. So, just how healthy is the pension fund, and how does it compare? How close to fully funded? The state's most recent actuarial evaluation showed that as of the end of 2013, the retirement system was in balance. That is, the expected total retirement benefit obligations equalled the assets ultimately expected to be available to the system. More specifically, the Gabriel Roeder Smith & Co. firm said the pension fund was 99.96 percent funded. It’s worth noting the actuarial reports have shown the retirement system funding at 99 percent or greater not only during Walker's tenure, but dating back to 2003. Wisconsin's pension system has long been viewed as a national model. When we rated Walker's 2013 claim that Wisconsin’s pension fund was the only fully funded one in the country, we relied primarily on a report from the non-partisan Pew Charitable Trusts. It was since updated, with the most recent version published in July 2015. That report shows that in 2013, South Dakota's pension system had joined Wisconsin as being fully funded. Pew actually ranked South Dakota first and Wisconsin second, even though both were 99.9 percent funded. The national average was 72 percent. Illinois was lowest, at 39 percent. Another report -- which included some actual as well as estimated data for 2014 -- also listed South Dakota and Wisconsin as the only fully funded pension systems. That report, from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, estimated that Wisconsin had an asset-to-liability ratio of 104 percent for 2014, up from 99.9 percent in each of the three previous years. Actual data for South Dakota, meanwhile, showed that state's pension system was funded at 100 percent in both 2013 and 2014. (The report also examined local pension plans. The City of Milwaukee's was estimated at 100.8 percent funded in 2014.) Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, told us Wisconsin and South Dakota are well funded because their investments have performed well and their retirement benefits ""have remained fairly reasonable."" In addition, in Wisconsin’s case, retirement benefits go down when investments don’t perform up to par, he said. Our rating Walker says Wisconsin's ""pension system is only one fully funded in the country."" That was the case among state pension plans in 2012, but newer reports show slightly different results. According to Pew Charitable Trusts, both South Dakota and Wisconsin were fully funded in 2013; and according to Boston College, both were fully funded in 2013 and 2014.

Marco Rubio says a minor can get an abortion -- but not a tattoo -- without parental consent
","Teenagers getting inked is apparently subject to greater parental say than getting an abortion, according to U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. In an Aug. 4 interview with Southern Baptist Convention President Russell Moore, Rubio joined other Republicans in criticizing Planned Parenthood amid the release of videos by an anti-abortion group that accuse the group of harvesting fetal tissue for profit. A day earlier, Florida’s Republican senator had been among those who voted to defund Planned Parenthood, a measure that failed to get the required 60 votes to advance. In his interview, Rubio raised concerns about nationwide access to abortions for minors: ""The idea that a minor can go get a tattoo,"" he said, before quickly correcting himself to say ""cannot get a tattoo without parental consent -- but can get an abortion without parental consent -- is just mind-shattering for the vast majority of Americans. ... People who believe that a young child, a minor, should be able to get an abortion easier than a tattoo -- they are the extremists."" We decided to check whether minors need their parents’ permission to get a tattoo, but don’t need permission to get an abortion. Parental consent laws First, the laws about parental consent for abortion and tattoos vary from state to state, so it’s not possible to make a blanket statement as Rubio did and apply it to the whole country. According to data through March 2015 compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 45 states have laws prohibiting minors from getting tattoos, with the majority of those states allowing it if there’s parental consent. For example, Florida law requires written, notarized consent of a minor's parent or legal guardian in order to tattoo a minor. Now let’s look at whether minors need their parents’ permission to obtain an abortion. There are two different categories of parental involvement: one is consent, which means a parent has to sign off on the abortion, while the other one is simply notification which can mean the parent receives a letter or a phone call about the abortion. According to Guttmacher Institute, a group that tracks abortion policy and statistics, a majority of states require consent and/or notification. In 38 states, minors either have to get consent and/or notify their parents, while in 12 states they don’t need either. We asked Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, which states require parental consent for a tattoo but not for an abortion. Using information from Planned Parenthood about abortion laws and the National Conference of State Legislatures about tattoo laws, Conant pointed to seven states:   State Abortion law for minors Tattoo law for minors California No parental involvement required It is a misdemeanor to tattoo anyone under age 18. Connecticut No parental involvement required Requires permission of parent or guardian. Hawaii No parental involvement required Requires written consent of parent or guardian Maine No parental involvement required It is illegal to tattoo anyone under age 18. Montana No parental involvement required Requires explicit in-person consent of the child's parent or guardian. New York No parental involvement required It is unlawful to tattoo the body of a child less than 18 years old. Vermont No parental involvement required Requires written consent of his or her parent or guardian. Sources: Planned Parenthood and the National Conference of State Legislatures Conant included two states that flat-out ban tattoos for minors: California and Maine. So that leaves five states that require parental consent for tattoos but have no parental involvement required for abortions. However, Rubio used the more narrow term of ""parental consent"" in his interview -- not ""parental involvement"" or ""notification."" There are some states that require only parental notification for abortion but do require consent for tattoos -- for example Florida. So that means that a Florida teenager doesn’t need her parents’ permission to get an abortion -- but does for a tattoo. State Abortion law Tattoo law Colorado Parental notification only Requires express consent from the minor's parent or guardian. Delaware Parental notification only Requires prior written consent of the adult parent or legal guardian. Florida Parental notification only Requires written, notarized consent of a minor's parent or legal guardian in order to tattoo a minor. Minnesota Parental notification only Requires written parental consent. South Dakota Parental notification only Requires signed consent form from the minor's parents West Virginia Parental notification only Requires prior written consent from a parent or guardian Source: Guttmacher Institute and National Conference of State Legislatures So in all, Rubio has a point for about 11 states. Complicating matters is that there is a way to avoid parental involvement. Since the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states may not give parents an absolute veto over whether their daughters have an abortion, 37 states that require parental involvement include a ""judicial bypass"" procedure. This allows a minor to receive court approval for an abortion without her parents’ knowledge or consent. Use of judicial bypass could increase the number of states where Rubio’s scenario would be valid. A spokeswoman for Americans United for Life, told PolitiFact that ""even in states with the most stringent parental consent requirements, a minor who can demonstrate (with the assistance of free counsel) to a court that she is either mature enough to make an abortion decision, or that obtaining parental consent is not in her best interest, can bypass the parental consent requirement.""   However, it’s worth noting that, despite the existence of judicial bypass, a majority of pregnant minors who seek abortion report that their parents are aware that they are doing so, according to a literature review by Guttmacher in 2009. Helena Silverstein, a government and law professor at Lafayette College who wrote a book in 2007: ""Girls on the Stand: How Courts Fail Pregnant Minors,"" suggested that rather than compare parental consent for tattoos to abortion, it is more useful to compare other minors’ consent law as they relate to sexual and reproductive health. All states allow minors to consent to get treatment for sexually transmitted infections while 32 states allow minors to consent to prenatal care without their parents’ permission. J. Shoshanna Ehrlich, an expert on reproductive rights at the University of Massachusetts, was also skeptical of Rubio’s comparison. While it ""must suck to be 16 and wait until you are 18 to get a tattoo, you can postpone the decision,"" unlike abortion, she said. Our ruling Rubio said ""a minor cannot get a tattoo without parental consent but can get an abortion without parental consent."" Rubio has a good argument for about 11 states, but that’s a minority. More commonly, parents by law need to be at least notified -- and in many cases give their consent -- for a minor to have an abortion. There is a significant exception, however: 37 states allow a minor to go through a judge without notifying parents. As for tattoos, most states either ban them for minors or require parental consent.

Mike Huckabee says Social Security imperiled by dramatic decline in wage-earners
","During the Aug. 6 Republican debate, Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie engaged in one of the calmer exchanges of the evening, discussing how best to reform Social Security and Medicare. Christie laid out his position first: raising the retirement age and cutting benefits for those who maintained a steady stream of high income into their old age. Huckabee countered with his own vision of a ""fair tax"" on consumption, which, he memorably claimed, would apply to everyone, ""including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now."" As part of his follow-up, Huckabee said, ""One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and capital gains."" We decided to check whether the funding stream for Social Security is in danger because the number of people receiving wages is declining dramatically. Sources of funding for Social Security While payroll taxes comprise the bulk of the program’s income -- making up about $750 billion in revenue in 2014 -- Huckabee ignores two other sources of revenue that provided support for Social Security. One is that wealthier beneficiaries pay taxes on their Social Security income. For 2014, the revenue collected this way came out to $29.7 billion. Another method of funding for Social Security comes from interest earnings on investments on the $2.8 trillion worth of reserves in Social Security. This amounted to $98.2 billion in 2014. More significantly, has there been a ""dramatic"" decline in wage-earners? It’s unclear exactly what kind of timeline Huckabee was using when he referred to the ""dramatically declining"" number of people getting wages, and Huckabee’s campaign did not respond to us. But going by the raw numbers, at least, there’s been no decline in the ranks of wage-earners at all. The total civilian labor force has been steadily increasing since 1948, the first year the Bureau of Labor Statistics started counting it, with a brief stagnation at the height of the recent recession. The labor force participation rate — which measures people who are working age and either employed or looking for a job — has fallen since the Great Recession, partly due to economic trends but also due to the aging of the Baby Boom generation. More useful for the purposes of Huckabee’s claim is a look at the total number of people paying into Social Security. In 2013, the number of wage and salary contributors to Social Security (a different category from those who are self-employed, though their earnings are also taxed for Social Security) was virtually the same as in 2007, and one expert predicted that it had probably continued to go up in 2014 and 2015. So the total number of people in the labor force and paying into Social Security is about the same as it was before the recession, not a dramatic decline. However, Jagadeesh Gokhale of Wharton School’s Public Policy Initiative said Huckabee would have been more accurate if he had phrased his claim more carefully. The number of wage-earners is indeed decreasing in relation to the number of Social Security beneficiaries. This is happening due to the increase of Baby Boomer recipients. When a Boomer retires, it’s a double whammy -- the retirement shrinks the number of wage earners while increasing the number of beneficiaries. So Huckabee has reason to be concerned about the number of wage-earners supporting Social Security. It’s just that he didn’t correctly describe the problem. What’s the impact of earnings from capital gains and dividends? Huckabee also suggests another reason why insufficient money is being funneled into Social Security: that the richest people are accumulating a significant portion of their wealth from capital gains and dividends, profits that aren’t taxed for the benefit of Social Security. We wanted to see how well this theory held up. One study that we found on this issue came from the Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that analyzes tax policy. The center looked at the composition of income reported on tax returns in 2012 and found that the highest-income earners make up a disproportionate share of non-wage earnings, said Roberton Williams, who co-authored the study. The study found that for those with an adjusted gross income above $5 million, capital gains made up nearly half their income, with dividends and interest accounting for another 14 percent. According to a calculation we did with the same data set — 2012 income statistics from the IRS — capital gains and dividends make up an even larger percentage of income for those earning more than $10 million. For those, capital gains, interest and dividends make up 62.7 percent of their adjusted gross income, while salaries and wages only account for 16.1 percent. (Business income and retirement funds round out the rest.) So there’s something to what Huckabee says on this point. But it’s important to keep it in context. There were only about 17,000 Americans making more than $10 million in 2012; combined, their adjusted gross income totaled about $546 billion, or just 6 percent of the country’s total pool of income. You have to adjust the cut-off point all the way down to $100,000 before you can include half of the income in the United States for 2012. Cumulatively, that group earned 56.5 percent of the nation’s income. And the further you extend the pay scale downward, the smaller the role capital gains and dividends play. For those earning $100,000 and up, non-wage income only accounts for 17 percent. Salaries and wages make up 59 percent. It’s also important to remember that wage and salary earnings are only taxed by Social Security up to $118,500. Our ruling Huckabee said that ""one of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically."" Several aspects of this claim are problematic, starting with the inaccuracy that only wages support Social Security. In addition, Baby Boomer retirements are shifting the ratio of recipients to workers in the wrong direction, but it’s not as simple as there being a dramatic decline in the number of people who get their income from wages. In fact, Huckabee overstates the impact of non-wage income on Social Security’s fiscal health; the shift from wage income to non-wage income is happening among the richest Americans, but this group still accounts for a fraction of all income earned in the country. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/12/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-social-security-imperiled-drama/

Marco Rubio slams Dodd-Frank, gets his numbers wrong
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says a law that attempts to stop banks from becoming too big to fail actually ends up making community banks too small to succeed. During the first Republican presidential debate, Rubio called for less regulation, lower taxes, and rolling back the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in the wake of the financial crisis in 2010. ""We need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks,"" he said on Aug. 6, 2015, to applause. ""Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed."" Rubio’s comment is a new version of an old Republican talking point, so we wanted to take a look. A spokesperson for Rubio referred us to a March 2015 brief by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond that noted a 41 percent decline in small banks between 2007 and 2013. But that’s a smaller category -- not small and mid-size, as Rubio said -- and it starts counting before Dodd-Frank became law. If we focus on the time frame he gives, 2010 to now, Rubio’s figure is overstated. Since 2010, the decline in their numbers is less than half of what Rubio said -- estimates range from 12 percent to 16 percent. Still, regulators say that’s not the full picture, and experts contend that a host of factors other than Dodd-Frank are at play. A 30-year trend First, let’s note that Dodd-Frank was billed as a safeguard against another financial crisis -- ""the most far reaching Wall Street reform in history,"" touts the White House -- and its regulations largely target big banks. So how did mom-and-pop bankers get hit in the crossfire?   To understand the shift, we have to look decades before Rubio’s time frame. The number of banks actually began to dwindle in 1980s, as seen in a chart from the Federal Bank of St. Louis:  The heart of the matter is why the numbers are going down. According to a 2012 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report, the majority of the loss comes from consolidation, not closures. In other words, banks were not so much collapsing for good as folding into other banks. This was possible thanks to a slew of laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s that chipped away barriers in banking across communities and state borders (the U.S. Government Accountability Office points to, for example, the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 and the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998). So big banks grew bigger, but that doesn’t mean all small banks disappeared. Community banks of different sizes have been subject to different trends.   From 1985 to 2013, the number of the smallest institutions has declined dramatically (85 percent to be exact). But mid-size and large community banks have remained relatively stable since 2010 (and have increased, albeit incrementally, since 1985). Here are two FDIC charts from a 2014 report to that point:  Two-thirds of failed or voluntarily closed community banks are actually acquired by other community banks, according to the FDIC. The result: fewer, but larger community banks. Their goal: to achieve ""economies of scale"" (cost advantages gained when spreading out expenses over more revenue), says the U.S. Government Accountability Office. So community banks have an incentive to grow bigger, because they then get more bang for their buck, explains Joe Rizzi, a banking consultant and American Banker columnist. Dodd-Frank’s impact As for how Dodd-Frank plays into all of this, there’s really no consensus. According to a February 2015 report by the Harvard Kennedy School, ""Dodd-Frank exacerbated the pre-existing trend of banking consolidation by piling up regulatory costs"" on community banks. ""It gets so expensive. The people who can really afford the experts and the simple costs are the larger banks,"" report co-author Marshall Lux told PolitiFact. ""The larger banks are ironically protected from other people entering the market."" Rizzi emphasized that the decline in the number of community banks came well before 2010. He attributes the change, instead, to the 30-year consolidation trend as well as the FDIC changing its policies on new banks in 2009. Moreover, he contends that fewer small community banks isn’t necessarily a bad thing. ""It’s a healthy development. It is better to have fewer sub-scale weak institutions and more stronger banks,"" he said. Lux and his co-author Robert Greene, however, envision a domino’s effect that mostly hits rural and densely populated communities. ""There’s a difference between market-driven consolidation and regulatory-driven consolidation. That leaves gaps. It’s not like a competitor is filling the void,"" Greene said. ""The community banks consolidate into mini-regionals and God knows, you’re then worried about the big banks swallowing those up,"" added Lux. Back to Rubio Despite their disagreement on Dodd-Frank’s culpability, no one backed Rubio’s claim or his call to repeal the law. Lux, whose report was also cited by Rubio’s campaign, told the Washington Post’s Fact Checker that the senator is ""simply wrong."" Rizzi put it more harshly: ""Trying to blame Dodd-Frank for the ‘decline’  -- I call it change -- in number of community banks is fantasy. Trying to maintain the number and size of community banks is nostalgia. George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life) is dead -- let him rest in peace."" Lux, for his part, advocated for reform rather than a complete overhaul of Dodd-Frank. After all, the law’s primary goal is to tackle ""too big to fail."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed."" Rubio’s figure is overstated for the time frame he gives. The highest estimate we found shows a 16 percent decline in the past five years -- less than half of what he said. The trend Rubio describes began decades before Dodd-Frank became law in 2010. Even then, experts say a host of factors other than Dodd-Frank are at play.   We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-slams-dodd-frank-gets-his-numbers-wron/

PAC accuses Rubio of favoring for-profit colleges in education plan
","A liberal political action committee is attacking Sen. Marco Rubio’s proposed overhaul of the nation’s colleges and universities, saying his plan unfairly benefits for-profit schools. After Rubio went on Fox & Friends on Aug. 10, 2015, to lambaste Hillary Clinton’s call to make post-secondary education more affordable, American Bridge 21st Century went after Rubio’s own plan. ""Perhaps in his eagerness to criticize, Marco neglected to mention his long-time advocacy for and support of for-profit colleges,"" the PAC wrote on its website. ""And Marco neglected to mention that his own proposed college affordability overhaul would specifically benefit for-profit colleges — institutions with a reputation for willfully misleading students, targeting veterans, in particular."" Rubio has spent a lot of campaign time talking about getting a proper education, but we haven’t learned many details of his strategy. Will for-profit colleges ""specifically benefit"" from his ideas to make education more affordable? We decided to take a crash course on his plan and find out. Rubio’s plan not specific  Rubio took aim at current education practices in a July 7 speech in Chicago. Among his goals would be to change how schools are accredited, saying the current system favored traditional colleges. ""Our higher education system today is controlled by what amounts to a cartel of existing colleges and universities, which use their power over the accreditation process to block innovative, low-cost competitors from entering the marketplace,"" Rubio said in his speech. ""Within my first 100 days, I will bust this cartel by establishing a new accreditation process that welcomes low-cost, innovative providers."" Accreditation is a system designed to evaluate whether a school or institution meets quality guidelines, and is generally performed by one of several regional boards. These boards are private groups that must be approved by the federal government, and are comprised of members from already qualified schools. It’s important to keep in mind that a school must be accredited in order to qualify for federal financial aid like student loans and Pell grants. Sources told us that makes accreditation very attractive to for-profit schools, which are owned by private companies looking to make money. Experts we interviewed did agree that unless you’re a traditional college, getting accredited can be difficult and lock out schools that could teach skills for less than a degree-granting university. Massive open online courses, boot camps and for-profit colleges often aren’t accredited. It’s not clear what the ""innovative providers"" Rubio mentioned in his speech truly are. Other than broad talking points, Rubio has yet to provide specifics about what he means, and his spokesman did not clarify what schools or programs would benefit from changes in the accreditation process. But that means American Bridge can’t say with certainty, either. ""Admittedly, we are slightly reading between the lines because Rubio did not utter the words ‘for-profit’ and he has yet to release a white-paper on this specific proposal,"" American Bridge spokesman Ben Ray told PolitiFact. But ""code words"" in Rubio’s speech like catering to ""market forces"" and ""competition"" show that he means for-profit colleges, Ray added. Media outlets and critics like American Bridge have pointed out that Rubio has a history of advocating for the privately run schools. American Bridge argues that for-profit schools have a history of overpromising results to recruit students, especially in Florida. In 2014 Rubio defended Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit company that late declared bankruptcy and closed more than 100 campuses after a federal investigation into its lending practices to students. The U.S. Department of Education fined the company $29.7 million for misleading students at Florida locations by lying about job placement rates.    Rubio had asked the agency to continue providing federal aid to Corinthian while the company was being investigated. The company donated more than $27,000 to Rubio over the last five years. Kevin Carey, education policy program director of the New America Foundation public policy institute, agreed that the schools usually have to conform ""to join the club"" and get accredited. But American Bridge is reaching to say Rubio’s plan aims to benefit those private companies when he mentions ""innovative providers."" ""I think it could mean many things, probably including online or technology-enabled education, but not exclusively for-profit colleges,"" Carey said. He noted that Corinthian Colleges already was an accredited institution, so while Rubio may have supported the company, the example doesn’t necessarily apply to a potentially revamped accreditation process the way American Bridge suggests. Our ruling American Bridge 21st Century said Rubio’s ""proposed college affordability overhaul would specifically benefit for-profit colleges."" Rubio has suggested revamping the accreditation process to allow ""innovative providers"" to become accredited. Exactly which schools or programs he means and why they need to be accredited is up for debate, because Rubio hasn’t given any details. That makes it extremely difficult for American Bridge to say the change is specifically to help for-profit colleges, despite Rubio's past affinity for the businesses. Many for-profit schools already are accredited, although experts say others may potentially benefit from Rubio’s plan. Rubio's plan is not specific in benefiting for-profit colleges, so we rate American Bridge’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/12/american-bridge-21st-century/pac-accuses-rubio-favoring-profit-colleges-educati/

George Will describes Bernie Sanders' Soviet Union honeymoon
","For most couples, the ideal honeymoon getaway might entail a week of unwinding at a beach resort or a stay in a secluded mountainside cabin. Not Bernie Sanders. He chose a colder route. Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, spent their first days as newlyweds in the Soviet Union, claims George Will in a recent Washington Post column. Will’s Aug. 7 column focused mostly on the legacy of Robert Conquest, who died Aug. 3 at age 98, and whose writings on Soviet prisons documented the atrocities of the Stalin regime. A reader asked us to look into the accuracy of the final paragraph of Will’s column, which invoked Sanders’ ""honeymoon."" It reads: ""Conquest lived to see a current U.S. presidential candidate, a senator, who had chosen, surely as an ideological gesture, to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988. Gulags still functioned, probably including some of the ‘cold Auschwitzes’ in Siberia, described in Conquest’s ‘Kolyma.’ The honeymooner did not mind that in 1988 political prisoners were — as may still be the case — being tortured in psychiatric ‘hospitals.’ Thanks to the unblinking honesty of people like Conquest, the Soviet Union now is such a receding memory that Bernie Sanders’s moral obtuseness — the obverse of Conquest’s character — is considered an amusing eccentricity."" We wanted to see if Sanders actually honeymooned on the turf of the United States’ former adversary during the final years of the Cold War. Sister cities The trip took place while Sanders was mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989. Toward the end of his mayoral tenure, the small city on Lake Champlain launched a sister-city program with Yaroslavl, located 160 miles northeast of Moscow. The program, which is still operating today, has facilitated exchanges between the two cities involving ""mayors, business people, firefighters, jazz musicians, youth orchestras, mural painters, high school students, medical students, nurses, librarians and the (Yaroslavl) ice-hockey team,"" according to its website. Along with sister-city relationships with Bethlehem in the West Bank and Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, the Yaroslavl program was part of Sanders’ unorthodox attempt to take on international issues from a small city in New England. Sanders also actively pursued his agenda outside of the country, writing letters to world leaders and even traveling to Cuba to meet with the mayor of Havana. ""Burlington had a foreign policy,"" he wrote in his 1997 book Outsider in the House, ""because, as progressives, we understood that we all live in one world."" The bond between Burlington and Yaroslavl solidified when Sanders and his wife, as members of a 12-person delegation from Burlington, paid their Soviet counterparts a visit in 1988. The timing of the trip was unusual. Bernie and Jane were married May 28, 1988. The delegation left Burlington the next day. ""Trust me,"" Sanders writes in the book. ""It was a very strange honeymoon."" When reached for comment, Sanders’ campaign said that the dates for the trip had already been set, and the couple ""set their wedding date to coincide with that trip because they didn't want to take more time off."" In a 2007 interview, Jane Sanders also recalled the peculiar timing: ""The day after we got married, we marched in a Memorial Day parade, and then we took off in a plane to start the sister city project with Yaroslavl with 10 other people on my honeymoon."" Bernie Sanders also refers to the trip sarcastically as ""quiet and romantic"" in his book. The ""honeymoon"" was dotted with meetings, interviews and diplomatic functions. A June 2015 profile in The Guardian described the former mayor’s meeting with Yaroslavl city officials: ""After receiving a rundown of central planning, Soviet-style, from Yaroslavl’s mayor, Alexander Riabkov, Sanders notes how the quality of both housing and health care in America appeared to be ‘significantly better’ than in the communist state. ‘However,’ he added, ‘the cost of both services is much, much, higher in the United States.’ "" An education in central planning probably wasn’t the only item on Sanders’ itinerary. Yaroslavl is home to historic churches and buildings, and the Sanderses would have been in for some good sightseeing, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Will made it sound as if Sanders was visiting to condone Soviet torture practices, but the Burlington trip was more of a dialogue-building exchange program. The Vermont weekly newspaper Seven Days reported in 2009 that the sister-city relationship ""helped local residents who sought to ease tensions between the United States and Soviet Union by initiating citizen-to-citizen exchanges with a Russian city.""  Also, the Soviet Union was barely intact at the time of the trip.  Negotiations had opened up between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a few years earlier. ""It was at the beginning of perestroika,"" said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, referring to the restructuring policy Gorbachev instituted in the mid 1980s. Gulags still existed and political prisoners were still held in 1988, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. But a watershed moment came when Gorbachev allowed physicist Andrei Sakharov to return from internal exile two years earlier. ""The power of the Communist Party was being questioned and the confrontation with the West was winding down through negotiations,"" Cohen said. In 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and in 1988, Reagan himself spoke in Moscow’s Red Square. One year later brought the fall of the Berlin Wall. Three years later, the Soviet Union collapsed. Participation in the Burlington-Yaroslavl program has waned over the years, though it was viewed as a ""glamorous endeavor"" by many in Burlington at the time, program leader Howard Seaver said in 2009. Will could not be reached for comment through his researcher. Our ruling Will wrote that Sanders chose ""to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988."" Sanders and his wife did travel to Yaroslavl, a city in the Soviet Union, after their wedding in 1988. In the sense that the trip came after the couple were married, the trip was a honeymoon. The two have also referred to the trip that way, albeit sarcastically at times. But it was an unusual honeymoon, to say the least. The trip’s primary purpose was diplomacy, not leisure, and included about 10 extra guests. Will’s claim is accurate but is missing context about the trip’s underlying purpose.

Ralston misfires with comment about debate over faith leaders, ruling
","Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, says June’s 5-4 Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriages is motivating him to pursue passage next year of a ""pastor protection"" bill. A working version of the bill reads: ""No minister of the gospel or cleric or religious practitioner ordained or authorized to solemnize marriages according to the usages of the denomination, when acting in his or her official religious capacity, shall be required to solemnize any marriage in violation of his or her right to free exercise of religion."" It was drawn up shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 26 in Obergefell v. Hodges that the U.S. Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage. The decision has been met with resistance in some states. ""In Georgia, we're going to come down clearly on the side of the separation of church and state, and as long as you have constitutional scholars debating among themselves whether this is covered, then I think we need to remove all uncertainty and all doubt."" Ralston said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on July 13, two days after he announced plans for his ""pastor protection"" bill. Ralston said his efforts are not connected to the ""religious liberty"" bills that have been at the center of some of the fiercest debates at the Capitol since 2014. Supporters see the ""religious liberty"" legislation as an extra layer of protection against government intrusion on religious beliefs, while critics say it would enable businesses to discriminate against gay customers. But what of the speaker’s claim of a debate among constitutional scholars? PolitiFact decided to dig deeper. First, a little background. Ralston was meeting with House Republicans on Jekyll Island in July when he first disclosed his plans to introduce a ""pastor protection"" bill in the 2016 General Assembly session. Several states have passed or are considering nearly identical bills, and two of these bills just became law in Texas and Oklahoma . Ralston says that in his House district in North Georgia, ""there’s a lot of unease in the faith community over the reach and ramifications"" of the Supreme Court’s decision. ""What we are trying to do is dispel the unease, dispel the uncertainty and replace it with clarity,"" he told a radio reporter last month. What do scholars say? As soon as Ralston announced plans for the bill, some began to question: Was it necessary? Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional scholar at the University of Georgia, said nothing in the gay marriage ruling affects the religious freedom protections provided faith leaders under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. They still have the right to refuse to perform any marriage ceremony, Kreis said. Based on Ralston’s statement, suggesting a debate among constitutional scholars, we went in search of other opinions. We contacted constitutional law scholars in Georgia and across the country, including George Washington University law professor Ira C. Lupu and Georgia State University constitutional law professor Eric J. Segall. All said the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prevents any minister, priest, rabbi or any other cleric from having to perform any religious ceremony - wedding or otherwise - against his or her faith. ""Many, for example, will not perform interfaith weddings,"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert and founding dean and distinguished professor of law at the University of California. The U.S. Supreme Court ""has never said otherwise,"" Segall said. ""And nothing in the same-sex marriage decision is to the contrary,"" he said. PolitiFact talked by telephone with Ralston, a lawyer by profession, and asked, ""Do you believe they (faith  leaders) are protected under the First Amendment?"" ""Arguably they are,"" the speaker said. He voiced concern that, with a U.S. Supreme Court that evolves, this could one day be an issue litigated in federal court. He also repeated his stance that, within the faith community, ""there’s certainly uncertainty and unease."" But, he acknowledged, ""I don’t think it is the reality."" He went to say: ""We also have to deal with the perception."" In a recent op-ed piece, Ralston wrote that ""the Pastor's Protection Act will make absolutely clear our state government does not view clergy as state actors."" Lupu, a nationally recognized scholar in constitutional law, said a civil marriage, based on its definition, ""is not a matter that has historically been the domain of religious leaders -- certainly not the exclusive domain."" ""Think about divorce laws and how far they depart from Catholic or Orthodox Jewish teaching,"" he said. Lauren Sudeall Lucas, a constitutional law expert and Georgia State University law professor, said the high court in Obergefell v. Hodges was careful to emphasize that it is ""the state"" that cannot refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. Lupu said he knows of no constitutional scholar who believes that the state can dictate to a pastor regarding who qualifies for religious marriage. ""So if Ralston says the Pastor Protection Act is legally necessary and adds something to the substance of the law, then he is speaking falsely,"" Lupu said. ""If he says ‘I know it's not necessary, but it will provide reassurance to some,‘ that cannot be a falsehood, because it will indeed do that."" Our ruling Georgia House Speaker David Ralston has announced he will propose a pastor protection bill, spelling out that faith leaders in the state have the right to refuse to perform any marriage ceremony that goes against their religious convictions. ""In Georgia, we're going to come down clearly on the side of the separation of church and state, and as long as you have constitutional scholars debating among themselves whether this is covered, then I think we need to remove all uncertainty and all doubt,"" Ralston said in an interview two days after announcing plans for the bill.

Did Hillary Clinton emails reveal location of ambassador killed in Benghazi attack?
","Of course Hillary Clinton’s emails contained classified information, says Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano. That’s obvious, in his view, from the sensitive content of the emails that have been released. The FBI is now investigating the security of the private email system Clinton used while secretary of state, which was not designed to handle classified information. Clinton has said she never dealt with classified information on her private server, though two government watchdog groups have said she did. Even the emails that have now been made public contain sensitive information -— including information about Benghazi, said Napolitano, a former judge, in an Aug. 5 conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""I saw emails that have been revealed under the Freedom of Information Act,"" Napolitano said. ""And in them, she is discussing the location of French fighter jets during the NATO bombardment of Libya, how big the no-fly zone is, where the no-fly zones are, and are you ready for this? — the location of Ambassador Stevens, who of course was murdered, in Libya. If that is not classified — if she didn’t know that was classified, she has no business being in public office."" Former U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was killed in the 2012 attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Do emails contained on Clinton’s private server really discuss information about his location in Libya? As we'll see, Clinton's emails discuss Stevens' location in general terms — similar to information shared in the media at the time. Key emails We found six possibly relevant emails in the cache of Clinton emails that the State Department has released to the public so far. These emails all take place in a one-month period in 2011 during the Libyan Civil War, about a year and a half before the September 2012 Benghazi attack. At the time, Stevens was not yet the ambassador — he was the special envoy to the Transitional National Council (called the TNC), then the de facto government of Libya — and he was embarking on his first trip to Libya in this role. He became ambassador in May 2012, about four months before his death. We’ll lay out the key points in each email that speak to Stevens’ whereabouts, and then get into the analysis. March 23, 2011: In this email, which Napolitano pointed out to us, Clinton’s then-chief of staff Jacob Sullivan wrote to Clinton about the NATO mission in Libya. Sullivan also wrote that someone named Bill was ""trying to make sure Chris Stevens gets into E. Libya."" March 27, 2011: This is an email between two State Department officials that was then forwarded to Clinton. The subject line is: ""Chris Stevens mission."" Regarding his location and travel plans, the email said, ""The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days."" April 8, 2011: An email among State Department employees (marked ""sensitive but unclassified"") that was later forwarded to Clinton said, ""Security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required."" April 10, 2011: Another email among State Department employees later forwarded to Clinton marked ""sensitive but unclassified"" said, ""The situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point where Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat, etc)."" April 22, 2011: Yet another email among State Department employees, this one marked ""unclassified,"" that was later forwarded to Clinton, ""I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5."" April 24, 2011: A final email among State Department employees later forwarded to Clinton: ""Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off."" After this email, few of the emails released so far discuss Stevens in any capacity until after the 2012 attacks. Clinton only participated in the March 23 email conversation, and she did not say anything about Stevens’ location; in the other emails, she only received the messages. In any case, the information ended up on her private email server. What do the emails tell us? These emails do discuss Stevens’ location, though the terms are vague. We learn from the emails that Stevens was in Malta then Benghazi, where he met with local leaders at unspecified locations, and he stayed at an unnamed hotel. That’s about it. Napolitano’s statement suggests that if a bad guy had gotten his hands on these emails, Stevens could have been in danger because the bad guys would know exactly where to find him. In reality, these emails don’t reveal much more than what was publicly known at the time. On March 25, 2011, Stevens’ predecessor, Ambassador Gene Cretz, said in a press conference that Stevens would soon be traveling to Benghazi. We found at least four State Department daily press briefings between March and April 2011, where a press secretary discussed Stevens’ Benghazi plans with journalists. Quite a few newspaper and television reports at the time said Stevens was in Benghazi meeting with local leaders, such as the New York Times and Fox News. The media reports did not mention that Stevens went into Libya by way of Malta, and that he had set up shop at a hotel. There is, however, an April 11, 2011, Associated Press photo of Stevens meeting with local journalists at the Tibesty hotel in Benghazi, where we now know (as a result of State Department and congressional Benghazi investigations) Stevens had lived and worked in 2011. Now to address the broader point of Napolitano’s statement: that Clinton sent and received classified information. Three of the six emails detailed above were marked ""unclassified."" Regarding the other three, Clinton received information from other State Department employees, and — as we found in a prior story — as head of the agency, she had the authority to say whether information from her department was classified or not. Of course, there’s always the possibility of Clinton emails clearly containing classified or sensitive information about Stevens that have yet to be or never will be released. But Napolitano specified that he was talking about emails already available to the public. Our ruling Napolitano said emails released to the public show Clinton discussed ""the location of Ambassador Stevens, who of course was murdered, in Libya."" To clarify, Stevens was not the ambassador to Libya at the time, and the emails occurred about 18 months before the Benghazi attacks that killed him. Clinton received at least six emails that discussed Stevens’ location in Libya, though the terms are vague -- for example, saying he was in Benghazi at an unidentified hotel. The context of Napolitano’s statement gives the impression that the emails contain information that would have been damaging if released, but it was widely noted in the media at the time that Stevens was in Benghazi, and on at least one occasion, reporters encountered him at the hotel where he was living and working. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/11/andrew-napolitano/did-hillary-clinton-emails-reveal-location-ambassa/

Fiorina: Trump's abortion flip-flop
","Of all the leading Republican candidates, Donald Trump’s credentials on the issue of abortion are the most spotty. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina made sure to highlight this during the first Republican presidential debate. When asked about Trump’s top position in the polls, Fiorina explained that Trump has connected with a legitimate frustration. ""Whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would (be) resolved, the political class has failed you,"" Fiorina said. ""That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into. I would also just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?"" In this fact-check, we assess whether Trump has changed his mind on abortion. Fiorina’s staff apparently was so sure this would come up, a day after the debate, they posted a page on their campaign website with supporting information. They cited articles from the Washington Post and National Journal that documented Trump’s shift from saying he was pro-choice to now saying he is pro-life. 'I am very pro-choice' Trump’s flirtations with a presidential bid have put him on record at various moments in a couple of election cycles. In 1999, he appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press, when he was thinking about a third-party run.  ""I am very pro-choice,"" Trump said. ""I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I hear people debating the subject."" When pressed on whether he would ban a procedure called ""partial-birth"" by abortion foes, Trump said, ""No. I would not. I am pro-choice in every respect as far as it goes, but I just hate it."" In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, Trump affirmed his basic position, but reversed his stand on that one particular procedure. ""There are some issues I don’t want to say much about. I support a woman’s right to choose, for example, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures. When Tim Russert asked me on Meet the Press if I would ban partial-birth abortion if I were president, my pro-choice instincts led me to say no. After the show, I consulted two doctors I respect and, upon learning more about this procedure, I have concluded that I would indeed support a ban."" So, as of 2000, Trump has ""pro-choice instincts."" 'I'm pro-life' In mid February 2011, with Trump again fueling speculation that he would run for president, he spoke at the annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Committee. In his 14-minute speech, he made this simple declaration: ""I am pro-life."" A few months later in April, he sat down with the Christian Broadcasting Network’s political correspondent, who asked if he would really stand by his new belief. Here is what Trump said: ""One thing about me, I’m a very honorable guy. I’m pro-life, but I changed my view a number of years ago. One of the reasons I changed — one of the primary reasons — a friend of mine, his wife was pregnant, in this case married. She was pregnant, and ... he didn’t really want the baby. And he was telling me the story. He’s crying as he’s telling me. They ended up for some reason, amazingly, through luck because they didn’t have the right timing, he ends up having the baby, and the baby is the apple of his eye. He said, it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to him. And you know, here’s a baby that wasn’t going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life."" So, by 2011, Trump opposed abortion. These days, he often re-tells the story about his friend’s unplanned child. A curious interruption Trump clarified his stance on abortion in a January interview with Mark Halperin of Bloomberg News. Trump said the only exceptions to banning abortions would be to protect the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape. But we noted this twist in that brief discussion: Trump: ""With caveats, life of the mother, incest and rape. And that’s where I stand. So I’m pro-life, but with the caveats. It’s life of the mother,very important, incest and rape."" Halperin: ""So say a woman is pregnant and it’s not in any of those exception categories and she chooses to have an abortion, should she --"" Trump: ""It depends when, it depends when. It depends when."" Halperin: ""Well let’s say early in her pregnancy."" Trump: ""Excuse me. If it’s not in any of those -- pro-life.  Mark it’s very simple. Pro-life."" Trump interrupted Halperin to say ""it depends when."" We reached out to Trump’s campaign and asked what he meant. We did not hear back. Our ruling Fiorina said that Trump changed his mind on abortion, and by Trump’s own admission, that is accurate. As late as 2000, he wrote that he was pro-choice. By 2011, he said he was pro-life. Recently, he noted that he thinks exceptions for the life of the mother, incest and rape are appropriate. We find some murkiness in his repetition of ""It depends when,"" but that doesn’t change the fundamental finding.

Fact-checking Donald Trump's claim that 'every poll said I won the debate'
","Donald Trump loves to call people losers. So it’s no surprise that, when commenting on his own performance in the Aug. 6 Republican presidential debate, he declared himself the clear winner. During an Aug. 9 interview on CBS’ Face the Nation, Trump, the current frontrunner for the GOP nomination, told host John Dickerson, ""Most polls, every poll, said I won the debate, which is fine. And I'm sure you have heard that, too. And I think I did win the debate. Some of the candidates told me I won the debate. But I had by far the toughest question. It was not even a contest."" Trump has a point, but we also found bad news for him in some of the polls. We’ll explain. (Trump’s camp did not respond to an inquiry.) We’ll start by noting that instant polls pegged to events like debates tend to be trickier to rely on than the traditional random-dial telephone polls. Anyone can cast their vote in such polls, which means that they do not represent a valid cross-sample of the electorate. That said, Trump would have a point if he were to cite a trio of instant polls taken right after the debate. One, which asked DrudgeReport.com readers who won the debate, found 45 percent of more than 585,000 votes cast went to Trump, triple the 14 percent amassed by the second-place finisher, Ted Cruz. Trump achieved similarly buoyant results in smaller polls sponsored by Time magazine (47 percent) and Slate.com (39 percent). However, at least one other post-debate poll undercuts his claim. A more traditional survey of 904 registered Republicans by Gravis Marketing conducted immediately after the debate on behalf of One America News Network found that Trump finished second, though within the poll’s margin of error. Ben Carson won 22 percent of the vote, compared to 19 percent for Trump. That’s a virtual tie, given the poll’s 3 percentage point margin of error. Interestingly, Gravis also asked survey respondents who they thought lost the debate -- and on this question, 30 percent of respondents cited Trump, a percentage second only to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., with 34 percent. Full results below:  In other words, the same poll showed many more voters -- all registered Republicans, in fact -- saying that Trump lost the debate than said he won. In producing sharply polarized responses toward Trump, the Gravis poll wasn’t an outlier, either. On the same morning Trump made his comments, NBC released a post-debate poll conducted with Survey Monkey. The survey had an unusual methodology -- it included responses from 3,551 adults drawn from the nearly 3 million people who take surveys with Survey Monkey. However, the results have some degree of credibility, since the data was weighted for factors such as age, race, sex, educational attainment and region. These results suggest that the general public showed the same degree of polarization about Trump’s performance as can be seen in Gravis’ poll of Republicans. In the NBC-Survey Monkey survey, 22 percent of respondents said that former CEO Carly Fiorina did best in the debate, compared to 18 percent for Trump. But 29 percent of respondents thought Trump did the worst in the debate -- a percentage twice as high as Paul, his nearest competitor, with 14 percent. Here’s the full rundown:    Finally, a Suffolk University poll of Iowa Republicans was released on Aug. 11, after Trump's comments. It asked people which candidate was most impressive, and Trump's performance was rated fourth-best, behind Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The poll also asked if people felt more or less comfortable with Trump as a candidate after watching the debate; 55 percent said they felt less comfortable. Our ruling Trump said that ""every poll said I won the debate."" He has a point that at least three instant polls -- from the Drudge Report, Time and Slate -- showed him with better showings than any of his rivals, though the non-random design of these polls means they should be taken with a big grain of salt. More problematic for his claim is that the methodologically superior Gravis poll showed him finishing second to Carson, and found more respondents saying he did the worst in the debate than the number who said he did the best.

Clinton accurately says black children with asthma have 500% higher mortality rate
","In her speech to the National Urban League on July 31, Hillary Clinton presented a long list of statistics showing that racial inequality persists in the United States. Among them was this figure: ""African-American children are 500 percent — 500 percent — more likely to die from asthma than white kids."" Clinton claimed that it hit particularly close to home, as it reminded her of her time in the early 1970s working for the Children’s Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group for poor and minority children. That number surprised us, so we decided to see if it was true and, if so, why. Clinton may have underestimated Asthma is a chronic lung disease — an inflammation of the airways that causes coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Around 25 million Americans have asthma, and the rate of asthmatics has been steadily increasing since the early 1980s. While most asthmatics function normally, often using inhalers to aid them in their breathing, asthma attacks can present a serious danger, especially in young children. A 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on childhood asthma data from 1980 to 2005 confirms Clinton’s claim almost verbatim: ""Compared with white children, black children have a 260 percent higher ED (Emergency Department) visit rate, a 250 percent higher hospitalization rate, and a 500 percent higher death rate from asthma."" (Clinton’s campaign confirmed that this was the source she had used.) The report also notes that even though mortality rates from asthma have decreased since 1999 for children in general, no corresponding drop has been seen in the mortality rate of African-American children. There’s also more recent data available that further confirms Clinton’s claim, and even suggests she may have understated the problem. One study from 2014 examines rates of childhood asthma in black and white children, with the most recent data from 2010. Despite making up a much smaller portion of the population, 106 black children died of asthma in 2010, compared to 68 white children. The corresponding rates of death for black and white children respectively are 8.6 per million and 1.2 per million — that means a black child is about 7.2 times more likely to die of asthma than a white child. Even among those children of each race who already had asthma, black children had a mortality rate about 3.5 times higher than white children. Notably, the study also shows that the racial disparity is not as severe for other problems with asthma; while black children have higher rates of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations, the difference in those cases is not as large as it is with the death rate. Using CDC Wonder, a database of public health information, PolitiFact also checked the data for 2013, the last available year. In that time, 123 black children died of asthma compared to 83 white children. That corresponds to a death rate of 10.1 per million for black children and 1.5 per million for white children, which just about matches the 2010 numbers. The disparity for 2011 and 2012 was actually even greater, with the difference just about ten-fold. Why the racial disparity? According to the CDC, nobody is quite sure. ""Reasons for disparities are not well understood and are the subject of research by numerous investigators in university research centers,"" says a statement from the agency’s Air Pollution and Respiratory Health Branch. However, there are studies that provide a couple of clues. For example, one examination of trends in preventive asthma medication use from 1988 to 2008 found that black and Mexican-American children were less likely to use the medication than white children. Another study from 1997 found that inner-city children are more likely to develop allergies as a result of prolonged exposure to cockroach allergens. Since minorities are more likely to live in urban areas, this may go some way toward explaining higher rates of asthma morbidity and mortality. Our ruling Clinton said, ""African-American children are 500 percent — 500 percent — more likely to die from asthma than white kids."" According to a 2006 study from the CDC, she’s right. According to more recent data, she’s slightly off, but only because she has underestimated the gap: In reality, it appears that black children are seven to eight times as likely to die of asthma as white children. We rate her claim True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/11/hillary-clinton/clinton-accurately-says-black-children-asthma-have/

Meme claims Scott Walker 'was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating'
","A reader asked us the other day to check a meme attack on Gov. Scott Walker that keeps making the rounds. She saw it on Facebook. The image in the meme, which apparently began circulating in early 2012, puts a dunce cap on Walker's head. It makes a reference to what would be the failed effort, later that year, to recall the Wisconsin Republican from office. Perhaps because Walker is now running for president, the meme has surfaced again. It said: ""Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating. Is it any wonder he’s attacking teachers now?"" There is no indication on the meme itself of who produced it. Walker has denied being forced out of school. When we asked about the meme, his campaign responded by referring us to a brief comment he made Aug. 8, 2015 at the conservative RedState Gathering in Atlanta. Asked about lacking a college degree, Walker said: ""It's simple. My senior year of college, I got a job offer from the American Red Cross. A lot of my friends who were a year or two older had degrees and no job. I had a job offer, no degree. I'm pretty smart. I took the job."" As we'll see, Walker was a senior when he left for the Red Cross. And although Walker has refused requests to release his college transcripts, there isn't evidence to back the claims in the attack. College days examined Here's what we know about the governor's college days from a widely noted piece we published in December 2013: In February 1988, as a sophomore at Marquette, a Catholic university in Milwaukee, Walker entered a campaign for student government president. The day before the election, the student-produced Marquette Tribune endorsed Walker's opponent, liberal John Quigley, but said Walker was qualified. A controversy ensued. Students told the Quigley campaign they’d seen Walker workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings on campus. The newspaper responded with an election-day editorial headlined, ""Walker unfit."" It decried his ""mudslinging"" and said another factor in its reversal on Walker being qualified was the alleged theft of papers, which Walker’s camp denied. Quigley won handily. Administrators investigated. But we found no paper trail, and could not learn from interviews, what came of that investigation, if anything. For our December 2013 article and at Walker's request, Marquette issued a statement saying Walker ""was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew."" That meant that no conduct issues, academic or otherwise, blocked Walker from continuing in school at the time of his departure. The university also said Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette as well as when he left, and that he ""was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time."" In February 1990, shortly before dropping out, Walker took a job in marketing and fundraising with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. It's also possible he was lured from school by politics. In fall 1990, while still living in the campus area, Walker ran against then-state Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat now in Congress, and lost. Two final notes: 1. In a separate item, also published in December 2013, we rated False a claim by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college ""not long after"" he was ""kicked out of student elections"" at Marquette. After the original article was published, the Democratic Party removed the accusation from its website. 2. As for his grade point average, Walker’s gubernatorial campaign said in 2010 that he had a 2.59 (on a 4.0 scale), about three-tenths of one point higher than the meme claims. But we don't know for sure, because he has refused to release his transcripts. Indeed, when Walker said in February 2015 at the Conservative Political Action Conference that he had ""unsealed"" his college records, we rated his claim False. He had authorized Marquette to issue the statements we noted, but he has not released his transcripts. Our rating An Internet meme says Walker ""had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating."" Walker left school as a senior for a job with the Red Cross, but has not released his transcripts, which has left some to question the move. There is no evidence, however, to prove the grade point average, ""was asked to leave"" or the cheating parts of the claim. We rate it False.

Rafael Cruz, father of Ted Cruz, says 'everybody prayed,' read Bible at schools prior to 1962
","Rafael Cruz is more than just a proud parent to his son, Republican presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Rafael is seen as Ted’s political ""super-surrogate,"" appearing at Tea Party and 9-12 meetings as well as various Republican clubs to speak on his son’s behalf. In a recent interview with the Austin American-Statesman, Cruz talked about more than just his son’s campaign. He lamented court decisions that closed a more God-centric era in public schools. ""Prior to 1962, everybody prayed before school started. In 1962, the Supreme Court banned prayer,"" said Cruz, who is a nondenominational pastor. ""In 1963, they banned the Bible from school. Prior to that, the Bible was the principal textbook in all schools."" We were curious about whether Bible reading and prayer in public schools were as prevalent as Cruz claimed before the Supreme Court stepped in. PunditFact could not reach Cruz for comment, but from what we found it looks like Cruz senior was overstating the breadth of religion in schools. What superintendents said Were school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings really as widespread as Cruz says? Far from it. ""The history of school prayer and Bible reading before the 1960s is complicated, but it is certainly not the case that there was a universal practice on school prayer that applied to all students,"" said Richard Layton, co-author of the 2014 book For the Civic Good: The Liberal Case for Teaching Religion in the Public Schools and an associate professor of religion at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Layton pointed us to a 1961 article from the Religious Education journal, which contained a survey from around 1960 that dealt with school prayer and Bible reading. The survey was mailed to 4,000 school district superintendents around the nation. About 55 percent responded. The survey includes many categories, but there was one clear takeaway: The country was divided on religious education, Bible reading and prayer in schools. Almost half of respondents said ""homeroom devotional services"" were not held in the school district. Of the superintendents who said their districts oversaw homeroom devotionals, only one-third said that all district schools had them, while 17 percent said that only some schools did. They were similarly divided on Bible readings. About 42 percent of superintendents said that schools in their system had them. The remaining 58 percent said readings did not happen in their district. Different schools incorporated religion and Bible discussion in different ways, but the Bible was not the ""principal textbook,"" experts told us. While Bibles may have been passed out in certain schools with other textbooks, this was not always the case. Some schools read passages from the Bible over the speaker, and in others teachers read scripture in front of the class. Whatever their district’s practice, the majority of superintendents felt that their school district was dealing with religion in an ""adequate way."" What state laws said State laws from the early 20th century also show a divide on religion in schools. A 1926 report indicated that only seven states (in addition to the District of Columbia) required Bible reading in all public schools. Another seven states allowed the Bible to be read in public schools but did not require it. Numerous other states were silent on the issue. By 1946, a survey showed that the number of states permitting or requiring Bible reading had increased, according to the 1950 book Church and State in the United States. Thirteen states (and Washington, D.C.) required Bible reading, and 25 more allowed Bible reading. Generally, Bible reading and ""homeroom devotional services"" in public schools were far more prevalent in the southern and northeastern states than elsewhere in the country. Supreme Court’s sweeping change  The Supreme Court decisions that Cruz mentioned had the biggest impact on schools that sponsored Bible readings or prayers. In the 1962 case Engel vs. Vitale, the court overturned a New York law requiring a nondenominational prayer at the beginning of the school day. Although students could opt not to participate, the court reasoned that the law violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which was aimed at preventing government interference with religion. A year later, the court ruled in Abington School District vs. Schempp that school-sponsored Bible readings were also unconstitutional, using similar reasoning as in Engel vs. Vitale. The Supreme Court decisions resulted in bans on government- and school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings in public schools. Private prayers and personal Bible reading were still allowed at school, so they were not entirely ""banned."" Subsequent cases in 1990 and 2000 have dealt with student religious groups meeting on school grounds after hours and student-led prayer before games. (The latter was ruled unconstitutional.) Our ruling Cruz said, ""Prior to 1962, everybody prayed before school started,"" and ""the Bible was the principal textbook in all schools."" Surveys and state laws from the era show school prayer and Bible reading were not as universal as Cruz said. Survey results of superintendents from the time show the nation’s schools were split roughly down the middle when it came to either religious activity. State laws also varied widely, though 38 had laws that at least permitted it (13 required it). This means the Bible textbook was also not the ""principal textbook"" in ""all"" schools. Cruz exaggerated the scope of school prayer and Bible readings before the Supreme Court decisions.

Didn't your experience show you that the pre-existing condition part of Obamacare is crucial, that there are so many people out there like you, but without your means, who wouldn't be alive if it were not for the part of the law that says, insurance companies have to take on people with pre-existing conditions?"" Fiorina responded, ""I absolutely endorse that goal. I did at the time. But guess what? None of that has worked. Demonstrably, if you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent."" A reader asked us to check whether this is correct, so we took a look. The Fiorina camp didn’t respond to inquiries. A look at a recent survey Reducing the influx of patients in emergency rooms was always a significant goal of the Affordable Care Act. Because hospitals by law cannot refuse emergency care, uninsured patients may be left with no option beyond the E.R. even to treat minor health issues. Yet this is an expensive solution for the health care system, since E.R. care costs much more than routine medical care dispensed by general practitioners. By increasing insurance coverage, the thinking went, patients would be steered toward providers who charge less than emergency rooms, saving money for insurers and, ultimately, for patients and taxpayers. So has it worked? The official statistics on emergency-room visits are published on an annual basis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the most recent report -- released in 2014 -- covers 2011, which was well before most elements of the health care law kicked in. So that data set is not helpful in judging the accuracy of Fiorina’s claim. Failing that, the best data we have comes from a survey conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians in March 2015. The most relevant question in that survey was: ""Since January 1, 2014, when the requirement to have health coverage took effect in the Affordable Care Act, the volume of emergency patients in my emergency department has … increased greatly? increased slightly? remained the same? decreased slightly? decreased greatly?"" Here’s the breakdown, based on the responses of 2,098 member physicians of the American College of Emergency Physicians:   Response Percent of surveyed giving this response Increased greatly 28 percent Increased slightly 47 percent Remained the same 17 percent Decreased slightly 5 percent Decreased greatly 0 percent Not sure 3 percent   The finding that only 5 percent of respondents saw any decrease in patients in their emergency room provides some validation for Fiorina’s claim. If this is a valid finding, then the health care law isn’t only failing at one of its main missions, but it’s actually making things quite a bit worse. But Fiorina seems to have garbled her talking point. Fiorina said emergency room visits ""are up over 50 percent"" -- not that a majority of emergency room doctors say they are seeing more patients come for treatment. In reality, the survey does not offer specifics on how many more visits there have been after implementation of the law. And a plurality of respondents suggest that the increases they’ve seen are ""slight,"" which doesn’t sound like a word most people would use to describe a 50-percent increase. Another concern: The American College of Emergency Physicians, as the sponsor of a survey, is not a neutral party in the same way a media pollster is. Also, the survey is what is known as an ""opt-in survey."" Unlike a poll in which the survey company reaches out to a random selection of the desired population, the emergency physicians’ poll is one in which individual respondents have chosen whether or not to participate. Still, the point Fiorina raises is a concern among health-care policy specialists. The magazine Health Affairs noted in July that between 1992 and 2012 the number of patient visits to hospital emergency rooms has risen 47 percent -- from 91 million to 133 million -- even as the number of facilities serving them fell by 11 percent, from 5,035 to 4,460. Given this, 39 percent of E.R.s report daily overcrowding. Again, though, this data is from before the law fully went into effect. Such figures suggest a problem many years in the making, but there’s also concern that the Affordable Care Act specifically has made the problem worse. One theory is that insurance rates have increased faster than the number of doctors available to serve the newly insured patients. This may have led some newly insured patients to fall back on old habits and make the E.R. their first option even for non-emergency care. Our ruling Fiorina said, ""If you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent."" Fiorina has raised a legitimate concern about the health care law, but the eye-popping statistic she cites is not supported either by official federal data or by a recent survey of members of the American College of Emergency Physicians. We rate her claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/10/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-emergency-room-visits-are-50-pe/
