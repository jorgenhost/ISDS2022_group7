Columnist Thomas Sgouros Jr. says federal E-Verify system unfairly denies job to 1 in 7 applicants
","
The panelists on the Dec. 30 edition of Rhode Island PBS's ""A Lively Experiment"" were reviewing 2011 when the topic of Gov. Lincoln Chafee's first year in office came up.

It's an only-in-Rhode-Island phenomenon, said Thomas Sgouros Jr., a columnist with GoLocalProv.com. ""We can have a governor who is sensible, apolitical and owes nothing to nobody and he gets completely trashed by the very same people who say, 'You know, we need a governor who is apolitical, sensible and owes nothing to nobody.'""

As an example, he cited Chafee's decision in January 2011 to stop requiring the state and companies doing business with the state to use the federal E-Verify system to make sure potential employees are not in the United States illegally.

Sgouros defended Chafee’s decision: ""Well, E-Verify is a system that, when it is tested, comes back with something between 10 and 15 percent of people that are false negatives. Right? So [if] you apply for a job, the chances are 1 in 7 that you are going to be denied that job unfairly if everybody is forced to use E-Verify. Now that seems to me like a system worth punting, and Linc Chafee agrees with me, and I applaud him for doing it, but he gets trashed for it.""

We had heard criticism that E-Verify has had problems with accuracy, but we wondered if it is really wrong so often.

PolitiFact Georgia addressed the overall accuracy of E-Verify on Feb. 23, 2011, when the system was being criticized for, among other things, incorrectly giving the green light to people who were in the country illegally. That claim got a Half True.

But Sgouros is making a different assertion -- that 10 percent to 15 percent of those looking for work will be initially rejected by the system. That's what we'll examine here.

First, a little background.

Checking the status of a potential employee through E-Verify involves having a newly hired worker fill out a form that asks basic information and show one or more documents to prove his or her identity.

The employer then goes on line and sends the information to E-Verify. E-Verify usually responds with notification that the worker is allowed to hold a job in the United States. The rest are given a ""temporary nonconfirmation"" designation, which means there's a problem or discrepancy that must be corrected.

Although Sgouros said these are the false negatives he was talking about, they're not necessarily false. Some may be ""true"" negatives because they're not actually authorized to work.

How big is each category?

From 2004 through early 2007, the rate of temporary nonconfirmations had been about 8 percent. But by December 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office was reporting that the rate had shrunk to 2.6 percent, far from the 10 percent to 15 percent Sgouros reported.
Among those nonconfirmations, only 0.3 percent were found to be clearly false negatives.

An independent assessment by the social science research firm Westat, commissioned by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, found that in 2008, 4.7 percent of workers were rejected by the system. But 99.3 percent of the people who should have been approved by the system right away actually were.

And in June of 2011, the immigration agency reported that the rate of nonconfirmation during the 2010 fiscal year had dropped even further, from 2.6 percent down to 1.7 percent, or 1 in 59, again a far cry from 1 in 7.

When we asked Sgouros for his evidence, he sent us two documents.

One was written in 2008 by an official at Intel Corp. who reported that 143 of the 1,363 hiring inquiries it made to E-Verify incorrectly warned that the employee might not be legally eligible to work there. The report pegs that as a rejection rate of 12.21 percent. It's not. It's actually 10.49 percent.

The other was Congressional testimony from 2008 by Mitchell Laird of MLC Enterprises, owner of 24 Burger Kings in Arizona, which was hiring about 900 people per year. He told a U.S. House committee that ""in over 14 percent of our queries, the initial response is something other than 'employment authorized.'"" He did not say how many of the people who received a nonconfirmation deserved it because they didn't have a right to work.

Sgouros said the experiences of Intel and the Burger King franchise, involving a few thousand job seekers, is more significant than the government assessments of the E-Verify program that involve more than 15 million cases.

The ""GAO study doesn't reflect the experience of any particular employer. I'm not sure that a broad area average is going to be a better reflection of the accuracy of the system in the places where it really matters than the experience of this employer or that one,"" he said.

Looking at the average instead of specific cases ""is a way to wash out the shortcomings of the system. . . The error rates are going to be highest in the areas where it matters most.""

We checked with Intel, where spokeswoman Lisa Malloy said that in the past three years the initial rejection rate, once in the double digits, has consistently dropped to below 2 percent. In some years it has been less than 1 percent.

Why the improvement? Intel hires a lot of students as interns; in 2009 E-Verify upgraded its database to add information to include more information about the students. ""When that information was added we saw our experience dramatically improve,"" she said.

So Sgouros' first example is no longer true. But even when we told him about the latest Intel data, he said his concerns remain. ""I'm still with Chafee on this,"" he said.

Calls to the Burger King franchise in Arizona to get updated information were not returned.

There's another twist to this story.

Sgouros suggested that flunking an initial E-Verify test means ""you are going to be denied that job unfairly.""

In fact, if E-Verify -- which can only be done on someone who has just been hired -- can't find evidence that you are authorized to work in the United States, federal law requires the employer to keep you on the job and continue your training until you contest the finding and get a final determination.

Workers have eight business days to appeal. If they don't appeal, the employer can fire them.  Cases are typically resolved within 10 days, according to Paula Grenier, spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

(The number of problems could get even lower. Residents of 21 states can go online to see their status through the agency's E-Verify Self Check system. It's available for Massachusetts residents and should be online for Rhode Island and the rest of the United States sometime in March, Grenier said.)

Our ruling 

Thomas Sgouros said that 10 percent to 15 percent of people screened by the E-Verify system are falsely found to be ineligible to work.

His evidence is two small company studies from 2008 involving a few thousand workers. He claims that those anecdotal cases are more important than the national average.

But the Sgouros statement we're checking would lead viewers to believe that he was talking about the overall accuracy of E-Verify, not just two examples out of more than 300,000 employers who use the system.

Not only that, his examples are outdated. In the case of Intel, the initial rejection rate he cites hasn't been true for three years.

Much larger and more recent government analyses, one by the GAO, found that the initial rejection rate is closer to 2 percent. And some of those people are being told they are not eligible to work in the United States because, well, they're not. That makes the actual rate of mistaken rejections even lower.

The element of truth in his claim is so small, it doesn't even warrant a Mostly False. We rate it False.

"['National', 'Jobs', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Workers', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Obama hired 135,000 bureaucrats
","
The day after a hair’s breadth victory in Iowa, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney powered up his New Hampshire campaign in two events featuring the 2008 Republican nominee, Arizona senator John McCain. A hefty crowd of 300 fans packed into the Peterborough, N.H. town hall Jan. 4, 2012, to hear the man who defeated Romney four years ago now endorse him.

Romney has built his campaign around contrasting himself with President Barack Obama rather than his Republican primary rivals, and this night was no different. He told the crowd that if the goal is to create jobs, you could rely on the private sector, or you could take Obama’s approach. ""You can hire lots of bureaucrats,"" Romney said. ""That’s what the president’s done. He’s added 135,000 people to the government workforce.""

So let’s examine that statement. Did President Obama hire 135,000 bureaucrats?

The Romney campaign sent us the source of that assertion. It comes straight from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and numerically, it’s accurate.  In January of 2009, the month that President Obama took the oath of office, the total number of federal employees, excluding the Postal Service, was 2,064,700.  In November 2011, it was 2,204,800 for a net gain of 140,100. If anything, Romney was cutting the president a bit of slack.

But the story behind the raw number is considerably different than what Romney suggested.

The BLS web site gives a breakdown. There we see that the single biggest area of growth, some 63,000 employees, was in the Department of Defense. Federal hospitals accounted for about 30,000 and a blend of other agencies contributed about 70,000. By the way, if you add all those together, you get more than either Romney or BLS gives for the net increase. That’s due partly to the lack of seasonal adjustments to the data and partly to the survey techniques used at the BLS.

You can unpack the numbers a little further by using a government database tool run by the Office of Personnel Management called Fed Scope. John Palguta, Vice-President for Policy at the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that studies the federal workforce, says using that tool, the trends are clear.

""Just about all of the increases are at the Defense Department, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice,""  Palguta says.

The Office of Personnel Management tallies are done every quarter, not every month, so the numbers don’t exactly match what you find on the BLS web site, but the trends line up. In round figures, from September 2009 to September 2011, the federal workforce grew about 100,000. Counting permanent civilian employees, the departments of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense grew by 53,000 -- more than half of the total. Veterans Affairs provides another 24,000, or about a quarter of the overall increase. Homeland Security contributes 12,000 -- call that another 10%. All told, national defense, assisting veterans, and protecting the national borders account for close to 90% of all federal civilian employee growth.

The numbers fall off quickly after that. The departments of Justice and Health and Human Services are tied at roughly 4,000 each.  

There’s a nuance in Romney’s statement that bears some scrutiny. He talked about hiring lots of bureaucrats which raises the question, is everyone on the federal payroll a paper-pushing practitioner of the dark arts of red tape? Not in the opinion of Palguta.

""The sad fact is that the VA has had to increase staff at the hospitals to care for the wounded warriors coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Palguta says.

There is another connection to veterans behind the single largest increase in manpower at the Defense Department. Tri-Care, the military’s health insurance program added some 5,000 people over the past three years. The general growth of the military over the past decade further drove up that number .

Protecting the country against terrorism also helped grow the ranks of federal workers. Within Homeland Security, the big gainers were the Transportation Security Administration, about 5,000, and a new division called the National Protection and Programs Directorate. Among other duties, the NPPD is charged with preventing attacks on the nation’s communications, water systems, and other infrastructure. While this reflects a consolidation of workers from other divisions, it still added some 2,700 employees to the Homeland Security tally.

Whether Romney would want to give President Obama full blame -- or credit -- for these changes, the Republican candidate’s statement overlooks the reality in Washington that no money gets spent without the consent of Congress. To take one recent vote, the House and Senate passed a spending bill that increases funding for certain areas of defense and both Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security.  Among other details, the measure requires the Border Patrol to achieve an active duty presence of not fewer than 21,370 agents protecting the U.S. border. The bill passed with 81 votes in Senate; one of those votes came from John McCain, the man standing next to Romney in Peterborough.

Historic trends are worth a mention.  The high water mark for government employees was in 1969 when there were 2.3 million workers.   The number today, about 2.2 million, is less than during the second term of President Ronald Reagan. The low water mark came at the end of the Clinton administration but the 9-11 attacks put the country on an upward course during the presidency of George W. Bush.

Our Ruling

Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney cast President Obama as using expanded government to increase employment.  PolitiFact does not attempt to assess motivations. What we can resolve is that in terms of the raw numbers, Romney is right. The country has more federal employees today than it did in 2009.

But Romney referred to those government workers as bureaucrats. This is a loaded term that obscures what most of the new employees actually do. Merriam-Webster lists as one of its definitions of bureaucracy: ""a system of administration marked by officialism, red tape, and proliferation."" That may not bring to mind doctors and nurses caring for wounded veterans or border patrol agents. When we examine the largest areas of growth, we find it is in national defense, veteran care, anti-terrorism and border security.

Finally,  while Romney makes it sound as if this is solely Obama's doing, congressional Republicans and Democrats have approved increases in those areas. If President Obama is responsible for this growth, he had a lot of help from members of Romney’s own party.

We rate Romney’s statement Half True.","[('\n""Employment, Hours, and Earnings""Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed January 5, 2012\n\nFedScope, Office of Personnel Management, accessed January 8, 2012\n\nHistoric Workforce Data,Office of Personnel Management, accessed January 8, 2012\n\nSummary of 2011 Appropriations, Congressional Research Service, accessed January 8, 2012\n\nStatus of Appropriations Legislation for Fiscal Year 2011, Library of Congress, accessed January 8, 2012\n\nHomeland Security Department: FY2010 Appropriations, Congressional Research Service, accessed January 8, 2012', 'http://www.bls.gov/data/#employment')]",/factchecks/2012/jan/09/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-hired-135000-bureaucrats/

Rick Santorum says welfare reform deserves credit for reductions in African-American child poverty
","
Fresh off his near-win in Iowa, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum held a town hall meeting in Brentwood, N.H., with voters on Jan. 4, 2011.

He covered many topics, including one of his favorites: welfare reform.

Santorum, who actively pushed for welfare changes as a member of Congress, talked about the effects of the 1996 reform law, telling the audience, ""Guess what happened? Poverty levels went down to the lowest level ever for ... one of the areas that had the highest level of poverty historically, which is African-American children.""

We looked into the statement and found that Santorum is right that poverty rates declined after the reform’s passage. But opinions differ on the primary cause.

What the reform did

Santorum was first elected to the House in 1991 and helped write the Republicans’ Contract with America, which proposed a major overhaul to the federal welfare system. President Bill Clinton had been elected promising to ""end welfare as we know it."" The legislative battle over just how to do that spanned several years. In 1996, Santorum had moved on to the Senate, helping win passage of a law that transformed welfare from an entitlement -- guaranteeing cash for needy people -- to a temporary assistance program with dollar caps and time limits on what beneficiaries could receive. It shifted most of the administrative work to the states and required recipients to move toward work and financial independence.

The idea was that people on welfare -- who were still poor because benefits did not exceed the poverty line -- would be motivated to seek job training and full employment and end up being better off financially.

For backup to his claim about the reform’s positive effect on black child poverty, Santorum’s campaign pointed us to a 2006 report by the conservative Heritage Foundation. It argued that poverty rates declined following reform and have stayed low even through fluctuations in the economy.

The report’s author, Robert Rector, testified before the House Ways and Means Committee that ""in the quarter century prior to welfare reform, the old welfare system failed to reduce poverty among black children. Since welfare reform, the poverty rate among black children has fallen at an unprecedented rate from 41.5 percent in 1995 to 32.9 percent in 2004.""

We found this U.S. Census chart, which presents slightly different figures for poverty among African-Americans under age 18: 41.5 percent in 1995 but 33.4 in 2004. The general trend, however, is the same.

Rector’s report includes a chart showing that even previous periods of economic expansion did not lead to a significant drop in welfare cases.

""How was the economic expansion of the 1990s different from the eight prior expansions?"" the report asks. ""The answer is welfare reform.""

In an interview, Rector said those patterns have held true even through the current recession.

""There was a sort of structural shift downward around the period of welfare reform,"" he said. ""It really has remained at a substantially lower level, although recessions have an effect.""

Other perspectives

While Rector maintains that the economy played only a secondary role in reducing poverty, other groups says it’s the main driver. After all, welfare reform became law during the longest period of economic growth in U.S. history.

""While there was a decrease in poverty overall in the economic boom of the late 1990s, it was not a result of welfare reform but due to the strength of the broader economy,"" said Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""There was an increase in labor market participation by single mothers during these years, but much of that increase was lost when the economy weakened.""

And Austin Nichols wrote in a 2006 report for the Urban Institute that improvements in the low-wage job market, especially for less-educated workers, benefited black children more than others because their parents tend to have less education.

""We still have welfare reform, but as the low-wage job market weakened, child poverty shot back up,"" Nichols said in an e-mail.

The Census put the child poverty rate for African-Americans at 35.3 percent in 2009. Rector said it’s about 38 percent today.

And a 2011 study by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a private charitable organization that describes its goal as ""helping build better futures for disadvantaged children in the United States,"" said that the last decade has been especially damaging for poor children.

""The official child poverty rate, which is a conservative measure of economic hardship, increased 18 percent between 2000 and 2009, essentially returning to the same level as the early 1990s,"" the report stated.

Our ruling

Santorum credited welfare reform for driving poverty down to the lowest level ever for African-American children.

He’s right that the poverty rate did reach historic lows following the reform’s passage, but the reason why is not so clear cut. There’s good evidence that the policy changes took more people off the welfare rolls by requiring them to work. And working, it follows, makes people better off than reliance on relatively low levels of public assistance. But the booming economy of the late 1990s had a lot to do with former welfare recipients gaining employment, as there were ample jobs to be had. Experts say the law and the healthy employment picture combined to help lift people out of poverty. And recently, as the economy has weakened and unemployment increased, poverty rates have risen, too. On balance, we rate Santorum’s claim Half True.","[('\nFormer Sen.

"['New Jersey', 'Guns', 'Bill Pascrell']","
Bill Pascrell claims no legislation has taken guns away from Americans in past 20 years
","
There’s another gun battle heating up in Congress that not only divides politicians on the right to bear arms, but to carry them across state lines without penalty.

And New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) doesn’t want that to happen.

During a Nov. 16 House hearing, Pascrell spoke against the proposed National Right-To-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. If H.R. 822 becomes law, states that allow people to carry concealed weapons would be required to recognize other states’ valid concealed carry permits. At least 40 states already have some form of reciprocity for out-of-state concealed carry permits. The bill has been referred in the Senate to the Committee on the Judiciary.

In opposing the bill, Pascrell said, ""We haven't had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country -- not one.""

Pascrell’s spokesman, Paul Brubaker said the congressman was specifically referring to federal legislation, noting that his ""point would have beeen clearer had he specified that he was referring to nonviolent, law-abiding gun owners.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found Pascrell’s argument somewhat on target.

But two gun-rights organizations we spoke with say two laws do take guns from people.

Larry Pratt, executive director of Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, and Joe Waldron, legislative director for the Washington state-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, both said a provision of The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned semiautomatic weapons with detachable devices. That, in effect, takes a weapon away from someone who wants it, they said.

Brubaker disagreed.

""The 1994 federal assault weapons ban prohibited for 10 years the possession, transfer, and manufacturing of semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices,"" Brubaker said in an email. ""However, there was a grandfather clause in the bill, and semiautomatic assault weapons that were legally-owned before the ban went into effect were NOT restricted. Those weapons could be transferred and sold within the confines of federal and state laws. … Neither the assault weapons ban, nor any federal prohibition of particular guns from being imported, resulted in the federal government taking legally-owned guns away from Americans.""

Waldron also pointed to The Domestic Violence Gun Ban, more commonly called the Lautenberg Amendment for its author, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). The amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 bans anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense from owning or possessing a firearm, even if the person had it before the conviction. The law requires that person to immediately surrender the weapon – but not necessarily to law enforcement.

That person’s gun and ammunition should be transferred  to a ""third party who may lawfully receive and possess them, such as their attorney, a local police agency, or a federal firearms dealer. In addition, such firearms and ammunition are subject to seizure and forfeiture,"" according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives website.

The result of the Lautenberg Amendment ""is that people have been disarmed of weapons within the past 20 years and they’ve been sent to prison when they’ve been caught in possession,"" Waldron said.

The consequences of one’s actions are central to the issue, according to ATF spokesperson Ginger Colbrun. As an example, she said that if a gun owner is convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, the person’s actions are to blame for him no longer being allowed to possess a weapon -- not the law.

""It really is semantics when you look at it,"" she said.  
But the person still has to give up the gun and to some, that's taking it away.

Our ruling

Pascrell said there hasn’t been any legislation in the past 20 years that took a gun from anyone in the United States. Gun advocates disagree, pointing to the federal crime bill and the Lautenberg Amendment as examples. But the facts are a gun can't be taken from someone who never had it, and having to surrender a gun because of a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction can be construed as it being taken away. We rate Pascrell’s claim Half True.

"['Ohio', 'Deficit', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Rob Portman']","
Senator Rob Portman says federal spending rose 21 percent over three years
","
Sen. Rob Portman voted with a big Senate majority in December to extend the payroll tax holiday, but voiced concerns the same day about a separate $1 trillion bill financing the Pentagon and other federal agencies.

""I just don't think this huge spending bill cuts enough,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""With a 21 percent increase in federal spending over the past three years, Washington needs to cut back just as Ohio families have had to do.""

His news release called spending ""out of control.""

That raised the eyebrows of PolitiFact Ohio. Has spending really increased by more than a fifth in three years?

We asked Portman's office, and were pointed to an analysis issued in November by the Congressional Budget Office.

Its first chart showed total federal outlays for 2008 of $2.98 trillion, compared with $3.6 trillion for 2011 -- an increase of 21 percent.

That confirmed Portman's figure, but the numbers left us with questions. What was responsible for the big and bigger jumps in spending shown in 2008 and 2009, which would have been under the watch of President Bush? (President Obama's first budget was for fiscal 2010.) Why had outlays actually declined in 2010?

We spoke with Jim Horney, vice president for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""The figure is right,"" he said about Portman's statement. But he said it would be wrong to conclude that the number shows a permanent increase in the rate of spending.

The big increase in 2008 and ""really big"" jump in 2009 were mainly, Horney said, ""the result of the downturn, which drives up spending, and of attempts to deal with it.""

The recession, which began in the 2007-2008 fiscal year, drove up spending in areas like unemployment insurance and safety net programs. Attempts to deal with it included the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

""The big (spending) increase was driven by temporary factors. We're sort of leveling off now,"" Horney said.

In the next three-year cycle, he noted, the projected spending of $3.6 trillion for 2012 is only 2.6 percent more than the actual outlays of $3.5 trillion in fiscal 2009-2012. The increase in the previous cycle, 2007-2010, was more than 27 percent.

Portman's figure on spending was correct. But it is significant that the spending crosses administrations and is demonstrably tied to the faltering economy. That’s additional information that provides clarification.

Dewhurst says ballistics tests have confirmed border agent was killed by Fast and Furious weapon
","The same day that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at the LBJ presidential library in Austin, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst of Texas called for Holder's resignation in a post on his campaign website that pointed to the ""Fast and Furious scandal"" as the ""latest evidence that Holder is failing to perform his duties in a competent manner."" The Dec. 13, 2011, post said the federal government's ""walking"" of guns — into the hands of criminals and across the U.S.-Mexico border — had endangered people in both countries. ""Ballistic tests have confirmed that the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent was caused by one of the DOJ-walked weapons,"" the post says, referring to the U.S. Department of Justice. We wondered whether Dewhurst, who is seeking the U.S. Senate seat to be vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison, was right about what ballistics tests found. First, some background: Fast and Furious was a multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation that took place in Arizona from late 2009 to early 2011 and was led by the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, an agency of the Justice Department. In the operation, agents allowed firearms to be illegally purchased in Arizona, with the goal of tracking at least some guns to Mexican drug cartels and eventually building a case against cartel leaders. Along the way, though, agents lost track of at least 1,300 guns — with some subsequently linked to crimes in Mexico and the United States, including the Dec. 14, 2010, slaying of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in Arizona. Dewhurst's campaign did not respond to our requests for information supporting his campaign's claim that ballistics information confirmed Terry's killing by a Fast and Furious weapon. We reviewed news reports, congressional reports and public testimony, which indicated that two Fast and Furious guns were recovered from the scene of Terry's shooting. However, we found no federal ballistics information confirming that the bullet that killed Terry was fired from one of the guns. According to a press release from the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix, Terry was shot during a firefight with a group of armed ""illegal aliens"" while on patrol with other agents in a canyon near Rio Rico, Ariz. — about 10 miles north of the border city of Nogales. The slaying helped push Fast and Furious into the national spotlight, and the operation is under investigation by the Justice Department's inspector-general, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Eleven months after the shooting, Holder told a Senate panel on Nov. 8, 2011, that ""any instance of so-called gun walking is simply unacceptable"" and that ""regrettably, this tactic was used as part of Fast and Furious, which was launched to combat gun trafficking and violence on our Southwest border."" Holder continued, telling the Judiciary Committee that ""this operation was flawed in its concept and flawed in its execution, and unfortunately we will feel the effects for years to come as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in Mexico."" News organizations have widely reported that the two rifles found at the scene of Terry's slaying were part of Fast and Furious.

According to a July 21, 2011, Los Angeles Times article, ATF supervisors acknowledged in emails two days after Terry’s slaying that the guns were part of the botched operation. And according to a Sept. 11 Times story, the Phoenix ATF field office sent out an agency-wide bulletin the day after Terry’s death saying that the guns were Fast and Furious weapons. Separately, a June 14, 2011, report released by Grassley and U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who leads the House oversight committee, includes a copy of a Dec. 15, 2010, ATF email that says: ""The two firearms recovered by ATF this afternoon near Rio Rico, Arizona, in conjunction with the shooting death of U.S. Border Patrol agent Terry were identified as 'Suspect Guns' in the Fast and Furious investigation."" Grassley has offered yet more support for the link, through news releases, written statements prepared for congressional hearings, and direct questioning of administration officials. A digital collection of documents on the senator's website includes a copy of a Justice Department email dated Dec. 17, 2010, to Gary Grindler, then the acting deputy attorney general. The email notes that a border agent was killed in Arizona earlier that week and says two weapons recovered from the scene had been linked to Jaime Avila Jr., ""a straw firearms purchaser that ATF and USAO (U.S. attorney's office) for Arizona have been investigating since November 2009 as part of its larger Fast and Furious operation."" During the November 2011 hearing, Holder did not dispute the statement, repeated frequently by senators, that the guns at the scene of Terry's slaying were part of Fast and Furious. However, in response to a question from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, about whether he had apologized to Terry's family, Holder said that it's unfair ""to assume that the mistakes that happened in Fast and Furious directly led to the death of Agent Terry."" He did not elaborate. So, it appears to be undisputed that two Fast and Furious guns were present at Terry's killing. And what of the ballistics testing? The only information we found about ballistics testing and Terry's death was an FBI report completed shortly after the shooting. The report, dated Dec. 23, 2010, says that the bullet that killed Terry could have been fired from the kind of guns that were found at the scene but that ""firearms examinations"" could not determine if the bullet came from either of the found weapons. The report — posted online July 26, 2011, by the Times and described in a story the next day — says the bullet ""was fired from a barrel rifled with four grooves, right twist, such as the K2 and K3 rifles"" — the guns found at the scene. ""However,"" the report says, ""due to a lack of sufficient agreement in the individual microscopic marks of value, it could not be determined if the … bullet was fired from the barrel of the K2 or K3 rifles."" Neither the FBI nor the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego, which is handling the Terry case, would comment to us about ballistics tests. Finally, we talked with the House oversight committee and Grassley's office. Becca Watkins, a spokeswoman for committee Chairman Issa, told us that the Times' reporting about the FBI report was accurate, although she said the committee is waiting for the Justice Department to respond to requests for more information. ""The ballistics report for the guns recovered at Agent Terry's crime scene do not rule out the Operation Fast and Furious guns as the weapon in his death,"" she said. But she suggested that it wasn't accurate to say that the report confirmed one of them was responsible for his death. At a Dec. 8, 2011, hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, asked Holder whether the department had ""identified the weapon that actually killed Agent Terry."" Holder replied that he was ""not prepared to talk about that"" because the investigation is ongoing. Our ruling By all accounts, Fast and Furious weapons were found at the scene of a U.S. agent's death. Dewhurst's campaign was emphatic, though, that ballistics tests confirmed that the weapons killed the agent. We found no information indicating that's so. Dewhurst's statement rates False.","[('David Dewhurst U.S. Senate campaign website, post, ""Dewhurst calls for Attorney General Eric Holder’s resignation,"" Dec. 13, 2011', 'http://www.dewhurstfortexas.com/latest-news/dewhurst-calls-attorney-general-eric-holders-resignation'), ('New York Times, news article, ""Holder, grilled on gun inquiry, says he won’t resign,"" Dec. 8, 2011', 'No link'), ('Arizona Republic, news article, ""ATF gun probe: Behind the fall of Operation Fast and Furious,"" Nov. 27, 2011', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/us/politics/holder-clashes-with-republicans-on-fast-and-furious.html'), ('Los Angeles Times, news articles on ""ATF\'s Fast and Furious scandal,"" Feb. 2, 2011 through Dec. 24, 2011 (accessed Dec. 21, 2011)', 'No link'), ('Los Angeles Times, documents related to Fast and Furious scandal (accessed Dec. 21, 2011)', 'http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2011/11/12/20111112atf-gun-probe-operation-fast-and-furious-fall.html'), ('Los Angeles Times, news article, ""ATF sought to downplay guns scandal, emails show,"" July 21, 2011', 'No link'), ('Los Angeles Times, news article, ""FBI report at odds with ATF claim on weapons,"" July 27, 2011', 'http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/atf-fast-furious-sg,0,3828090.storygallery'), ('Los Angeles Times, news article, ""Gun story had misgivings about ATF sting,"" Sept. 11, 2011', 'No link'), (""Los Angeles Times, document, ballistics report from Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's slaying, posted July 26, 2011"", 'http://documents.latimes.com/fast-and-furious/'), ('Congressional Research Service, report, ""Gun Control Legislation,"" Nov. 7, 2011', 'No link'), (""U.S. attorney's office, District of Arizona, press release, May 6, 2011"", 'http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/21/nation/la-na-0722-fast-furious-emails'), ('U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, website, ""Operation Fast and Furious,"" accessed Dec. 28, 2011', 'No link'), ('U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, transcript of hearing, Nov. 8, 2011 (accessed via Nexis)', 'http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-fast-furious-fbi-20110727,0,808389.story'), ('U.S. Rep.

Rick Perry says Barack Obama is a socialist
","
In our super-heated political discourse, explosive words get tossed around pretty easily these days. Hitler comparisons and terms like Nazi and socialist have become the currency of political attacks not just in the blogosphere but also by elected officials.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry launched such an attack at a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 8, 2012.

Asked if he agreed with Sen. John McCain that President Barack Obama ""is a patriot,"" Perry replied:

""I make a very proud statement and, in fact ,that we have a president that's a socialist. I don't think our founding fathers wanted America to be a socialist country. So I disagree with that premise that somehow or another that President Obama reflects our founding fathers. He doesn't. He talks about having a more powerful, more centralized, more consuming and costly federal government.

""I am a Tenth Amendment believing governor. I truly believe that we need a president that respects the Tenth Amendment, that pushes back to the states. Whether it's how to deliver education, how to deliver health care, how to do our environmental regulations. The states will considerably do a better job than a one-size-fits-all Washington, D.C. led by this president.""

This was not the first time Perry has used the term against Obama. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas trace the origins to at least June 2008 when Perry told a Republican group that a European plan for cutting global poverty was ""the type of socialistic program that Obama wants to bring to America.""

More recently, Perry told Fox News last November that, ""I think Barack Obama is a socialist.""

A similar claim has been made by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who wrote a book titled To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine.

We've addressed Republican charges of Democrats being socialists before. In 2008, we explored a claim by Sarah Palin based on Obama's conversation with Joe the Plumber (as Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher came to be known after that conversation) that Obama's tax policy was socialism (Pants on Fire). Last year, PolitiFact Oregon and other PolitiFact state sites checked a claim by bloggers that 70 House Democrats are socialists (Pants on Fire).

Asked about his Obama-is-a-socialist claim in November, Perry said, ""When you talk about printing money and spending government money, and trying to spend it out. That conversation he had with Joe the Plumber -- kind of redistribute the wealth -- the best I can tell, that's socialism.""

But as we explained in our examination of Palin and Joe the Plumber's statements, Obama's tax policy relies on the same progressive approach that has been the cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863, an approach embraced by Republicans and Democrats. It was based on the Tax Act of 1862, which President Abraham Lincoln signed, and which imposed a ""duty of three per centum"" on all income over $600, and five percent on income over $10,000.

The idea is that the wealthy pay a larger share of their income because they are more able to afford it. To the extent the government then gives some of the money to the less-wealthy through various programs, you could say the income is being redistributed. But that concept has been embraced by Republicans and Democrats for well over a century.

That's a far cry from true socialism, which is defined as support for ""governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.""

That's enough for us to set the Truth-O-Meter ablaze, but let's dig a little deeper to explore whether Obama's main policies can accurately be called socialism.

* The health care law. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has called the Democratic health care law ""job-killing,"" a claim we rated False. Is it possible it's also socialism? (If it is, we should note that anything that kills jobs isn't very good socialism!)

In fact, the health care law relies largely on the free enterprise system, an economic approach that Perry usually speaks about fondly. To increase health care coverage for the uninsured and people in small business, the law sets up exchanges to encourage private health insurance companies to compete. (In 2010, we chose the Republican claim that the law was a ""government takeover"" as our Lie of the Year.)

* The economic stimulus. In February 2009, Obama and the Democrats muscled through the $787 billion spending package to try to jump-start the economy. The program was about one-third tax cuts and two-thirds government spending on everything from clean energy initiatives to electronic speed-limit signs.

It's true that government payrolls were stabilized or grew because of the new money, but it was nowhere near a government takeover of our private enterprise economy.

* The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). When Obama took office, he inherited the TARP, the Bush administration's plan for stabilizing the economy. It was designed to prevent financial firms from collapsing by buying assets and stakes in the companies. In December 2008, President George W. Bush authorized use of the money for loans to U.S. automakers.

Obama has emphasized he was not eager for the U.S. government to be involved in such efforts but that he felt they were necessary. ""If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout,"" he said in his 2010 State of the Union Address, adding that ""if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today.  More businesses would certainly have closed.  More homes would have surely been lost. So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program.  And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable.  And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks.""

Many Republicans opposed the TARP -- an initiative of a Republican administration -- because they felt it was too much government intrusion into the private enterprise system. This is the one area where you could even begin to make a case that the government was taking ownership, but as a percentage of the full U.S. economy, it was relatively small and temporary.

So add them up, and it amounts to flimsy evidence to even begin to argue that the Obama is on a path toward socialism.

""Socialism means public ownership of the means of production. Obama does not believe this. Therefore he is not a socialist,"" conservative economist Bruce Bartlett told PolitiFact in an e-mail. ""Although it is true that the federal government did come to own some private businesses as a consequence of bailout policies initiated by the George W. Bush administration such as TARP, the Obama administration sold many of them -- such as its shares in GM -- as quickly as feasible. A true socialist would have held on to them.""

Dan Mitchell, a scholar on fiscal policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, says there are other words for Obama's expansion of government (he thinks fascism is a fair term), but that it's not accurate to call it socialism.

Daniel N. Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University Law School, said ""it is a lie"" to say Obama is a socialist. ""If he is a socialist, so were Eisenhower and Bush Sr.""

Our ruling

There are plenty of ways to have a meaningful, substantive conversation about the differences of the Republicans and Democrats in tax policy, economics and the role of government. But it's simply preposterous for Perry -- and Gingrich -- to refer to Obama's policies as socialism or to say he is a socialist. Obama's policies may have expanded government, but they don't justify this ridiculous hyperbole. We're reaching for the matches -- Pants on Fire!","[('\nNBC News, Transcript of NBC-Facebook debate, Jan. 8, 2012', 'http://presspass.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/08/10049650-read-the-nbc-news-facebook-debate-transcript'), ('\nFrum forum, Is Obama a Socialist?

Newt Gingrich says that EPA didn't know why it cited a New Hampshire dump
","
Excessive government regulation commanded a good portion of the NBC News-Facebook GOP debate on Meet the Press on the morning of Jan. 8, 2012.

During the debate, former Speaker Newt Gingrich was asked about his idea to replace the Environmental Protection Agency. Gingrich was quick to criticize the government agency designed to ""protect human health and the environment.""

""If you look at the EPA's record, it is increasingly radical,"" Gingrich said. ""It's increasingly imperious. It doesn't cooperate, it doesn't collaborate, and it doesn't take into account economics. The city of Nashua recently had a dump that was cited by EPA. They went down to find out, what was it being cited for? And they told them, frankly, ‘We don't know. We can't find the records that lead to this citation, and we're not exactly sure what it referenced. But it must be bad or we wouldn't have sent it out.’""

We wondered whether Gingrich’s vague classification of an EPA citation really went down that way.

First we contacted Gingrich’s campaign to find out how the speaker came up with this example, but they never got back to us.

We turned to Nashua Telegraph reporter Albert McKeon, who did a story on the city’s EPA problem last month, to see if Gingrich explained the situation accurately.

As far as ""a citation"" goes, McKeon said Gingrich framed that explanation incorrectly.

EPA didn't give the dump a citation. Rather it put it on a list, McKeon said. ""The description for the list itself is very vague. It says it doesn’t imply any organization has committed any violation, it just triggered them to be on a list of being watched.""

McKeon reported that Four Hills Landfill in Nashua had appeared on three months’ worth of the EPA’s watch lists for supposed violators of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Resource Conservation and Recovery (for hazardous waste) acts.

The purpose of the watch list, however, seemed a little fuzzy.

According to the EPA Web site, the watch list exists ""to facilitate dialogue between EPA, state and local environmental agencies on enforcement matters relating to facilities with alleged violations identified as either significant or high priority.""

Being on the watch list does not mean a facility has violated the law, according to the agency, but only that an EPA investigation, or a state or local environmental study, has led an organization to assert an unproven violation has occurred.

""Being on the watch list does not represent a higher level of concern regarding the alleged violations that were detected, but instead indicates cases requiring additional dialogue between EPA, state and local agencies -- primarily because of the length of time the alleged violation has gone unaddressed or unresolved,"" the EPA site says.

The reason Nashua’s dump made the list also was vague, McKeon said.

EPA spokesman Dave Deegan, working at the agency’s Boston offices, told McKeon a ""data lag"" on the watch list, which cited a long-ago state Department of Environmental Services action against the Nashua landfill, got Four Hills on the list. But Four Hills had had no violations in recent memory and was in compliance with environmental standards, Deegan said.

""Nashua had no idea they were on the list, and the EPA, quite frankly, didn’t either,"" McKeon said. ""(Deegan) said it was a violation in the past. He said they were not really sure what it was, but somehow it got transferred to the EPA's database, and it shouldn’t be on there because there were no problems with Nashua.""

Nashua being on the list was more a matter of not keeping records up-to-date. Nashua is not currently under any scrutiny for any violations, according to the city and the EPA.
 
Our ruling:

Gingrich said the EPA cited a Nashua landfill without knowing its reason for doing so. The landfill  made a ""watch list"" for an outdated action, but it was not cited or fined for any violation by the EPA for being on the list.

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama didn't expand U.S. trade deals
","
During the Jan. 7, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama’s trade policies. 
""We have to open up markets for our goods,"" Romney said. ""We haven't done that under this president. European nations and China over the last three years have opened up 44 different trade relationships with various nations in the world. This president has opened up none."" 
We won’t check the claim about European and Chinese trade deals here, but we will look at whether Romney is correct about Obama’s record on trade agreements. 
After lengthy negotiations, Obama signed trade agreements with three separate nations on Oct. 21, 2011 -- South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. 
These were not trivial deals. The one with South Korea, in particular, was ""the largest trade deal since 1994,"" when the U.S. approved the North American Free Trade Agreement, Bloomberg News reported at the time, citing administration data. The South Korea deal was poised to increase U.S. export access ""for everything from cars to farm goods,"" Bloomberg wrote. 
All three deals were initially forged under President George W. Bush, but Bush was unable to get the deals past a Democratic-controlled Congress. 
After the GOP took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections, Congressional Republicans pointed to the proposed deals as rare areas of possible cooperation between the two parties. But implementation negotiations initially stalled amid administration insistence on securing protections for workers. During the 2008 campaign, Obama had promised to ""use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world."" 
Even though negotiations with lawmakers dragged on, the administration was ultimately able to secure a legislative formulation that could garner enough votes to pass. Doing so required some political risk for the president with his own base, since a sizable faction within his own party is skeptical of expanding free trade agreements. (Public Citizen, a group that opposed all three agreements, produced a detailed comparison of what Obama promised and what the trade agreement with South Korea contains.) 
We asked the Romney camp for their view, and a spokesman said that Romney was referring to new deals initiated and completed by this administration, rather than deals initiated during the previous administration and closed by Obama. But we think that's a misleading standard. If that's what Romney means, he's effectively stripping Obama of any credit for enactment of the three trade agreements, when in fact bringing them to fruition required significant negotiating efforts with lawmakers of the opposite party (and led to an achievement that eluded his predecessor, Bush). 
Our ruling 
It did take the better part of three years for Obama and Congress to enact the languishing South Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements. But ultimately he did reach an accord with lawmakers that enabled the agreements’ relatively easy passage in both the House and the Senate, including strong support from Republicans as well as the votes of several dozen Democratic lawmakers.

Rick Santorum says Republicans’ Medicare plan would give seniors same benefits that Congress members receive
","
Every American should have access to the health care benefits that members of Congress enjoy.

That’s an oft-repeated grumbling about the Washington elite, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum acknowledged that he hears it from voters on the campaign trail.

""Well, you know, I hear this all the time. ... I've been campaigning around the state, you know, ‘We should have the same kind of health care that members of Congress have,’"" he said during a Jan. 8, 2012, primary debate in New Hampshire.

""Well, that's pretty much what Paul Ryan's plan is. … The members of Congress have a premium support model. So does every other federal employee,"" he said.

Santorum was referring to the budget proposal introduced by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chair of the House Budget Committee. Known as The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America’s Promise, Ryan’s plan reduces federal spending through changes to entitlement programs including Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for Americans 65 or older.

Santorum isn’t the first to say that Ryan’s vision for Medicare mirrors Congress members’ health insurance. But PolitiFact has investigated and found that the plans are not the same.

Medicare vs. the Ryan plan

Right now, Medicare is a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals and sets fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.)

Under Ryan’s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government ""premium support"" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (Ryan’s plan specifically says this is not a ""voucher"" program, since the government will pay the insurance companies directly.) Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care.

Ryan’s plan explains it this way: ""When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.""

There’s the comparison again.

Ryan’s proposal requires the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which is how members of Congress buy their insurance.

So how are the two systems alike?

In Ryan’s budget, Medicare plans from private insurers would be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as are plans that cover members of Congress.

Also, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to compare different plans and select from different insurance options, as members of Congress do. The government would pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress.

How are they different?

First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.)

Second, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise their rates, through a formula known as ""Fair Share."" Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent. Federal support for premiums in Ryan’s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs.

Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000.

Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired, living on a fixed income. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Our ruling

Keeping in mind that Ryan’s Medicare proposal is only a broad outline right now, what we do know about it strikes us as fundamentally different from the health insurance that members of Congress receive, and on the point that matters most: cost to beneficiaries.

At a minimum, the premium supports will not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income on average than members of Congress and likely will not have the same options to buy more expensive plans. Finally, they will not enjoy the same protection against rising costs that ""Fair Share"" provides members of Congress. We rate Santorum’s statement Mostly False.","[('\nPolitiFact, ""Mike Pence said the Republican Medicare proposal will allow seniors to buy the same kind of health care as Congress,"" April 13, 2011', 'https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-plouffe-pence-van-hollen/story?id=13340725&page=3'), (""\nNBC News Republican presidential debate, Jan. 8, 2012, transcript accessed via Nexis\n\nThis Week with Christiane Amanpour, interviews with Rep.

Jon Huntsman says President Barack Obama threw deficit reduction plan 'in the garbage can'
","
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman suggested President Barack Obama damaged trust in the executive branch by ignoring a 2010 bipartisan proposal to chop the deficit.

Huntsman, a Republican candidate for president, made the claim at an NBC-Facebook debate in Concord, N.H., on Jan. 8, 2012.

""When the American people look at the political process play out, they hear all the spinning and all the doctrinaire language, and they still walk away with the belief that they're not being represented in Congress, that there's no trust in the executive branch,"" he said. ""And the Simpson-Bowles bipartisan proposal lands right on the desk of Barack Obama, and it lands in the garbage can.""

He was referring to a proposal that grew out of Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, established in February 2010, and chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and former Democratic White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles. 

In December 2010, the commission released its final report, which included dozens of proposals to cut discretionary spending, reform the tax code and Social Security and rein in health care costs, among other measures.

We wondered — did Obama discard the policy proposals suggested by the the deficit commission?

We've checked similar claims before, and think there's better evidence they landed in a desk file than a round file.

Claim: Obama failed 'to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions' 
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in a speech in September 2011 that Obama failed ""to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions of the Simpson-Bowles Commission."" 
Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey rated Christie's claim Mostly False.

They found that the president did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations at the outset but that Obama later outlined deficit reduction measures similar to those proposed by the commission. 

Even the commission’s co-chairs, Simpson and Bowles, said so.

""We are encouraged that the president has embraced a balanced, comprehensive approach to deficit reduction similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Commission report,"" Bowles and Simpson said in an April 13, 2011, press release.

Alice Rivlin, a member of the commission and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under Clinton, told PolitiFact New Jersey she was disappointed that the president didn't endorse the commission's recommendations immediately but agreed that Obama later embraced some of its proposals.

A former policy adviser to Clinton said Obama has ""approached the report very carefully.""

""He's kept it at arms' length,"" Bill Galston, now a senior fellow at Brookings, told PolitiFact New Jersey. Obama is ""not exactly rejecting it,"" Galston said, but ""not exactly embracing it either.""

Claim: Obama 'took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas'

In April 2011, John Boehner told ABC News that Obama, ""took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas. Not one.""

PolitFact rated Boehner's claim False.

PolitiFact looked at the commission’s final report, which was released in December 2010; the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, which was released in February 2011; and a fact sheet released by the White House following Obama’s budget speech at George Washington University in April 2011.

The commission’s report offered no shortage of recommendations for the White House to choose from -- more than 70, in fact. Based on our analysis of these three documents, as well as our discussions with independent budget experts, we found many policies now advocated by Obama had been included in the bipartisan commission’s final report. However, in many cases the White House proposals either differed in some of the details or lacked details entirely. 
Here's an abbreviated version of what we found. (For more explanation, visit the original fact-check.)

First are two recommendations by the commission that were included in the president’s budget proposal:

• Allow the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to increase premiums. 

• Increase government authority and funding to reduce Medicare fraud.

These two items by themselves show Boehner was wrong to say that none of the commission’s recommendations were included — and it was similarly inappropriate for Huntsman to declare the proposal went from Obama's desk in the garbage can.

Next, we listed six of the commission’s recommendations that were included in the president’s budget with slight differences.

• Eliminate ""in-school subsidies"" for the federal student loan program. 

• End the reliance on deficit spending to fund the transportation trust fund. 

• Freeze pay for federal workers and Defense Department civilians.

• Overhaul the medical malpractice system. 

• Reform the corporate tax system. 

• Increase government efficiency.

Finally, the White House ""framework"" on deficit reduction refers very generally to seven of the commission’s recommendations. In several of these examples, the White House proposal offers less detail than the commission’s.

• Cut both security and non-security spending. 

• Implement structural tax reform. 

• Reform Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate mechanism. 

• Establish a long-term global budget for federal health care spending.

• Eliminate state ""gaming"" of Medicaid. 

• Reduce agricultural subsidies. 

• Create a mechanism to enforce adherence to debt stabilization.

We reached out to Huntsman's campaign for evidence for his claim but didn't hear back the day of the debate. 
Our ruling

Huntsman used a metaphor to describe what happened to the deficit reduction proposal. ""The Simpson-Bowles bipartisan proposal lands right on the desk of Barack Obama, and it lands in the garbage can,"" he said.

But our research shows that, while he didn't embrace the entire document, some of its ideas emerged in Obama's budget proposals released more than a month later.

Mitt Romney, once again, says U.S. is 'inches away from no longer being a free economy'
","
Mitt Romney continues to repeat the talking point that the United States is ""only inches away from no longer being a free economy."" But we’ve ruled it Pants on Fire twice-- and now he's achieved a PolitiFact hat trick.

During the Jan. 7, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney once again stated, ""We're only inches away from no longer being a free economy.""

Previously, Romney had said essentially the same thing during a Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, and in his June 2, 2011, presidential announcement at a farm in Stratham, N.H.

As we indicated when we first checked this claim in June, we at PolitiFact tolerate a bit of hyperbole from politicians on all sides when they’re trying to make a point. So we’re not literally using a ruler to measure distances here. However, we decided that the underlying question -- whether the United States could really be approaching socialism -- is a fair one to analyze.

Here are some of the statistics to consider:

Government spending

On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. 
For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited.

Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, told us at the time that Romney is ""implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent,"" Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s footprint in GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit.

And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion.

""It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom,"" Bartlett said. ""Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about."" 
Here are a few other statistics to consider.

Taxes

Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011.

And as we concluded in a separate fact-check, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage.

Regulation

""One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.)

However, there’s strong evidence undercutting Romney's claim that comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011-- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom.

Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded.

The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the ""mostly free"" category. The only nations to be considered more ""free"" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark.

If the results of this study -- which, we’ll remind readers, was produced by a staunchly conservative think tank -- suggest that the U.S. is on the verge of socialism, then Lenin must be partying in his mauseoleum. For the U.S. to fall into the ""mostly unfree"" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan.

We did hear one argument that provided a measure of support for Romney’s position -- but only in a backhanded way.

Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a think tank that does economic and social policy research, said Romney’s comparison is imperfect because over the past century, there really hasn’t been a golden age in which the economy was genuinely unfettered, so the U.S. really couldn't be inching away from such an age.

""We’ve been a mixed economy for a long time,"" Steuerle said. ""The ‘free market’ is a somewhat vague term. Technically, a Federal Reserve system and an antitrust division of the Justice Department interfere with a totally free market economy, yet they may promote a competitive economy.""

Our ruling

It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank.

Last June and August, we found this claim to merit a Pants on Fire. Nothing has changed our view. We rate Romney's statement Pants on Fire.

""We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states,"" Huntsman said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005. 
Huntsman and the Legislature achieved that goal with two changes in tax law over two years. 
When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent. 
This created a much flatter tax, stripping away most deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bonds or deducting withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts. 
The research arm of the Utah Legislature says this was not a flat tax in the purest sense. ""Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (In a progressive tax system, the tax rate on the last dollar of income earned rises as you go up the income scale, meaning that richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than do poorer people.) 
Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit on state taxes a portion of their federal tax deductions and exemptions. The credit phases out and goes away for those making very high incomes in the state. 
This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis. 
""There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study. 
Anti-tax groups have given Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax. 
The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some ""minor blemishes""' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.) 
So the system he and the Legislature enacted in Utah wasn’t a pure flat tax, since taxpayers may still make adjustments for certain financial factors, but it is a flatter tax, and it includes one major defining factor of a flat tax, a single rate for all income groups. 
Job creation 
When we asked the Huntsman campaign in September for data to back up the claim, they directed us to a blog post at National Review Online, the website of the well-known conservative magazine. The item, posted June 20, 2011, compared employment statistics for several governors. 
At PolitiFact, we always double-check data in media reports against official statistics, so we did so here. 
We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment statistics. We looked at the Current Employment Statistics database for each of the 50 states and subtracted the number of jobs in January 2005 from the number in August 2009. 
As it happens, this period was split between an expansion (2005 through 2007) and a deep recession (2008 and 2009), so a majority of states actually lost jobs over that period. Utah was not one of the job-losing states -- but it also wasn’t No. 1 in the nation, according to this set of statistics. 
The states with the fastest employment growth over the period when Huntsman was governor were Wyoming, with a 9.5 increase; North Dakota, with 7.5 percent; Texas, with 6.5 percent; and Utah, with 4.8 percent. 
This would suggest that Huntsman’s Utah actually trailed Perry’s Texas, earning it a False. But that’s not the whole story. 
When we showed our math to the Huntsman camp, they stood by their numbers. They sent us to a page for the state of Utah on the BLS website that backed up the claim Huntsman made during the debate -- the number of jobs in Utah rose by 5.9 percent over the period. Using the equivalent pages for the other three states, we found that Utah exceeded them all -- Texas grew by 4.9 percent, as Huntsman indicated, while Wyoming grew by 4 percent and North Dakota grew by 3 percent. 
Using these figures, Huntsman was correct. So what gives? 
When we checked with the BLS, a spokesman explained that the way we calculated the numbers and the way the Huntsman camp calculated the numbers are different because the numbers come from different data sets. The data we used come from the Current Employment Statistics, a monthly study of the payroll data at 400,000 businesses, whereas the Huntsman campaign was using data from the Current Population Survey, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households. 
Is one of these data set preferred in this context? The BLS’s answer is yes -- and the preferred method is not the one used by the Huntsman campaign. ""BLS uses changes in the payroll survey to describe job gain or loss,"" said spokesman Gary Steinberg. 
We’ll note one additional factor. For claims like these, where elected officials suggest that they deserve credit for an achievement (or that their opponent deserves blame for a failure), PolitiFact attempts to determine whether the politician in question does in fact deserve credit or blame. 
In the case of job creation, Huntsman, as governor, played some role, but there were so many other factors at play -- from the state of the national economy to the particular climate for specific industrial sectors in the state to broader demographic trends -- that we think it’s a stretch for Huntsman to claim a significant share of the credit. That’s particularly because he credited just one portion of his efforts in office, the tax overhaul, with the job-creation numbers. 
Our ruling 
Huntsman didn’t create a pure flat tax in Utah, but he did create a flatter one. As for jobs, the Utah economy did well, but it did not outpace Texas in job creation using the yardstick most economists -- and the Bureau of Labor Statistics itself -- use. We also don’t think it’s valid for Huntsman to claim as much credit as he does for himself and his tax changes for the jobs numbers. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.","[('\nABC\xa0News-WMUR-Yahoo\xa0debate,\xa0Manchester, N.H.,\xa0Jan.\xa07, 2012,\xa0accessed via\xa0CQ Transcriptswire\xa0(subscribers only)', 'http://www.le.state.ut.us/lrgc/briefingpapers/IncomeTaxPresentationJan2010.pdf'), ('\nPolitiFact, ""Jon Huntsman touts record on taxes, job creation in New Hampshire debate,"" Oct. 12, 2011', 'No link'), ('\nUtah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel,""What happened to taxpayers under Utah\'s\xa0individual\xa0income tax?"" presentation, Jan 26, 2010', 'http://www.imakenews.com/cppa/e_article000800860.cfm?x=b11,0,w'), ('\nCenter for Public Policy and Administration at the University of Utah,analysis of tax law, April 25, 2007', 'No link'), ('\nUtah legislative analysis of tax reform, March 2007', 'http://le.utah.gov/lrgc/BriefingPapers/TaxReliefandReform2007.pdf'), ('\nTax Foundation,\xa0blog post, Sept. 22, 2006', 'No link'), ('\nTax Foundation, ""The Facts on Utah\'s Tax Climate""', 'http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/1855.html'), ('\nClub for Growth,\xa02012 Presidential White Paper on Gov.

Fact-checking a viral post about impeachment and Trump’s post-presidency benefits
","House Democrats have filed an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump for ""willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States"" after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 that temporarily stopped Congress from counting electoral college ballots. With only nine days until Inauguration Day, the Democrats’ move to impeach Trump is unlikely to result in his removal from office. But a viral social media post says it could have lasting effects on his future in public life. The post, published by the liberal Facebook page The Other 98% on Jan. 9, outlined four potential consequences for Trump if the House votes to impeach him for a second time: ""For those wondering if it’s worth impeaching him this time, it means he: The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Celebrities like comedian Jim Gaffigan and advocacy organizations like the March for Science have shared the post to millions of followers. (Screenshot from Facebook) The source of the screenshot in the posts is a Jan. 8 tweet from Ben Costiloe, a 57-year-old man who lives in Texas. He told PolitiFact that he copied the text from something he saw on Facebook. ""I looked at it, and they didn’t have any followers,"" said Costiloe, whose own Twitter following has grown more than tenfold since publishing the post. ""I thought about it and said, ‘Well, this isn’t completely true, but it could be true in a perfect world.’ So I threw it out there."" But Costiloe’s viral tweet paints a misleading picture of what could happen if Trump is impeached again. If the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump, he would not automatically lose his post-presidency perks — two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate would have to vote to convict and remove Trump. Trump could lose his ability to run for office after he leaves the White House, but it would not happen solely as a result of impeachment. The Constitution says, ""Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.""  Most of the benefits afforded presidents were passed as part of the Former Presidents Act. Two benefits mentioned in Costiloe’s tweet — an annual lifetime pension of about $200,000 and annual travel allowance of up to $1 million — are enumerated in the law, which passed in 1958. The law says those benefits apply to presidents ""whose service in such office shall have terminated other than by removal pursuant to section 4 of article II of the Constitution of the United States of America."" That section of the Constitution spells out the process by which a president may be removed from office ""on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" ""Impeaching him does nothing; only convicting him would,"" said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University. ""And under current law (the Former Presidents Act), convicting him only strips him of those benefits if he is convicted while still in office (which looks certain not to happen)."" Meanwhile, a 1962 law provides Secret Service protection for former presidents, at their request, ""for a reasonable period after he leaves office.""  ""The FPA provides some limited security and travel expenses to former presidents and their spouses, but only if they aren't using the Secret Service protection that is provided under the other separate law,"" said Demian Brady, director of research for the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. ""So the FPA's benefits specifically limit its benefits in the case of impeachment and removal, but the other law that provides Secret Service protection does not. A separate law would be required to (do) that."" Congress could pass a new law to strip Trump of his post-presidency benefits, and it would not require the same two-thirds vote that a conviction in the Senate would. But impeachment alone — even the second in Trump’s one-term presidency — wouldn’t disqualify Trump from receiving some benefits. On the last point of Costiloe’s tweet, Kalt said Trump could lose his ability to run for office again ""even after he has left office,"" if the Senate votes to convict him. The Senate has never convicted an impeached president, much less a former president. However, Michael J. Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, wrote in a post for the Just Security law forum that, ""if an impeachment begins when an individual is in office, the process may surely continue after they resign or otherwise depart."" ""Understandably, members of Congress and the American people might lose the appetite for subjecting a president to impeachment once he has left office for good,"" he wrote. ""But that is a political choice not a constitutional directive."" If the Senate did vote to convict Trump, the Constitution doesn’t specify how many votes are required to also disqualify him from holding public office. In the past, the Senate has used a simple majority vote to bar three people, all federal judges, from holding office. A Facebook post says that if Trump is impeached again, he will lose his lifetime pension, travel allowance, Secret Service detail, and his ability to run for public office. That claim misses the mark on most counts. If the House votes to impeach Trump, the Senate would have to convict him while he’s still in office in order to revoke his lifetime pension and travel allowance. With only days until Biden takes over the White House, that prospect is unlikely, and Trump’s Secret Service detail would remain unaffected. After Trump leaves the White House, the Senate could bar him from holding public office. Congress could also change the law to deny Trump his benefits. But neither would happen simply as the result of impeachment. The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Archived pages of Pence’s Twitter account show that in May 2020 his header photo was an image of him standing at a podium flanked by Trump and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. On Nov. 3, he changed it to the image that appears in the tweet.

Black Lives Matter protests faced a more militarized response than Capitol mob
","In remarks to Ohio reporters, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said there was a big difference in police response between what Black Lives Matter protesters faced and what riotous Trump supporters encountered at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. In the summer, ""peaceful Black protesters outside the White House were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, a full militarized response,"" Brown said Jan. 8. ""While this week, white supremacists, rioters were able to breach the Capitol."" The ease with which a mob of people fresh from a rally led by President Donald Trump breached the Capitol and ran rampant through the halls of Congress has led to resignations and triggered formal investigations.  While no two protest situations unfold in exactly the same way, Brown’s comparison of the earliest clashes in each event is accurate.  After Minneapolis police killed unarmed George Floyd on May 25, protests against police brutality spread across the country. In Minneapolis, protesters surrounded a police station May 28, entered it and set fires inside. There was looting, vandalism and other fires in the city.  Trump vowed the federal government was ready to step in. ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,"" Trump tweeted at about 1 a.m. May 29. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""  RELATED: From Miami '67 to Donald Trump 2020: The history of 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts' On the afternoon of May 29, the Black Lives Matter protest movement arrived in Washington, D.C. About 1,000 people gathered in a park across the street from the White House. The confrontation between police and protesters grew more tense. At about 3 a.m., a line of officers in riot gear with shields advanced and deployed chemical irritants to disperse the crowd. The next day, police in full riot gear, again facing a line of protestors — some throwing water bottles and eggs — charged and broke up the group. Video from a local news reporter captured the clash. Insanity outside the White House. Three warnings of an unlawful assembly from the Secret Service before storming into the crowd. A lot of people have been hit with paper spray. In all the chaos, at least one person was tossed to the ground and presumably arrested. pic.twitter.com/Ab2eSkq9CS There are iconic images that took place after the initial clashes. Police on horseback and officers firing pepper balls charged through peaceful protesters. Their goal — move them away from a church where Trump was scheduled to have his picture taken holding up a Bible. Lines of National Guard troops stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  But even from the first encounters, the use of riot gear and shields against Black Lives Matter protesters stands in sharp contrast to the security line that met the Trump supporters at the Capitol Jan. 6. When marchers walked up to a portable metal barricade on the Capitol grounds, they saw a handful of officers in their regular uniforms standing on the other side. The marchers and officers struggled over control of the barricade. The Trump supporters overwhelmed the police. The moment it all began. pic.twitter.com/gdyx9Udgc6 Soon after, a line of police were tussling with Trump supporters on the steps of the Capitol. Rioters shoved police officers, spraying chemical irritants and hitting them with lead pipes. Police deployed flash bangs and pepper spray in an attempt to ward off the crowd.  A couple of hours after rioters breached the Capitol’s first line of defense, police reinforcements began to arrive. Many wore riot gear. They used tear gas to disperse the rioters. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 6 p.m. curfew. After curfew, law enforcement officers clad in body armor began to use aggressive tactics similar to their treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters, advancing on rioters and whacking them with batons.  While police forces prepared for the worst with the Black Lives Matter protests, the people in charge of protecting the Capitol failed to anticipate the aggression of the Trump supporters.  Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, head of the House committee that controls the Capitol Police budget, said that a week before the march, the Capitol Police assured him that everything was under control. Ryan said he was told they expected a ""pretty vanilla"" protest. ""There wasn't going to be any kind of violence anticipated,"" Ryan said. ""Maybe some dust-ups. Maybe issues around people trying to get guns into the District of Columbia, where they have very strict gun laws, but absolutely nothing like this."" The people who study crowds and police say there was ample reason to plan for a much more aggressive group. ""There was clear intelligence about where this was headed,"" said Ed Maguire, Arizona State University criminologist. ""All you had to do is go on Parler (the alt-right social media platform) for 10 minutes. I was on the night before. They were talking about violence. This is open source material, and the police would have had more."" Just a month earlier, a Dec. 12 Trump rally had attracted members of the Proud Boys, a violence-prone group that showed up again on Jan. 6. In December, they were involved in street fights that led to multiple stabbings. Bowser urged residents to stay home and avoid any confrontation with people coming to the rally. The night before the assault on the Capitol, members of the Proud Boys and a militia group called the Three Percenters were in Washington wearing body armor and helmets, with some carrying clubs. Brown said Black Lives Matter protesters outside the White House faced a more militarized response than rioters who assaulted the Capitol. The record shows that early on, federal officials planned for aggressive clashes with Black Lives Matter protesters, while those responsible for Capitol security planned for peaceful protests.

No, this isn’t a video of a Capitol rioter upset because he’s on the no-fly list
","A video of a distressed man yelling in an airport has gone viral, and in some cases, it’s wrongly being connected to the U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6.  ""This is what they do to us. They kicked me off the plane. They called me a f------ terrorist,"" the man says in a TikTok video.  Another person can be heard asking him to please calm down and saying that she was kicked off a Delta flight earlier. Some social media users are mischaracterizing why the man is upset. ""People who broke into the Capitol Wednesday are now learning they are on no-fly lists pending the full investigation,"" one Facebook post said. ""They are not happy about this.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the TikTok user who published the video didn’t say the man was upset because he was on the no-fly list, a Department of Homeland Security database of ""known or suspected terrorists.""  Rather, the user said that he was upset because he was directed to wear a face covering.  ""Homeboy had a full toddler level meltdown bc he was told to wear a mask,"" the Jan. 10 TikTok post said. USA Today reported that Delta removed two ""unruly"" passengers flying from Ronald Reagan Washington International Airport on Jan. 8.  Other airlines have reported difficult customers after the wake of the riot, including ""non-mask compliant, rowdy, argumentative"" passengers who harassed crew members on an Alaska Airlines flight from Washington Dulles International to Seattle, according to the story.  Separately, Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, released a statement on Jan. 7 urging the Transportation Security Administration and the FBI to add those involved in the attack on the Capitol to the no-fly list. We reached out to Delta and the FBI about the claim in this Facebook post — and whether rioters have been added to the no-fly list — but did not immediately hear back.   However, there’s nothing to support the allegation in the post.  First, the TikTok user who posted the video said that the man was upset because he was kicked off his flight for not wearing a mask.  And second, if the man had been added to the no-fly list — a decision that’s made by the FBI and enforced by TSA — it doesn’t make sense that he would have made it to the boarding area, where this video was taken.  If someone is on the no-fly list, they can’t even get a boarding pass, which means he wouldn’t have made it to the gate.

Pre-pandemic Iowa had largest workforce in state history
","Going into Iowa’s 2021 state Legislature session, Gov. Kim Reynolds made a bid to draw attention to her administration’s pre-pandemic economic record last year, telling reporters that the state had the largest employed workforce in its history when 2020 started. ""We began 2020 last year with our state’s fiscal health strong, our economy was growing, our wages were going up and we had more Iowans working than at any other time in our state history,"" Reynolds told reporters in a Thursday, Jan. 7, electronic news conference. Iowa’s first COVID-19 case was detected in March 2020. Although the labor force in Iowa had been steadily increasing, the COVID-19 pandemic marked a reversal of that trend. Iowa’s total civilian labor force and the number of those who were employed declined. We’ve checked claims about Iowa’s economy pre-pandemic before, though not the particular claim about Iowa boasting its largest employed workforce at the start of 2020.  Reynolds spokesperson Pat Garrett pointed to Iowa Workforce Development data to back up the claim and a check shows that’s true, though other indicators exist to show when an economy is prospering. In January 2020, Iowa’s employed workforce totaled 1,704,900 people, a March 16, 2020, Iowa Workforce Development report shows. That’s 600 more people than in the previous month and 33,000 more people than in January 2019. No other month in Iowa’s recorded employment has been higher than that January 2020 figure. By November 2020, the number of employed Iowans totaled 1,561,600, about 143,000 less than 10 months prior. The total available civilian labor force declined by 93,000 since April 2020. Ryan West, deputy director of the Iowa Workforce Development told The Daily Iowan in a phone interview that between October 2019 and February 2020, more than 1.7 million Iowans were employed, the most since the data first became available beginning in 1976. The numbers used, he said, are sourced from monthly reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the past two years, Iowa has had historically low unemployment rates for the state. According to the Iowa Workforce Development, nine of the past two decades’ lowest reported monthly unemployment rates were recorded in the last two years. The lowest unemployment rate over the past 20 years was 1.9 percent in October 2018.  But were wages going up? The annual mean wage from May 2019, the last available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was $47,330, up from the May 2018 average wage of $46,150. According to a 2019 State of Working Iowa report by the Iowa Policy Project, which since has merged with another organization and has been renamed Common Good Iowa, the median hourly wage went up about 80 cents since 2009 to $18.40, most of which came in the last two years. However, that wage growth has been ""slow to come"" according to the report. Iowa’s top 10 percent of earners had the highest share of wage growth. Before COVID-19, the numbers show Iowa’s employed workforce was the largest in the state’s history. But the numbers have declined since the pandemic. We rate the governor’s statement as True.","[('Zoom news conference with Iowa Gov.

There’s no evidence Trump has invoked the Insurrection Act
","Social media posts have started circulating false claims that President Donald Trump has signed and invoked the Insurrection Act, and that Michael Flynn will be appointed vice president.  A website called bitchute.com published a video Jan. 10 with the headline: ""TRUMP SIGNS INSURRECTION ACT - GENERAL FLYNN TO BE APPOINTED VICE PRESIDENT."" The man in the video claims that the Insurrection Act was signed ""last night,"" and that Trump will be staying in office. He says not to expect Trump to bother going to the Capitol to be inaugurated, saying that he believes Trump will be inaugurated in the White House.  Later in the video, the man says he ""can’t confirm"" it right now, but says to ""not be surprised"" if Michael Flynn — the former national security adviser who was pardoned by the president after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI — is put forward as the vice president. Other posts on Facebook display a screenshot of what is supposedly a post Trump made on Parler, an alternative social media application that was suspended by several hosting platforms over posts inciting violence. An account called ""@TeamTrumpNews"" wrote:  ""I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807, to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat & Republican lawmakers, CCP agents, the FBI, DOJ, CIA, & others to undermine, corrode and dismantle the United States of America and its Constitution. These entities pose a direct threat to national security. I will remain president indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.""  But Trump hasn’t signed or invoked the Insurrection Act, and there’s no evidence Flynn would be involved in any upcoming presidential administration. The Insurrection Act is a federal law that empowers the president to deploy the military and federalize National Guard troops to suppress certain situations including civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion. Before the president could use any of the powers under the act, he would first have to issue a formal proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact reached out to the White House and the Trump 2020 campaign but did not hear back. The act has been used to send the armed forces to quell civil disturbances a number of times during U.S. history, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. It was most recently invoked during the 1992 Los Angeles riots after four white police officers were acquitted in the roadside beating of a Black man, Rodney King, and during Hurricane Hugo in 1989, when widespread looting was reported in St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Congressional Research Service says it is legal convention under the act for the president to first issue a proclamation to get the situation under control before using the powers in the federal law.  ""If the President decides to respond to such a situation, generally upon the recommendation of the Attorney General and, if necessary, the request of the governor, he must first issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse within a limited time,"" the report says, citing Title 10 of the U.S. Code. ""If the situation does not resolve itself, the President may issue an executive order to send in troops."" Trump has not done this, and he signaled in a Jan. 7 speech that he will support the transition to a new administration. In the videotaped speech a day after a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, Trump said that he’s focused on ""ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power"" and that ""a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th."" He also added in a subsequent tweet that he would not be attending the event. Several posts online claim that Trump has invoked the Insurrection Act, and a video blog says Michael Flynn will serve as vice president. This is not supported by evidence. Trump has not issued the proclamation required before he can use the powers of the act and he signaled on Jan. 7 that he will support a transition of power.  We rate this False. ","[('Bit.Chute.com, TRUMP SIGNS INSURRECTION ACT - GENERAL FLYNN TO BE APPOINTED VICE PRESIDENT, Jan. 10', 'https://archive.is/gDSiT'), ('Facebook post, Jan. 11', 'No link'), ('Politico, MAGA leaders call for the troops to keep Trump in office, Dec. 18, 2020', 'https://archive.is/BgBuj'), ('Congressional Research Service, The Use of Federal Troops for Disaster Assistance: Legal Issues, Nov. 5, 2012', 'No link'), ('USCode.house.gov, CHAPTER 13—INSURRECTION, Accessed Jan. 11, 2021', 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/18/trump-insurrection-act-presidency-447986'), ('Washington Post,\xa0 Could Trump declare martial law to try to steal the election?, Dec. 24, 2020\xa0', 'No link'), (""Business Insider, VIDEO: Trump condemns the Capitol siege as 'heinous attack' and says he will focus on a smooth transition of power, Jan. 7, 2021"", 'https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22266.pdf'), ('New York Times, What Is the Insurrection Act of 1807, the Law Behind Trump’s Threat to States?, June 2, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/jan/11/blog-posting/theres-no-evidence-trump-has-invoked-insurrection-/

No, Pope Francis has not been arrested
","Social media users are circulating a false claim that Pope Francis has been arrested by Italian authorities and charged with child trafficking and fraud.  The claim appears to have gone viral through an article for the website Conservative Beaver.  ""Pope Francis aka Jorge Mario Bergoglio was arrested Saturday in connection with an 80-count indictment of charges including possession of child pornography, human trafficking, incest, possession of drug paraphernalia and felony fraud,"" it reads.  The article further claims that the Italian National Prosecutor’s Office ordered the arrest, and that Italian police, the International Criminal Police Organization and the FBI will interrogate the Pope at an undisclosed location.  There is no evidence to support any of these claims. This article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  ""I can categorically deny those outlandish accusations. There is no truth whatsoever to them,"" said Rev. Fr. Roger Landry, attaché for the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations.  No credible news organization has reported anything along these lines about the pope.  The Conservative Beaver article was published Jan. 10, and said the pope had been arrested the night before. But on Jan. 10, Pope Francis live-streamed an address from the library of the Apostolic Palace. The Conservative Beaver cites several Tweets claiming that a blackout had occurred in Vatican City during the purported arrest. However, multiple people living in Vatican City told the Catholic News Agency that there was no blackout on Jan. 9.  The article also quotes Giuseppe Governale, an Italian prosecutor, as saying:  ""These individuals are truly the worst of the worst in society. I can promise you, we will not stop targeting human trafficking until we put a stop to this despicable trade in the Vatican and Italy, as well as surrounding countries around Europe. While I am a lead prosecutor in Italy, my department will strive to protect our citizens, especially those that need us most, our children."" The quote is not from Governale. It’s a doctored version of a public statement issued by a different official, Madison County, Ala., Sheriff Kevin Turner, relating to a human trafficking arrest in Alabama.  The Conservative Beaver article swaps out the words ""Madison County"" with ""the Vatican and Italy,"" the words ""counties around our state"" with ""countries around Europe,"" and the words ""the sheriff"" with ""a lead prosecutor in Italy.""   I can promise you, we will not stop targeting human trafficking until we put a stop to this despicable trade in Madison County as well as surrounding counties around our state. The Conservative Beaver has published misinformation in the past, falsely claiming at various points that George Soros, Barack Obama and Hunter Biden had been arrested. An investigation by Lead Stories found that a photo purporting to show  Zayden Thornton, the owner and operator of the site according to the ""About"" page, appears to contain a fake computer-generated face.

Facebook posts wrongly claim left-wing activist, antifa ‘incited’ US Capitol mob
","UPDATE, Jan. 15, 2021: Following the publication of this fact-check, John Sullivan was arrested Jan. 14 in Utah, the U.S. Justice Department announced. He was charged in a criminal complaint with one felony count of interfering with law enforcement in connection with a civil disorder, as well as misdemeanor charges of unlawful entry and disorderly conduct.  An affidavit from an FBI agent that was filed in support of the criminal complaint and arrest warrant noted that despite Sullivan’s claims that he was present as a journalist, he has no press credentials and is not affiliated with any journalistic organization. The affidavit does not say Sullivan led the mob. Social media users and allies of President Donald Trump have continued pushing the baseless claim that it was antifa activists, not Trump supporters, who mobbed the U.S. Capitol. There’s no evidence that the crowd was infiltrated or led by antifa activists in disguise, and specific individuals held up online as antifa activists have turned out to be Trump supporters. One man accused of being an ""antifa thug,"" for example, is actually a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Another man labeled as an antifa activist is really a known neo-Nazi. But claims faulting antifa for the violence at the Capitol keep coming. The latest target is Utah’s John Sullivan, the founder of Insurgence USA, an activist group against police brutality. ""Anti-Trump founder of radical left-wing group ‘Insurgence USA’ John Sullivan incited insurgence of U.S. Capitol,"" said the text over one image shared widely on Facebook. The post originated on Parler, a social media platform targeted to conservatives. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Other posts sought to link him to antifa. Sullivan has not been shy about his presence at the Capitol riot. He filmed the events as they happened, and he was nearby when Capitol police fatally shot a woman inside the building. He described the shooting during an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper that night.  Sullivan confirmed to PolitiFact that he entered the building with the rioters, and that he is in the photographs shown as part of the Facebook post. But there’s no proof that he ""incited (the) insurgence,"" and he has denied any affiliation with antifa, a broad coalition of anti-fascist activists. In a Jan. 8 press briefing, FBI Assistant Director Steven D’Antuono said the agency has ""no indication"" that antifa played a role. In interviews with PolitiFact and other national and local news outlets, Sullivan said he went to the riot to document what happened, not to participate. On his two Twitter accounts, Sullivan shared videos he captured as the crowd stormed into the Capitol, including a nearly 40-minute YouTube video that graphically documents Ashli Babbitt’s fatal shooting by police. ""I was not leading that in any shape, form or fashion,"" Sullivan said of the mob that bashed through windows and doors and stormed the Capitol. ""I didn’t organize it. I had no part in planning it. I was only there to experience and witness what went down."" Jade Sacker, a documentary filmmaker working on a project about Sullivan and his brother, was there alongside Sullivan for much of the riot. As she filmed Sullivan and the mob around him, he was in her sight ""40 to 50% of the time,"" Sacker told PolitiFact. ""I wouldn’t say that he was directing the charge or anything. He was certainly actively there and interested in what was going on,"" Sacker said. ""He was recording the whole time."" PolitiFact reviewed Sullivan’s video of the mob into the Capitol and Babbitt’s shooting. It doesn’t show Sullivan clearly engaged in the violence or leading the run up to the Capitol, although it does show him animated as he spoke with police and rioters from the frontlines.  At points in the video, Sullivan can be heard telling others he was only filming and discouraging violence. At other points, he appeared to encourage what was happening. As rioters scaled a wall outside, for example, he cheered them on. ""We did this s---, together,"" he said after the barricades came down. ""This is f------ history. We’re all a part of this f------ history."" ""Let’s burn this s--- down,"" Sullivan can be heard saying on the video before heading inside. It was not clear if the comment was directed to or heard by any specific person or people. He told Deseret News he was trying to blend in. In other videos online, he can be seen filming. ""He was vocal, but I wouldn’t say he was inciting violence,"" Sacker said. Sullivan spoke with police and FBI agents Jan. 7 about the shooting he witnessed, he said. ""You could say if I were going to be arrested, they would’ve done so,"" he said. Investigations by law enforcement agencies are ongoing, with several arrests made among the thousands of Trump supporters who took part in the chaotic scene. But there’s no evidence that Sullivan ""incited (the) insurgence"" on his own, as the Facebook post suggests. Social media users have linked Sullivan to antifa and Black Lives Matter because of his past protest history and social media activity. His Twitter accounts have frequently used #antifa, #blm, and other anti-Trump or anti-police hashtags, PolitiFact found. The cover photo for one of his accounts advertised a Jan. 6 Insurgence USA event to ""Kick These Fascists Out of DC."" Sullivan has also been filmed using incendiary language in the past. At a small August rally in Washington, D.C., he described the need to ""rip"" Trump out of office, according to Fox News. Photos highlighted on his personal website show him holding a firearm. But Sullivan said he’s not a part of the antifa coalition often blamed for violent events, noting that Trump supporters at the riot were shouting ""f--- antifa."" Sacker said she has followed Sullivan for four months and accompanied him to many protests, including some affiliated with Black Lives Matter. He is not pro-Trump, she said, but he cares about ""dismantling the system."" She said she had not personally seen him be violent. Sullivan faces criminal charges related to a June 29 protest in Provo, Utah, according to public records. Deseret News reported that he helped organize the event and was seen on recordings kicking and threatening drivers while directing protesters to block intersections. PolitiFact found no other criminal history. Those claiming antifa infiltrated or led the mob at the Capitol have provided no proof. The evidence of Trump supporters participating, however, is indisputable. The march to the Capitol was weeks in the making, with plans indicating the potential for violence drawn up in the open on social media forums and pro-Trump websites. Video and photographs from the scene show Trump-branded paraphernalia and flags. A Facebook post claimed Sullivan ""incited (the) insurgence of (the) US Capitol."" Sullivan joined the mob of Trump supporters that entered the Capitol, filming the events as they transpired and posting his videos online. But he was one person among thousands. There’s no evidence that he ""incited"" the violence himself or led the charge into the Capitol. Sullivan denied any affiliation with antifa, although he has posted related hashtags on Twitter.  We rate this statement Mostly False. PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

No, the Capitol insurrection was not staged by antifa
","In the wake of a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol that left four protesters and a Capitol Police officer dead, many on the far-right are seeking to minimize the violence and deflect blame from an attack intended to disrupt the finalizing of Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential victory. One persistent claim is that bad actors from the far-left impersonated supporters of President Donald Trump and are actually responsible for the violence. Let’s be clear — this is completely fabricated. Nevertheless, this line of thought has pervaded social media, amplified by prominent voices such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama. PolitiFact National rated claims from both Pants on Fire. Here, we add a would-be candidate for Wisconsin governor to that list. Jonathan Wichmann, who has accumulated 27,000 followers on a Facebook page describing him as a 2022 gubernatorial candidate, posted a YouTube video Jan. 8, 2021, with the following description: ""A meeting between DC police and rioters / Antifa beforehand. If you don’t know that the DC looting was staged think again."" Antifa is short for anti-fascist, a term often used to describe a loose collection of activists who rally against fascism and far-right groups. The accompanying 18-second video shows one man taking a selfie with what appears to be a Capitol Police officer while someone says, ""Hey Cap’"" twice. It takes place inside the U.S. Capitol. But Wichmann’s claim flies in the face of a litany of evidence without presenting any reasonable evidence itself. Wichmann did not respond to an array of messages seeking a defense of his claim. He posted the video on a little-viewed YouTube channel, but also linked to it on his more highly-trafficked Facebook page. (Wichmann himself linked to the YouTube video during a discussion of an NPR story on his Facebook page. He said an NPR story on the protest-turned-riot ""has been edited multiple times to say different things throughout the day,"" implying there was something underhanded at play. Of course, this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how news reporting works — the situation began as a protest and turned into a historically unprecedented attack on the seat of U.S. government. So yes, news reports from essentially everywhere were updated as that story developed.)  The first logical hurdle Wichmann fails to clear is that the video itself doesn’t remotely prove his assertion, which was made in the video description. For one, Wichmann titles his video, ""A meeting between DC police and rioters / Antifa beforehand."" But a man who shared that video on Twitter told PolitiFact National the interaction happened after police started moving the crowd out of the building.  The video appears to show members of the pro-Trump group acting friendly with police. This is not the only video of its kind, as others circulated widely on social media showed officers allowing the group past barriers. It’s part of a law enforcement response that has been highly criticized and led to the resignation of the U.S. Capitol Police chief. But a poor response from police is a far cry from proving the protesters themselves are not who they purport to be. The clip used by Wichmann itself is a second-hand version of a livestream from online personality Tim Gionet, known by the nickname Baked Alaska, who is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist. The original stream — taken while Gionet stormed the Capitol — has been removed, as it and others are now being used to help identify the people who participated. But Wichmann takes a ridiculous logical leap in interpreting one apparently friendly interaction with police as proof the people in the Capitol weren’t actually Trump supporters. Especially when a mountain of evidence says otherwise. The mob that broke windows inside and outside the Capitol and violently pushed past police moved to the building after a rally earlier that morning where Trump spoke to the group. Here are a few of the many reasons the antifa claims don’t hold water. Paxton’s antifa claim cited two sources: a screenshot of a tweet by right-wing journalist Paul Sperry and a screenshot of a Washington Times article with the headline, ""Facial recognition firm claims Antifa infiltrated Trump protesters who stormed Capitol.""   The tweet, claiming a busload of ""antifa thugs"" had been dropped off at the Capitol, has since been deleted and remains completely unsubstantiated. The newspaper has since retracted the report, and the company it cited as a source, XRVision, has said its software identified two members of a Neo-Nazi organization and a Q-Anon supporter, not members of antifa. Meanwhile, many individuals seen in news and social media footage have been identified, and have lengthy public histories of backing Trump, QAnon and other far-right causes.  That includes the bare-chested man with face paint and horns, identified by the Arizona Republic as Jake Angeli, ""a QAnon supporter who has been a fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year."" And Richard Barnett, who was pictured with his feet on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is a Trump supporter and gun rights advocate who posted recently he was prepared for a violent death. A growing number of people have lost their jobs or been arrested after being identified by law enforcement and social media sleuths. We know the group outside the Capitol included several Republican state legislators, including newly-elected West Virginia lawmaker Derrick Evans, who shared a livestream video in which he charged through a door in the interior of the Capitol building. He was criminally charged Jan. 8. An array of other online claims have asserted the Capitol assault was a ""false flag"" operation -- a supposed covert operation designed to deflect blame. PolitiFact rated those False, noting, ""To dismiss the insurrection as a false flag is to dismiss the testimony of dozens and dozens of lawmakers, government employees and journalists who were at the Capitol that day to cover Congress certifying the victory of President-elect Joe Biden."" And of course, Trump himself identified the mob as his own supporters in a video posted to Twitter amid the Capitol incident, where he asked them to disperse peacefully, adding, ""We love you. You’re very special."" Wichmann said ""the DC looting was staged"" by antifa. Wichmann presents no evidence to back this claim online or in response to our requests. This is a pure fiction that contradicts an array of easily accessible information. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.","[('Jonathan Wichmann YouTube channel, A meeting between DC police and rioters / Antifa beforehand, Jan. 8, 2020', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=kkEiktECl6o&feature=youtu.be'), ('Jonathan Wichmann, Facebook post, Jan. 8, 2020', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Ask PolitiFact: Did Capitol Police let mob of Trump supporters in?, Jan. 7, 2021', 'https://www.facebook.com/votewichmann/posts/279157330441903'), ('PolitiFact, Texas Attorney General advances antifa conspiracy theory after D.C. riot, Jan. 8, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Mo Brooks pushes baseless claim that antifa orchestrated Capitol riots, Jan. 7, 2021', 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jan/07/ask-politifact-did-capitol-police-let-mob-trump-su/'), ('PolitiFact, Face-painted man in horned fur cap at Capitol riot supports Trump and QAnon, not antifa, Jan. 7, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, No, the storming of the Capitol wasn’t a false flag, Jan. 7, 2021', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/08/ken-paxton/texas-attorney-general-falsely-states-antifa-storm/'), ('PolitiFact, There’s no proof antifa stormed the Capitol.

 Photo shows National Guard at Lincoln Memorial, not the Capitol
","A social media post pairs two photos in order to highlight the stark differences in the police response to the Black Lives Matter protests and the violent insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  One of the photos shows rows of D.C. National Guard troops in riot gear stationed at the steps of a building.  The second shows a few police officers in bike helmets heavily outnumbered by a mob of Trump supporters.  ""Just a reminder, the 1st image was the capitol’s security during a Black Lives Matter protest, the second is from today,"" reads the post.  The post contains a factual error: The first photo depicting rows of National Guard troops was taken at the Lincoln Memorial, not the Capitol. ABC News Correspondent Martha Raddatz took the photo on Jun. 2, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests and posted it to Twitter. ""Your Lincoln Memorial this evening,"" reads the original caption.  A similar photo posted to Getty Images possesses a caption specifying that it was taken at the Lincoln Memorial and not the Capitol.  Despite this inaccuracy, the central thrust of the post has validity. There were documented differences in the way police handled the violent attack on the Capitol and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020.  After Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, police deployed harsh riot control tactics on protesters calling for justice and police brutality in Washington, D.C. and across the nation. In some cases, law enforcement officers rushed peaceful protesters with shields, sprayed them with chemical irritants, and shot them with rubber bullets.  By contrast, law enforcement members were photographed and filmed displaying relative restraint during the storming of the Capitol, helping rioters down the steps and, in one instance, pausing to snap a selfie with an insurrectionist.  ""The speed of the escalation of force was markedly slower (during the insurrection) than what we saw during Black Lives Matter,"" said Michael Sierra-Arévalo, a professor at the University of Texas-Austin who studies policing.  A grave exception occurred when a Capitol Police officer shot and killed a woman as she attempted to break into the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6. A post on Facebook seeks to compare police presence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, with police response to Black Lives Matter demonstrations in D.C. in June 2020. But it shows a picture taken in front of the Lincoln Memorial and says, ""Just a reminder, the 1st image was the capitol’s security during a Black Lives Matter protest.""  That’s wrong, though the central thrust of the post — that police presence on Jan. 6 was far lighter than that over the summer — has merit. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Elections', 'Mitch McConnell']","
Mitch McConnell says, accurately, that Joe Biden’s win wasn’t unusually close
","In a speech before what he called ""the most important vote I've ever cast,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., rejected challenges to the validity of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential race. ""The Constitution gives us here in Congress a limited role,"" McConnell said on Jan. 6, shortly before the Capitol was breached by mobs of President Donald Trump supporters. ""We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids. The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken. They've all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever."" McConnell went on to say that ""this election actually was not unusually close. Just in recent history, 1976, 2000, and 2004 were all closer than this one. The Electoral College margin is almost identical to what it was in 2016. If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" Was McConnell correct that the 2020 election ""was not unusually close""? The final data provides strong support for McConnell’s assertion. Here’s a rundown of the evidence. Biden’s Electoral College victory was exactly the same as Trump’s in 2016: Both won states with a collective 306 electoral votes. Four years ago, Trump declared this number of electoral votes to be ""a massive landslide."" We rated that False, noting that 306 electoral votes ranks no better than the bottom quarter of Electoral College showings in American history, and no better than the bottom one-third of the showings since the end of World War II. Experts say the more restrained characterization by former President Barack Obama — that Biden’s victory was ""decisive"" — is well-supported. Biden’s electoral vote total, like Trump’s, ""was on the low side,"" said John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. ""The big difference, of course, is that Trump lost the popular vote. Biden is winning a majority of the popular vote, and by a healthy margin."" Biden’s 306 electoral votes rank higher than either victory by George W. Bush, who accumulated only 271 in 2000 and 286 in 2004. It would also be slightly larger than the number won by Jimmy Carter in 1976, Richard Nixon in 1968, and John F. Kennedy in 1960. Biden’s achievement is especially notable since it occurred during a period known for high partisan polarization.   ""The era of landslide elections appears to be behind us,"" said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist. ""The strengthening of partisanship in the electorate has dampened the magnitude of swings from one party to the other."" An even stronger sign of the decisiveness of Biden’s victory was the popular vote. The popular vote doesn’t determine the presidential victor — otherwise we would have had President Al Gore and President Hillary Clinton — but comparing the margin of Biden’s popular-vote victory with that of his predecessors suggests how broad-based his support was this year. When all ballots were counted, Biden led the popular vote tally by almost 7.06 million votes, according to the Cook Political Report's 2020 National Popular Vote Tracker.    This means Biden amassed a wider popular vote margin than any candidate since 1996 except for Obama in 2008, who won by more than 9.5 million votes. Biden’s popular-vote win was wider than the reelection victories of George W. Bush and Obama. It’s also wider than the popular-vote victories of Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, both of whom lost the electoral vote. And it's wider than Bill Clinton amassed in his first victory in 1992. Meanwhile, it was far wider than John F. Kennedy in 1960, Richard Nixon in 1968, and Jimmy Carter in 1976, and it was only about 18,000 votes shy of George H.W. Bush’s winning margin in 1988, when Bush won a whopping 426 electoral votes. Arguably an even more impressive measure of Biden’s win is his percentage of the popular vote. Biden, running as the candidate of the out-of-power party, secured 51.3% of the popular vote.   Going back to 1932, Biden’s percentage of the vote for the out-of-power party was exceeded only by the 55% won by Dwight Eisenhower, the Republican running to succeed Democrat Harry Truman in 1952, and the nearly 53% by Obama, who was running to succeed Republican George W. Bush in 2008. In fact, you have to go back to 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt ousted President Herbert Hoover amid the Great Depression, to find a higher percentage of the vote for a candidate taking on an incumbent. We looked at the collective margins for the seven closest states in the four close elections in recent history: 2000, 2004, 2016 and 2020. Collectively, the margins for these seven states in 2020 were 284,597 — wider than any of the other three elections.    The seven closest states we looked at for 2020 were, in descending order, Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, New Hampshire, Maine, and North Carolina. (We excluded non-competitive states such as Delaware and Wyoming.) In the end, the highly competitive states of Pennsylvania and Michigan didn’t even make the list of seven closest states. The 2000 election remains the benchmark for a close election. The seven closest states that year — Florida, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Iowa, Oregon, New Hampshire and Nevada — collectively had just a 46,000-vote margin.  By contrast, the seven closest states in 2020 currently have a collective margin more than six times wider than the closest seven in 2000.  The one metric that shows a relatively close race is the number of added votes in various states that could have tipped Trump into victory in those states and, in turn, could have gotten him to 270 electoral votes. Trump could have won the Electoral College, narrowly, if he’d secured an additional 10,457 votes in Arizona (with 11 electoral votes), another 11,779 votes in Georgia (16 electoral votes), 20,682 more votes in Wisconsin (10 electoral votes), and 22,641 added votes in Nebraska’s 2nd congressional district (which allocates one electoral vote on its own).  Together, that’s fewer than 66,000 votes that, if perfectly allocated among those states, would have flipped the election to Trump. This amounts to .04% of all votes cast. McConnell said, ""This election actually was not unusually close."" By most metrics — including electoral votes, the popular vote margin, the percentage of the vote he won, and the margins in the seven closest states — Biden did put up impressive numbers compared with recent presidential winners. The sole notable sign of a close race was that, due to the vagaries of the electoral college, only about 66,000 more votes for Trump — if they were perfectly allocated among the right states — would have flipped the election from Biden to Trump. But that dynamic has been the case in other recent presidential elections. We rate the statement True.","[('Newsweek, ""Full Text of Mitch McConnell\'s Speech Before \'Most Important\' Vote of His Career,"" Jan. 6, 2021', 'https://www.newsweek.com/full-text-mitch-mcconnells-speech-before-most-important-vote-his-career-1559426'), ('PolitiFact, ""How narrow was Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump?""

In Georgia runoff, 32,000 votes for Perdue didn’t ‘disappear’
","Democrats are projected to take control of the Senate after Georgia’s runoff election, but on Facebook, some people are casting doubt on the vote-counting process. In a Jan. 5 post, a Facebook page called Prime Time Patriots published a clip from CNN’s broadcast of election results. In a caption, the account said the video showed ""32,000 votes disappear from Georgia Senate run-off candidate David Perdue live on CNN."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screenshot from Facebook) Prime Time Patriots also published the video on YouTube, where it has more than 27,000 views. We found dozens of similar claims about disappearing votes for Perdue using CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. After the 2020 presidential election, run-of-the-mill clerical errors in the vote counting process were taken out of context to spin a false narrative of voter fraud. So we wanted to take a closer look at claims that Perdue lost votes during the runoff. Those claims are wrong — the Georgia secretary of state’s office told PolitiFact its data did not reflect a drop in votes for Perdue at any point. The tally appeared to change during CNN’s broadcast because the firm that the network gets its data from corrected an error. Many news organizations don’t get their vote tallies directly from the states — they get them from third-party organizations. CNN receives data from Edison Research, a company that contracts with the National Election Pool, a consortium of American news organizations, to provide real-time vote results. Rob Farbman, executive vice president of Edison Research, told PolitiFact in an email that the vote drop for Perdue actually corrected a previous mistake in the vote counting process. ""The vote drop for Perdue happened after we corrected an error that had erroneously added 32,000 to Perdue’s vote count in Bibb County,"" he said. ""The incorrect vote was entered by a data entry operator reporting results collected by an Edison reporter stationed at the Bibb County Office. This error was corrected within five minutes and accounts for the brief additional 32,000 votes for Perdue."" That means that, at the time of CNN’s broadcast, Perdue had 742,323 votes, not 774,723. The sudden drop adjusted for that error.  We reached out to CNN for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.

Fact-checking Hawley’s claim about Pennsylvania’s election law
","Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri led the Senate charge against the electoral college certification of Joe Biden’s victory. Much of his argument was based on changes to mail-in voting in Pennsylvania. Hawley said that he objected to Biden’s win because Pennsylvania failed to follow its own state election laws. ""You have a state constitution that has been interpreted for over a century to say that there is no mail-in balloting permitted, except for in very narrow circumstances that's also provided for in the law,"" Hawley said Jan. 6. ""And, yet, last year, Pennsylvania elected officials passed a whole new law that allows universal mail-in balloting, and did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution said."" Hawley’s central argument is that a new state law about voting by mail — passed not ""last year"" but in the fall of 2019 — conflicts with the state’s constitution. The courts have not backed up his argument, and he omits the full story about the new law. The state constitution doesn’t have an explicit ban on mail-in voting, and the law permitting mail-in voting passed with strong Republican support.  Spokespersons for Hawley did not respond to our questions. Hawley’s statement about interpretations ""for over a century"" limiting mail-in voting likely refers to limits starting in the 19th century about absentee voting for soldiers. A 1924 Pennsylvania state supreme court decision about civilians voting stated that a ""ballot cannot be sent by mail or express."" After World War II, the state amended the constitution to allow certain limited instances of absentee voting. Article VII Section 14 of the state constitution says the state Legislature should set laws governing absentee voting in specific instances.  ""The Legislature shall, by general law, provide a manner in which, and the time and place at which, qualified electors who may, on the occurrence of any election, be absent from the municipality of their residence, because their duties, occupation or business require them to be elsewhere or who, on the occurrence of any election, are unable to attend at their proper polling places because of illness or physical disability or who will not attend a polling place because of the observance of a religious holiday or who cannot vote because of election day duties, in the case of a county employee, may vote, and for the return and canvass of their votes in the election district in which they respectively reside."" Hawley’s argument is that this passage forbids a 2019 law that allowed mail-in balloting. Pennsylvania’s senators disagreed. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., spoke during the debate of Biden’s electoral college votes, and said the constitution gives reasons while someone might need to vote remotely, but it didn’t forbid other reasons. ""There is no in-person requirement in our state constitution,"" Casey said. ""The constitution set a floor, not a ceiling, for this type of voting.""  In October 2019, the Republican-led Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an election law, Act 77, that added no-excuse voting by mail, a provision pushed by Democrats. The act says that any qualified elector who is not eligible to be an absentee elector can get a mail-in ballot. Republicans got one of their priorities included too: elimination of straight-ticket voting. The bill drew supporters from both parties, but it had more support from Republicans.  ""It was always touted as a bipartisan effort to get ready for 2020, pre-pandemic, bring Pennsylvania in line with Florida and Ohio and a bunch of states that had the no excuse system,"" said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University constitutional law professor who specializes in elections. Act 77 required constitutional challenges be brought within 180 days, but that didn’t happen. After Trump lost the Nov. 3 election, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and co-plaintiffs filed a case against state officials arguing that the mail-in ballot provisions in Act 77 were a violation. Kelly asked the court to prohibit the certification of results that included mail-in ballots or direct the Pennsylvania General Assembly to choose electors.  One week later, the state Supreme Court dismissed the petition as untimely, writing that the plaintiffs filed their case more than a year after Act 77 was enacted and after millions of residents had already voted in the primary and general elections. The case was filed as the final ballots ""were being tallied, with the results becoming seemingly apparent,"" the court wrote. The court’s three page order did not address whether Act 77 and the state constitution were in conflict. ""It is not our role to lend legitimacy to such transparent and untimely efforts to subvert the will of Pennsylvania voters,"" Justice David Wecht, a Democrat, wrote. Chief Justice Thomas Saylor, a Republican, wrote that throwing out votes at this point was extreme and untenable: ""There has been too much good-faith reliance, by the electorate, on the no-excuse mail-in voting regime created by Act 77."" After losing, Kelly took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where an emergency application for injunctive relief was denied by Justice Samuel Alito Dec. 8. Kelly is still seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, said many Pennsylvania lawmakers believe the law is constitutional.  ""Clearly the state legislature and governor believe it is consistent with the state constitution,"" Toomey said. ""This law wasn’t challenged when it was passed, it wasn’t challenged when it was applied during the June primary election. It was only challenged after President Trump lost the general election.""  Election law experts said that even if Hawley were right about the law violating the state constitution, which is debatable, it still wouldn’t be the role of the U.S. Congress to fix it.  When Hawley defended his decision to challenge Pennsylvania’s electoral vote, University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck tweeted: ""In other words, @HawleyMO’s main gripe is that the (Republican-led) Pennsylvania legislature violated the *Pennsylvania* Constitution when it expanded mail-in voting in 2019. 1. That’s not fraud. 2. That’s a question for the *Pennsylvania* Supreme Court to decide — and it passed."" Vladeck told us in an email that it is factually correct that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has never ruled on whether Act 77 is consistent with the Pennsylvania Constitution — the court threw out the challenge as untimely. But to suggest that it’s Congress’s role to intervene in the question of state constitutionality is wrong. ""Indeed, it would completely upend fundamental constitutional principles if Congress, rather than the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, were the last word on the meaning of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and yet that’s what Hawley’s arguing for here,"" he said.  Hawley said, ""Last year, Pennsylvania elected officials passed a whole new law that allows universal mail-in balloting, and did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution said.""  To suggest that lawmakers passed a law that plainly violated the state constitution is wrong. The point Hawley raised is debatable, not clear cut.  Additionally, Pennsylvania lawmakers cared enough about constitutionality to give a window of time — 180 days — for people to challenge the law’s constitutionality. No one did until Trump lost the election there.  Finally, it’s important context to note that election experts said that what Hawley argued for — congressional intervention — was the wrong remedy for a question about the state constitution.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Missouri', 'Josh Hawley']","
Protesters at Sen. Josh Hawley’s home were disruptive but not threatening or violent
","Before he objected to election results in two states at the Capitol, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley told his followers about an incident occurring at his Vienna, Va., home near Washington while Hawley was in Missouri. ""Tonight while I was in Missouri, Antifa scumbags came to our place in DC and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can’t travel,"" he wrote. ""They screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door. Let me be clear: My family & I will not be intimidated by leftwing violence."" He was referring to a demonstration held by activist group ShutDownDC. The group was protesting Hawley’s announcement that he would object to electoral votes from some states when the Senate convened Wednesday to certify the results of November’s election. President Donald Trump has claimed without evidence that the election was riddled with election fraud. PolitiFact and other independent fact-checkers have found these claims of voter fraud to be false. Hawley’s tweet got traction on social media, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday equated Hawley’s claim to the violence by Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol.  So what happened at Hawley’s house? Around 7:45 p.m. Jan. 4, police showed up to the demonstration, and their account of the event was much different from Hawley’s. ""People were peaceful,"" officer Juan Vazquez, a spokesman for the Vienna Police Department, told the Associated Press. Vasquez said the protesters violated several laws, such as a Virginia law banning picketing in front of a house, a town ordinance against being loud in front of a home and a littering code as protesters wrote messages with chalk on the sidewalk. But Vasquez said that when officers explained the violations, ""everyone just left."" ""There were no issues, no arrests,"" he said. ""We didn’t think it was that big of a deal."" ShutDownDC livestreamed the entire demonstration on YouTube. The video shows a protest that, while disruptive, included no threats and no attempts to break inside. There was also no violence. However, protesters wrote messages on the sidewalk with chalk and were warned by police for that. There were about 15 people there, according to the Washington Post. Protesters shouted chants such as ""shame on Hawley"" and ""protect democracy from the GOP."" Protesters also lit candles, held signs, gave speeches and walked up to his door to deliver a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Phil Letsou, Hawley’s deputy communications director, pointed to a moment in the video where protesters exchange words with Hawley’s wife and neighbors who came outside. The wife and the neighbors asked the protesters to leave, which they refused, but the protesters did not threaten, commit violence, vandalize or attempt to break in. The demonstration lasted for about a half hour. Hawley said protesters at his Virginia home ""screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open (his) door."" This conflicts with police accounts of the event and a video showing the full demonstration. The demonstration was disruptive, but the full video shows it was not as violent as he made it sound.

"['Elections', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden is right that more than 60 of Trump’s election lawsuits lacked merit
","A day after a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, President-elect Joe Biden spoke about the importance of democratic institutions. He said that one of those pillars was the judiciary system. Trump was ""truly stunned when the judges he appointed didn't do his bidding and instead acted with integrity, following the Constitution, upholding the rule of law,"" Biden said. ""In more than 60 cases, in state after state after state, and then at the Supreme Court, judges, including people considered ‘his judges, Trump judges,’ to use his words, looked at the allegations that Trump was making and determined they were without any merit,"" Biden said Jan. 7, at an event where he introduced Judge Merrick Garland as his nominee for U.S. Attorney General. Is that accurate? Yes. More than 60 lawsuits brought by Trump and his allies failed because they were unable to prove their allegations. Some lawsuits were dismissed due to errors in the filings and other procedural issues. PolitiFact reached out to Biden’s transition team and the Trump campaign but did not hear back. Marc Elias, a lawyer who has filed and defended cases on behalf of Democrats, keeps a tally on the outcome of the election cases. ""It is 63 losses by Trump and his allies,"" Elias told PolitiFact the morning of Jan. 8. ""We treat each case separately — so if there is a federal case and a state case, we treat them as two cases. We only ever count a case one time — so if there is an appeal or remand, we do not treat that as a separate loss."" The one case where Trump found success didn’t involve an allegation about fraud. The case centered on reducing the amount of time Pennsylvania voters had to fix errors on their mail-in ballots. The matter involved a small number of ballots that didn’t change the outcome. News outlets, including Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, have reported that Trump and supporters of his campaign have been routinely defeated in court. ""Judges have denied or dismissed dozens of cases backed by Trump and his allies, who have pushed unsupported charges of widespread fraud in battleground states,"" said a Jan. 7 Fox News report. The lawsuits collapsed as Trump and his allies failed to prove the fraud they alleged. Plaintiffs in some lawsuits lacked standing to sue, and some were also riddled with errors. In one case, an affidavit that attempted to cite results from precincts in Michigan cited Minnesota data instead. At least 86 judges — from state courts to the U.S. Supreme Court — have rejected at least one post-election lawsuit filed by Trump or his supporters, according to a review of court filings by the Washington Post, published Dec. 12. Around that time, more than 50 cases had failed or been tossed out of court, the Post found. The Post analysis found that 38 judges appointed by Republicans were among the 86 judges who had rejected lawsuits. The U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-appointed justices, rejected Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s challenge to election results in four states. Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, said in dismissing one Pennsylvania challenge: ""Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here."" Biden said that in more than 60 cases, judges ""looked at the allegations that Trump was making and determined they were without any merit."" Biden’s figure is correct. Trump wasn't a plaintiff in all of them, some were his allies or supporters echoing Trump’s claims. The lawsuits failed for various reasons: some had errors in the filings, others lacked standing. Mainly, the allegations lacked proof. We rate Biden’s claim True.","[('Washington Post, ‘The last wall’: How dozens of judges across the political spectrum rejected Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, Dec. 12, 2020', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judges-trump-election-lawsuits/2020/12/12/e3a57224-3a72-11eb-98c4-25dc9f4987e8_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_todays_headlines&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_headlines'), ('PolitiFact, A day of crisis at the US Capitol, fact-checked, Jan. 6, 2021', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Marc Elias, lawyer for Democrats litigating election cases, Jan. 8, 2021', 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jan/06/day-crisis-us-capitol-fact-checked/'), ('Rev.com, Joe Biden Introduces DOJ Nominees, Merrick Garland Transcript, Jan. 7, 2021', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/jan/08/joe-biden/joe-biden-right-more-60-trumps-election-lawsuits-l/
