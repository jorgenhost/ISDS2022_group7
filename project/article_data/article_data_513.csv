Gov. Scott Walker says state schools chief Tony Evers is ignoring his ability to take over schools
","Have the problems facing Milwaukee Public Schools reached a point where the state should step in? They have in the eyes of Gov. Scott Walker, who said Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers has failed to step up. Evers, not so coincidentally, is one of the many Democrats aiming to take on Walker in the November 2018 election. In an extended interview portion of WISN-TV’s May 13, 2018, episode of  ""UpFront with Mike Gousha,"" Walker left open the possibility of changing district boundaries and breaking MPS into smaller sections as ""things we realistically have to look at.""   After Gousha asked if the state has a responsibility to step in with MPS, Walker replied: By law, Democrats gave the superintendent of public instruction, back in 2009, the ability to take over failing schools. And for whatever reason the current superintendent has failed to do that … Maybe we have to look beyond that. If the superintendent is not willing to do that, then I think then maybe there are other things we need to look at. Maybe we shake things up a little bit.    Is Walker right about Evers ignoring his ability to take over Milwaukee schools? The background When asked for backup to the claim, Walker spokeswoman Amy Hasenberg cited Wisconsin State Statute 118.42. The statute -- with the heading ""Low-performing school districts and schools; state superintendent interventions"" -- provides a list of scenarios under which the state schools superintendent can intervene in low-performing school districts and schools. The first part of the statute addresses what can happen to districts found to be in need of improvement for four consecutive school years: (a) Employ a standard, consistent, research-based curriculum that is aligned with the state's model academic standards, as determined by the state superintendent, and across grades in all schools. (b) Use pupil academic performance data, including data indicating improvement in pupil academic achievement and English language acquisition, to differentiate instruction to meet individual pupil needs. To the extent practicable, the school board shall assess pupils in the language and form most likely to yield accurate data. (c) Implement for all pupils a system of academic and behavioral supports and early interventions, including diagnostic assessments, instruction in core academic subjects, different instructional strategies for different pupils, and strategies to improve reading and mathematics instruction and promote positive behavior. (d) Provide additional learning time to address the academic needs of pupils who are struggling academically, including pupils whose proficiency in English is limited. The additional learning time may include an extended school day, an extended school year, summer school, or intersession courses.
  How it works in practice Department of Public Instruction spokesman Tom McCarthy told the Wisconsin State Journal in an article posted May 14, 2018, the department has never considered a ""takeover"" of Milwaukee schools because ""how schools are governed or run isn’t going to change the challenges kids in Milwaukee face."" In an email, McCarthy told us ""not only is the governor mischaracterizing how 118.42 works, he's also incorrect in whether it can be currently used to intervene with MPS."" McCarthy went on to say: The superintendent powers have a trigger for use (based on the performance of a district/school) and allowable interventions. The allowable interventions do not allow the superintendent to ""take over a school,"" but do allow for specific turn-around strategies to be required. Taking over a school, as we have historically known and used the phrase, means assuming all decision-making power. The superintendent powers do not permit that and no such power exists in 118.42. Meanwhile, an analyst at the state’s Legislative Reference Bureau referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a  Wisconsin Legislative Council memo for statute 118.42. The memo includes criteria ""authorizing the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to intervene with the school district under certain conditions."" But it contains no reference to the superintendent having the authority to take over failing schools. What’s more, McCarthy noted MPS no longer qualifies for these permitted interventions. The law’s trigger is based on performance on the school/district report card and whether that district has fallen into the bottom category. MPS -- having moved out of the bottom category -- no longer qualifies. A separate program In our interview with McCarthy, he did note there is a takeover provision in state law . Though it operates differently: ""It does exist in the Opportunity Schools Partnership Program,"" he said. ""In that scenario, the takeover authority is vested in the county executive and the commissioner. Not the state superintendent."" Under that program, known as OSPP, the department of public instruction identifies districts that would qualify for the program due to performance triggers spelled out by the law, and notifies the county executive in the county that is home to the district ""The county executive appoints a commissioner and that person then has the ability to take over a school, provided they are on the list of low-performing schools within the district,"" said McCarthy. ""Again, no authority for (DPI) exists in the OSPP beyond simple identification."" In November 2015, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele selected Demond Means, superintendent of the Mequon-Thiensville School District, as the special commissioner. By late July 2016, Means had resigned, saying the adversarial climate surrounding the program ""is the last thing our children need."" Means was given a list of schools that qualified for takeover. The following school year, 2016-’17, those schools determined to be eligible could be taken over, but Means did not take over any schools. In 2017-'18, the just-concluded year, no schools were eligible for takeover. Alan Borsuk, senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette Law School and weekly columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said the state superintendent does have options. ""The superintendent has strong options to seek change under that state law and had other options under the now-gone federal No Child Left Behind law, but they didn’t rise to what I would label taking over schools,"" Borsuk told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Our rating Walker said ""Democrats gave the superintendent of public instruction, back in 2009, the ability to take over failing schools. … The current superintendent has failed to do that."" While the law in questions allows the superintendent to order various interventions, it does not have a provision for a complete takeover. A different law allows the local county executive to take action. That process was begun in Milwaukee, but did not advance. In addition, MPS no longer falls into the bottom category of the state's school and district report cards, and therefore no longer qualifies for the interventions under the state law. We rate Walker’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBE97C0>],/factchecks/2018/jul/05/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-state-schools-chief-tony-eve/

Did Sen. Bill Nelson vote for higher taxes 349 times? No
","For years, Republicans have criticized Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for voting to raise taxes again and again. Nelson's opponent in the 2012 U.S. Senate race, Connie Mack, claimed Nelson raised taxes 150 times. That number grew to 272 before the November 2012 election. Now, Nelson’s current competitor, Gov. Rick Scott, is upping the ante in a new television ad. ""Forty years later, a lot of things have changed, but Bill Nelson is still in Washington,"" the narrator says. ""Still collecting a paycheck. Besides reading speeches, what’s Nelson done all those years. 349 times he’s voted for higher taxes."" Scott’s evidence included about 349 votes Nelson cast in the Senate starting in 2001, as well as votes he took in the U.S. House of Representatives (1979-90). With that, we wanted to see if it was true. We have rated similar claims that Nelson voted to raise taxes False because the total was bolstered by non-binding resolutions, which cannot change the tax law, and double counted multiple votes on a single piece of legislation. Although the list is not exactly the same, we found that Scott’s team uses the same tallying tricks implemented in the past, which inflates the number of times Nelson voted for higher taxes. In 2012, we fact-checked Mack’s claim that Nelson voted to raise taxes 150 times and ruled that claim False. Two months later, we fact-checked Mack again. This time he claimed that Nelson voted for higher taxes 272 times and that also rated False. As we concluded in those checks, Mack’s list was boosted by including budget resolutions and counted multiple votes on the same piece of legislation. Scott’s 349-time claim does the same thing. More than half of votes on his list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set nonbinding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. Budget resolutions do not change tax law. Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction, offered another important distinction. ""Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is also not voting for a tax increase,"" Gordon told us. Scott’s tally makes the additional mistake of counting multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Scott’s list includes nine votes Nelson took on a 2008 budget resolution. Again, those votes do not alter how much in taxes anyone pays. Overall, we found that nearly half of all the votes Scott counted were from non-binding resolutions. The mathematical gymnastics continues in other parts of Scott’s list. Scott’s tally includes multiple votes on the other pieces of legislation. It’s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments. For example, in 2017, Scott counted 19 of Nelson’s votes against H.R. 1 — the GOP tax bill. By voting against the bill, Scott’s office argues Nelson voted for higher taxes. In reality, Nelson’s votes would have kept the status quo. And while the tax bill that passed Congress and was signed into law cuts taxes for most Americans, not every American is guaranteed a tax cut. Scott’s ""claim is predicated on the idea that tax cuts are ‘free,’"" Joe Rosenberg, a research associate for the Tax Policy Center, said. ""The claim could equivalently be phrased as ‘Nelson voted to reduce the federal deficit 349 times.’"" Besides tallying tricks, Scott’s statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Nelson voted for President Ronald Reagan’s major tax cut package in 1981 and Nelson also voted to extend President George W. Bush-era tax cuts in 2006 and 2010. Nelson also supported the 2009 stimulus package, which included more than $200 billion in tax cuts. ""The statement you are fact checking is that Nelson VOTED in favor of higher taxes 349 times,"" said campaign spokeswoman Kerri Wyland. ""He did. Every member of Congress should be held accountable for every single vote they take – that is part of their job and it is what American families expect. Every vote cited was an opportunity for Bill Nelson to make his position on taxes clear, and every time he voted in favor of higher taxes."" Scott said Nelson ""voted for higher taxes"" 349 times. Just like Republicans in the past, Scott’s list overstates the number of times Nelson voted for higher taxes by including nonbinding budget resolutions, which accounted for almost half of the 349 votes on the list. Scott also counts multiple votes on the same piece of legislation, which further inflates the number. And as we’ve concluded in previous checks, the list neglects that Nelson has, on occasion, voted for lower taxes. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB974140>],/factchecks/2018/jul/05/rick-scott/did-sen-bill-nelson-vote-higher-taxes-349-no/

Pants On Fire: White House claim Sen. Kamala Harris ‘supporting MS-13’
","The White House made an inflammatory attack on California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris this week, claiming on its official Twitter account that she is ""supporting the animals of MS-13."" Here’s the tweet from July 2, 2018:  It’s part of a pattern of attacks by President Trump and his administration on Democrats over immigration enforcement and the violent gang MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha. The gang grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. For this fact check, we examined the tweet about Harris. We also reviewed similar attacks. Harris repudiates claim The White House did not respond to our request for evidence supporting the claim. Harris strongly rejected it, replying to the White House on Twitter: ""As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That’s being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers."" Harris was California’s attorney general and San Francisco’s district attorney before she was elected to the Senate in 2016. She is often mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate. She added in another tweet: ""My record speaks for itself:
→ Arrested members of drug trafficking organizations that smuggled in narcotics to the United States
→ Announced the arrests in a murder-for-hire plot by a Tijuana-based drug cartel
→ Confiscated 500lbs of meth from a Mexican cartel"" We found no evidence Harris has ever supported or expressed any sympathy for MS-13. Pattern of baseless claims   This is not the first rhetorical firebomb on MS-13 lobbed at Democrats by Trump or the White House. In a speech in May, Trump claimed California Rep. Nancy Pelosi ""came out in favor of MS-13."" PolitiFact found Pelosi hasn’t defended the gang and rated it False. Trump has repeated it in subsequent speeches. On the same day the White House tweeted about Harris, it also attacked Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, saying: ""@SenWarren, why are you supporting criminals moving weapons, drugs, and victims across our nation’s borders? You must not know what ICE really does."" Democrats, including Harris, Pelosi and Warren, have criticized Trump’s policy of separating children from migrants and asylum seekers entering the country. They’ve also called for reforming, or in some cases abolishing, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, and replacing it with a new agency. They have not, however, explicitly called for ending immigration enforcement. Nor have they made statements in favor of MS-13. Here’s what Harris said on MSNBC in June about ICE: ""I think there’s no question that we’ve got to critically re-examine ICE and its role and the way it is being administered and the work it is doing,"" Harris said. ""And we need to probably think about starting from scratch because there's a lot that is wrong with the way that it's conducting itself. And we need to deal with that."" Our ruling The White House attacked Sen. Kamala Harris for ""supporting the animals of MS-13,"" in a tweet from its official account. Harris and other Democrats have sharply criticized the Trump administration for its immigration policies. They have expressed concern about how those entering the country, legally and illegally, are treated and called for reforming or replacing ICE. That’s not the same thing as or even close to ""supporting"" a violent criminal gang. We found no information showing Harris has supported or sympathized with MS-13. When asked, the White House provided no evidence to back up its reckless attack, which fits with a pattern of other baseless claims on the subject.   We rated the White House claim Pants On Fire.

Did Ronald Reagan say immigrants made America great?
","A conservative group in favor of legislation that benefits immigrants has a new ad claiming President Ronald Reagan said immigrants made America great — a jab to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan and his hard-line immigration policies. ""Today, the Becoming American Initiative launched its first ad featuring a video of President Ronald Reagan talking about how immigrants have always made America great,"" the group said July 3. ""The message is especially important for conservatives and all Americans to hear on July 4th as President Trump pushes to limit immigration."" The ad shows footage of Reagan talking about immigrants who ""brought with them courage and the values of family, work and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again."" Reagan used the ""Let’s Make America Great Again"" slogan in his 1980 presidential campaign. Did he say what the ad shows?  We found that Reagan in a 1980 campaign speech spoke about immigrants’ journey to America and of their contributions to society. The ad patched together what Reagan said about immigrants with his closing call for everyone to ""make America great again."" The full speech wasn’t just about immigrants, it narrated Reagan’s grievances with Carter and the economy and Reagan’s own vision for America. We reached out to Becoming American Initiative, a conservative a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, via Twitter but did not hear back. The 30-second ad features Reagan’s voice over video of him delivering a speech with the Statue of Liberty in the background. It includes black and white video of a crowd of people walking and of men doing construction work, as well as video in color of a man picking fruit, of a child at the border, and a photograph of people waving American flags at what looks like a naturalization ceremony. Here’s a transcript of Reagan’s words: ""Through this Golden Door has come millions of men and women. These families came here to work. Others came to America and often harrowing conditions. They didn’t ask what this country could do for them but what they could do to make this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history. They brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again."" A slide at the end of the video said: ""Immigrants Have Always Made America Great."" The Becoming American Initiative ad is based on a Labor Day, Sept. 1, 1980 campaign speech Reagan delivered at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, N.J. Reagan went on to beat Democrat Jimmy Carter in the November election. With the Statue of Liberty in the background, Reagan paid tribute to immigrants, starting his speech by saying they came to America to work and helped build cities and ""incredibly productive farms."" Reagan twice said ""make America great again"": around the middle of the speech, when he spoke about what his administration will do; and toward the end of the speech, when he called on everyone to also ""make America great again."" The ad from Becoming American Initiative cut and patched together sentences. Below is a partial transcript of Reagan’s speech, in bold are the words the ad highlighted. ""Through this Golden Door, under the gaze of that Mother of Exiles, has come millions of men and women, who first stepped foot on American soil right there, on Ellis Island, so close to the Statue of Liberty. These families came here to work. They came to build. Others came to America in different ways, from other lands, under different, and often harrowing conditions, but this place symbolizes what they all managed to build, no matter where they came from or how they came or how much they suffered. They helped to build that magnificent city across the river. They spread across the land building other cities and towns and incredibly productive farms. They came to make America work. They didn’t ask what this country could do for them but what they could do to make this, this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history. They brought with them courage, ambition and the values of family, neighborhood, work, peace and freedom. We all came from different lands but we shared the same values, the same dream. Today a President of the United States would have us believe that dream is over or at least in need of change. Jimmy Carter’s Administration tells us that the descendants of those who sacrificed to start again in this land of freedom may have to abandon the dream that drew their ancestors to a new life in a new land. The Carter record is a litany of despair, of broken promises, of sacred trusts abandoned and forgotten. ... This country needs a new administration, with a renewed dedication to the dream of an America -- an administration that will give that dream new life and make America great again! Restoring and revitalizing that dream will take bold action. ...  I want more than anything I've ever wanted, to have an administration that will, through its actions, at home and in the international arena, let millions of people know that Miss Liberty still ""lifts her lamp beside the golden door."" Through our international broadcasting stations -- the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and the others -- let us send, loud and clear, the message that this generation of Americans intends to keep that lamp shining; that this dream, that this dream the last best hope of man on earth, this nation under God, shall not perish from the earth. We will instead carry on the building of an American economy that once again holds forth real opportunity for all, we shall continue to be a symbol of freedom and guardian of the eternal values that so inspired those who came to this port of entry. Let us pledge to each other, with this Great Lady looking on, that we can, and so help us God, we will make America great again."" Several years later, Reagan signed into law the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. The law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards — including people who had been in the United States since 1982 and special agricultural workers. A Becoming American Initiative ad claimed Ronald Reagan said immigrants ""brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again."" The ad is based on a 1980 Labor Day campaign speech in New Jersey, where Reagan lauded immigrants’ contributions, while also listing his grievances with Carter and his own vision for America. Reagan didn’t say immigrants ""made America great"" verbatim, but he did imply it. The ad cuts out some of Reagan’s words to make the comments appear adjacent.

Corey Stewart falsely claims Sen. Tim Kaine wants to do away with ICE, border patrol
","Corey Stewart, the Republican vying to unseat incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine in Virginia, blasted Kaine and other Democrats for their immigration views during a live video broadcast to his Facebook page on June 30, 2018. ""The left is calling for — Tim Kaine and the Democrats are calling for — not only no border enforcement; they don’t want a border at all,"" Stewart said. ""Tim Kaine doesn’t want a border at all. He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well. He wants to get rid of all that."" The video showed Stewart driving in his car to a protest at the Red Hen, the restaurant in Lexington, Va., that sparked controversy when its owner asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to get up from her table and leave. Stewart was joined at the protest by campaign supporters, including a local ""Bikers for Trump"" group. His comments followed some Democratic calls to abolish ICE, the U.S. government agency best known for arresting, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants.  Heard @realDonaldTrump on Fox this morning talking about our rally outside the Red Hen yesterday with the Bikers for Trump!! pic.twitter.com/ODYir9ARYf After progressive candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., with a campaign that called for ICE’s elimination, several Democratic leaders — including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren — adopted similar positions. But we found no evidence that Kaine hopped on that bandwagon, despite Stewart’s claim. Noel Fritsch, spokesman for the Stewart campaign, did not respond to a request for comment. Kaine has been relatively firm in his support for bills that add to border security, while at the same time advocating for legal immigration, protection of Dreamers — immigrants here illegally who arrived as children — and other traditionally Democratic immigration policies. Kaine has also been critical of Trump’s policy of separating immigrant families at the border. With regard to ICE, Kaine has rebuked controversial raiding tactics practiced under the Trump administration, but he has not called for the agency’s termination. ""Tim believes we need comprehensive immigration reform and strongly supported legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 to create a path to citizenship and fund border security,"" said a statement on the immigration page of Kaine’s campaign website. The 2013 bill, for which Kaine delivered a Senate floor speech in Spanish, was the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, and it passed the Senate by a 68-32 vote. Although it ultimately died in the House, the bill would have increased the number of federal agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, required construction of 700 miles of border fencing and allocated money for aerial drones, among other border security measures. The bill also included provisions that would have allowed immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to adjust their immigration status so long as they satisfied certain criteria. Later, in February 2018, Kaine co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to protect Dreamers and enhance border security. In addition to providing legal status and a path to citizenship for people who arrived in the U.S. as children, the bill would have granted $25 billion in funding for Northern and Southern border security over a 10-year period. ""We’ve reached a deal that gives us the best chance to protect Dreamers against deportation from the only country they know as home,"" Kaine said at the time. Ultimately, the proposal fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate after the Trump administration publicly opposed it. ""I think we do need to do more border control,"" Kaine said during an interview on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" in April 2018. ""I want to see a strategy … not just a president acting like the military was his palace guard and he could do whatever he wanted on a day in question."" Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, pointed to the 2013 and 2018 bills as well as an op-ed Kaine wrote criticizing the Trump policy of separating families at the border. Sams also noted that the $25 billion in border security funds provided by the 2018 proposal was the exact amount Trump had requested. Stewart said, ""Tim Kaine doesn’t want a border at all. He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well."" We found no evidence to support this claim. On the contrary, Kaine has backed two comprehensive immigration bills that featured significant measures for increased border security. He has not made any statements about getting rid of ICE, let alone the border. We rate Stewart’s statement Pants on Fire!

"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Kelda Helen Roys']","
Did Wisconsin's schools chief receive the largest charter school grant in the country?
","""We need to fully fund and support our schools. Public schools,"" said Kelda Roys, one of the many Democrats hoping to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November 2018 election. The comment came during a May 28, 2018 interview with Kai Brito on the WORT 8 O’Clock Buzz. In it, Roys took a jab at rival Democratic candidate Tony Evers regarding some of the charter-school initiatives he has pursued as state superintendent of public instruction. Brito brought up U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos before asking Roys’ stance on education policy. DeVos, a controversial appointee of President Donald Trump, is an outspoken proponent of education reform through school choice and charter school programs. Her critics are quick to point out her absence of experience working in, or even sending her children to, public schools which educate 90% of children in America. Roys’ attack on Evers came in a statement that was a bit of a jumble, but emphasized her criticism of public money being taken away from public schools: ""And, you know, frankly, the voucher schools that have proliferated in places like Milwaukee and Racine — and now we’ve got statewide voucher expansion — are a problem, but we also have to address charter schools because there are a lot of private charters. And in fact, our current superintendent of public instruction sought and received the largest charter school grant in the country from the Trump-DeVos administration to start new charter schools in Wisconsin. ""And I think that we need to stop privatization because that money comes right off the top and it’s only what’s left over after the charters have gotten their money that goes to our public schools. That’s wrong."" Roys brought up a laundry-list of education issues in her statement. So before we go on, it’s worth defining a few terms. Voucher schools Voucher schools are private schools. Most are faith-based. The voucher school program, or ""school choice,"" uses public funds to pay the tuition of a student at a private school. More than 36,000 students across Wisconsin attended private schools through the voucher program in the 2017-18 school year. Charter schools Charter schools, on the other hand, are public schools. Every charter school is entirely publicly funded, open to any student, and free for any student. In the 2017-18 school year, Wisconsin charter schools served more than 42,000 students. There are two main types of charter schools in Wisconsin. Of the 234 charters currently operating across the state, 211 are run within existing public school districts. That includes Milwaukee Public Schools, which oversees 21 charter schools. The other 23 -- all in the greater Milwaukee area -- are ""independent"" charters, which operate with the most autonomy because they do not answer to a school district and do not employ unionized teachers. These schools are authorized by other public entities: the City of Milwaukee, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, or the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. The schools are operated by nonprofit companies that have a charter, or contract, with the Milwaukee Common Council or one of the two universities. The agreement offers charter schools some flexibility from state rules governing traditional public schools in exchange for meeting performance targets specified in the contract. ""Private charters?"" The phrase ""private charters"" is technically incorrect since all charter schools are public schools. But it is sometimes used -- particularly by critics -- as shorthand to refer to the independent charters run by non-profit groups. Proponents of public schools often talk about ""privatization"" to refer to any public funds given to schools outside of traditional districts. So, did Evers seek and receive the largest federal grant for charter schools and can some of that money go to ""private"" charter schools? The charter school grant In 2017, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction won a $95 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Innovation and Improvement. Tom McCarthy, communications director for the state Department of Public Instruction (DPI), told us in an email that since winning its first grant in 1997, the state has won five of these charter school grants. The new grant, part of the Expanding Opportunities Through Quality Charter Schools Program, was the largest awarded in 2017. It is the fourth largest in the last decade of the program’s history, following California ($254 million in 2010), New York ($113 million in 2011), and Florida ($104 million in 2011). Wisconsin submitted the grant application on May 15, 2017 — three months after DeVos assumed her position — and the award was announced in the fall. Because 2018 grants have not yet been awarded, this confirms that this is indeed the ""largest charter school grant in the country from the Trump-DeVos administration."" Evers, as state superintendent of public instruction and the leader of the DPI, is certainly responsible for this grant -- though McCarthy said that Evers’ ""blessing"" was about the extent of his involvement in the initiative. Does the grant increase ‘private’ charters? In a June 25, 2018 email Roys spokesman Brian Evans said: ""The question becomes, will this grant increase the number of independent charters? To which the answer is certainly yes. In the $95 million grant Kelda was referring to, nothing specifies that this grant money is for public instrumentality charter schools rather than the more private independent charters. In fact, on page 33 of the PDF of DPI's application for the grant, DPI touts recent changes to Wisconsin laws that ‘expanded the reach of independent charter schools and expanded access to these schools across the state.’ They go on to state that ‘the number of independent charter schools will likely increase during this grant period.’ As we previously established, the use of this grant to increase or expand independent charters will very clearly result in an increase in privatization, even if some public charters are also created."" Well, only public charters will be created, since all charters are public. But yes, some independent charters will be created under the new grant. Awards from the new grant were announced June 28, 2018, after Roy’s statement. Of the $17.4 million awarded for the first year of the grant, about $4 million will go toward six new independent charter schools. The rest will go to 20 new or existing school district charters. ""Over the life cycle of all grants dating back to 1997,"" added McCarthy from DPI, ""the vast majority of the money has gone to schools managed by public school districts."" Will the grant result in money losses to public schools? Technically, no. Since charter schools are public schools, an increase in charters -- and any subsequent increase in students who choose to attend them over traditional public schools -- does not change the amount of total public school funding.

However, school-level funding follows the students.

To fund most of the independent charters (called ""2R"", a reference to their section in the Wisconsin charter school law), a little bit of funding is trimmed from every public school district across the state. For instance, during the 2017-18 school year, general state aid was reduced by about 1.4% to fund the $65.9 million needed to pay for students to attend these schools.

Three of the upcoming independent charters (called ""2X"") that have been funded by the new grant will instead pull a per-pupil amount from the local school district that the students would otherwise attend. 
For in-district charters -- which comprise the majority of charters in the state -- school-level funding isn’t an issue. In-district charters are often housed in the same building as the traditional school, their staff are hired under contract from the school district, and in general moving funds from ""traditional"" to ""charter"" doesn’t affect resources for the students. Our rating Criticizing ""privatization"" of the public school system, Roys said Evers sought and received the largest federal grant for charter schools. The grant is the largest awarded under Trump, though it’s one of several received by the state since 1997. Although private entities (non-profits) -- if authorized -- can apply for the grant money and use it to run charter schools, technically, all charter schools are public schools.

Larry Kudlow wrong about deficits falling rapidly under Donald Trump
","Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council for President Donald Trump, raised eyebrows when he said in a Fox Business Network interview that the nation’s deficit is falling on Trump’s watch. The economy under President Donald Trump, Kudlow said on June 29, ""is throwing out enormous amounts of new tax revenues. As the economy gears up, more people working, better jobs and careers -- those revenues come rolling in, and the deficit, which is one of the other criticisms (of Trump’s economic policy), is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly. Growth solves a lot of problems."" .@larry_kudlow: ""The deficit... is coming down, and it's coming down rapidly. Growth solves a lot of problems."" pic.twitter.com/H375h7rV0a As it happens, the deficit hasn’t come down to date -- which sparked a quick backlash on social media and prompted Kudlow to amend his remarks later that day. Kudlow told the Washington Post that ""the economy is so strong right now it’s going to produce lower deficits. I probably should have said future deficits."" However, that assertion is questionable as well. The most trusted source for future budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office, shows rising deficits for years into the future. In fiscal year 2015, when Barack Obama was president, the federal deficit was $438 billion. (A refresher: The deficit refers to federal revenues minus federal outlays. Each year’s deficit adds to the overall public debt.) In fiscal year 2016, which was also under Obama, the deficit rose to $585 billion. In fiscal year 2017, which was about two-thirds on Trump’s watch, the deficit rose to $665 billion. The deficit also rose as a percentage of the nation’s gross domestic product -- a way of comparing economic statistics across time. In fiscal year 2015, the deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP, rising to 3.2 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 and 3.5 percent in fiscal 2017. So on a full-year basis, Kudlow is wrong. He’s also wrong if you look at the first seven months of fiscal year 2018. According to the Treasury Department, the first seven months of the current fiscal year saw a deficit of $385 billion -- which is 12 percent higher than the first seven months of fiscal year 2017, when the deficit totaled $344 billion. As for the future, CBO finds no reason to expect the deficit to go down any time soon. For fiscal year 2018, CBO projects a deficit of $804 billion, rising each successive year to $981 billion in 2019, $1 trillion in 2020, $1.1 trillion in 2021, and $1.3 trillion in 2022. The deficit is also poised to increase as a percentage of GDP --  from 3.5 percent in 2017 to 4.0 in 2018 and eventually to 5.4 percent in 2022. Here’s the full chart from CBO’s most recent projections, released in April.  Not only that, but CBO specifically cited the tax cut Trump backed and signed into law as a reason for spiraling deficits. ""The deficit that CBO now estimates for 2018 is $242 billion larger than the one that it projected for that year in June 2017,"" CBO wrote in its April report. ""Accounting for most of that difference is a $194 billion reduction in projected revenues, mainly because the 2017 tax act is expected to reduce collections of individual and corporate income taxes."" And the projections would be even worse if Congress doesn’t allow the recent round of tax cuts to expire. ""In that scenario, far larger deficits and much greater debt would result than in CBO’s baseline projections for the 2019–2028 period,"" CBO wrote. Kudlow said, ""The deficit ... is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly."" After being criticized, he later clarified that he ""probably should have said future deficits."" Kudlow’s first formulation is wrong, and his revised version isn’t supported by the most widely trusted barometer -- projections by the CBO. Trump tax bill, which dramatically cut revenues, is a big reason why. The statement is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Donald Trump off-base in describing GDP growth on his watch
","During a June 28 visit to Mount Pleasant, Wis. -- the site of a planned Foxconn manufacturing facility -- President Donald Trump touted his economic record, including the growth of the nation’s gross domestic product, which measures the size of the economy. ""Watch those GDP numbers,"" Trump said. ""We started off at a very low number, and right now we hit a 3.2,"" or 3.2 percentage growth compared to the last quarter on an annualized basis. ""Nobody thought that was possible."" This statement includes both factual inaccuracies and an apparent misunderstanding of the statistical measurement Trump is citing. Here is a chart showing the quarter-by-quarter growth in gross domestic product since 2008. The red bars indicate the tenure of Republican presidents George W. Bush and Trump, while the blue bars indicate the tenure of President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Trump’s first problem is a straightforward factual inaccuracy. He said that ""right now,"" growth was 3.2 percent. However, the most recent growth number, for the first quarter of 2018, wasn’t 3.2 percent. It was considerably lower, at 2.0 percent. (The next growth number, for the second quarter of 2018, won’t be available for several more weeks.) On Trump’s watch, the U.S. did see one quarter of 3.2 percent growth -- the third quarter of 2017. By now, that data point is three quarters old. Arguably, the bigger problem with Trump’s assertion is the idea that ""nobody thought that was possible."" Here, Trump is confusing 3 percent growth during a single quarter with 3 percent growth sustained over an entire year. Due to normal variations in the economy, meeting the 3 percent threshold for a quarter is not uncommon. But it has been almost a decade and a half since the U.S. economy grew at a 3 percent pace over an entire year. As the chart shows, the last time the economy as a whole grew at 3 percent for an entire year was in 2005, when it grew at 3.3 percent. ""Economists do not expect a consistent 3 percent annual growth from the U.S. economy given our demographics and our current productivity numbers,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. (Read our more detailed explanation of economists’ reasoning.) By contrast, quarterly increases of 3 percent are not rare -- in fact, they happened eight times under Obama, including levels Trump has not yet reached, such as 4.6 percent (twice) and 5.2 percent (once). The one caveat to keep in mind is that Trump’s task in expanding GDP rapidly is harder than it was for Obama, said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. That’s because the recovery has been going for so long -- since June 2009 -- that the economy has less ""slack"" in it that could feed quick growth. ""Experience shows that it is easier to see quarters with relatively rapid real GDP growth when the economy can grow both because of a growing working-age population and rising productivity and because many of the involuntarily unemployed are finding jobs,"" Burtless said. Trump said, ""Watch those GDP numbers. We started off at a very low number, and right now we hit a 3.2 (percent). Nobody thought that was possible."" This is inaccurate two ways. First, the most recent saw GDP growth of 2.0 percent, not 3.2 percent. And second, exceeding 3 percent GDP growth in a quarter is not an unusual achievement -- Obama accomplished it eight times. The real achievement would be a full year at 3 percent, which hasn’t happened under Trump yet.

Donald Trump wrong that Mercedes, BMW import cars to U.S. by the millions
","During a June 28 visit to Mount Pleasant, Wis. -- the site of a planned Foxconn manufacturing facility -- President Donald Trump defended his hard line on international trade, which has included the imposition of tariffs against both historical friends and adversaries. At one point, he singled out German cars. ""The European Union … they send us Mercedes, they send us -- by the millions -- the BMWs -- cars by the millions,"" Trump said. This assertion is wrong. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) We turned to data from the Center for Automotive Research, an Ann Arbor, Mich., think tank. In 2017, the Center for Automotive Research found, BMW sold 354,110 cars in the United States, while Daimler sold 375,311, mostly Mercedes-Benzes. That’s 729,000 vehicles -- not even one million, much less ""millions."" Volkswagen, another German automaker that Trump didn’t mention by name but which is also based in the European Union, sold 625,068 cars in the United States that year. Adding the three companies together, that works out to 1.35 million German cars sold in the United States last year. That’s not exactly ""millions,"" either -- but the problem with Trump’s assertion runs deeper than that. The big three German automakers all have operations in the United States as well as overseas. So care needs to be taken to clarify where the German cars are made before they are labeled ""imports."" BMW’s largest assembly plant in the world is in Spartanburg, S.C., while Mercedes has a facility in Tuscaloosa County, Ala., and Volkswagen has a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. Production levels for German cars in the United States have risen in recent years, with some of those cars sold in the United States and some exported overseas. When we inquired with Edmunds.com, an automotive website and analytical group, they sent us data showing that about 330,000 of the 1.35 million German cars sold in the United States in 2017 had been built here. That leaves about 980,000 German cars built elsewhere but sold in the United States. To take one example, according to the Center for Automotive Research, BMW made 371,000 cars in the United States in 2017, exported 272,000 of these, sold the remaining 99,000 U.S.-built cars in the U.S. market, and imported roughly 255,000 cars for U.S. buyers in 2017. ""For sure, the raw number of imports are nowhere near ‘millions,’ "" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. German carmakers didn't just ship cars from Germany, but also from Mexico, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Hungary, Spain, Brazil, Argentina, France and Italy, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research. A little less than half of German car imports to the United States actually came from Germany directly, she said. It’s also worth noting that even U.S. carmakers import cars into the United States. In fact, collectively, they import cars on a larger scale than the German companies do. Specifically, Ford imported 100,000 cars into the United States on net, while General Motors imported 760,000 cars on net and Fiat-Chrysler imported 920,000 on net. For the record, sales by the the three German carmakers are modest in the U.S. market, accounting for 8.5 percent of all sales in 2017, according to the Center for Automotive Research. By contrast, the Big Three U.S. automakers accounted for about 48 percent of U.S. sales that year. Meanwhile, Trump’s formulation also leaves out the economic benefits of having German automakers operating factories in the United States. Collectively, these plants employ an estimated 50,000 workers, and they have spillover effects on the local, regional and national economies. ""American workers are building some of the most popular vehicles with U.S. shoppers: SUVs,"" said Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto industry analysis with Edmunds.com. ""As more and more Americans opt to trade in their sedans for an SUV, the percentage of U.S.-built German vehicles on the road is on the rise."" Trump said, ""The European Union … they send us Mercedes, they send us -- by the millions -- the BMWs -- cars by the millions."" Together, Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen imported less than a million cars into the United States in 2017, not ""millions."" More importantly, Trump ignores that a large proportion of German cars sold in the United States were also built here, using American workers and suppliers whose economic fortunes are boosted by Germany’s carnakers. Other U.S.-built German cars were sold as exports.

Websites wrongly claim man arrested on child sex charges was a Clinton campaign official
","A new outrage is bubbling on social media, this time over the arrest of a 22-year-old man on charges of attempting to sexually exploit a child, enticing a child to engage in sexual activity and possessing child pornography. The charges have made news for several outlets — including the Washington Post — because the perpetrator was a well-known activist working to prevent sexual violence. Before his arrest, Joel Davis was the founding executive director of the international organization Youth to End Sexual Violence and a member of the International Campaign to Stop Rape & Gender Violence in Conflict, an international group of human rights experts. But some conservative websites have tried to attach another, unsubstantiated label to Davis, writing that he worked as a ""campaign official"" for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. We found no evidence to support this claim. ""Clinton campaign official arrested by FBI on child rape/trafficking charges,"" said a June 27, 2018, headline from Puppet String News, an ""alternative news"" source, according to its about page. The Puppet String News report cited an article from blog site True Pundit, which in turn linked to a story from Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper. Several other blog sites with histories of peddling falsehoods online published similar articles. Both Puppet String News and True Pundit said Davis worked for Clinton’s election campaign. ""Child trafficking is now exposed as officially embedded within the Clinton campaign, as Clinton for 2016 campaign staffer Joel Davis has been arrested for raping children and trying to meet up with children as young as two,"" the Puppet String news story said. ""The Clinton campaign literally just had a top staffer arrested on child rape/trafficking charges by the FBI … you can only bet it goes all the way to Hillary Clinton and obvious top aides."" The Daily Mail story — the likely source for both inaccurate reports — made no such claim, but did include a photo from Davis’ Facebook page that showed the university student wearing a Clinton campaign pin and standing in front of multiple Clinton campaign posters. The three others in the photo can be seen holding clipboards and folders, but Davis’s hands are empty, save for a cup of coffee. A caption attributed to the photo by the Daily Mail said, ""He's with her: Davis posted this picture after Hillary Clinton's election defeat, suggesting he had campaigned for the 2016 loser."" Davis was allegedly committing the same crimes he was outwardly fighting, according to a Justice Department press release. Davis texted undercover FBI agents sexually explicit photos and videos of children and said he wanted to have sex with children of any age, according to the federal criminal complaint. And, Davis was a Clinton supporter to some degree. In what he called ""the only post about #election2016 I'm going to write,"" Davis wrote in a Nov. 9, 2016, Facebook post that ""felt betrayed"" by the election result because he had been living ""inside a liberal bubble."" But Davis never indicated that he had worked for Clinton, and even if he had, campaigning for Clinton is not the same as being a ""campaign official"" or a ""top staffer."" We searched Google and Nexis and did not find any credible reports connecting Davis to Clinton. We also checked Davis’s Twitter and LinkedIn accounts and found no mention of the campaign. Seemingly, the only evidence to support the claim that Davis worked for the Clinton campaign is a photo showing him and three others with Clinton campaign pins and posters. (Puppet String News did not respond to a request for comment sent via Facebook Messenger.) That does not make him a top Clinton aide, staffer or official. We rate this claim False.

Jeff Sessions' false claim that 80 percent of asylum applications are without merit
","Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the Trump administration’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy to prosecute all immigrants who enter the United States illegally, saying not prosecuting them would be a ""disservice"" to the country and an ""insult"" to those who come to the United States legally. Sessions said ""adults are only being arrested"" because they didn’t come to the United States through a port of entry ""where they could have applied for asylum lawfully."" (That’s not accurate. Immigrants can apply for asylum even if apprehended at the border, regardless of immigration status.) ""But many do not apply for asylum, of course"" Sessions said June 25 before the National Association of School Resource Officers. ""And our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief."" Is Sessions accurate that 80 percent of immigrants who apply for asylum ""do not merit the relief""? We asked the Justice Department about Sessions’ claim, pointing to Sessions’ prepared remarks posted on the department’s website saying: ""courts find that 80 percent of asylum claims are without merit."" In fiscal year 2017 there was a 20 percent grant rate for asylum applications, ""which suggests that most are not meritorious,"" Justice Department spokesman Devin M. O’Malley told PolitiFact. But experts told us it’s not that clear cut that the remaining 80 percent of asylum applications are not merited. There are several other reasons why an asylum claim is not granted, experts told us. Here’s a closer look at the issue. The Justice Department pointed to immigration court statistics, particularly a table on asylum rates for the latest full fiscal year, 2017. A footnote for that table said the data is for asylum decisions on affirmative and defensive applications issued in completed removal, deportation, exclusion, and asylum-only proceedings. (""Affirmative asylum"" is filed voluntarily with Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; if USCIS is unable to approve a case, the agency may refer it to immigration court within the Justice Department. ""Defensive asylum"" applications go before an immigration judge and are filed by individuals who are in removal proceedings.) Here’s what the 2017 asylum rates said: • Grant rate: 20.22 percent • Denial rate: 33.51 percent • Other closure rate: 27.66 percent • Administrative closure rate: 18.61 percent The ""other"" rate is for cases that have a decision of abandonment, not adjudicated, other, or withdrawn. The administrative closure rate covers ""decisions that have not been placed back on the docket following a granted motion to recalendar,"" the footnote for the table said. Just because the grant rate is about 20 percent, it does not mean that an 80 percent aren’t qualified, or don’t merit relief, as Sessions claimed. As the Justice Department table showed, there are several other factors at play. It’s also worth noting that the data the Justice Department highlighted includes ""affirmative asylum"" cases, which initiate with USCIS and are referred to immigration court. Affirmative asylum applicants are not in removal proceedings, as would be people apprehended at the border due to the ""zero-tolerance"" policy. Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, pointed to other data released in the Justice Department’s fiscal year 2016 statistics yearbook. It showed a 31 percent grant rate in 2016 for defensive asylum claims. Border claims would fall into that pile (along with some others), Gilman said. Immigration law experts told us that some asylum cases can also be denied while still having viable claims. It is not accurate to infer that because only 20 percent of claims were granted that the rest were not meritorious, said Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School. ""Many cases are denied for procedural reasons not related to the merit of the claim, or because the applicants are unrepresented or poorly represented and therefore don't have the chance to make their case in an effective way,"" Gordon said. She also said that cases decided by asylum officers are not counted in the immigration court statistics. Access to counsel significantly impacts the outcome of a case, said Lori A. Nessel, a law professor and director of Seton Hall University School of Law's Center for Social Justice. ""When asylum-seekers are detained, they are much less likely to have lawyers and without lawyers, they are less likely to even seek asylum or other relief, much less be granted,"" Nessel said. Immigrants, including asylum applicants, also do fare better in some courts than in others, said Stephen Meili, associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School. An October 2017 story published on NJ.com noted disparities in outcome of cases, with immigrants faring better in courts in Newark, N.J. than in Atlanta. Greater access to lawyers in the Newark and New York area could determine success in courts, the story said. In discussing merit, it's also important to count the number of cases that are reversed by the board of immigration appeals or by one of the circuit courts of appeals, said James Hathaway, a law professor and director of the Program in Refugee and Asylum Law at the University of Michigan Law School. Sessions said, ""Our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief."" Sessions’ claim is based on Justice Department data showing a 20 percent asylum grant rate in 2017. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the remaining 80 percent were without merit. The data the Justice Department used to support Sessions’ remark actually undercut his point. Some cases had not been adjudicated or placed in the court docket. Immigration law experts also said that even if a case is denied, it could still be meritorious, but unsuccessful in court because an applicant did not have a lawyer. Sessions’ claim is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBC35C0>],/factchecks/2018/jul/02/jeff-sessions/jeff-sesssions-false-claim-80-percent-asylum-appli/

A look at Marco Rubio's West Miami home
","Forget for a minute about the awkward grasp for a plastic bottle of Poland Spring before millions on live TV.

There’s something else in Sen. Marco Rubio’s response to the State of the Union on Tuesday that is riling up the blogosphere. Where does Marco Rubio live?

President Barack Obama loves to say people who don’t agree with him are rich, Rubio said on Feb. 12, 2013. Rubio went on to emphasize his own middle-class Republican cred.

""Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren’t millionaires. They’re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare. They’re workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills. They’re immigrants, who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy.""

Some bloggers jabbed Rubio for omitting details about his West Miami crib.

The headline of a post from Miami gossip columnist Jose Lambiet: ""Marco Rubio: I still live in da hood -- sorta!"" Lambiet included a slew of photos of Rubio’s home on his blog, including his living room, kitchen, and backyard pool, trampoline, wooden fort and patio surrounded by a tall green hedge. Miami New Times dinged Rubio for his ""humbleboast.""

What’s their beef?

One, Rubio did not mention his home is for sale. Rubio wants to sell the four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home and buy one in D.C. so he can see his kids more often, spokesman Alex Conant told The Daily Caller in January. Rubio rents a room in a Capitol Hill apartment, Conant said.

""If he can sell his home in Miami, he would be able to afford to move his wife and kids to Washington during the school year and still own a home in Florida,"" Conant told us in an email.

And two, at a listing price of $675,000, the two-story, 2,700-square-foot home on a cul de sac is not what some may consider ""working class.""

From New Times: West Miami is, in fact, a fairly blue collar town, just west of tonier Coral Gables. But it's pretty brazen to put your residence there in a nationally televised speech when 1) you are actively trying to leave that working-class neighborhood and 2) you stand to make more than a half-million bucks by doing so.

Rubio and wife Jeanette bought the home in 2005 for $550,000, the same year it was built. The sale garnered controversy for Rubio in 2008 when the Miami Herald reported Rubio failed to disclose a $135,000 equity line he obtained from a bank run by political supporters after taking out his mortgage.

Rubio’s realtor and brother-in-law, Orlando Cicilia of Centrust Realty, told us Rubio’s home is one of the nicer ones in his neighborhood.

""It’s all a working-class neighborhood,"" he said. ""You’ve got some executives, and you have a lot of regular people there.""

Cicilia said he found the home for Rubio at a construction price in 2005. Cicilia, married to Rubio’s older sister, lives in Rubio’s childhood home, about half a mile away. Cicilia did not want to elaborate on that.

The neighborhood is in a central location close to pricier Coral Gables, the airport, shopping malls and other businesses. About 27,000 people live in Rubio's zip code (33144), according to the Census Bureau’s 2007-11 American Community Survey.

Obama says fuel efficiency has doubled
","
President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address that the country’s progress toward energy independence can be measured in miles per gallon.

""Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control our own energy future,"" he said. ""We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar, with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it.""

A lot of energy claims are packed in that statement. Here, we’ll examine whether we’ve ""doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas.""

We reached out to the White House asking for backup to this claim but did not receive any. But back in 2011, the EPA announced a plan, in partnership with a dozen automakers, to increase average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks. (That figure represents a combined city/highway rating as tested in a lab. In real-world driving, the EPA estimates drivers would average closer to 43 mpg.)

Is that for cars coming off the assembly line now? Not hardly. The 54.5 mpg benchmark is the goal for model year 2025 vehicles.

Fuel efficiency is gradually increasing on the way to the 2025 goal. When he took office in 2009, federal standards called for an average rating of 27.5 mpg. For 2013 vehicles, the standard is 30.5 mpg. In 2016, it rises to 34.1.

So comparing fuel efficiency in 2009 and now, there’s an increase of 11 percent -- not nearly double.

Our ruling

Obama said the U.S. has ""doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas,"" which clearly sounds as though cars on the road today are running at twice their earlier fuel efficiency. But he was comparing a real number with a projected one, a standard for vehicles manufactured more than a decade from now.

The statement was misleading and more importantly untrue. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEC5A00>],/factchecks/2013/feb/14/barack-obama/obama-says-fuel-efficiency-has-doubled/

Chris Christie vetoed bills to raise minimum wage and restore Earned Income Tax Credit, Democratic Party chairman says
","

As state Sen. Barbara Buono kicked off her campaign to unseat Gov. Chris Christie, state Democratic Party Chairman John Wisniewski said she had a record on which to run.

That record, he said, belongs to the Republican governor.

With supporters holding up Buono signs behind him, Wisniewski sounded off on Christie’s tenure during a Feb. 2 campaign kickoff rally at New Brunswick High School. Buono forms the ""perfect contrast"" to Christie, said Wisniewski, a state assemblyman from Middlesex County.

""We have a governor who’s vetoed measures like increasing our minimum wage and restoring the Earned Income Tax Cut,"" Wisniewski said, eliciting boos from the crowd.

The assemblyman’s charges are pretty solid. By different means, Christie has vetoed bills to raise the minimum wage and to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit after reducing that benefit in his first state budget.

But Wisniewski’s statement ignores the fact Christie also has offered alternatives to both.

First, let’s talk about the minimum wage.

In late 2012, the Democrat-controlled Legislature passed a bill to increase the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 and implement annual cost-of-living increases. But on Jan. 28, Christie conditionally vetoed the legislation and recommended certain changes, including scrapping cost-of-living increases and phasing in over three years a $1 increase.

Democrats have rejected that plan and vowed to ask voters in November to amend the state Constitution with a minimum wage hike tied to annual cost-of-living increases.

Now, we’ll address the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income residents who work.

As part of the fiscal year 2011 budget, the state tax credit was reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent of the federal amount. That reduction began with tax year 2010.

The Legislature passed a bill in June 2011 to restore the credit to the original 25 percent figure, but Christie later vetoed the bill without proposing any changes. In June 2012, Christie vetoed a second bill to restore the credit.

However, around the same time, he offered to restore the credit as part of a plan to provide an income tax cut That proposal was outlined in Christie’s conditional veto of a separate bill that would have raised the income tax rate on taxable income of more than $1 million.

The Legislature has not acted on the governor’s proposal.

More recently, Christie agreed to increase the tax credit as part of his conditional veto on the minimum wage bill.

So, while it’s correct the governor vetoed two bills to restore the Earned Income Tax Credit, he also has offered at least two proposals that included increasing the tax credit.

Alicia D’Alessandro, a spokeswoman for Wisniewski, said in an e-mail that the governor’s alternative proposals are not worth acknowledging.

""The conditions attached to his vetoes undercut the purpose of the bills and do not even merit acknowledgement,"" she said. ""In what world would the Democratic state chairman give credit to the Republican governor for ‘alternative measures’ that were clearly offered only for show?

""Anyone who believes that would happen at a campaign rally must think this election is happening in Fantasyland.""

Our ruling

At a campaign rally for Buono, Wisniewski said: ""We have a governor who’s vetoed measures like increasing our minimum wage and restoring the earned income tax cut.""

Wisniewski is right about those vetoes. Christie conditionally vetoed a bill to raise the state’s minimum wage and issued absolute vetoes on two bills to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit.

But the governor has offered alternatives to increase the minimum wage and restore the tax credit to its previous level.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

California editorial says Texas is tops in carbon dioxide emissions and toxic releases into water
","Reacting to Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch and woo of Californians, a Sacramento Bee editorial played off of a radio ad in which Perry urged businesses there to check out Texas.

The Feb. 6, 2013, editorial listed various ways Texas isn’t so great. We’ve since piled up related fact checks, here.

For this article, we’re reviewing this Texas reference in the editorial: ""Come check out a state that ranks... first in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and first in the amount of toxic chemicals released into water.""

No. 1 polluter, times two?

Stuart Leavenworth, who oversees the Bee editorial page, did not offer backup for the reference to toxic chemical releases. But he pointed us to a Texas news account about carbon dioxide emissions.

For our look, we’ll consider CO2, then toxic chemicals put into water, looking both at raw amounts and the totals adjusted for state populations and economic output.

Carbon dioxide emissions The Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article says that according to federal data released that day, Texas releases far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continues: ""Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show.""

The story says the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It says the agency ""collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said.""

To our inquiries, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says.

And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons.

According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency.

It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: ""Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well.""

Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities.

Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons.

So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions. However, we calculated, Texas would have tied for 13th among the states if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population that year, as gauged by the U.S. Census Bureau. Less populous states led after this adjustment, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. California emissions were 10 metric tons per resident.

Toxic chemical releases Wondering how Texas ranks in toxic chemicals released into water, we queried Luke Metzger, who heads Environment Texas, which describes itself as a statewide citizen-funded advocate for clean air, clean water and open spaces.

Metzger pointed out that the EPA maintains a Toxic Release Inventory, tabulating reported releases into waterways of 231 toxic chemicals or classes of toxic pollutants. Environment Texas drew on the inventory for an April 2012 report stating that Texas ranked fourth nationally in 2010 with 14.3 million pounds of toxic discharges.

Top Ten States by Toxic Industrial Releases Into Waterways, 2010 (Millions of Pounds) 

Source: Environment Texas, April 2012 report.

According to the report, Indiana had the most toxic releases, more than 27 million pounds, followed by Virginia (18 million pounds) and Nebraska (14.7 million pounds). Nationally, 226 million pounds were released in 2010, the report says. It cautions, too, that the totals solely reflect industrial releases, not accounting for other sources including wastewater treatment plants and agriculture-related facilities. Still, the report says, the federal inventory is the ""best and most complete set of data available.""

Adjusting these figures for each state’s 2010 population changes the rank order, putting Texas at No. 10, with toxic releases of 0.6 pounds per resident--and that is also without checking per-capita tallies for 40 remaining states. On a per-person basis, Nebraska led the nine other states, at 8 pounds per resident, followed by Indiana (4) and Virginia (2). Every other of the 10 states had a ratio of less than two pounds per resident.

By telephone, a consultant to Environment Texas, Tony Dutzik of the Boston-based Frontier Group, said another way to gauge CO2 emissions and toxic releases into water by state is to compare totals compared to each state’s Gross Domestic Product, which indicates its economic activity. We tried that for the 2010 toxic releases by using state GDPs for 2010, as posted by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. By this filter, Nebraska had the most toxic releases per dollar of GDP, Texas the 10th-highest--again, only among the 10 states identified as having the most overall industrial releases that year.

We also applied the GDP filter to the 10 states, including Texas, that had the greatest industrial CO2 emissions in 2010. By this metric, Texas was tied with Kansas for 12th; Wyoming ranked first.

By email, Metzger sent a spreadsheet, which he said Dutzik had built from more recent data posted by the EPA, indicating that Texas ranked third overall among the states in industrial toxic releases into water in 2011, trailing Indiana and Virginia, but running ahead of Georgia.

Our ruling

The editorial said Texas ranks first nationally in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and toxic chemicals released into water.

We can see a basis for the first part of the claim, though not the second. Texas ranks No. 1 in CO2 emissions, by a wide margin. But it trailed about a dozen states in 2010 after each state's emissions were adjusted for the state's population or economic output.

In 2011, Texas ranked third in total industrial releases of toxic chemicals into water; it was fourth nationally the previous year--and adjusting for each state’s population or economic output leaves Texas in 10th place among those states with the most industrial toxic releases that year.

We rate this two-part claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF12540>],/factchecks/2013/feb/13/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/california-editorial-says-texas-tops-carbon-dioxid/
"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'Terrorism', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says he's kept Congress ""fully informed"" on targeted killings
","
After being criticized for using drones to kill suspected terrorists, including American citizens, President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address that he has been transparent with Congress about his administration’s policy.

""Where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans,"" Obama said. ""Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts. Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts.""

With all the controversy, we wondered if it was correct that he'd kept Congress ""fully informed.""

The White House’s case

The White House told us Obama has been transparent about his policies on the killings, citing speeches by two high-ranking officials on how the administration decides to target a terrorist suspect. One was by Attorney General Eric Holder at Northwestern University School of Law on March 5, 2012. The other was by John Brennan, now Obama’s pick to head the CIA, at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars on April 30, 2012.

The White House also noted that in the run-up to Brennan’s confirmation hearing, the administration released key documents to the committee, including a 2010 memo by the Office of Legal Counsel that laid the groundwork for the U.S. drone strike a year later on Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to Al Qaida. Those documents were to be studied privately by the committee and were not made public. However, NBC News obtained a shorter ""white paper"" that is believed to have been derived from the longer Office of Legal Counsel memo.

The White House also highlighted a comment that Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, made in an interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. When Mitchell asked whether the president ""is making the decision with no congressional or judicial oversight,"" Rogers replied, ""I'll disagree a little bit. There is oversight."" Referring to the al-Awlaki case, Rogers said, ""I knew about the operations leading up to it and I review all of the airstrikes that we use under this title of the law.""

How lawmakers see it

However, several lawmakers, including several senior senators, have spent years seeking documents from the administration, which indicates that not everyone agrees with Obama’s claim of having kept Congress ""fully informed.""

Four days before the State of the Union address, a blog by Marcy Wheeler called ""emptywheel"" assembled a list of 15 instances from the past two years in which lawmakers have sought information from the administration about its policy on targeted killing. The blog post backs up its claims with links to original documents.

The lawmakers seeking information include Republicans (Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Rep. Tom Graves of Georgia) and Democrats (Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Reps. John Conyers of Michigan, Jerry Nadler of New York and Bobby Scott of Virginia). Some examples:

• Following a June 7, 2012, hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on Justice Department oversight, members of the panel sent a series of follow-up questions to Holder. Among these was a series of questions by Nadler on targeted killing policy. Among other things, Nadler wrote that ""we have yet to get any response to our requests"" for information on the Office of Legal Counsel memo that would later be provided privately to the House and Senate intelligence committees.

• On Dec. 4, 2012, three Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee -- Conyers, the ranking Democrat, plus Nadler and Scott -- wrote a letter to Holder saying that the ""white paper"" provided to the committee was insufficient. ""Unfortunately, while providing some additional information, the paper does not fully satisfy our prior requests or fulfill our ongoing need for information that allows us to conduct meaningful congressional oversight,"" the lawmakers wrote.

• On Feb. 4, 2013, a bipartisan group of 11 senators wrote to Obama asking for ""any and all legal opinions that lay out the executive branch’s official understanding of the president’s authority to deliberately kill American citizens.""

• Finally, on Feb. 8, 2013, six House Judiciary Committee members -- Conyers, Nadler and Scott, plus Republicans Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, the panel’s chairman; James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Trent Franks of Arizona -- wrote to Obama requesting the opportunity to view the same documents he had shown to the intelligence committees.

Meanwhile, Wyden suggested at Brennan’s hearing that he was not satisfied with the administration’s release to the intelligence committees. While he called the release a ""good first step,"" Wyden asked Brennan whether he would ""go back to the White House and convey to them the message that the Justice Department is not yet following through on the president's commitment."" (Brennan said he would.) Wyden also asked Brennan to release ""any and all countries where the intelligence community has used its lethal authorities."" (On that request, Brennan was noncommittal.)

The office of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., released a statement to PolitiFact for this story, saying, ""Sen. Leahy has reviewed the Department of Justice white paper on targeted killings of U.S. citizens, but the White Paper raises more questions than it answers. The White Paper is not an adequate substitute for any Office of Legal Counsel opinions that may address this issue. Sen. Leahy for a considerable period of time publicly and privately has pressed the administration to disclose any such opinions to Congress, and he recently also was part of a larger group of senators who, on a bipartisan basis, asked the president to direct the Department of Justice to turn over any Office of Legal Counsel opinions. He looks forward to hearing from the administration on this issue.""

Coming from a senior senator -- Leahy chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee -- and a member of the president’s own party, this perspective carries some weight in our analysis.

Our ruling

The White House has certainly provided some information to Congress and the public about the process of targeting suspected terrorists, and the adversarial relationship between the executive branch almost ensures that not every one of the 535 members of Congress will be satisfied with what the executive branch discloses.

Still, we think the magnitude of the complaints, and the fact that they’re bipartisan, suggest that this goes well beyond a small fringe of lawmakers.

We particularly find problems with the president’s claim that he’s been transparent ""throughout"" his term and has kept Congress ""fully informed."" The requests for additional information have been pending for much of the president’s tenure in office, a far cry from being transparent ""throughout"" his term. And a recurring theme of these requests is not that the administration is providing no information, but that it is holding back on a portion of the information being sought, which is the opposite of keeping Congress ""fully informed.""

We rate Obama’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE10F80>],/factchecks/2013/feb/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-hes-kept-congress-fully-informed/

Sacramento Bee editorial says Texas has greatest number of uninsured
","
Playing off of Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch in a radio ad for California businesses to check out Texas, a Sacramento Bee editorial published Feb. 6, 2013, mocks the Lone Star State by saying: ""Come check out a state that ranks first in the number of executions, first in the number of uninsured"" — and so on.

We’re tackling each of the Bee editorial board’s Texas-centric factual pokes and stacking our findings here.

We’ve confirmed that Texas is first in executions. For this story, we’re looking into the number of uninsured Texans.

Stuart Leavenworth, who oversees the Bee’s editorial page, pointed out web postings by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicating how many residents of each state have health coverage.

Nationally in 2011, the foundation estimates, some 16 percent of the population was uninsured.

In Texas in 2011, the foundation says, 24 percent of residents had no health insurance — and that was the highest uninsured rate for any state. Some 22 percent of Nevada residents and 21 percent of New Mexico residents lacked coverage, according to the foundation, while California and Louisiana were among five states where 20 percent of the population was uninsured.

The foundation cites as a basis for these percentages household surveys by the U.S Census Bureau, which suggest slightly different levels of the uninsured dependent on whether the cited survey is a one-day snapshot or one that encompasses several years.

Regardless, Texas has consistently had the highest uninsured rate.

Does it also have the greatest number of uninsured, as the editorial says?

Not so. 
Another foundation chart indicates that California had 7.3 million uninsured residents, and Texas had more than 6.1 million. Of course, California’s population exceeds Texas’ by some 12 million.

Separately, we found a lower tally for Californians under age 65 who lack coverage in a December 2012 article by Paul Fronstin of the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of sound public policy through objective research and education. 
A summary of that article opens: ""In 2011, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance — 7.1 million — of any U.S. state. The percentage of uninsured Californians has risen steadily over the past two decades; the state now has the seventh-largest percentage of residents without coverage in the United States."" The summary says, though, that the state’s share of uninsured residents should drop as the federal law known as Obamacare takes full effect.

By email, Fronstin agreed California has more uninsured than Texas, pointing to his own analysis of Census Bureau survey research released in March 2012. Still, he said, 27 percent of Texans under 65 are uninsured, compared with 22 percent of Californians.

Our ruling

The editorial says Texas ranks first among the states in its number of uninsured.

Texas continues to have  the nation’s greatest share of uninsured residents. However, California has about 1 million more uninsured residents.

Ed FitzGerald says he was an early Obama supporter in Cuyahoga County
","
First impressions mean a lot in politics. And for Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, who is gearing up for a run at Ohio Gov. John Kasich next year, they are especially important. 
A Democrat who previously served as mayor of Lakewood, FitzGerald is not well-known beyond Greater Cleveland. He has been traveling the state for nearly a year in an effort to build relationships with party activists who can help make him a credible candidate. 
The effort intensified last month when ex-Gov. Ted Strickland, a fellow Democrat, said he would not seek a rematch with Kasich, a Republican. FitzGerald has been the most active in a group of potential challengers that also includes U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and former Rep. Betty Sutton. 
While speaking last month at the Ohio College Democrats’ winter conference in Cincinnati, FitzGerald mixed his dry humor with political biography. He presented himself as a reformer -- a theme familiar to local voters who elected him to lead them past a corruption scandal. 
The boast that caught our eye was one reported by the Cincinnati Enquirer: ""He proudly said that he was the first Cuyahoga County official to endorse President Barack Obama."" 
PolitiFact Ohio found the line interesting and wanted more context. 
We reached out to the Ohio Republican Party, which sends trackers to capture FitzGerald’s public remarks on video. (FitzGerald frequently jokes that the trackers’ jobs are the only ones Kasich can take credit for creating, but we’ll set that claim aside as political hyperbole.) 
Video provided by the GOP shows FitzGerald made the claim about his Obama endorsement toward the end of a 20-minute speech. While praising the young crowd for its engagement, he drew inspiration from Obama. He recognized Ohio Senate Minority Leader Eric Kearney, who spoke before him, and noted that Kearney was an early supporter of Obama’s 2008 campaign. 
Then FitzGerald continued: ""I was the first elected official in Cuyahoga County to endorse him."" 
Cuyahoga County has nearly 60 municipalities, each with its own set of elected leaders. Obama began his campaign for the presidency in early 2007. At the time, FitzGerald was a city councilman and mayoral aspirant in Lakewood, Cleveland’s second-largest suburb. FitzGerald won his race for mayor that year and was in office by the time the 2008 primary season began. 
A search of Plain Dealer archives revealed then-County Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones as one of Obama’s key local supporters in early 2007. Jones was one of several local officials to attend an Obama’s first Northeast Ohio event Feb. 27, an East Side rally less than three weeks after Obama officially entered the race for the White House.The newspaper’s first mention of FitzGerald as an Obama backer came Jan. 31, 2008, when he represented him at a Lakewood straw poll. Obama beat Hillary Rodham Clinton by a 2-to-1 margin, according to the story. 
We reached out to Jones, now pursuing an acting career. 
""I don’t know how he calculates that he was the first,"" said Jones, who could not remember when he formally endorsed Obama. ""I think that’s incapable of being proven or disproven. How did this manifest itself? He would have had to have gotten up pretty early to beat me to it."" 
When reached by PolitiFact Ohio, FitzGerald said he pledged his support the day Obama declared himself a candidate for president, Feb. 10, 2007. But he added that there probably was no record of the endorsement because he offered it through an Obama campaign web site. 
""He might have beaten me to the web site,"" Jones allowed. 
FitzGerald accurately recalled that Obama began his campaign as an underdog. Clinton was the early favorite for the Democratic nomination. But FitzGerald also acknowledged that he hardly was a heavy-hitter at the time. Even in its infancy the Obama campaign was enough of a force that it didn’t have to worry about telling the world about a city councilman’s endorsement. 
""No one cared about it then,"" FitzGerald said. 
But now it’s a handy tidbit as the county executive contemplates a run for governor. FitzGerald told PolitiFact Ohio that he couldn’t remember why he shared it with the College Democrats, other than to emphasize the importance of getting involved early in a cause you believe in. According to the Ohio GOP video, here’s what he said after claiming first dibs on Obama: 
""There’s a lot of great things that President Obama has done. One of the great things that he’s done is that he has empowered young activists more than any other presidential candidate that I have seen — and, I would argue, ever — since Robert Kennedy."" 
FitzGerald, though, clearly said he was the ""first elected official in Cuyahoga County to endorse"" Obama. To endorse is to ""approve openly"" or ""to express support or approval of publicly and definitely,"" according to the most applicable definition offered by Merriam-Webster. 
We don’t doubt that FitzGerald was one of the first local supporters of the future president. His work in the straw poll, at a time that many were still in Clinton’s corner, confirms that. But FitzGerald’s initial backing, offered quietly online and by his own acknowledgement tough to verify, doesn’t equal an endorsement in the most accurate sense of the word. 
FitzGerald is correct that his support wasn’t a big deal at the time. So even if he was the first or, more precisely, one of the first, he might have overstated the importance of his endorsement. And Jones rightly questions whether it can be proven who, technically, was the first. FitzGerald is unable to offer proof. 
The gubernatorial prospect’s statement has an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, FitzGerald’s claim merits a rating of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA17F80>],/factchecks/2013/feb/13/ed-fitzgerald/ed-fitzgerald-says-he-was-early-obama-supporter-cu/
"['Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Social Security', 'Welfare', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Has Ryan remained consistent in talking about what he calls society's ""takers"" and ""makers?""
","
In the 2012 presidential campaign and for years before that, Paul Ryan warned that a culture of European-style dependency on government programs had created as many ""takers"" as ""makers"" in American society -- or even a majority of ""takers.""

So when President Barack Obama in his second inaugural address proclaimed that Social Security and Medicare strengthen America rather than make it a ""nation of takers,"" many saw it as a swipe at Ryan.

Ryan blasted Obama’s words as misleading.

Republicans, he said, had not meant to include elderly recipients of Social Security and Medicare as ""takers."" Those folks, Ryan said, helped earn their retirement benefits through payroll taxes deducted from their paychecks specifically for those programs.

Ryan critics in the media labeled it a reversal and an attempt to soften the GOP rhetoric on fiscal issues. But Ryan insisted the position didn’t change, though Obama’s words created another impression.

Has Ryan’s position remained the same? Or has the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate altered it as the GOP repositions itself following a painful defeat in the presidential race?

With Ryan a possible presidential candidate in 2016, we thought we’d roll out the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard note: The Flip-O-Meter does not measure whether a change is good politics or good policy, only whether a politician has been consistent.

So, what about those ""takers"" and ""makers""?

We’re not sure who introduced the terms into the political debate, but Ryan helped popularize them, notably after a 2009 report by the business-backed Tax Foundation on the redistribution of federal tax dollars and spending.

That report categorized Americans by whether they had received more in federal benefits than they had paid in various federal taxes, though it used the gentler terminology of ""givers"" and ""receivers.""

The study, cited frequently by Ryan, calculated that 60 percent of families were net receivers and projected the figure would rise to 70 percent under Obama’s policies.

It is important to note that Medicare and Social Security benefits were included in the Tax Foundation calculation. The report, and subsequent ones that borrow from it, make clear that ""all federal spending"" is covered.

The studies also make clear that taxes people pay toward those programs were included on the other side of the ledger.

Enter Ryan, who picked up the 2009 report’s conclusion in support of his argument that America was at or near a ""moral tipping point"" and already at a fiscal crossroads.

His warnings were sometimes dire, and based explicitly on the Tax Foundation report.

In a 2010 interview on a cable show hosted by U.S. Rep. Walter Jones (R-North Carolina), Ryan promoted his debt-reduction plan, including gradually reducing Social Security benefits for younger Americans and replacing Medicare’s guaranteed health benefits with vouchers to help buy private coverage. Those big entitlement programs ""are exploding our debt"" in a way that threatens the U.S. economy, Ryan said.

He told Jones: ""Right now, about 60 percent of the American people get more benefits in dollar value from the federal government than they pay back in taxes. So we’re going to a majority of takers vs. makers in America and that will be tough to come back from that.""

Ryan repeated the point with conservative political activist Star Parker in September 2011.

""Right now according to the Tax Foundation, between 60 and 70 percent  of Americans get more benefits from the federal government than they pay back in taxes,"" he said. ""So we’re getting toward a society where we have a net majority of takers vs. makers, who, if that trend continues, then we’ll have a European situation on our hands.

Campaigning in August 2012, just days before officially joining the presidential ticket with Mitt Romney, Ryan told a MacIver Institute interviewer: ""We risk hitting a tipping point in our society where we have more takers than makers in society, where we will have turned our safety net into a hammock that lulls able bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency which drains them of their will and incentive to make the most of their lives.""

Obama, Ryan said, wrongly portrays Republicans as favoring a ""dog eat dog"" society. They actually want a safety net that provides ""equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome,"" he said.

Ryan avoided the ""takers"" and ""makers"" line -- and references to the Tax Foundation study -- after his August 2012 selection as the veep nominee.

It was a hot topic, though, after a video surfaced of Romney’s remarks that 47 percent of Americans are content to be dependent on government, and they support Obama. In a campaign interview with the Journal Sentinel, Ryan blamed Obama and the bad economy for increasing dependency, and said people were not dependent by choice.

Also during the 2012 campaign, Ryan pulled back from his 2005 description of Social Security as a socialist-based ""welfare transfer"" and ""collectivist system"" that was too costly and should be converted to a system of individual accounts that workers could invest as they wished.

Let’s look now at Ryan’s post-election comments.

Two days after Obama’s inaugural jab at those who call Social Security and Medicare recipients ""takers,"" Ryan told a conservative talk show host that Obama had used a ""twist of terms to try and shadowbox a straw man in order to win an argument by default.""

""No one is suggesting what we call our earned entitlements -- entitlements you pay for, like payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security -- are putting you in a taker category,"" Ryan said on the Laura Ingraham radio show. ""No one suggests that whatsoever.""

Ryan said his primary concern was welfare programs of the sort Washington reformed in the 1990s. That change was under President Bill Clinton, eliminating the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program in favor assistance tied to work.

Ryan’s comments on the show were the first instance we could find of him separating Medicare and Social Security from what he calls the ""takers.""

We asked Ryan’s office if there any instances before the election in which he made the distinction between the retirement programs and ""takers."" The office did not provide any.

Instead, they pointed us to comments he made after the inaugural to Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, in which Ryan noted that Social Security helped him go to college after his father died. Ryan also said he didn’t think of his mother, who is on Medicare, as a taker.

In those interviews, Ryan argued that he had only used the Tax Foundation figure of 60 to 70 percent as a device to highlight his larger point that it’s not too late yet to reverse course because not all takers see themselves that way.

That’s accurate to a point. In some instances he made the larger point by citing surveys showing only 30 percent of Americans favor a welfare state. But in several interviews his point was simply the need to cut the budget to prevent the 60 percent ""takers"" figure from growing.

But here we’re looking at how Ryan defined ""takers"" before the election and whether it changed after the election.

We found no record of Ryan prior to the election spelling out, program by program, which federal benefits would cause him to view a recipient as a ""taker."" Rather, he took an all-in approach.

Ryan labeled all recipients of federal benefits that way, elevating numbers buried in a think-tank report to the statistical centerpiece of his budget-cutting message over a period of years.

Indeed, his warnings about dependency were made all the more dramatic because the numbers he cited were so large -- in part because they included the entitlement programs.

Had Ryan taken out the big entitlement programs the number would have been lower, said Gerald Prante, the former Tax Foundation economist who devised the methodology used in the paper.

In our view, by distancing himself from his prior, broad denunciation of ""takers"" in connection with all federal benefits, Ryan’s post-election approach has changed dramatically.

That’s true both on the key point of how retirement benefits should be viewed, and in the style of his presentation.

A major reversal earns him a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE50B00>],/factchecks/2013/feb/13/paul-ryan/has-ryan-remained-consistent-talking-about-what-h-/

Ex-chief justice's opinion on same-sex marriage hard to gauge
","
The national debate over same-sex marriage has forced most politicians to pick a position. But one well-known figure in Georgia’s legal community says she has avoided taking a stance on the issue for personal and professional reasons.

Former Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears recently wrote a column in Fulton County’s Daily Report. She praised a group called the Institute for American Values for its recent decision to separate from its past position of opining on same-sex marriage.The mission of the conservative, New York-based organization is to ""study and strengthen civil society."" Its president, David Blankenhorn, has been a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, while other board members have been more supportive on the issue. He wrote a book in 2007, ""The Future of Marriage,"" which included his belief that children need a mother and a father. Last year, Blankenhorn described his revised views on same-sex marriage in a New York Times column. Blankenhorn stands by his book, but is now more focused on strengthening the institution of marriage, regardless of the genders involved.

""I'm pleased with the direction the Institute is taking,"" wrote Sears, who has been a board member of the group for several years. ""Unlike David, I was never against same-sex marriage. But much like David, I've witnessed the fallout from broken families in the past several decades, during which divorce and out-of-wedlock births have skyrocketed, and unstable, serial cohabiting relationships have become the norm for raising children.""

PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Sears, whose name frequently appears on lists when there is an important judicial opening, has never opposed same-sex marriage.

Sears, a partner at the law firm Schiff Hardin's Atlanta office, was reportedly on the shortlist of candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court a few years back. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog posted an item about Sears’ column and noted that there are three openings on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which decides cases in Alabama, Florida and Georgia. Sears told PolitiFact Georgia she’s ""not vying for anything.""

Sears told us that she’s been purposefully careful not to offer a position on same-sex marriage, particularly when she was on the bench.

""By having grown up African-American and female, I wanted to be careful and sensitive to the rights of our gay and lesbian citizens,"" she said.

In 2009, an Associated Press story noted that Sears was criticized by gay rights groups, such as Georgia Equality, for joining the Institute for American Values, because of Blankenhorn’s publicly stated opposition to same-sex marriage.  

""Anytime someone joins the board of an organization, I think it’s kind of implied that they support the positions of that organization,"" Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham told PolitiFact Georgia about his group’s criticism of Sears at the time. Despite their criticism, Graham was not aware of any instance in which Sears had publicly stated her position on the issue.

Sears said her role at the institute would build on her work with the Georgia Supreme Court toward ""strengthening the institution of marriage,"" by working to reduce the nation’s divorce rate. (The AP reporter who reported that story now works for the AJC. PolitiFact Georgia checked with him about the piece, and he assured us his reporting was accurate.)

While she was under consideration for the U.S. Supreme Court, it was noted that Sears had addressed same-sex marriage only indirectly, writing in an opinion that alimony should not be reduced for someone who entered into a homosexual relationship the same way it might be if the person had remarried, because such relationships did not enjoy the same legal protections as marriage.

In a 2008 interview with the AJC, Sears was asked if her attendance at a conference on marriage was an indication that she is against same-sex marriage.

""We will have a one-hour debate on same-sex marriage which I will facilitate, and I have no view,"" Sears said as part of her answer. ""I've included it as a small part of the conference because I didn't want people to think I was afraid of it.""

In addition to reviewing Sears’ public statements (or lack of public statements) on the issue, PolitiFact Georgia also reviewed her legal history.

She ruled with the Georgia Supreme Court in throwing out the state’s hate-crimes law in 2004 as ""unconstitutionally vague""; reinstating Georgia’s gay-marriage ban in 2006; and declining to hear an appeal from a biological mother who wanted to terminate the parental rights of her former lesbian partner in 2007, and in 2004 opposed the state Legislature’s successful attempt to place an anti-same-sex marriage amendment on the ballot.

During her Georgia Supreme Court re-election campaign in 1998, one of her two opponents spread the idea that Sears supported same-sex marriage. Sears declined comment; her campaign manager said Sears’ statements used in the accusations were taken out of context.

So where does former Georgia Supreme Court Justice Leah Ward Sears stand on same-sex marriage?

Earlier this month, she said in a newspaper column that she was ""never against same-sex marriage."" Never is pretty definitive and PolitiFact Georgia sets the bar high when someone is absolute about whether they’ve said or claimed they’ve never made a particular statement.

Sears was careful not to enter the controversial fray during her time on the bench, and from the research we reviewed, she had not taken a public stance on the issue. Still, she went to work a few years ago for a conservative think tank whose leader has been a staunch same-sex opponent, and she told PolitiFact Georgia that she is grappling with her position on the issue. In addition, her legal record while on the Georgia Supreme Court shows she has sided with the majority on rulings that have been cheered and jeered by gay rights activists.

We ruled her statement Mostly True.

President Barack Obama says an 'overwhelming' majority supports gun legislation like background checks
","
President Barack Obama used his 2013 State of the Union address to urge Congress to vote on legislation to reduce gun violence.

Victims of recent attacks deserve it, he said, and voters support some ""common-sense reform.""

""Overwhelming majorities of Americans – Americans who believe in the 2nd Amendment – have come together around common-sense reform – like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun,"" he told lawmakers.

Do ""overwhelming majorities of Americans"" support gun legislation such as background checks?

 The evidence

Viewers who watched an enhanced version of Obama’s speech online at WhiteHouse.gov saw a graphic that said ""92 percent of Americans support background checks for gun buyers.""

It cited an independent poll from Quinnipiac University, which we quickly found on the university’s site.

The results from the phone poll of 1,772 registered voters in late January and early February 2013 were straightforward:

• It found 92 percent support for background checks for all gun buyers, which the Quinnipiac pollsters described as ""overwhelming.""

• It found 91 percent support for universal background checks among voters in a household with a gun.

Other polls we’ve cited in recent fact-checks also found high percentages of support for universal background checks, even among gun owners.

A Pew Research Center poll from Jan. 9-13, 2013, of 1,502 adults found 85 percent of Americans (and 85 percent of gun owners) favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.

A CBS/New York Times poll conducted Jan. 11-15 among 1,110 adults showed that 92 percent of Americans (and 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member) support universal background checks.

Obama did cherry-pick the gun-control proposal on which consensus is strongest -- background checks. Other proposals he might also call ""common-sense,"" such as bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, held 56 percent support in the Quinnipiac poll. And they were narrowly opposed by voters in households with a gun, with 52 percent against such measures.

 Our ruling

Obama said ""overwhelming majorities of Americans"" support gun legislation ""like background checks."" The poll cited by the administration, as well as other independent polls in 2013, do show support for universal background checks above 80 percent among voters, even those who own guns.

But people would get the impression from Obama's statement that there is similar support for other White House gun proposals, when the reality is weaker majority support among voters and slim opposition among gun owners. That’s a point worth clarifying. We rate the president’s claim Mostly True.

Marco Rubio says sequester was Obama’s idea
","
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio delivered the Republicans’ response to the State of the Union address, criticizing President Barack Obama on policy but also style.

""Any time anyone opposes the president’s agenda, he and his allies usually respond by falsely attacking their motives,"" Rubio said. He named several examples, including the sweeping cuts to military and other spending set to take effect unless Congress and the president agree on deficit-reduction package.

""Tonight, he even criticized us for refusing to raise taxes to delay military cuts – cuts that were his idea in the first place,"" Rubio said.

For the record, Obama didn’t make that specific criticism in his speech, but here we’re focusing on the second half of Rubio’s statement about where the idea of the cuts originated.

We have examined claims similar to this before, when Mitt Romney made the charge during the presidential campaign, and when Obama turned the tables and blamed the sequester on Congress. Let’s review.

In search of a budget deal

In 2011, the federal government was nearing its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing. Raising the debt limit (also called the debt ceiling) was in some ways symbolic: Congress has the power of the purse, and the decisions to spend the money had already been made.
   
But that didn’t stop a showdown in the summer of 2011. House Republicans insisted that actual spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner led negotiations with the White House, and at first the sides seemed to be moving toward a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget, dubbed the ""grand bargain.""
   
The closed-door negotiations fell apart, though, and a flurry of finger pointing ensued. Some observers blamed Boehner for being unable to deliver his own Republicans on a deal, thanks to tea party opposition to any new taxes. Others blamed Obama for his inexperience, for not cultivating relationships with Republicans and for tactical mistakes at negotiating. Some blamed both.  
   
At any rate, Republicans and Democrats came to a less ambitious agreement to raise the debt limit through the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law found approximately $1.2 trillion in budget cuts spread over 10 years. But it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion through a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. This 12-member committee became known as ""the super-committee.""
   
The super-committee was supposed to meet and agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 23, 2011. Their proposal -- which could include tax increases, spending reductions or both -- would then get a filibuster-proof, up-or-down vote in Congress.
   
As an incentive to action, the law included an unusual kind of budget threat: If the super-committee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted it down, then automatic, across-the-board cuts would go into effect, with half of those cuts hitting defense. These automatic cuts are referred to as ""sequestration.""
   
Lo and behold, the super-committee didn’t agree on a deficit reduction package, so Congress never voted on it. More deadlines have come and gone, and smaller budget patches have been passed. But the sequester is looming again, with big cuts set to hit March 1.

Whose idea?

Some of the most detailed reporting on sequestration is from Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his book The Price of Politics. Woodward’s reporting shows clearly that defense sequestration was an idea that came out of Obama’s White House.
   
The intention, however, was to force Republicans to negotiate, not to actually put the cuts into effect.

Woodward summarizes the thoughts of the Obama team: ""There would be no chance the Republicans would want to pull the trigger and allow the sequester to force massive cuts to Defense."" Democrats, meanwhile, didn’t want to see their favorite domestic programs cut.
   
As the negotiations proceeded, Republicans seemed to think the same thing.
   
""Boehner told the House Republican leadership and other key members not to worry about the sequester … ‘Guys, this would be devastating to Defense,’ he said. ‘This would be devastating, from their perspective, on their domestic priorities. This is never going to happen.’""
   
Yet even as the deadline nears (again), it’s clear neither side wants federal spending to plummet.

In August 2012, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a report detailing how sequestration will affect different departments. In its introduction, the OMB repeats the Obama administration’s opposition to the process.
   
""The specter of harmful across-the-board cuts to defense and nondefense programs was intended to drive both sides to compromise. Congress can and should take action to avoid it by passing a comprehensive and balanced deficit reduction package.
   
""As the administration has made clear, no amount of planning can mitigate the effect of these cuts. Sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument. It is not the responsible way for our nation to achieve deficit reduction.""
   
Still, some people we say that the Obama White House proposed sequestration, so that means Obama owns it. 
Here's what experts told us last fall. 
""While both parties are culpable for sequestration because the Budget Control Act passed Congress, the president proposed it originally and ultimately owns its outcome,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, an expert on defense with the conservative American Enterprise Institute who advised the Romney campaign. ""That is because he alone can lead by calling the party leaders together for a resolution today if he wanted as president.""
   
Other see the two parties as co-owners of sequestration, especially since Republicans in Congress voted for the law that set up its possibility. In the House, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted for the law, while 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 269-161.) In the Senate, 28 Republicans and 45 Democrats voted for it, while 19 Republicans and 6 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 74-26)
   
""The logic that lays the blame for sequestration at Obama's feet, because he negotiated the BCA with GOP leaders in Congress, could just as easily apply to those other negotiators, or, indeed, any member of Congress who voted for the BCA in August 2011,"" said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Preble favors reductions to the defense budget.
   
Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense also noted that sequestration results from a law passed in the usual manner. ""I think the fact that Congress passed it means it is not a presidential mandate. It was a law that originated in Congress and was sent to the president’s desk,"" she said.

Our ruling

Rubio said the defense cuts known that are part of sequestration were Obama’s ""idea in the first place.""

That doesn’t tell the whole story -- particularly the fact that Obama does not favor these cuts. The White House proposed them as a means of driving the two sides to a compromise over the deficit, not as a real-world spending plan.

Still, the idea did originate with Obama’s team. We rate Rubio’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE50740>],/factchecks/2013/feb/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-sequester-was-obamas-idea/

Barack Obama touts administration's border enforcement achievements in State of the Union
","
During his State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama touted his administration’s record on curbing illegal immigration.

""We can build on the progress my administration has already made – putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years,"" Obama said.

We looked at both parts of this claim during the second presidential debate between Obama and Mitt Romney. We don’t see substantive changes in the wording, and we haven’t found any updated data, so we will recap our previous analysis here.

As usual, when a speaker makes a claim that suggests either credit or blame, we do a two-step assessment. Is the statement factually accurate? And is the credit or blame fairly assigned?
   
More boots on the southern border than at any time in our history
   
In 2012, the Border Patrol had 18,516 agents on the southwestern border with Mexico, accounting for about 87 percent of all agents. The number of agents on the southwestern border has risen by 6 percent from the 2009 level, and is currently five times higher than the 1993 level.
   
The total number of agents is higher than in any year going back to at least 1924, according to data from the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics compiled and provided to PolitiFact by Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied immigration issues.
   
It’s worth noting that the biggest bump in Border Patrol staffing came under President George W. Bush. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents rose by about two thirds.
   
Still, Obama framed his claim carefully. Are there more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history? The answer is yes.
   
Is the flow of undocumented immigrants the lowest in 40 years?
   
When demographers try to measure the number of people crossing the border illegally, they usually refer to the net flow -- arrivals to the United States minus departures. Lately, that number has been essentially a wash, according to statistics from the Pew Hispanic Center.
   
The center estimated that between 2010 and 2011, the number of immigrants from Mexico declined so much that the flow into Mexico was bigger than the flow out of Mexico for the first time since ""probably in the 1930s,"" Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for Pew, told us last October.
   
This is consistent with the kind of decline Obama was referring  to, but both Passel and Massey said Obama was likely referring to a somewhat different statistic -- namely, apprehensions of individuals crossing from Mexico to the United States. Those numbers also support Obama’s claim.
   
Apprehension statistics are an imperfect gauge of population flow, since they can be affected by the magnitude of the border patrol effort. Still, while this statistic is not a ""direct measure of flow across the border,"" Passel said, it is ""widely accepted as an indicator of the magnitude of the flow.""
   
So what does that data look like? In 2011, according to federal statistics compiled by Massey, the United States apprehended 327,577 individuals, a smaller number than in any year going back to 1970 -- or just outside Obama’s 40-year window. And if you look at apprehensions per agent, it’s the lowest in an even longer period -- since 1943, Massey said.
   
Assigning reasons for the decline
   
Where Obama’s claim runs into problems is when he credits his policies.
   
Passel said Obama has a point that law enforcement -- something the president has influence over -- has a major impact.
   
""We know from various surveys that the cost of hiring a smuggler to get into the U.S. has increased significantly as enforcement has been ramped up,"" he said. ""We also know that Mexicans have been pushed into more remote areas to try to cross where it is physically more difficult and dangerous.""

But Massey considers the economy the primary factor. The recession, he said, had an immense impact in slowing border crossing. In particular, dwindling prospects of finding a job in sectors such as construction, which traditionally attract a disproportionate number of Latinos, dampened the urge for potential Mexican migrants to undertake a difficult journey.
   
Two other significant factors were also out of Obama’s control -- the state of the economy in Mexico (which has been relatively healthy) and the activity of the drug cartels (which has increased violence on the Mexican side of the border).
   
Our ruling
   
Obama said his administration has made ""progress"" on border enforcement by ""putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.""
   
Obama is right about the numbers of Border Patrol agents and on the immigrant flows across the border. However, it’s a stretch for him to suggest that his administration is the primary reason. The growth in agents began under Bush, and while law enforcement matters in curbing flows of illegal immigrants, so do economic conditions in both the United States and Mexico as well as crime on the Mexican side of the border, and these are factors Obama doesn’t directly control. On balance, we rate Obama’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC62F6C0>],/factchecks/2013/feb/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-touts-administrations-border-enforcem/

Marco Rubio says U.S. economy shrank in last quarter of 2012
","
During the televised Republican response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union Address, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio criticized Obama’s handling of the economy.

""Economic growth is the best way to help the middle class,"" Rubio said during the Feb. 12, 2013,response. ""Unfortunately, our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012.""

Is that correct?

We located the announcement from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal agency that calculates gross domestic product, or GDP -- the benchmark statistic for measuring the size of the economy.

On Jan. 30, 2013, the bureau announced that in the final quarter of 2012, GDP shrunk by 0.1 percent -- a small enough decline to prompt the qualifier ""slightly"" in the news release’s headline, yet notable because it represented the first quarterly decline in GDP since the second quarter of 2009, when the economy was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month.

The fourth-quarter decline was striking because the third quarter had seen GDP growth of 3.1 percent, the third-fastest quarterly expansion since the end of the recession.

The bureau cited several reasons for the decline, most notably a fall in defense spending.

Economists said the data was not necessarily a sign that the economy was heading back into recession, and indeed, within a few days, a different federal agency -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- released rosier data on job growth, showing a monthly increase of 157,000 jobs in January, plus upward revisions of two prior months totaling 127,000 jobs.

Our ruling

It’s too early to say whether the fourth-quarter decline in GDP represents a reversal of economic fortune or just a blip, so it’s prudent not to place too much weight on one quarter’s worth of data. But we have no quarrel with the way Rubio phrased it -- that the economy ""actually shrank during the last three months of 2012.""

Barack Obama says U.S. has created half million manufacturing jobs in three years
","
At several points in his State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama noted the importance of manufacturing to the nation’s economy.

""Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing,"" Obama said. ""After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.""

The claim about job numbers is an update of a line Obama included in his acceptance speech at the 2012 Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C. We checked that one and rated it True.

The main difference between Obama’s two versions was that the timeline in the most recent claim has been extended by six months.

Because of the wording of his claim, we are examining whether the numbers are right, not whether Obama's policies were instrumental. To check the numbers, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. We used seasonally adjusted statistics for manufacturing jobs.

Shedding jobs for more than 10 years
   
It’s not news that manufacturing jobs have been in decline in the United States in recent years, though sometimes with ups and downs. Generally, the decline has been due to broad economic shifts both inside and outside the United States, as well as changes in technology. Manufacturing’s share of U.S. employment was 29 percent in 1960, but it fell to just 9 percent by 2011. Even the raw numbers of manufacturing jobs fell over that period -- from 15.7 million to 11.7 million -- despite a large expansion of the overall U.S. workforce.
   
Between March and April 1998 and December 2009 -- the decade-plus that Obama appears to be referring to -- manufacturing employment fell from 17.6 million to 11.5 million, a decline of just over one-third. So Obama’s correct that manufacturing jobs had been ""shedding jobs for more than 10 years"" by the time he took office.

Added about 500,000 jobs over the past three years

During the period Obama chose -- from January 2010 to January 2013 -- manufacturing jobs began to rise again, by 490,000. We think that qualifies as ""about 500,000,"" as Obama put it.

It’s worth noting that while the reversal has been striking, this rise has still replaced only a fraction of the manufacturing jobs lost during the ""decade of decline."" The manufacturing jobs gained during the turnaround replaced less than 10 percent of the jobs lost during the decade of decline.

Our ruling

The rise in manufacturing jobs that Obama is referring to is modest compared to the prior decade’s decline, but he has described the numbers carefully.

The Austin Democrat, speaking at a Jan. 22, 2013, Texas Tribune public interview, also said such closings could drive up abortions.

""Those who are claiming that they want to reduce abortion, which I think is just about everybody, I don’t think anybody wants to see that increase -- and in fact, it has be.en decreasing,"" Howard said.

A reader asked us to check whether abortions are decreasing.

We quickly found state and federal figures indicating a decrease.

Howard’s chief of staff, Scott Daigle, guided us to information kept by the Texas Department of State Health Services, which says that ""induced terminations of pregnancy"" in the state totaled 77,592 in 2010, down from 77,850 the year before and 81,591 in 2008.

Agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams provided a chart confirming those figures and covering additional years. She added, by email, that preliminary data indicate 72,470 abortions occurred in 2011 -- some 5,100 fewer than the year before.

The chart shows that while the number of abortions decreased every year from 2009 through 2011, it went up in five of the eight previous years, topping out at 82,056 in 2006.

Daigle also said that a November 2012 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that abortions nationally decreased from 857,475 in 2000 to 784,507 in 2009. According to information posted online by the centers, those tallies drew from data submitted voluntarily by states and other ""reporting areas,"" which it had been collecting since 1969.

The 2009 abortion rate for 45 ""reporting areas,"" ranging from states to New York City that had continuously provided data since 2000, the centers say, was 15.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years and the abortion ratio was 227 abortions per 1,000 live births. It said the figures were based on data evaluated from the areas that reported data every year during 2000-2009. Compared with 2008, the total number and rate of reported abortions for 2009 decreased 5 percent and the abortion ratio decreased 2 percent, CDC said.

""The change from 2008 to 2009 represented the largest single-year decrease in the total number and rate of reported abortions for the entire period from 2000 to 2009,"" the center says. From 2000 to 2009 the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 6 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, to the lowest levels for the period, the center says.

Historically, abortions surged after a key court ruling, then started decreasing. According to the centers’ Nov. 23, 2012, ""Abortion Surveillance"" report for 2009, abortions ramped up after the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing the procedure in all states.: After the decision, ""the total number, rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years), and ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions increased rapidly, reaching the highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing at a slow yet steady pace,"" the report says. ""However, the incidence of abortion has varied considerably across demographic subpopulations, and recent reports through 2008 have suggested that the sustained pattern of decrease has leveled off. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor long-term changes in the incidence of abortion in the United States.""

Separately, we asked the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, for its analysis. Broadly, spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said by email, the ""national numbers and rates of abortion were declining from the early 1990s to about 2005, but appear to have leveled off in the most recent period studied.""

She pointed us to a January 2011 Guttmacher paper on the incidence of abortion in 2007 and 2008, based on interviews of abortion providers, saying by phone that the next update, drawing on interviews being conducted this year, is to be published in early 2014.

The 2011 paper includes a chart indicating that the number of U.S. abortions peaked at 1.6 million and hovered above 1.2 million from 2004 through 2008, the last year shown. The incidence of abortion changed little between 2005 and 2008, the paper says. The number of abortions increased by 0.5 percent, from 1,206,200 to 1,212,350, the paper says, while the abortion rate increased 1 percent, from 19.4 to 19.6 per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Also, the abortion ratio did not change over this period, remaining at 22 abortions per 100 pregnancies.

Wind told us that while the decline in abortion had leveled off from 2005 through 2008, this followed a long-term decline in abortion rates. 
Our ruling 
Howard said abortions are decreasing.

 The Texas tally has dropped for several consecutive years, while nationally the total hovered around 1.2 million from 2005 through 2008, by one analysis, and the number and rate decreased in 2009, according to information analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'EmpowerED Georgia']","
Georgia lawmakers cutting education funding, group says
","
Are the people who run this state devoting less money to Georgia’s public schools than they did a decade ago?

Yes, says one group.

EmpowerED Georgia, a group of parents and teachers that estimates its membership at 3,500, has a chart on its website claiming the decrease has been at least 25 percent per student since 2002. The group says state lawmakers, through tax credits and other programs, have been overly supportive of private schools in recent years at the expense of public schools.

A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw the claim about the size of the decrease and asked us to investigate.

The EmpowerED Georgia graphic says the decrease is based on information on midterm education spending it found on the Georgia Department of Education’s website.

""The key point I was making is that the state allotments to local school systems over the last decade have decreased by a significant percentage on a per-student, inflation-adjusted basis,"" said EmpowerED Georgia co-founder Matt Jones, a teacher at Toombs County School in Lyons. ""The method of measuring the exact rate of inflation is a technical issue, but the approach used is the most relevant one for state and local governments. We believe that 25 percent is the best estimate possible.""

Here’s what EmpowerED Georgia found:

In fiscal year 2002, which began July 1, 2001, and ended June 30, 2002, the state spent about $5.6 billion on education. In fiscal year 2012, which began July 1, 2011, and ended June 30, 2012, the state spent about $7.04 billion. 

EmpowerED Georgia divided the total spent by the number of public school students in Georgia, which has increased from nearly 1.5 million pupils in 2002 to about 1.65 million in 2012. It calculated the difference of per-pupil spending between those years and adjusted it for inflation. It used a price index that state and local governments use for various costs.

In fiscal year 2002, EmpowerED Georgia found the average spent on each student was $3,873. Ten years later, the organization said the total was $2,910.

The difference, according to these numbers? A 25 percent decrease.

Case closed, right? Not so, say state education officials.

Those officials say some perspective is necessary here. The state budget, for example, is smaller than it was, when adjusted for inflation. State spending decreased significantly after the Great Recession in 2008. The education budget cannot escape all cuts, education officials say. Class sizes are larger than they were. There’s new technology in the classroom. It’s difficult to make such a comparison, they say.

""They are theoretically being more productive with larger classes,"" Lou Byars, the department’s director of financial review, said of Georgia teachers.

Jones wrote an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that rejected the state’s argument about the recession’s impact on education spending. 

""[T]hat does not explain why k-12 programs have been reduced virtually every year since 2002. Nor does it explain how, under these dire budgetary restrictions, the General Assembly has miraculously been able to find funding for a private school tuition program and a new system of state charter schools,"" he wrote.

Education officials also questioned EmpowerED Georgia’s methodology.

""The idea of adjusting it for a (consumer price index) or a (government price index) is not a good way to do it,"" said Scott Austensen, the state Education Department’s chief financial officer.

A government price index uses a combination of elements that state and local governments face when preparing and adjusting a budget, such as construction prices, wages and health care costs. Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a fiscally conservative think tank, questioned the use of such an index. 

""We don't like the government spending index because it has little to do with overall inflation and more to do with comparing your rate of growth with other government out-of-control spending growth and has nothing to do with the ability of taxpayers and their income growth to fund the program,"" McCutchen said.

Georgia State University’s Fiscal Research Center completed a report in November on the recession’s impact on school revenue. Like EmpowerED Georgia, it found state spending on education in Georgia had declined by 25 percent between 2002 and 2011. It, too, used an inflation index of state and local government prices. Overall, education spending has declined by about 12 percent, if you include local and federal spending in the state. Cynthia Searcy, who wrote the GSU report, said EmpowerED’s spreadsheet looked accurate to her, although they used slightly different numbers.

Georgia State University associate professor Carolyn Bourdeaux, who edited the report, believes state and local government price indexes more accurately capture the cost of government to operate. 

To sum up, EmpowerED Georgia claims that education spending is down about 25 percent over the past decade.

The larger point about a decrease in education spending is not disputed by state education officials. But they disagree with the use of state and local government price indexes to conclude there’s been a 25 percent decrease. EmpowerED Georgia’s math is supported by the Georgia State study. Still, there are some factors that deserve consideration when examining this claim, such as the recession’s impact on state spending and larger class sizes.

The group’s statement contains an element of truth but needs a lot of context to be fully understood. 

Under the definitions of our rating scale, this rates as Half True.

Jeff Merkley says domestic abuse against women has fallen 50 percent since federal law went into effect
","
Violence - or the potential for violence -  is everywhere. It’s the reason we have police and laws, jails and federal programs to study the causes and suggest responses.

It’s the reason, too, that Congress passes laws to address crime in all its facets. One of those is the Violence Against Women Act, which is intended to protect women from domestic abuse and violence. It provides federal dollars for an array of programs to achieve that goal. Oregon, for example, collected $9.4 million in 2012 for programs to protect women from violence.

The law was first passed in 1994 and easily renewed in 2000 and 2005 by lopsided majorities. But it was allowed to lapse in 2011 after a partisan Congress couldn’t reach agreement. (Partisanship in Congress? Shocking, we know.)

Now it’s back and in an effort to build momentum and the votes to renew it, supporters like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.,  have been talking about the law’s benefits.

Here’s what Merkley said Feb. 7 during a conference call with reporters: ""Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent.""

That seems to be a pretty strong selling point and as the bill moves toward a final vote in the Senate it’s something that will be repeated and emphasized during debate.

But is it true?

First, we need a quick fly-by of the law and what it provides. The law, known by the shorthand VAWA, first passed in 1994 and was written by then senator and now Vice President Joe Biden.

It acknowledged domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes, and provided federal resources to encourage community-coordinated responses to combating violence.  

When it was re-authorized in 2000 lawmakers expanded the definition of crime to include dating violence and stalking.  Its subsequent reauthorization in 2005 created new programs to meet the emerging needs of communities working to prevent violence.

Until it expired in 2011, the law was expansive and reached into every corner of the country. (Some funding continued into 2012.) Among other things, it provided grants to states and local law enforcement to beef up enforcement as well as money to prosecutors to focus on gender-based crime. Included in the array of programs and assistance, VAWA provided money for direct services for victims of sexual assault and for things like transitional housing and legal assistance.

According to Merkley, all those programs made a difference.

Which brings us back to his claim that since it was first enacted domestic violence has fallen 50 percent.

Another fortunate development when it comes to crime is that governments at all levels but especially the federal government go to great lengths to quantify, parse and sub-total crime. Data abounds.

It’s also unambiguous.

""From 1994 to 2010, the overall rate of intimate partner violence in the United States declined by 64 percent, from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000,"" the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in November 2012.

The report notes that over that same period ""4 in 5 victims of intimate partner violence were female.""

A report by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, an interest group focusing on the issue, comes to a similar conclusion.

""The rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence against women has decreased by 63 percent and the number of women killed by an intimate partner has decreased 24 percent,"" between 1994 and 2010.

The group connects the numbers directly to the VAWA, saying the law ""has changed the way federal, tribal, state and local entities respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking.""

Surveys by the American Bar Association and other independent groups had similar findings.

That’s a lot of scholarship and paper, sponsored, collected and analyzed by federal and independent researchers. And while the results don’t perfectly align, all agree that the incidence of domestic abuse has dropped by more than 50 percent since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994. You can quibble about the minor differences but not the accuracy of Merkley’s statement.

We rate this claim: True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8FDC80>],/factchecks/2013/feb/11/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-says-domestic-abuse-against-women-has/
