Rep. Chet Edwards says he said no to Washington liberals who wanted to take away our guns
","
Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central's faux-news program ""The Daily Show,"" wryly noted on its Sept. 29 episode that the Obama administration's track record is ""why you see so many Democrats running ads proudly touting their party's accomplishments."" 
Then flowed a montage of Democratic campaign ads denouncing President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The last clip? A Sept. 17 ad for Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco: ""And when Washington liberals wanted to take away our guns, Chet said no."" 
""Those are the ads that Democrats are running?"" Stewart marveled. 
On Stewart's cue, we wanted to know more about Edwards' supposed showdown with gun-averse liberals. 
Megan Jacobs, an Edwards' spokeswoman, sent us a statement citing several pieces of legislation to defend his boast. 
Namely, on March 17, 2009, Edwards was one of 65 House Democrats who sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. ""As strong supporters of the Second Amendment, we were very concerned to see your recent remarks suggesting that the administration will push for reinstatement of the 1994 ban on 'assault weapons' and ammunition magazines,"" the letter says. ""Many of our constituents lawfully own and use these firearms and ammunition magazines that would be affected by a new ban."" 
The letter concludes: ""We would actively oppose any effort to reinstate the 1994 ban or to pass any similar law. We urge you to abandon this initiative and to focus instead on effective law enforcement strategies to enforce our community laws against violent criminals and drug traffickers."" 
What prompted the letter? Jacobs pointed us to a February 2009 article on ABC News' website that quotes Holder saying: ""As President Obama indicated during the campaign, there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons."" Obama's campaign website said in 2008 that he supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent ""as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets."" 
Some background: In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed legislation prohibiting the sale of 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons — like AK-47s, Uzis and revolving-cylinder shotguns — and imitation models of those guns. The law didn't apply to more than 650 other types of firearms that were manually operated by a bolt, pump, lever or slide action, were permanently nonfunctional and antique firearms. Also, the ban was set to expire in 2004 unless Congress reauthorized it, which it didn't. 
Edwards told us he voted for the ban in '94 after a 1991 shooting in Killeen left 24 dead. He said he opposed the ban's reauthorization because he didn't think it was effective in significantly reducing gun violence. 
We wondered how many Texans would be affected by bringing back the ban. Tim Carroll, a spokesman with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told us that the agency doesn't track how many people own assault weapons. 
Carroll also told us that when the 1994 ban was implemented, it did not apply to firearms anyone already owned. Meaning: No one would had their guns taken away. 
Speaking to Edwards' pro-gun bonafides, Jacobs noted that the congressman drew an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association, meaning it considers Edwards a ""solidly pro-gun candidate"" who ""has supported NRA positions on key votes in elective office,"" according to an explanation of the ratings on the NRA's website. 
The letter to Holder signed by Edwards is one of 11 reasons the association lists on its website for endorsing the congressman. Other reasons include legislation Edwards cosponsored to repeal a gun ban in the District of Columbia, legislation he cosponsored to extend federal protections to state right-to-carry license and permits nationwide and legislation he cosponsored to prohibit gun confiscation during states of emergency. 
We did not find fresh signs the Obama administration is pushing to return the ban, though there have been reports about assault weapons in the news. In May, Mexico President Felipe Calderon asked a joint session of the U.S. Congress to renew the ban to help Mexico's war with drug cartels. In June, Reuters reported that police in the Texas border city of Laredo seized 147 AK-47 assault rifles bound for Mexico. And on Sept. 28, Colton Tooley, a 19-year-old student at the University of Texas at Austin, sprayed several rounds from an AK-47 on campus before killing himself. 
Of course, Edwards' ad says liberals wanted to take away ""our guns"" — not just assault weapons. 
The statement Jacobs sent us further says that ""since Democrats gained a House majority since 2007, numerous bills have been introduced that require the registration of guns that would limit gun ownership."" Edwards' statement singles out Pelosi and Reps. Henry Waxman, George Miller and Barbara Lee of California and Barney Frank of Massachusetts as liberals ""on the opposite sides of Edwards on many key gun-related votes."" 
The statement cites a host of Edwards votes on gun issues, including: a 2003 vote to protect firearms manufacturers and dealers from being sued for damages resulting from the misuse by others of their firearm or ammunition and a 2004 vote not to extend the assault weapons ban. 
This year, Edwards was one of 159 cosponsors of legislation ""to restore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia."" The bill would prohibit the District from restricting a person's right to carry a firearm at his or her home, personal land or business, repeal D.C's registration requirement to possess firearms and repeal a ban on semiautomatic weapons. In 2005, Edwards voted to prohibit the use of federal funds to enforce a D.C. law requiring certain firearms to be unloaded and disassembled. In 2008, he voted to overturn the D.C. ban. 
Still, we did not track with Edwards' logic. While it's evident he's supported legislation that is considered pro-gun and said ""no"" to legislation that isn't, we didn't see anything showing that Washington liberals were coming to take our guns away. 
As we neared completion of our review, Edwards told us that ""the reason a lot of gun-control legislation has not come up, been introduced, but it's been killed,"" is thanks to ""Democrats like me and those who have opposed it."" 
Edwards cited 2009 legislation by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, which sought to create a licensing system for certain firearms and a record system tracking the sale of those firearms. Specifically, Edwards said he objected to a provision requiring applicants seeking a firearm license to submit ""a clear thumbprint"" and ""a current, passport-sized photograph of the applicant,"" according to the bill. 
""If I'm a citizen in Texas and I say I'm not about to be fingerprinted or photographed to keep a handgun, then I am in violation of the law"" he said. ""The federal government would have the right to take that gun away."" Those who failed to comply with Rush's proposal, which never came to a vote, would have been subject to a fine or imprisonment or both, but we saw no language stating that guns would be taken away. 
In a letter Edwards sent a constituent in January, he said, ""I oppose this bill and do not believe there should be a national gun licensing system."" 
Edwards told us that he has gone to Democratic leaders in the House and said, ""Don't allow these gun control bills to come to the floor. Not many have. That's my point."" 
Edwards also pointed to legislation he supported to expand gun rights in the District of Columbia, which prohibited gun owners from keeping handguns in their homes. In June 2008, the Supreme Court overturned D.C.'s ban.""They wanted to be able to take guns away, I wanted to stop them from legally being able to take those guns away,"" he said. 
Where does that leave us? 
Edwards makes a case that he’s steadfastly opposed efforts to impose gun controls. However, none of his cited measures would ""take away"" anyone’s weapons. It’s overblown claims like this that keep the Truth-O-Meter in business. 
His statement is False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1BEF00>],/factchecks/2010/oct/12/chet-edwards/rep-chet-edwards-says-he-said-no-washington-libera/

Candidate for insurance commissioner says rival fought against mammogram coverage
","
If you believe Democrats, state Sen. Ralph Hudgens, the Republican candidate for insurance commissioner, is trying to get between women and their mammograms. 
Hudgens' opposition, former state Sen. Mary Squires, lobbed this attack in news releases and statements to the media commemorating the beginning of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which is October. 
""Why would we vote for an insurance commissioner who fights -- and fights hard -- to strip women of life-saving coverages like mammograms?"" Squires asked Morris News Service. 
Taking coverage of mammograms from women? Really? We took a closer look. 
Squires is one in a chorus of Hudgens critics on the subject. At about the same time she launched her attack, an anonymous video appeared on YouTube that pilloried him on mammogram coverage. A spokesman for the Squires campaign said it is not behind the video and does not know who is. 
The video juxtaposes an interview with a woman who says she owes her life to a mammogram with grainy clips of Hudgens saying he doesn't want to have to pay for the tests. 
""Why would I need to pay for maternity coverage?"" Hudgens says. ""Or why would I need to pay for coverage of breast reconstruction or Pap smears or mammograms?"" 
""He wouldn’t even cover mammograms,"" a female announcer says. ""And now he wants to be your insurance commissioner."" 
This skirmish is part of an ongoing battle over whether Georgia law should require certain health insurance policies to cover mammograms, Pap smears, colorectal cancer screening and other services. These requirements are called ""mandates."" 
In the past, health insurance policies in Georgia failed to include coverage for women's health and other services. State legislators, especially the Georgia Legislative Women’s Caucus, rallied to institute mandates to fix this problem starting in the early 1990s. 
Hudgens ran afoul of the Women's Caucus because he co-sponsored SB 407 during the past session. The bill would have let Georgians buy health insurance policies across state lines. 
The idea of allowing out-of-state policies is popular among certain conservatives and insurance companies, but not with the bipartisan Women's Caucus. Its members battled successfully to kill the bill because they believed it would have undermined mandates by freeing insurance companies to sell policies governed by other states, some of which have fewer requirements. 
But state Sen. Judson Hill, a Republican from Marietta and the sponsor of SB 407, said his bill did not threaten coverage protected by mandates. No one would be forced to buy insurance across state lines, and some of the policies might be governed by states that have more mandates. 
But insurance industry advocates were concerned that SB 407 didn't do enough to curb mandates. They wanted state law to allow ""mandate-light"" policies, or policies that don't have to follow all the mandates. Georgia has one of the country's highest number of the requirements, which means that this state's policies would be too expensive to compete with cheaper ones from states with fewer mandates, an official with the Georgia Association of Health Underwriters said. 
Still, when Hudgens made the statements featured in the attack video in July, he was using fightin' words. They came during a primary campaign candidates forum hosted by the Northwest Georgia Association of Insurance and Financial Advisers and the Georgia Association of Health Underwriters. 
A longer video of his statement shows Hudgens said this: 
""Why would I, if I were buying an individual policy for myself, why would I need to pay for maternity coverage. And this costs you, in every policy. Or why would I need to pay for coverage of breast reconstruction or Pap smears or mammograms?"" 
A few seconds later, Hudgens added ""every time we have attempted to create a mandate-light policy, you got two groups of people that fight us and defeat us. One of them are the Democrats ... and the other one is the Women’s Caucus. Whether it be Republicans or Democrats, they fight against this, saying we’re trying to discriminate against women."" 
When reached by AJC PolitiFact Georgia for this item, Hudgens told us he dislikes mandates in general because they drive up health care costs. He wants Georgia to let consumers buy plans where they can pick and choose the services they need without paying for ones they don't.

""There is no way I'm against women,"" Hudgens said. ""What I'm looking for is to change the way we buy insurance to tailor it to the individual."" 
So it's not only true that Hudgens as a co-sponsor of SB 407 joined efforts to weaken mandates. He's a vocal opponent of mandates, and as chairman of the state Senate's Insurance and Labor Committee, he has a great deal of influence. 
And it's true that if SB 407 passed as originally conceived, the policies available to Georgians might not all have mammogram coverage. 
But would Hudgens' opposition to mandates have effectively stripped woman of mammogram coverage? 
As SB 407 sponsor Hill said, no one would have to buy out-of-state coverage. 
Mammogram coverage is so well-established it is possible but ""unlikely"" that plans would drop the coverage if it was no longer mandated, said Christopher Carpenter, an expert on economics and public policy at the University of California-Irvine who has studied state insurance mandates and mammography. 
Before state mandates, many women who did not have mammogram coverage got them anyway, Carpenter said. Still, the mandates appear to have an important impact since they began in the mid-1980s through 2000. Carpenter's yet-unpublished research appears to show that they increased mammography rates by about 8 percent. 
So it appears that more women do get mammograms if they have coverage. And it's reasonable to be concerned that the end of mandated coverage for mammograms could mean that it would be harder to get. Women could have to pay a premium to buy it. 
But saying Hudgens fought to ""strip women of life-saving coverages like mammograms"" is an overstatement. He fought to take away mandatory coverage. 
Squires' statement is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That means it meets PolitiFact's definition for Half True.

"['Oregon', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Taxes', 'Doug Ainge']","
Doug Ainge once argued forcefully for a sales tax; now he says ‘No Sales Tax. No Way.’
","
Back in the day (read: June 9, 2003), Doug Ainge, a current Democratic candidate for Oregon’s House District 30, argued forcefully for a sales tax in an opinion piece he wrote for The Oregonian.

Here’s a bit of what he handed in for publication: ""Almost every state has a sales tax and it does not hurt tourism or business development in any of them, just look around us. Are you not taking your children to Disneyland because California has a sales tax? Are you going to pass up a Mariners game because of Washington's sales tax? The trip to the Grand Canyon is canceled because of Arizona's sales tax? We must all wake up to the reality that it's short sighted and unjust to allow tens of thousands of people to gain from our great state and pay no tax. It is clearly past time to tax tourists, drug dealers, prostitutes and all other sectors of the underground economy.

""We must lower the state's marginal income tax rate from 9 percent down to 5-6 percent. We must cap property taxes once again. Then we must institute a 5-6 percent sales tax, with all consumables exempted (i.e. food and medicine). The entire sales tax must be specifically dedicated to K-12 education.""

The article identified Ainge as a history, government and economics teacher at Banks High School.

Seven years later, Ainge, the Oregon House candidate, is saying something a little -- OK, a lot -- different. Here’s the transcript of Ainge’s first television ad:

""Right now, folks from Washington come down to Oregon to buy stuff. Why? No sales tax. In a tough economy, it makes things a little easier. But some politicians want to change that. Doug Ainge knows a sales tax is a bad idea at the worst time. Doug Ainge will fight tax breaks for out-of-state corporations and he’ll vote against a sales tax for Oregon. We voted nine times to stop a sales tax. Let’s vote one more time to keep it that way. Doug Ainge for state representative. No sales tax. No way.""

Well, the message couldn’t be clearer: Sales taxes are evil. Or something along those lines.

We checked in with the campaign to make sure we weren’t missing anything. In an e-mail response, Eric Hagarty, Ainge’s campaign manager wrote, ""Working families are already paying more than their fair share, and in an economy like this a sales tax would only make things worse. Republicans have chosen to cherry-pick statements that are nearly a decade old in an attempt to distract voters from the fact that Doug has the right answers for our economy, schools and government.""

We’re not so sure that an entire opinion piece in the state’s largest newspaper on the merits of a sales tax is cherry-picking, but that’s really neither here nor there. Ainge has gone from arguing for a sales tax (Disneyland doesn’t suffer) to saying he’d vote against one (""No sales tax. No way."").

At PolitiFact Oregon, we call that a Full Flop.

President Barack Obama says foreign money coming in to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce may be helping to fund attack ads
","
Stumping for Democratic candidates in the past few weeks, President Barack Obama has repeatedly warned that foreign money may be bankrolling many of the attack ads being run against Democrats. And now he says he has found an Exhibit A: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Here's what the president said at a rally on Oct. 7, 2010, on behalf of Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley:

""Just this week, we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections. And they won't tell you where the money (for) their ads comes from.""

On ABC's This Week on Oct. 10, 2010, George Will connected the dots: ""Well, he won't tell us who he's talking about. He's talking about the Chamber of Commerce, which does indeed receive dues from foreign entities that are associated with American business, just as the AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it. And -- and the shock and awe that we're supposed to feel from this is somewhat selective.""

We have looked previously at more general Obama administration claims about foreign money financing attack ads against Democrats. We will take a look at Will's retort about the AFL-CIO in a separate fact-check. But here, we will examine Obama's claim about the Chamber, that, ""Groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections."" 
For example, the chamber has run ads against Democratic U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson in Florida, calling him a ""lap dog"" who supports ""job-skilling energy taxes."" The Chamber has also run ads against Senate candidates Charlie Crist in Florida and Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut,  attacking them for supporting the health care law.

Current federal law prohibits ""a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country"" from making ""directly or indirectly"" a donation or expenditure ""in connection with a Federal, State, or local election,"" to a political party committee or ""for an electioneering communication."" But Obama has repeatedly warned that a Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission case opened the floodgates for special interests -– including foreign corporations (a claim many Republicans dispute).

With independent groups outspending the actual campaigns in some midterm elections -- the Chamber has vowed to spend more than $50 million nationwide -- it's a theme that has been oft-repeated by Democratic party leaders lately. A video released by the Democratic National Committee states that ""it appears they are even taking secret foreign money to influence our elections.""

First off, White House officials confirmed Obama's comment was, in fact, aimed at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And when Obama said ""just this week, we learned...,"" he's referring to a posting on ThinkProgress, a blog affiliated with the liberal Center for American Progress, which ran under the headline ""Exclusive: Foreign-Funded 'U.S.' Chamber Of Commerce Running Partisan Attack Ads.""  The article details the Chamber of Commerce's many overseas affiliates, and claims the Chamber has ""spearheaded an effort to raise money from foreign corporations, including ones controlled by foreign governments."" The article claims foreign members of the Chamber send money either directly to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, or the foreign members fund their local Chamber, which in turn, transfers dues payments back to the Chamber, and that the funds are commingled with an account used to pay for the attack ads.

Chamber officials readily acknowledged their group has 115 foreign member affiliates in 108 countries, and that it received foreign money. But Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for the chamber, told the New York Times that overseas American Chambers of Commerce pay a total of less than $100,000 in membership dues that go into its general fund. In addition, the Chamber gets membership dues from foreign corporations. While the total was not quantified, Josten said it amounts to a small fraction of the group's total budget of more than $200 million.

More importantly, the Chamber maintains that none of that foreign money is used to finance the Chamber's political agenda in the United States. The Chamber put out a statement saying all foreign money received by the organization is properly segregated from money used to fund political activity.

""We're careful to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws,"" Chamber spokeswoman Tita Freeman said in a statement. ""No foreign money is used to fund political activities. All allegations to the contrary are totally and completely false.""

According to ThinkProgress, however, ""while the Chamber will likely assert it has internal controls, foreign money is fungible, permitting the Chamber to run its unprecedented attack campaign.""

But here's the thing: Neither Obama nor the DNC offer any evidence that foreign money is actually being used to fund the attack ads. Rather, the argument is that it could be a problem.

""We simply don't know,"" said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

As a 501 (c)6 non-profit trade association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is not required to disclose its donors. And it doesn't.

Foreign companies with American divisions can form PACs and collect contributions from their American employees, or those with green cards. The Center for Responsive Politics lists more than 140 foreign-connected PACs, from pharmaceuticals like GlaxoSmithKline to BP. These PACS have raised more than $12 million this election cycle.

""The law of the land right now is that if an organization like the Chamber of Commerce is using generally accepted accounting principles to show that you are not using foreign money to finance regulated activities, then you're in the clear,"" said Paul Ryan, an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center.

""It is hard with no disclosure to pin it down,"" David G. Vance, a spokesman for the Campaign Legal Center. ""That's the big problem. There's no way to check any of it. As it is, they just have one big pie, and no one knows where it all goes.""

So far, though, no one has offered any evidence that the Chamber of Commerce is not complying with that law.

""It's unverifiable,"" Levinthal said. ""You've got to take their word for it. There is no way to tell, unless the group wants to put up identifiable evidence on its own...The Chamber of Commerce is not volunteering that information. Nor do they have to by law.""

Levinthal cautioned that it's not just a problem with right-leaning groups. The same rules apply whether you are a left group or a right one, Levinthal noted.

A New York Times story by Eric Lichtblau sums it up this way: ""A closer examination shows that there is little evidence that what the chamber does in collecting overseas dues is improper or even unusual, according to both liberal and conservative election-law lawyers and campaign finance documents.

""In fact, the controversy over the Chamber of Commerce financing may say more about the Washington spin cycle — where an Internet blog posting can be quickly picked up by like-minded groups and become political fodder for the president himself — than it does about the vagaries of campaign finance.""

Some Republicans say the Democrats' stance amounts to ""guilty until proven innocent."" David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, was asked by Bob Schieffer on CBS' Face the Nation on Oct. 10, 2010, if he had any evidence that the chamber was using secret foreign funds to influence the election.

''Well, do you have any evidence that it's not, Bob?'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''The fact is that the chamber has asserted that, but they won't release any information about where their campaign money is coming from. And that's at the core of the problem here.''

President Obama and other Democrats may have a legitimate concern about disclosure. The campaign finance experts we spoke with said there's no way to know for sure if the Chamber of Commerce is keeping foreign money it receives separate from the pot of money used to fund attack ads -- other than the Chamber's assurances that it does. And the president is technically correct when he says the Chamber of Commerce ""takes in money from foreign corporations ... So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections."" But we think that statement suggests foreign money is, for sure, being used to directly fund the attack ads. The Chamber said it isn't. And Obama and other Democrats have offered no evidence so far that it has. And so we rule his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A0EB00>],/factchecks/2010/oct/11/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-foreign-money-coming-u/

Portman uses new and improved job-loss number to criticize stimulus
","
PolitiFact has rapped Rob Portman for certain claims made during his U.S. Senate campaign. We’ve credited Portman, too, for truthful statements. That’s the nature of the Truth-O-Meter: We play it as it lays.

Which brings us to Portman’s latest television ad. In the 30-second spot, Portman points to ""out-of-control"" federal spending, ""dangerous"" deficits and an economic stimulus plan that he says isn’t working. ""Since the $800 billion stimulus passed, Ohio’s lost over 100,000 more jobs,"" Portman says in the commercial.

The claim about the stimulus program not working has been batted about repeatedly. The White House said when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in February 2009, that unemployment would peak at 8 percent. Yet it is now 9.6 percent nationally, and 10.7 percent in Ohio.

A number of economists say that even more jobs would have been lost were it not for the government spending to stimulate the economy. The Congressional Budget Office’s last quarterly evaluation said the stimulus increased national employment by 1.4 million to 3.3 million jobs. There have been mistakes, missteps and gaffes documented in the spending programs, however, and Portman and other Republicans say the spending was poorly focused. This central question will be for historians and economists in the future to settle.

We’re merely taking note of Portman’s claim because of this: He uses a lower number -- 100,000 jobs lost in Ohio since the stimulus passed -- than he used previously. When he put the figure at 150,000 in June, the Truth-O-Meter ruled it Half True -- because only 127,900 jobs had actually been lost, judging by the most widely accepted measure.

That was based on Bureau of Labor Statistics figures through May, the most current at the time.  The numbers come from surveys of employers and are adjusted as the data becomes more complete. Using updated data, BLS now shows the post-stimulus job losses in Ohio came to 130,000 for the period Portman claimed in his earlier statement..

But now it’s October and Portman is using a lower figure when he speaks. As he said in his newest ad, and repeated during an Oct. 8 debate at the City Club of Cleveland, since the stimulus bill passed, ""Ohio’s lost over 100,000 more jobs.""

Yet here’s the thing: Portman’s rhetoric might actually be too cautious now. As measured by the latest BLS figures, which go through August and are preliminary, Ohio has 149,200 fewer jobs now than when the stimulus passed. That’s exquisitely close to 150,000.

What happened?

The state steadily lost jobs through 2009 but the numbers started improving early in the year, continuing through May. The summer saw a retraction, however, reducing Ohio’s employment count by a total of 19,200 jobs during June, July and August.

So Portman was accurate and then some with his recent, more cautious statement. The Half True ruling nevertheless stands for his June claim, because PolitiFact doesn’t believe in fortune-telling and Portman’s numbers were in fact off when he made that statement.

But we give credit where credit is due. So the Truth-O-Meter takes a turn to the right and rules on Portman’s newest claim: True.

Allen Boyd campaign ad claims Steve Southerland didn't pay taxes for five years
","
In a tight race for a North Florida congressional seat, Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd has put out a TV ad accusing his opponent, Republican Steve Southerland, of being a tax scofflaw.

The ad begins with a video clip from a Southerland campaign event in Marianna, Fla., on Jan. 18, 2010.

Someone in the audience yells out, ""Do you pay your taxes?""

""That's a great question,"" Southerland responds. ""I do pay my taxes.""

Then a voice-over states: ""Steve Southerland did not pay his taxes in '05, '06, '07, '08 or '09. In fact, Southerland didn't pay his taxes until he ran for Congress. Now he wants to raise sales taxes by 23 percent. You just can't trust Steve Southerland.""

On the screen, viewers see ""Delinquent on his property taxes."" And the small print cites the source as the Bay County, Fla., tax collector.

We were curious if Southerland is the scofflaw that Boyd suggests.

First of all, county tax records indicate Southerland has paid the property taxes for his Panama City home on time and in full for all of the years cited in the ad; and public records show no liens for unpaid federal income taxes.

The Boyd campaign explains that the ad is referring to business taxes that Southerland's companies failed to pay ... on time.

That's right. It's not that Southerland didn't pay his businesses' property taxes. It's that he didn't pay them on time. In all of the years cited, Southerland did, eventually, pay all of the taxes due, with a penalty and interest.

Southerland has an interest in several companies, including the family Southerland Funeral Homes and Machriste Inc.

Online records for the Bay County tax collector show that the property taxes for some of these companies were often paid late, and with a penalty. But all of them are currently stamped in red: Paid.

Southerland acknowledged they were paid late but said that he always paid the late fees and the account was settled.

So why were they paid late?

Southerland said it came down to a business choice: whether to pay the tax bill on time or meet obligations to pay salary and benefits to employees.

""You have the option, according to the law, of paying them a month or two late"" with a penalty and interest, Southerland said.  ""I paid for my ability to pay it late. I made the same decision small businesses have had to make all around the country.""

J.R. Starrett, a spokesman with the Boyd campaign, said, ""This shows a continued behavior. He doesn't feel like he needs to pay his taxes on time.""

We spoke to Peggy Brannon, the tax collector for Bay County, who explained that if an owner is more than two months delinquent in paying property taxes, the county sells a tax certificate. The purchaser of the certificate pays the taxes due on the property -- so the county gets its money -- and then gets a share of the interest penalty charged to the owner when they square up on their taxes. That happened a couple times with Southerland's properties, she said. Paying late ""is not uncommon"" for business owners, said Brannon. And in every case, she said, Southerland has eventually paid his taxes with penalties and interest. ""He's all paid up,"" Brannon said.

As for the ad's claim that Southerland ""now wants to raise sales taxes by 23 percent,"" that relates to Southerland's kind words for a plan to replace federal income taxes with a sales tax on retail sales. Supporters of the idea call it ""the Fair Tax.""

At a May 8, 2010, campaign event, Southerland said, ""I like the Fair Tax very much,"" and later added that he thinks the 23 percent sales tax figure often cited in Fair Tax research sounds about right. But he also added that there were some things about the Fair Tax he wasn't sold on. And at a campaign event on July 8, 2010, in Destin, Southerland said pursuing a Fair Tax would not be a ""centerpiece of my positions in Congress,"" (though he repeated that there are ""some things about the Fair Tax that I like""). That's a little squishy to be claiming in an ad that Southerland wants to raise the sales tax by 23 percent. Especially without noting the context that if he did, it would be as a replacement to the federal income tax.

But our fact-check here is whether Southerland didn't pay his taxes for five years. We think the claim is awfully deceptive. In fact, Southerland always paid his federal income taxes as well as his personal property taxes -- on time and in full. As for the property taxes on some of the companies Southerland owns, he did often pay late. As a result, he paid a fine and interest in each case, and usually squared up in the same year the tax was due.

In every case, Southerland eventually fully satisfied his tax obligation. The ad makes it seem like Southerland thumbed his nose at the tax collector and then squared up on five years' worth of taxes only after he'd decided to run for Congress, and that simply is not the case. Make what you will of Southerland paying late on some business property taxes. But paying late is not the same as not paying at all. We rate the ad's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972CD3C0>],/factchecks/2010/oct/11/allen-boyd/allen-boyd-campaign-ad-claims-steve-southerland-di/

GOP state Senate candidate Leah Vukmir says the Legislature passed more than $5 billion in tax increases in 2009
","
With Democrats hoping to retain control of the state Senate, one of the most hotly-contested races features two lawmakers from Wauwatosa -- Republican state Rep. Leah Vukmir vs. Democratic incumbent Jim Sullivan.

Going door to door, Vukmir distributes a flier that says she will work to improve the economy, attract more jobs and cut taxes. In it, she also laments the current tax burden in the state, saying that in 2009, the Legislature ""passed more than $5 billion in tax increases.""

We’ve been here before.

And though the Legislature did raise taxes -- and fees -- quite a bit in 2009, the total wasn’t anywhere near $5 billion.

Our research was done after Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, made almost the identical claim. We found that taxes and fees were upped by $3.14 billion in 2009. Consequently, we gave Kleefisch’s statement a False rating.

To try to get closer to $5 billion, Vukmir’s campaign includes -- as Kleefisch did -- a$1.5 billion boost in net property taxes. But we’ll repeat what we said in the Kleefisch claim: Property tax levies are set by local taxing bodies, such as the city and the county, not by the Legislature.

GOP state Senate candidate Leah Vukmir says Wisconsin now has more government jobs than manufacturing jobs
","
Ever since achieving statehood in 1848, Wisconsin has stood proudly as a Goliath of manufacturing: Milwaukee became ""the machine shop of the world,"" Green Bay was home to the world’s largest cheese maker, an internationally known steam valve manufacturer emerged in La Crosse.

The Badger State remains a national leader in making things, with manufacturing providing jobs to 15 percent of the workforce. But recent decades have been marked by factory shutdowns, including the loss of one of every four manufacturing jobs since 2000.

In several 2010 races for the state Senate, the decline in manufacturing has been highlighted by Republicans, including state Rep. Leah Vukmir of Wauwatosa. Her challenge to Democratic Sen. Jim Sullivan, also of Wauwatosa, is one of several races that could determine whether Democrats keep control of the Senate.

""For the first time in history,"" Vukmir declares in a flier that she distributes door to door in the district, ""Wisconsin has more government jobs than manufacturing jobs.""

Such a statistic, if true, would indicate a profound change in the very complexion of the state.

Vukmir, according to her campaign staff, based her statement on a December 2009 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The article was about a state Department of Workforce Development report on unemployment in the previous month.

The report said the state had 438,200 government jobs (federal, state and local, including schools) in November 2009. That was 2,400 more than the 435,800 jobs in manufacturing.

The article went on to say government employment had exceeded manufacturing employment in April and May of 2009, as well.

Those developments were notable because, on an annual basis, manufacturing jobs exceeded government jobs in every year since 1966, which is as far back as the state statistics go.

In her flier, Vukmir presented the change as a done deal.

But the reality is much fuzzier. Picture it as a race, with two runners taking turns as the leader.

Our review of more recent monthly data showed that November 2009 was the first of seven consecutive months in which government jobs outpaced manufacturing jobs. That ended in May 2010. But manufacturing regained the lead in June through August 2010. September numbers have not yet been released.

As for annual figures, which are more telling and the common measuring stick, in 2009 manufacturing employment outpaced government employment by 10,800 jobs.

It remains to be seen where 2010 winds up.

There are many factors at work when it comes to what is happening in the Wisconsin labor market.

Beyond the long-term trends, the recession hit manufacturing jobs hard, while government employment has been supported by federal stimulus money aimed at preventing layoffs.  

Additionally, the count of manufacturing jobs has been artificially low in recent years, according to state labor economist Dennis Winters, because factories are hiring more temporary workers. The state classifies temporary workers as service employees, even if they work in manufacturing.

So, where does that leave us?

To press her case that more needs to be done to help create private-sector jobs, state Senate candidate Leah Vukmir said that for the first time in history, government jobs outnumber manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin. At various points in 2009, that was indeed the case -- though for the year as a whole, manufacturing jobs narrowly led. The jury is still out for 2010, though manufacturing jobs lead in five of the first eight months of the year.

Hank Gilbert says Texas Department of Agriculture could be buying up to 300,000 stress balls
","
Bounciest Democrat on November's statewide ballot? It might be Hank Gilbert, making his second hard charge for state agriculture commissioner versus Todd Staples, the Republican who topped him four years ago.

Gilbert, ever prowling for issues, recently trumpeted that the Texas Department of Agriculture is looking at buying thousands of stress balls -- squeezable toys. He said in a Sept. 24 press release: ""Make no mistake, Texans love their balls: footballs, baseballs, basketballs, and soccer balls. But 300,000 stress balls? It seems a little extreme, but that's the quantity of grape, barbell, and book-shaped polyurethane stress balls the Texas Department of Agriculture could be spending taxpayer dollars on...""

Really?

To our inquiry, Gilbert's campaign provided Web links to the agriculture agency's June request for bids as well as a September post on a state website indicating that a $99,000 contract to provide promotional materials was awarded to a Massachusetts company, Oceans Promotions.

We downloaded the June 29 bid-request package from a site for state requisitions overseen by the state comptroller's office.

The package shows the department was seeking bids to provide up to 300,000 stress ""relievers,"" which we're guessing are not balls because they're not round.

Precisely, the package says, the agency sought bids to make ""promotional items with logo imprints to follow through on (the) TDA Food and Nutrition Texans Bring It Campaign,"" with the items to include grape-shaped stress relievers with ""Texans Bring It"" written on them or ""Eating Right,"" which would be made of polyurethane and be two inches high by three inches wide.

The package says a second set of stress relievers, each one called ""Dumbbell,"" would be imprinted ""Texans Bring It"" and ""Exercise"" and be five inches high by 1.8 inches in diameter. A third stress reliever would be imprinted ""Book"" and ""Texans Bring It,"" according to the bid package, while other promotional items would include pencils, buttons and bumperstickers.

The package says the bids were sought for various quantities, starting from 2,500 and topping out at 100,000 each. It electronically links to a Branders.com site showing what the agency wanted the stress relievers to look like (our interpretation: bunches of purple grapes).

Is all this a real deal?

To our inquiry, Bryan Black, Staples' spokesman, replied via e-mail: ""An invitation for bid was issued for these federally funded educational items to reduce the $5.8 billion avoidable health care expenditures, paid by taxpayers, associated with overweight and obesity health problems.""

We followed up with Black, asking if it's accurate to conclude that up to 300,000 of the stress relievers are being purchased. We also wondered why the purchase was being made. Black said he'd limit his comment to his e-mailed statement.

Surely the agency would pipe up if Gilbert got its purchase plans wrong. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809697EC40>],/factchecks/2010/oct/11/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-says-texas-department-agriculture-cou/

House Democrats say Matt Wand cut police, voted for slush fund
","
At PolitiFact Oregon, nothing gets our pulse racing quite like the words ""slush fund."" We know that few things make voters angrier than personal expense accounts on the taxpayer dime.

So we had to check it out when we spotted a recent campaign mailer that said this: ""Matt Wand cut the police force while creating a slush fund for his own expenses.""

The line runs with a photo of Wand, a Republican House candidate for District 49, on the side of a police vehicle with the phrase ""to protect and serve ... himself.""

Funny, cutting ... but is it true?

According to Future PAC, the House Democrats' campaign committee, while on the Troutdale City Council, Wand voted to ""cut the police force as part of the 2010-2011 budget."" Separately, he ""worked hard to protect his own pocketbook -- by supporting an expense slush fund for himself.""  

Michele Rossolo, executive director of Future PAC, said the mailer was based on a reduction in the number of FTE, or full-time equivalent staff, in the Police Department from 2009-10 to 2010-11. Also, she sent minutes from an April 6, 2010, Troutdale City Council work session as evidence that Wand approved a ""slush fund.""

Erich Mueller, finance director for Troutdale, was calmly apoplectic when reached by phone to explain the city’s budget.

First, it's true that the number of budgeted police officers decreased, from 29.5 FTE positions to 28.5. But that's because one position had been double-filled to account for an employee on long-term deployment with the Oregon National Guard. And when that person returned from overseas, he retired.

""The money was the same,"" said Troutdale Police Sgt. Marc Shrake. ""There were two bodies on payroll for visual purposes.""

Second, the police budget was not cut in terms of money. In fact, the total amount of money budgeted for police operations and management went up -- from $3,710,552 in 2009-10 to $3,826,510 in 2010-11. That's about a $116,000 increase.

""Since the police budget was increased,"" Mueller said, ""I don't know how he could have cut it.""

And third, City Council members, as part of the 15-member city budget committee, did approve a new $50 monthly stipend for each of the six city councilors. The stipend, which replaced a reimbursement system for council members, would be used to pay for meals with other elected officials or individuals, to attend retirement events, or to pay for fax lines, cell phone bills and office supplies. None of those items would be reimbursed by the city.

Wand was a member of the budget subcommittee that suggested the stipend. But the idea was proposed by Tanney Staffenson, chairman of the Troutdale budget committee, according to the minutes provided by Future PAC (Page 10).

And get this: Wand signed a form declining the stipend on June 8, 2010. That’s right. He didn't even take the opportunity to ""protect his own pocketbook.""  

So, it’s inaccurate to say that Wand cut the police force when he didn’t. It’s inaccurate to say that he selfishly created a ""slush fund"" for his own expenses, when he didn’t. This attack on Wand’s character -- remember, he is pictured next to a slogan that reads ""to protect and serve ... himself"" -- shows a reckless disregard for the truth. Even in political advertising.

This mailer is not only false, it’s ridiculous. We rate this Pants on Fire.

Marshall voted against ""budget resolutions"" but not necessarily federal spending bills
","
Democrat Jim Marshall is in the fight of his political life this year in his Middle Georgia congressional district. 
Republicans have tried to unseat Marshall in the past. And they have always failed. But the GOP hopes a fired-up base this year coupled with GOP state lawmaker Austin Scott of Tifton, the Republican nominee for the 8th District, can finally topple the seemingly indestructible Marshall. 
A former Army Ranger and winner of two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart, the 62-year-old Marshall is firing back with a campaign video in which he attempts to distance himself from national Democrats and run-amok federal spending. 
""In Congress, both sides are addicted to deficits, so I’ve opposed every budget Republican and Democrat,"" Marshall says in the ad. 
That’s a bold claim. And it should be simple enough to check out, we at PolitiFact Georgia innocently reckoned. Then we waded into the morass of the federal budget process with all its nuance, double talk, triple talk and outright mendacity. 
Here’s how a couple of experts describe Uncle Sam’s budget: 
""The term ‘budget process,’ when applied to the federal government, actually refers to a number of processes that have evolved separately and that occur with varying degrees of coordination,"" said James V. Saturno of the Congressional Research Service. 
Said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: ""There is no ‘The Budget’ when you talk about federal spending."" 
Marshall spokesman Doug Moore said Marshall was talking about the annual ""budget resolution,"" which outlines federal spending for five or more years. It is the blueprint for most federal spending. And Marshall has indeed voted against the budget resolution every year. 
""This [the budget resolution] is your only opportunity to weigh in on mandatory spending,"" Moore said. ""If you don’t like the debt the country will take on, you vote against the budget. If you think that the priorities are out of alignment, you do it here."" 
Moore points out that the budget resolution covers mandatory federal spending, or about two-thirds of the total budget -- everything from Social Security to Medicaid. 
Congress also votes on about a dozen separate appropriations bill every year. Those bills fund discretionary federal spending. They account for about one-third of the budget and fund everything from military operations to road building.   
Scott’s campaign manager, Joby Young, agreed Marshall has voted against budget resolutions. But Marshall has voted in favor of all but five federal spending bills during his eight years in Congress, Young said. 
Moore said Scott’s campaign is cherry-picking votes in an attempt to discredit Marshall, a co-founder of the Balanced Budget Caucus and a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of conservative Democrats. 
The yearly spending bill is where the budget rubber meets the road, Scott’s campaign argues, and it is where Marshall should be held accountable. 
""The budget resolution is nonbinding and does not become law,"" Scott campaign spokesman Sam Ray said. ""Jim Marshall has voted for 87 percent of the appropriations measures which did become law and spent trillions.""  
Ray added, ""He is voting against the playbook but running all of the plays."" 
Congressional voting records show that Marshall voted for the $787 billion stimulus and the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. But he voted against President Barack Obama’s health care proposal and Obama’s proposed budget.  
So where does this leave us on Marshall’s claim that he has opposed all budgets -- regardless of the party proposing them?   
We talked to budget experts from think tanks of various stripes, from left-leaning to Libertarian to conservative -- the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the New America Foundation. 
The experts concurred that the budget resolution is an important part of the budget process. But they also concluded that strictly talking about the budget resolution without discussing the underlying spending bills omits critical context. 
  
Marshall’s statement is accurate, but it leaves out important details that could lead viewers of his campaign video to a different conclusion. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BCD140>],/factchecks/2010/oct/11/jim-marshall/marshall-voted-against-budget-resolutions-not-nece/

Democratic governor candidate Tom Barrett says Scott Walker would ban stem cell research
","Stem cells hold the potential to treat, and even cure, some of our most deadly and debilitating illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s and diabetes. To make the cells do their magic, research is needed — and the University of Wisconsin has been at the forefront of that work.

But for many people, there is a tension between conducting such research and protecting the sanctity of human life. The dilemma confronts not only scientists, but politicians, who are able to set government funding priorities and even place limits on the work scientists do.

As in 2006, stem cell research has become an issue in the race for governor.
Just as outgoing Gov, Jim Doyle did four years ago, Democratic nominee Tom Barrett is running a TV ad that paints his Republican opponent — Scott Walker — as extreme on the issue.

The ad features a mother talking to the camera about her son, who has juvenile diabetes. She describes how stem cell research ""gives our family hope, hope for a cure,"" and she continues with a blunt declaration:

""Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research in Wisconsin. That’s right, ban it.""  

It is the mother making the statement. But as the candidate, Barrett is responsible for the content of the ad. Indeed, as the mother speaks, the words ""Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research"" appear on the screen.

Before we can evaluate the accuracy of Barrett’s claim, we need a brief explanation of stem cells and the current state of science.

Here are some key points from a primer by the National Institutes of Health:

Stem cells are important for two reasons: As a generic type of cell, stem cells can renew themselves through cell division. Moreover, they can be induced to become specific tissue or organ cells that have special functions. That gives stem cells their potential to treat, and someday even cure, a number of diseases.

Scientists work with two types of stem cells: embryonic and adult. Embryonic stem cells are derived from an embryo, which science defines as the ""developing organism from the time of fertilization until the end of the eighth week of gestation, when it is called a fetus."" Adult stem cells, in contrast, come not from a developing organism but from the body.

Embryonic stem cells have a crucial advantage: With regard to treating diseases, embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body. Adult stem cells are thought to be limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin.

The embryonic-adult distinction is critical, though it is not mentioned in the TV ad.

The mother in the ad is Heidi Fallone. She and her husband, Edward, are two of the six members of the board of directors of Wisconsin Stem Cell Now, a group that advocates specifically for embryonic stem cell research.

Heidi Fallone’s connection to the group is not mentioned in the ad. She is presented as an average mother, with her message packing an emotional wallop as strong as the words: Walker would ban stem cell research.

In truth, Walker’s comments on the topic have expressed support for stem cell research generally — but not if it involves embryos.

It is a line that many candidates have drawn, including Mark Green, who was the subject of Doyle’s attack in 2006. In his ad, Doyle used a Verona mother, pictured with her young daughter, who has diabetes. The mother said Green would ""outlaw stem cell research.""  

In the 2010 campaign, Walker and his campaign staff have issued various statements, including two in August, that spell out his position.

In one, a day after a U.S. district judge shut down federal funding of all research involving embryonic stem cells, a Walker aide said, ""We can realize the potential of stem cell research without destroying human embryos or resorting to human cloning. We can both protect the earliest stages of life and find cures.""

In another statement, also in the wake of the judge’s ruling, Walker himself said that ""science has shown us repeatedly that you can have successful stem cell research without destroying a human embryo.""

As an alternative to embryonic stem cell research, researchers have been developing techniques to reprogram adult cells back to the embryonic state. But recent studies have revealed problems. The reprogrammed cells appear to retain a memory of their previous role — as skin, for example — and differ in subtle ways from embryonic stem cells.

In response to questions, the Barrett campaign has defended its TV ad.

Campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Associated Press: ""Embryonic stem cell research is stem cell research, Walker wants to ban it — he wants to ban stem cell research.""

The statement, though, shifts the debate. No one disputes that Walker opposes embryonic stem cell research.

As additional support, Walzak provided PolitiFact Wisconsin two newspaper articles and a survey Walker completed for the group Pro-Life Wisconsin. But the material, like other items cited,  showed only that Walker opposes embryonic stem cell research, not that he wants to ban all stem cell research.

In an interview, Walzak said the Barrett ad is accurate because it is widely known that only embryonic stem cell research — not adult stem cell research — is being debated in terms of a research ban.

However, since the ad began running, Barrett has altered his message. An e-mail sent by Barrett’s campaign to supporters, signed by Fallone, says Walker would ban ""critical"" stem cell research. It goes on to criticize Walker’s opposition to embryonic stem cell research.

If anything, that underlines how inaccurate the TV ad’s language is.

So, where does that leave us?

Democrat Tom Barrett is running a TV ad claiming his opponent for governor, Republican Scott Walker, ""would ban stem cell research in Wisconsin.""  In truth, Walker has repeatedly said he supports research involving adult stem cells, but opposes research involving embryonic stem cells. That is a critical distinction in the world of science — and of politics. Barrett’s ad ignores it, presenting Walker as so extreme on the matter that he is ""against hope.""

We rate Barrett’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096959940>],/factchecks/2010/oct/10/tom-barrett/democratic-governor-candidate-tom-barrett-says-opp/

Lee County's Debbie Jackow says opponent doesn't support land program
","
Lab tech and political newcomer Debbie Jackow's campaign mailer touts what she is not. She is not her opponent, two-term incumbent Lee County Commissioner Tammy Hall.

Jackow lists her bulleted campaign promises under the header, ""Unlike her opponent Debbie WILL NOT..."" 

• Be a tax and spend commissioner

• Raise property taxes

• Be owned by special interests

• De-fund the 20/20 land program

That last line about the county's Conservation 20/20 program caught our attention.

We wondered, is that a fair accusation?

Voters approved the 20/20 land program in a 1996 referendum to help the county buy up and exempt environmentally sensitive land from development. The program taxes 50 cents for every $1,000 of assessed property value. In 14 years, Lee County taxpayers have spent $286.5 million to preserve 37 square miles of land.

Hall has always voted to approve funding for the program. She voted for it again this year, and it's approved through 2011. We looked for evidence to support Jackow's claim that Hall planned in the future to pull funds from Conservation 20/20.

We pulled footage from the July 6, 2010, commission meeting where commissioners voted to fund the program. This meeting and the media's coverage of it, Jackow said, were the basis of her accusation.

Clerk of Court Charlie Green suggested at the start of the meeting that the commission divert $27 million from Conservation 20/20 this year ­to help fill the county's budget deficit. Hall's only response was to invite Green to stay at the meeting through the vote on the 14-year-old program.

Two hours into the meeting, Hall thanked Commissioner Ray Judah for his support of Conservation 20/20. She then said, ""I support, I have always supported the (Conservation) 20/20 program.""

She led a unanimous vote to continue funding the program.

So where did Jackow's accusation come from?

""It was in The News-Press,"" Jackow said. ""(Hall) said she would consider touching the 20/20 money.""

A July 7 News-Press article said, ""Commission Chairwoman Tammy Hall said the board should be looking ahead to further cost-cutting measures. She cited Clerk of Court Charlie Green's idea of putting a halt to the county's land conservation purchasing program and using its tax dollars to help plug the budget hole.""

A look at the meeting footage shows Hall suggesting the county continue to make cuts. Without expressing support for Green's idea, she also states, ""The clerk has given us ideas on how to maybe put things on hold and transfer over, but that is our goal ... that the average citizen in Lee County does not see a tax increase.""

Hall offered no further comment on Green's suggestion during the meeting.

Hall has supported Conservation 20/20 every year she's been in office, including the current year. To say Hall is considering de-funding the program would be a stretch. Saying she has de-funded the program is clearly incorrect. We rate this statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AE5840>],/factchecks/2010/oct/10/debbie-jackow/debbie-jackow-says-opponent-doesnt-support-land-pr/

Al Gore says ocean acidity levels haven't been this high for many millions of years
","Former Vice President Al Gore, now a crusader against climate change, argues that the continued release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is going to do more than just raise temperatures. It's going to alter the balance of sea life by changing the acidity of the oceans. During a June 11 keynote address at U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 4th Annual Rhode Island Energy & Environmental Leaders Day, Gore said ocean acidification has been characterized as the evil twin of global warming. The process ""disrupts ocean chemistry,"" he said. Ocean water is still more base than acid on the pH scale, ""but it's much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years."" That's important, he said, because, ""This disrupts the process by which shells are formed, not only for shellfish but also for the little critters, the zooplankton, the little tiny critters at the base of the ocean food chain. They have little thin shells. That's being disrupted now."" On Sunday, we checked a similar claim from Whitehouse, who said the acidity of the oceans had increased 30 percent since the industrial age. We ruled that Mostly True. We were equally interested in Gore's assessment of the problem over a much longer span. Is the ocean currently ""much more acidic"" than it has been for ""many millions of years?"" As we outlined in our examination of Whitehouse’s claim, acidity is measured on the pH scale. The lower the number, the greater the acid level. Currently, the oceans have a pH of about 8.1. That's more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when the level was 8.2. When we contacted Gore's office, spokeswoman Betsy McManus directed us to an ocean acidification fact sheet from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She highlighted this statement, which starts out by describing that scientists measure ocean pH in ancient times by using telltale chemical signatures in tiny creatures buried in ocean sediment: ""Additional geochemical evidence and modeling provide strong evidence that the average surface ocean pH has not been much lower than about 8.2 for millions of years."" That seems far less extreme than Gore's statement that the ocean is much more acidic than it has been for many millions of years. So we contacted several oceanographers to get data from the geologic record, where ocean pH is inferred from a variety of methods using cores taken from ancient ice and deep sea sediment. Just as you can get different temperature readings at the same time if you have thermometers in different locations, the pH measurements in any particular era and from cores taken from different locations can vary. If you look at individual data points, you don't have to go back ""many millions of years"" to find ocean levels as acidic as today. A 2009 study in the journal Science that went back 2.1 million years by analyzing the shells of single-celled plankton buried off the west coast of Africa, found that while the pH averaged around 8.2 during that period, there were a few points -- 100,000 and 900,000 years ago -- when the surface ocean pH hit 8.1, where it is today. But Barbel Honisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and chief author of the Science paper, cautioned that ""the uncertainty in the data points is very large."" She said she has more confidence in data published a year later in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, which went back five million years, because it dovetails with other evidence. That study suggested that pH levels dropped to between 8.0 and 8.1 about 3 million to 4 million years ago. ""If you go back 4 million years, you're there,"" Honisch said, adding that other data support that conclusion as well. ""The ocean was more acidic or just as acidic as it is now."" Again, that's not ""many millions of years."" Acid levels also seemed to rise to today's level around 15 million to 16 million years ago, according to Honisch. And Andrew Dickson, an oceanographer at the University of California San Diego, said, ""Once we go back beyond about 23 million years, the average surface ocean pH is lower than today,"" he said. Another Science paper by Honisch and her colleagues, this one from 2012, looked at a broad array of evidence in 10-million-year blocks. Beginning 10 million years ago, acid levels gradually grew until the pH dropped to about 7.5 110 million years ago. That's five times more acidic than today's oceans. The climate experts we spoke with stressed that it's important to put this in perspective. Changes in pH typically occur over millions of years, giving life forms -- whose biology can be thrown akilter by a small change in pH -- time to adapt. Scientists fear that today's shift will come so rapidly, organisms won't be able to compensate, and many species will simply die off.

Pink Pony ad warns fight could cost jobs
","
We couldn’t resist. 
The folks who run the Pink Pony Gentlemen’s Club recently paid for an ad in a community newspaper claiming several hundred people would be unemployed if a city of Brookhaven ordinance forced the strip club to shut its doors. 
Dancers. Bartenders. Even ""house moms."" 
We’ll get to the house moms in a minute. 
""FACT,"" the ad says in red letters. The ad said the city’s ordinance would put ""300 Pink Pony employees out of work in this economy."" 
A colleague saw the ad in a DeKalb County newspaper and forwarded it to us. The ad included a prior fact check we wrote looking into the Pink Pony’s claim that management has never been cited for a violation of a state law or ordinance. That one was rated True. 
We at PolitiFact Georgia are typically digging into technical topics and slogging through long reports; so we virtually danced (with our clothes on) at another opportunity to fact-check a claim by the club. Does the Pink Pony really employ 300 people? 
""Three hundred might be a conservative number,"" said Aubrey Villines, an attorney who specializes in First Amendment issues who represents the club. 
In May, the Pink Pony filed a lawsuit against the DeKalb County municipality claiming Brookhaven’s ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses would put the club out of business. Specifically, the ordinance would prohibit nude dancing, with or without serving alcohol. The city has said it will not enforce the ordinance until a DeKalb County Superior Court judge rules on its legality. 
The lawsuit is serious business, Villines says. The Pink Pony claims Brookhaven would lose $450,000 a year in property and sales taxes, along with license and permit fees. It’s also a big deal for Brookhaven taxpayers, who are paying legal fees associated with the lawsuit. 
There’s been plenty of news coverage over the years about how the strip club business has made it rain with greenbacks in Atlanta. (See: The Gold Club, Adam ""Pacman"" Jones.) Cab drivers, food delivery workers, they all make money off the Pink Pony, Villines said. 
""If we leave that area (of Brookhaven), it will cave under,"" Villines said, stressing that was the main point of the ad. 
Villines estimated the Pink Pony employs about 200 dancers. Some work there a couple of days a week, he said. Others, he said, work as many as five days a week. There’s the bartending staff, servers, the kitchen crew, security, disc jockeys, the janitorial staff. And, yes, house moms. 
House moms, Villines explained, are women who help dancers if they encounter work-related trouble, such as a flat tire en route to the Pony. Their duties include making sure the dancers don’t drive home under the influence. 
""They’re the first line of defense,"" Villines said of house moms. 
The Pink Pony, though, wouldn’t show us any proof that they have 300 people on the payroll. They couldn’t reveal that sort of information, Villines said. 
DeKalb County, though, requires strip club dancers, waitresses, bartenders and bouncers to get an annual license to work at adult entertainment establishments. The dancers pay $300 a year; the other occupations pay $200 a year. 
As of July 18, there were 352 men and women licensed to work at the Pink Pony, county records show. The records do not show each employee is currently working there. 
So, there are more than 300 people currently licensed to work at the club, which is more than what the Pink Pony claimed in its ad. 
Still, we don’t know if all of them are regularly working there. Do the majority of the 200 or so dancers work two days a week? Once every two months? 
The Pink Pony claim is partially accurate, but it ignores a lot of context that would give a reader a different impression. 
We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AB9BC0>],/factchecks/2013/jul/22/pink-pony/pink-pony-ad-warns-fight-could-cost-jobs/

Wisconsin needs to import 10% of its milk? So says Gov. Scott Walker
","
For two decades, America’s Dairyland has suffered the indignity of being outmilked by, sheesh, California. 
Now comes word that our cows don’t even produce enough milk for Wisconsin -- more needs to be brought in from other states. 
The Badger State, since being eclipsed by California in milk production in 1993, has had time to cope with being No. 2. But Bucky apparently still wants to fight. 
On July 10, 2013, Gov. Scott Walker spoke to reporters in Dallas, Wis. (pop. 409), at Wisconsin Farm Technology Days, which is billed as one of the largest agricultural shows in the nation. He said it is important that Wisconsin dairy farmers increase milk production to meet the demands of the state’s dairy plants. 
""A lot of people don’t realize that we’re importing about 10 percent of our milk supply,"" Walker said, according to The Country Today, a newspaper that covers rural life in Wisconsin and Minnesota. 
""We’re America’s Dairyland, but yet we don’t have enough milk in this state to meet the demand for our cheesemakers."" 
Do we really have to import about 10 percent of our milk? 
Walker’s evidence 
At the ag show, Walker talked up the state agriculture department's 30X20 program, which gives grants of up to $5,000 to dairy producers toward a goal of generating 30 billion pounds of milk per year statewide by 2020. 
Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the governor based his claim on hard numbers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as two assumptions. 
As we'll see, the government does not track milk ""imports,"" or rather the shipment of milk across state lines. So, the two assumptions Walker makes are critical in evaluating his statement. 
Figures from the USDA show Wisconsin produced 27.2 billion pounds of milk in 2012. 
(That was up 4 percent from 2011 and is a record for Wisconsin, according to the USDA.) 
From there, Walker does some calculations. He assumes, as it is widely held in dairy circles, that 90 percent of milk produced in Wisconsin is used to make cheese, as opposed to being bottled or used to make foods such as ice cream and yogurt. 
That would mean 24.5 billion pounds of Wisconsin milk was available for cheese making. 
Walker's other assumption is a rule of thumb -- cited by Wisconsin cheese industry folks and others, such as Harvard University -- that it takes about 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of cheese. 
So, dividing the 24.5 billion pounds of milk by 10 would mean there was enough Wisconsin milk to make 2.45 billion pounds of cheese in 2012. 
But federal figures show Wisconsin actually produced more than that -- 2.79 billion pounds of cheese (tops in the United States). 
That's a difference of 340 million pounds of cheese. 
Put another way, it would mean Wisconsin cheese makers needed to import 3.4 billion pounds of milk to produce all of the cheese they made in 2012. 
And 3.4 billion pounds of milk amounts to 12.5 percent of the 27.2 billion total pounds of milk produced in Wisconsin in 2012. 
So, by Walker's figuring, his 10 percent claim is actually conservative. 
That's a start. Let’s hear from some experts. 
Other evidence 
John Umhoefer, executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association in Madison, cited slightly older federal figures, from 2011, which he said comprise the latest complete data-set available. He also used the two assumptions Walker did. 
Wisconsin produced 26.1 billion pounds of milk in 2011 -- which, using the 10-pound rule of thumb, was enough for about 2.61 billion pounds of cheese. 
But Wisconsin cheese makers actually made 2.64 billion pounds of cheese in 2011. 
So, using round numbers, if 90 percent of Wisconsin milk gets used for cheese, but cheese making accounts for all of the Wisconsin milk produced (and a little more), that means there's at least a 10 percent milk shortfall. 
That additional milk had to come from some other state, if it didn’t come from Wisconsin. 
James Robson, chief executive officer of the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, which works to increase the sale and consumption of Wisconsin milk and dairy products, told us Wisconsin has had a milk production shortfall for all 12 years that he has headed the Madison-based board. 
He said the efficiency of Wisconsin milk production has increased the past several years, but that consumers' demand for cheese has increased even more, creating the need for milk from out of state. 
(Wisconsin’s more than 1.2 million dairy cows produced 21,436 pounds of milk per cow in 2012, up 4 percent from 2011.) 
""Some of our cheese makers bring in milk from as far away as Texas,"" Robson said. 
He is also relying, however, on the two key assumptions Walker made. 
What about those? 
Ed Jesse, an emeritus agricultural and applied economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the first thing to know about milk shortfalls or imports is that the government does not track the shipment of milk between states.   
So, any statement about the amount of milk brought into Wisconsin is an estimate. 
As for the two assumptions, Jesse said they have long been widely quoted and he doesn't necessarily argue with them, but that they aren't rock-solid, either. It takes 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of some cheeses, but less milk for others. And while it's often said 90 percent of Wisconsin milk is used for cheese making, that could be a ""rural myth"" but ""it’s probably not far off,"" Jesse said. 
Indeed, even the Milk Marketing Board hedges a bit, saying ""as much as"" 90 percent of Wisconsin milk is made into cheese. 
Our rating 
Walker said: ""We’re importing about 10 percent of our milk supply. We’re America’s Dairyland, but yet we don’t have enough milk in this state to meet the demand for our cheesemakers."" 
Walker's statement is on target, based on the best available estimates, but there aren't actual statistics on how much milk is shipped to Wisconsin from out of state. 
With that clarification, we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968738C0>],/factchecks/2013/jul/22/scott-walker/americas-dairyland-needs-import-10-its-milk-gov-sc/

Twists, turns in tale of County Executive Chris Abele and residency rules
","
In the months-long war of words between local officials and Gov. Scott Walker over ending residency rules for government workers, one episode in the endgame escaped with little notice. 
Ten days before Walker signed the 2013-’15 state budget, which included a provision prohibiting local governments from enforcing residency, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to oppose the change. 
But Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele declined to back the effort, returning the resolution unsigned, and not until 10 days after Walker approved the budget on June 30. 
County supervisors were surprised, saying that Abele had favored the lobbying effort, which dovetailed with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s fight to retain the rules. 
This is a case for the Flip-O-Meter.  
That’s what we use to determine if a public official has changed position on an issue. An important note: We’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch. We’re looking at whether the candidate has been consistent. 
Walker says residency rules, long opposed by unions, scare off some would-be job applicants. Barrett, who hopes to overturn the state’s action in court, says there’s no shortage of qualified applicants, and that public employees should contribute toward their publicly funded benefits by paying local property taxes. 
Where has Abele stood? 
  
March 2011:  
In the special election to replace Walker as Milwaukee County Executive, Abele differed on residency rules with opponent Jeff Stone, a Republican state representative. 
Asked about legislation being discussed in the Legislature to free Milwaukee teachers, police officers and firefighters from residency rules, Stone said he would vote to lift the rules.  
Abele said the rules should stay.  
He agreed with Barrett, who raised concerns at the time that Milwaukee could be harmed as Detroit was when public workers left following the lifting of residency.  
Hiring from the broadest possible pool of potential employees is desirable, Abele told WISN-TV’s Mike Gousha, but ""there’s a reason to be concerned"" in the short run about the impact of workers leaving the city. 
In the end, state lawmakers did not act on the residency issue. 
June 2012: 
Abele, at this point in office for more than a year, expressed ""mixed feelings"" about Milwaukee County’s own residency rules as he defended giving one of his top appointees a four-year waiver on moving into the county under the county’s residency rules.  
County Board supervisors said they were blindsided by the waiver that Abele’s administration gave to economic development director Brian Taffora.  
July 2012: 
When the County Board moved to give itself authority to approve such waivers, Abele vetoed the measure. 
He fleshed out his ""mixed feelings"" on the issue, saying that having the board more involved would make it harder to ""hire and retain outstanding employees from across the state and country.""  
But Abele’s spokesman, Brendan Conway, told a reporter that Abele wasn’t trying to ""overthrow"" the county’s residency policy. 
November 2012: 
A month before Taffora resigned rather than face a renomination fight, Abele told WTMJ radio’s John Mercure he was ""kind of agnostic"" on residency requirements. 
Again, he expressed mixed feelings, decrying ""artificial limits"" that can harm recruiting, but also saying that Taffora still intended to move to the county and comply with the rule if he could sell his house in Ozaukee County. 
February 2013: 
  
Shortly after Walker put a broad provision in the budget blocking municipalities statewide from enforcing residency, Barrett began his pushback campaign. 
  
Abele joined in, doing an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Feb. 21, 2013.  
  
The mayor saw it as a ""public indication he had supported our efforts,"" spokeswoman Jodie Tabak told PolitiFact Wisconsin. 
  
The story did not detail Abele’s reasoning. 
  
June 2013: 
  
With Abele’s apparent blessing, a County Board committee on June 14, 2013 approved the resolution opposing the state move to prohibit local units of government, including Milwaukee County, from requiring residency requirements. 
Milwaukee County, as well as all other local units of government, ""should retain the right to determine residency restrictions as deemed most effective for each particular community,"" the resolution stated. 
Abele ""has no issues with this resolution,"" his deputy chief of staff, John Zapfel, told the committee before its vote. 
Asked by County Supervisor David Cullen if that meant Abele would sign it, Zapfel said: ""That is my understanding, correct."" 
Cullen told us Abele ""had a chance to lend his voice to those who were asking Scott Walker to veto it. He chose not to. It was disappointing."" 
Abele returned the resolution unsigned on July 9, 2013, catching Barrett by surprise, the mayor’s spokeswoman, Jodie Tabak, told us.  
The county executive’s message to the County Board did not discuss the merits of Walker’s move; rather, it said he was returning it unsigned because the state budget was complete and the prohibition was taking effect. 
We asked Abele why he didn’t sign the resolution after his aide assured supervisors he would. 
Abele said Zapfel may not have been given a clear idea of his position.  
Abele told us he spoke out in support of retaining residency only in the context of public safety workers in Milwaukee. He said he was responding to the passionate stance taken by political ally Barrett and Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn. 
We found no record of Abele parsing the issue that way during the five-month lobbying campaign by Barrett. Walker’s proposal was to eliminate the rules statewide, not just for Milwaukee. 
Our rating 
Abele’s statements and actions don’t constitute a full flip-flop, in our view. He clearly has some misgivings about residency rules for Milwaukee County government, so leaving the file unsigned is not a major reversal.  
Still, his actions and words have been inconsistent, to the point where both his political friends and his frequent foes on the County Board were taken aback by his withdrawal from the fight as the legislative battle drew to a close in June.  
Indeed, if Abele had the nuanced position he says he did, it was so closely held that even one of his top aides apparently was completely unaware of it. 
The Flip-O-Meter defines a half Flip as a partial change of position or inconsistent statements. That’s what we rate this one.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BE2C40>],/factchecks/2013/jul/21/chris-abele/twists-turns-tale-county-executive-chris-abele-and/

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says the oceans are 30 percent more acidic than in the past
","Most people have heard about what will happen if humans keep pumping large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air as we burn more fossil fuels, including warmer temperatures, melting polar caps, rising sea levels, stronger storms and big changes in the types of plants and animals that can survive and thrive in particular regions of the world. ""But wait,"" as an evil TV pitchman might gleefully declare, ""there's more."" On June 12, 2013, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, took to floor of the Senate for one of his regular speeches about the impact of pollution on Earth's climate. This time he focused on a lesser-publicized problem -- the oceans are becoming more acidic. ""Our oceans face unprecedented challenges from climate change and carbon pollution,"" he said. ""Oceans have absorbed more than 550 billion tons of our carbon pollution. As a result, they have become 30 percent more acidic. That is a measurement. That is not a theory."" Thirty percent more acidic? Our first question was: ""Is it true?"" Our second was: ""If so, what does that mean?"" When most people think of measuring acidity, they think of pH, the scale that runs from 0 to 14. (Think back to your school days and the little strips of paper that changed color depending on whether a substance was an acid or a base.) ""So,"" you might ask, ""has the pH of the ocean shifted a few points?"" Not at all. The pH scale is not a straight-line measure like a yardstick. It's a logarithmic scale, where a one point drop would make a substance 10 times more acidic. (What you're really measuring is the number of hydrogen ions, which determine how acidic something is.) Whitehouse's office directed us to several sources -- and we found our own -- reporting that since the mid-18th century, when air pollution became more prevalent, the pH of surface seawater has gone from about 8.2 to about 8.1. (That's a rise in acidity, but sea water would have to drop below 7.0 before it could be officially classified as an acid.) Lowering the pH by a tenth of a point translates to a 26-percent rise in hydrogen ion concentration, but some of those science sources say the increase is actually closer to 30 percent. The pH scale has been around only since 1909. How do we know what the pH was like in the 1800s or earlier? The oceanographers we consulted told us basic chemistry provides the answer. Seawater absorbs air, including carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide interacts with the water to make the ocean more acidic. Researchers have good measurements directly comparing carbon dioxide and pH dating to 1989. They show that surface ocean acidity has risen as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen, just as expected. To go further back in time, scientists have measured the carbon dioxide concentrations in tiny bubbles of air trapped in ice found in places such as Greenland and Antarctica. Those ice cores show that, until the 1850s, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had not risen above 280 parts per million for most of the last million years or so. But in the past century and a half, they’ve been rising steadily, causing an increase in ocean acidity. Today, those carbon dioxide levels have occasionally passed 400 parts per million. ""It's been mostly in the last 100 years,"" said Steve D'Hondt, an oceanography professor at the University of Rhode Island. One other point. The acidity of the entire ocean hasn't changed by the amount Whitehouse citied. The chemical composition of deeper layers shifts much more gradually. ""It's been a long time since the deep ocean touched the atmosphere,"" said Andrew Dickson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at the University of California-San Diego. ""So it's not true of the ocean as a whole. It's only true of the surface layer."" That leads us to our second question: what does it mean? Because the effects of acidification are currently restricted to the upper 600-1,600 feet of the ocean, where most of the life is found, there's serious concern that small changes in pH will have a big -- and not very healthy -- effect on many ocean species, although some may be unaffected. Earth's oceans have been much more acidic in the past -- 110 million years ago the oceans were 400 percent (five times) more acidic. But most of those changes developed over millions of years, giving organisms time to evolve and adapt to the shift. The current rise in acidity is rapid. Said University of Rhode Island oceanographer Arthur Spivack, ""We already have a measurable change in ocean pH and we're going into a period where there will be a substantial change."" Our ruling U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said the oceans ""have become 30 percent more acidic."" He is correct if you look at the increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions since the 1850s in the upper layers of the ocean, where most sea life thrives. We also note that he's describing the change using a measure that heightens the drama for the casual listener. But regardless of how it is characterized, that change is cause for concern if it harms ocean creatures sensitive to changes in pH. On the other hand, the deeper ocean has not seen a 30-percent increase. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

McAuliffe says ethics investigation concluded Cuccinelli ""should have been prosecuted""
","
A special prosecutor’s report concluding that Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli did not violate state disclosure laws by neglecting to report political gifts was hotly contested on July 20 during the first debate between Virginia’s gubernatorial candidates. 
Democrat nominee Terry McAuliffe said that Cuccinelli, the GOP nominee, was not vindicated by the findings. 
""If you read the report, which I have done, it says the attorney general should have been prosecuted, but Virginia laws are insufficient,"" McAuliffe said. 
""That’s absolutely wrong,"" Cuccinelli injected. 
A minute later, Cuccinelli got his turn to respond fully. ""So much of it is inaccurate, where do I begin? he said of McAuliffe’s claim. ""I’ll let the fact checkers take care of it."" 
So, let’s begin. 
At the center of the disclosure controversy is Jonnie Williams, chief executive of troubled dietary supplement company Star Scientific. Williams gave at least $140,000 in gifts and loans to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s family, many of which were not reported on state disclosure forms filed by McDonnell. 
Cuccinelli announced this spring that he had omitted $12,000 in gifts on disclosure forms he filed between 2009 and 2012, saying it was an oversight. Of the gifts, about $5,000 came from Williams, who gave the attorney general a trip to New York aboard his private jet, a catered Thanksgiving dinner and vacations at Williams’ Smith Mountain Lake home. 
Amid criticism from Democrats, Cuccinelli in April appointed Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring to investigate whether Cuccinelli had violated state disclosure laws. 
Herring, in a nine-page report released on July 18, wrote ""our investigation finds no evidence"" that Cuccinelli violated any laws or intentionally failed to disclose the gifts. 
Contrary to McAuliffe’s statement, the report does not say Cuccinelli ""should have been prosecuted but Virginia laws are insufficient."" The report does not mention the word ""prosecute"" and it offers no opinion on the strength or weakness of the state's disclosure laws. 
McAuliffe, after the debate, was asked to pinpoint language in the report verifying his claim. He offered nothing specific. ""Well, that’s my analysis of the report,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
McAuliffe said the ethics report said Cuccinelli ""should have been prosecuted, but Virginia laws are insufficient."" 
There is nothing in the report that remotely supports McAuliffe’s claim. To the contrary, the report concludes Cuccinelli did not violate any laws. 
McAuliffe’s hyperbolic statement is not only wrong, it defies any reasonable reading of the report. We rate his comment Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2BBEC0>],/factchecks/2013/jul/21/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-investigation-concluded-cuccinelli-/

Does Portland 'break even' enforcing parking regulations?
","
PolitiFact Oregon suspects there are stages a motorist experiences upon finding a yellow parking ticket envelope stuck to their windshield: Disbelief. Shame. Anger at those meanies at the city trying to squeeze every dime out of you, just to rack up revenue.  
Well, Dylan Rivera, a spokesman at the Portland Bureau of Transportation, told the Portland Mercury that ""generally we barely break even"" in parking enforcement. In other words, the city does not make revenue off errant motorists.  
  
A curious reader asked us to find out if that is true. Does revenue collected from parking fines cover the cost of enforcing parking rules? We sent an email to Rivera and to his colleague at PBOT communications, Diane Dulken. They confirmed what was stated in the Portland Mercury.  
""It’s a balancing act,"" said Dulken. ""It’s not a cash cow; it’s not intended to raise revenue.""  
Of course we asked for numbers to back up the claim. Here they are, in millions of dollars::  
Year 
Revenue 
Expenses 
Direct Expenses 
Indirect Expenses 
2009-10 
$4.4 
$5.5 
$3.4 
$2.1

$5.1 
$5.5 
$3.4

$5.6 
$7 
$4.2 
$2.8 
2012-13 
$6.6 
$8.1 
$4.8 
$3.3 
2013-14 
$7.4 
$8.7 
$5.3 
$3.4 
You can see that expenses -- including both direct and indirect costs -- outstrip revenue collected. Direct costs are for salaries and equipment. Indirect costs are for overhead, such as phones, office space, public information officers and other administrative costs sprinkled throughout the bureau.  
The numbers for 2012-13, the budget year that ended June 30, are estimates. Dulken explained that the numbers increased because the city hired three new enforcement officers last year, bringing the total to 50. We also should remind readers that the city raised fines for some parking violations in February 2013.  
The projected numbers for this year exclude revenue and costs associated with a plan for new meters in Northwest Portland.  
If you count both indirect and direct expenses, PBOT isn’t breaking even. Instead, it appears the parking enforcement program has been losing money.  
(Why even enforce parking rules, you ask? Well, the city does get money from meters, and needs to maintain parking turnover for retailers. Plus, whom do you call when a stranger is blocking your private driveway? PBOT, apparently, is what stands between us and a disorderly parking free-for-all.)  
But here’s the deal. Like you, PolitiFact Oregon is highly suspicious. We don’t want to take a government employee’s word for it. We want to know how the budget for parking enforcement is presented to others.  
We pored through previous budgets, found online. We learned that the costs of parking enforcement in 2010-11 was $3.4 million; in 2011-12 it was $4.2 million; and in 2009-10 it was $3.4 million. In other words, the budgets use direct costs to convey the cost of the parking enforcement program. Indirect costs are not included.  
What’s up with that?  
We got on the phone with Rivera, who acknowledged that there are different ways to view costs. But the bottom line, he said,  is that ""our impression has been, and this inquiry has confirmed, that we’re not writing citations for the purpose of funding the transportation"" bureau.  
Fair enough. We adore a reasonable and upfront response from government. Readers now have more information to assess how parking ticket money works in the city of Portland. 
There are different ways to look at the statement that ticket revenue matches costs. The city’s share of ticket revenue does not cover the fully loaded costs of providing enforcement services, according to the bureau. On the other hand, ticket revenue does cover the direct salary and equipment costs of writing tickets, according to public budgets.  
We’re not in a position to audit the bureau’s books. All we know is that indirect costs are not details readily available to the public. Direct costs are what the public can ferret out when assessing parking enforcement. To us, those are important details missing from a statement that can be accurate looked at one way, not accurate looked at another way.  
We rate the statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A6E800>],/factchecks/2013/jul/20/portland-bureau-transportation-pbot/does-portland-break-even-enforcing-parking-regulat/

Using that data, St. Petersburg’s crime rate yo-yoed from 2002-04 before decreasing steadily until 2008. The crime rate spiked in 2009, largely due to an increase in aggravated assault, larceny, burglary and stolen cars. 
What happened in 2010, Foster’s first full year in office? The crime rate plunged to at least a 10-year low. The rate fell again in 2011 and again in 2012. 
The biggest drop-offs occurred in the number of motor vehicle thefts, aggravated assaults, larcenies, burglaries and robberies, data show. 
Here’s a chart that shows the decline:

What’s happening in St. Petersburg is happening across the country, so it’s tough to figure out how much of an effect local law enforcement plays. The national crime rate has been declining over the past 20 years and is at its lowest points in some kinds of crime since the early 1960s, said William Ruefle, a University of South Florida St. Petersburg criminology professor who analyzes local crime. 
Ruefle credits modern, smarter policing. There’s also the all-time high rates of imprisonment around the country. A small number of people commit most crimes, so if they’re locked up, there will likely be fewer infractions, he said. 
When we asked Foster about his initiatives to reduce crime, he directed us to responses to two questions in his Tampa Bay Times editorial board questionnaire about the city’s homelessness issue. 
Foster pointed to several anti-crime initiatives that happened during his tenure, including a ban on panhandling; a joint police department-sheriff’s office task force focused on violent crime; new security cameras (thanks to Republican National Convention dollars); the creation of a gun bounty program targeting weapons owned illegally; adding a late-night downtown patrol unit to accommodate later bar hours; and establishing a squad that aims to address crime where it’s trending. 
Should Foster take the credit for declining crime? To a degree, experts said.   
Most of the ideas came from experts at the police department, said St. Petersburg police Chief Chuck Harmon, who has led the department since 2001. He credited Foster as being a good listener with a keen interest in crime around the city. (According to Harmon, Foster is the first mayor to get his own radio call sign. It’s X-0.) 
""He knew what the problem was, but it was my staff’s job to come up with the solution,"" Harmon said. ""I will say he’s been involved with all of those things he talked about in one way or another. He could nix it if he didn’t like it."" 
Police officials have ""been scratching our heads"" trying to figure out what’s driving the drop, Harmon said. Even though he can’t give a definitive reason for the big drop-off, he said the department has tried new tactics in recent years. 
For example, police are better monitoring offenders on probation and parole, which played a role in significantly reducing car thefts, he said. And a new unit created in the spring responded to an uptick in auto thefts during the first few months of 2013 -- most of which involved the driver leaving keys in the ignition while running into a convenience store -- by posting reminders at gas stations and on social media. 
""Crime prevention isn’t rocket science, but sometimes you just have to remind people: Don’t leave your keys in your car,"" said police spokesman Bill Proffitt. 
Foster wants to expand the department, which has applied for a four-year federal grant that would allow the city to add five more police officers. That would bring the force to 550 officers. 
Ruefle said honing in on crime spots are most likely to have an effect on addressing crime. Foster’s actions on the homeless population have also had some effect on crime, he said, as homeless residents were responsible for 15 percent of the city’s arrests and ""it is much lower now."" 
Still, it’s hard to say precisely what effect any of these policies have on the falling crime rate, he said. 
The big question: How long will the drop last? Both Harmon and Ruefle said it can’t keep going down at this pace. Harmon expects an increase in cybercrime will present the department with new challenges. 
In fact, police officials reported on July 10, 2013, that crime is up 6.2 percent for the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012. The city, however, is still on pace to have a lower crime rate in 2013 than it did in the years before Foster took office. 
Our ruling 
Foster said, ""Since I was elected, crime rates have been at their lowest in over a decade."" 
On the numbers, Foster is accurate. The crime rate is at its lowest since at least 2000. But in judging claims like these, we also must consider whether Foster is right to take credit for the drop. On that front, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. Yes, the mayor helped institute a number of new crime-fighting measures. But crime rates are down across the country, and it’s unclear how much the new crime-fighting tools helped St. Petersburg’s decline. 
On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C204C0>],/factchecks/2013/jul/19/bill-foster/bill-foster-says-st-petersburg-crime-rates-have-be/

GOP Stoppers say Texas ranks poorly in worker deaths, carbon emissions and more
","A ""Rick Perry 2016"" image popped up on Facebook accompanied by warnings about the state he’s led since late 2000: ""Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients."" The June 13, 2013, post by the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, which also has a web page highlighting political items, was accompanied by a message signed ""Veruca"": ""True. Google it."" Referring to the Republican governor’s possibly renewed presidential aspirations, the comment closed: ""Just think if he makes good on his threat to run again, he can do for the whole country what he's done for Texas."" Mindful that we’ve previously explored claims about each of these topics, we asked the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, whose posts play off of the novel and movie ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" how it reached its Texas rankings. Worker deaths ""Veruca Salt"" (who did not provide her real name), a co-founder of the group, replied via Facebook message and pointed out an April 1, 2013, commentary by a state legislator, a Sept. 15, 2012, Dallas Morning News news article and a Sept. 21, 2011, news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, each of them indicating that in 2010, Texas was tops in some kind of worker fatalities. The commentary by Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, said: ""Texas still leads the country in the rate of construction worker fatalities."" The Sept. 15, 2012, News’ story said that Texas led the nation with 461 total worker deaths in 2010, a tally attributed to the bureau, whose news release said Texas had 456 ""fatal work injuries"" in 2010, according to a preliminary count, which was down 26 from 2009. Some 134 of the deaths were highway-related, according to the release, with workplace homicides and falls accounting for 48 and 45 deaths, respectively. The release does not say Texas led the nation in workplace deaths. In May 2013, we rated as Half True a claim that Texas leads the nation in fatal industrial accidents. Drawing on statistics compiled by the federal bureau, we found that according to preliminary figures for 2011, Texas ranked No. 1 in five of six types of event or exposure tabbed by Austin advocate Jim Marston as  ""industrial accident categories"" plus the transportation category. California led in deaths caused by violence and other injuries by persons or animals. Texas, the nation’s second-most populous state, had 18 of the nation’s 143 work fatalities attributed to fires and explosions; 67 of the total 666 from falls, slips and trips; 43 of the 401 caused by exposure to harmful substances or environments; and 66 of 708 deaths resulting from contact with objects and other equipment. California had the second-most in each of the four categories: 9, 60, 36 and 50 deaths, respectively. Third in fires/explosions was Tennessee with 10; third in falls and slips was New York with 39; third in harmful exposure was Florida with 27; and New York was third in object/equipment contact deaths at 34. We looked at preliminary data for 2003 through 2010 and found Texas led those categories about 88 percent of the time. Seeking a way to account for population differences among states, we took each state’s 2011 raw numbers of deaths in the four categories Marston tabbed, added them together, then divided by the average number of workers employed in the state in 2011 per the bureau. Texas ranked 18th, with a rate of 1.7 such deaths per 100,000 workers. Observing that the five states with the ""worst"" rates all employed fewer than 1 million people in 2011, we checked to see how Texas fared among states employing more than 1 million. The answer: 10th place. ""Worst"" among the states were Montana (3.4 deaths per 100,000 workers), North Dakota (3.3), West Virginia (3), Alaska (3) and New Mexico (2.8). ""Worst"" among states with more than 1 million employed were Arkansas (2.6), Louisiana (2.3), Kansas (2.3), Missouri (2.1) and Kentucky (2). During our look into the Everlasting GOP Stoppers’ claim, a bureau spokeswoman, Cheryl Abbot, responded to our inquiry about worker deaths in general by emailing us a federal document showing 2011 workplace fatality rates state by state. That year, according to the document, Texas had a rate of 4 fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. That tied the state for 22nd with Alabama. North Dakota ranked first with a fatality rate of 12.4, according to the document, with Wyoming second (11.6) followed by Montana (11.2), Alaska (11.1), Arkansas (8.0), South Dakota (6.7) and New Mexico (6.6). Among the 10 most populous states, Texas ranked second to Ohio, which had a 5.5 fatality rate, according to the document. Carbon emissions ""Salt"" pointed us toward a May 14, 2013, blog post in a trade publication, Environmental Leader, stating: ""Texas still led the U.S. states in CO2 emissions from energy with 663 million metric tons in 2010, followed by California and Pennsylvania."" The post, like a May 29, 2013, online post by the Environmental Defense Fund, attributed the conclusion to figures posted by the federal Energy Information Administration. The post said too, however, that Wyoming had the nation’s greatest per-resident emissions, 118.5 metric tons per capita. In February 2013, we found a similar contrast; by far, Texas topped other states in carbon emissions except when those emissions were adjusted for population. A Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article said that according to federal data released that day, Texas was releasing far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continued: ""Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show."" The story said the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It said the agency ""collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said.""   To our inquiries at that time, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says. And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: ""Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well."" Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities. Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed a distant second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons. So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions, though it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population.In per-capita emissions, less populous states led the nation, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. High school graduates On Texas ranking last in high school graduates, ""Salt"" cited the March 2013 edition of a report by a Texas House caucus, the Legislative Study Group, on how Texas ranks compared to other states. ""Texas is dead last in percentage of high school graduates,"" the report said, a conclusion attributed to the ""Texas Fact Book"" published in 2012 by the Legislative Budget Board, which said that in 2009, 79.9 percent of Texans had graduated from high school, placing the state 50th. By email, a staff spokesman for the budget board, John Barton, told us that ranking was based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey, which indicates Texas trailed Mississippi, at 80.4 percent, and California, 80.6 percent. More up-to-date information was available before the group made its post about Perry. In the bureau’s 2011 survey, Texas, Mississippi and California tied for last among the states, with 81.1 percent of adults having high school degrees. Louisiana was fourth, at 82.5 percent. We suppose the group’s Facebook post could be read as saying Texas is last in current high school graduation rates. That was not what we found in January 2013 when we rated as Mostly True a Perry claim that Texas graduation rates were at an all-time high and third-highest in the nation. Texas had tied with five states for the third-highest graduation rate in 2011, of 86 percent, we found. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Mental health spending ""Salt"" offered news articles and blog posts from 2011 and 2012 indicating Texas ranked 50th in per-resident spending on mental health care. Most drew on an annual analysis by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. In February 2013, we rated as Mostly True a claim that Texas is ""last in mental health expenditures,"" after noting that the foundation’s latest review indicated that another state spent less per resident than Texas in fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010. Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. The state’s per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56. In raw dollars, then, Texas spent more on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after trailing all other states for several years. Our ruling The Facebook post said: ""Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients."" This post takes things out of context by cherry-picking figures, in each case stressing the result that makes Texas look worst. Still, two of the declared ranks seem fairly solid. Texas tied with Mississippi in 2011 for the greatest share of adults lacking high school degrees and it was second to last in per-person mental health spending in 2010. In contrast, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its 2011 worker fatality rate and while the state had the most carbon emissions in 2010, it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population. We rate this claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F2E40>],/factchecks/2013/jul/19/facebook-posts/gop-stoppers-say-texas-ranks-poorly-worker-deaths-/

Rep. Tom Cole says food stamp spending doubled under Bush, doubled again under Obama
","
Food stamp spending doubled under President Barack Obama — after doubling under his Republican predecessor, says Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. 
That’s one reason he’s disappointed that House lawmakers missed a chance to push for more than $20 billion in savings over 10 years when they stripped nutrition programs from the farm bill. Now they may be stuck with current law or the Senate bill, he said, which aims to trim about $4 billion. 
""I would argue what we missed, as Republicans, was the chance for real reform,"" he said in an  MSNBC interview July 16, 2013. ""We could have gotten some reductions. It's a program that's doubled under President (George W.) Bush, doubled again under President Obama. So, you know, program this big, there's some things you can do differently and still help people that need it."" 
We wondered: Did such spending double under Bush, then double again? 
SNAP growth 
We’ll start by noting that food stamps have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008. 
It’s the federal government’s largest food program, eclipsing other big farm-bill food spending for school lunches and breakfasts and for Women, Infants and Children. It helps low-income people buy groceries, usually with benefit cards that work like debit cards. 
The 2007-09 recession drove the number of folks on food stamps to a record high under Obama. In an average month in 2011, one in seven U.S. residents got help. A Washington Post reporter this year documented one Rhode Island town’s reliance on its monthly SNAP infusion. 
We asked Cole for his evidence that spending doubled under Bush before doubling under Obama. The congressman provided numbers from the agency that administers the program, the U.S. Agriculture Department. 
He compared total costs of the program from the start of Bush’s term in 2000 to the end of his second term in 2008, then growth from 2008 to the most recent fiscal year available, 2012. Costs had more than doubled under Bush, from $17 billion to $38 billion, then doubled again under Obama, to $78 billion. 
Cole didn’t adjust for inflation, but he should have: A more accurate inflation-adjusted measure even more closely matches his claim. Total spending on SNAP in 2012 dollars doubled under Bush, from $20 billion to $40 billion, and very nearly doubled under Obama, $40 billion to $78 billion. 
Why? 
The story since 2007 is still fresh: joblessness driven by the recession made more people eligible for help, and also drove more folks who were already eligible for help to ask for it, perhaps because their other support networks were tapped out. The stimulus bill also included a boost in benefits, which temporarily increased costs. That expires in November. 
The recession also partly explains the rise in benefits before Bush left office in 2008. 
But it was the presidency of Bill Clinton and the 1996 welfare reform that set the stage for rising benefits under Bush. Under Clinton, spending had fallen nearly 40 percent, partly because of new limits in the law. By the late 1990s, lawmakers were already starting to roll back some restrictions, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
""The increases were largely a rebound from the deep cuts the program sustained in the 1996 welfare law and strengthening the program’s ability to support working families,"" said Dottie Rosenbaum, who worked in the Congressional Budget Office at the time. She’s now a senior policy analyst with the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. 
Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who advised Bush on welfare policy at the time of the 2002 farm bill, said the goal then was to expand food programs for low-income working families. The bill made it easier for states to administer the programs and to get more eligible people signed up. 
""If they're willing to work for 9 or 10 bucks an hour, and get our kids out of poverty, then we ought to help them,"" he said. 
He said he’s concerned by the increase in spending on food stamps, and has testified before Congress on ways to reduce it, including requiring more evidence for families to claim deductions that help them qualify for benefits. 
Rosenbaum argues no change is required. Spending will come down on its own as the economy recovers. About 65 percent of the growth in spending from 2007 to 2011 was driven by an increase in the number of people eligible for food stamps in the poor economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office. About 20 percent of growth came from the temporarily higher benefits under the stimulus bill. 
In other words, the economy by itself will bring food stamp spending down. 
""The more recent growth is driven primarily by the recession and is evidence that SNAP is doing precisely what it is designed to do: quickly help more low-income families during economic downturns as poverty rises, unemployment mounts, and more people need assistance,"" she said. 
Our ruling 
Cole said food stamp spending ""doubled under President Bush, doubled again under President Obama."" Agriculture Department numbers back his claim. 
Whether that’s evidence the program requires reform depends on your perspective on government assistance. Even with no change in the law, spending will fall as the economy recovers. Cole got his history right. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C29C0>],/factchecks/2013/jul/19/tom-cole/rep-tom-cole-says-food-stamp-spending-doubled-unde/
"['Georgia', 'Redistricting', 'Nikema  Williams']","
Georgia Democrats blame their numbers on gerrymandering
","
This week, Georgia’s revered civil rights icon and congressman U.S. Rep. John Lewis testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the first congressional hearing after the Supreme Court’s decision last month striking down a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 
In late June, the court voted 5 to 4 to abolish a requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of racial discrimination get Justice Department approval before changing election laws. The court ruled that the 40-year-old demographic data used to determine which states fall under the preclearance requirement was outdated and not reflective of societal changes. 
The court’s decision drew criticism from many civil rights and Democratic groups. The Georgia Democratic Party leader called the decision ""unfathomable."" 
""The Republican Majority in Georgia drew maps in 2012 that reduced Democratic voting performance,"" interim party Chairwoman Nikema Williams said in a news release. ""Georgia is nearly 50 percent Democratic and they diminished our voting strength to 32 percent through gerrymandered maps. However, the Supreme Court ruling may backfire when Democrats across the state rally."" 
Had Georgia’s Democratic numbers in the state decreased by nearly a third? And if so, were gerrymandered maps to blame? We decided to follow the numbers. 
We started by checking the 50 percent figure. 
PolitiFact Georgia has previously examined a similar claim. 
Tracking R’s and D’s in the Peach State is difficult because Georgia does not have partisan voter registration. Primaries are open to everyone regardless of party affiliation. 
  
In the 2012 general election, about 53.3 percent of voters cast ballots for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, versus 45.5 percent for Democrat Barack Obama (a difference of 7.8 points). The point spread increased to 10 points in the 2010 gubernatorial race, but it narrowed to 5.2 points for the presidential race in the 2008 general election. 
  
In a 2011 poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 38 percent of voters said they were Republicans, and 35 percent identified as Democrats. 
    
A 2008 Pew Research Center poll reported similar voter statistics for Georgia: 32 percent identified as Republicans, and 31 percent as Democrats. A 2008 Gallup poll leaned more to the left with 45.4 percent of voters labeled Democrat or leaning Democratic, compared to 41.8 percent Republican or leaning that way. 
So, polling data supports that part of Williams’ claim, but actual voting numbers differ. 
We contacted the state Democratic Party’s spokeswoman, Liz Flowers, about the other parts of her boss’ statement. 
Flowers said Williams’ 32 percent figure is based on the Democratic representation in the Georgia Legislature. By our count, there are 77 Democrats in the 236-member state General Assembly. Doing the math on those numbers works out to a 32 percent Democratic showing. 
But is the 32 percent representation a product of ""gerrymandered maps"" as Williams claimed? 
Georgia’s most recent redistricting was completed two years ago. Democrats argued that the Republican-controlled state Legislature had redrawn the districts to give the GOP an advantage, which is the definition of gerrymandering. 
The redrawn maps pitted Democrat against Democrat in the 2012 elections, particularly in the metro Atlanta area, which substantially reduced Democratic representation, Flowers said. 
But a review of legislative members in the session prior to redistricting showed about a 35 percent Democratic representation. So the 2011 redistricting seems to have caused a targeted, but not necessarily substantial, reduction in party counts. 
And the Democratic numbers are probably not all due to redistricting, said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, who has long studied Georgia’s voting trends. 
""In our system where (a candidate) wins or loses a district outright, usually the majority party will get a bonus, more than its proportionate share of seats,"" he said. ""This tends to be true no matter which party is in the majority. 
""Even if you had an independent master draw up the (redistricting) plan, the majority party would still get more seats because of the way our system is set up,"" Bullock said. 
And, when it comes to gerrymandering election maps, experts say the Democrats have done it too. 
To sum up, Williams said that although Georgia is nearly 50 percent Democratic, the Republican majority reduced Democratic voting strength in the state Legislature to 32 percent through gerrymandered maps. 
Polling data in which voters self-identify their party affiliation seems to support Williams’ 50 percent claim, although some actual voting numbers show large advantages in votes for Republican candidates. 
The Democratic representation, taken at face value, is 32 percent, but placing the blame for that low representation on Republican-led redistricting is not totally fair. And besides, when Democrats are in control, they do it too, experts said. 
Williams’ claim contains some truth, but it leaves out significant context that might give the reader a different impression.

"['National', 'Mitch McConnell']","
Barack Obama is getting his nominees confirmed faster than President George W. Bush was at the same time in his second term, says Mitch McConnell
","
Comity may have returned to the Senate with a deal that averted a showdown over confirmation of President Barack Obama’s nominees, but beforehand, passions ran high. Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., accused Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., of a naked power grab to push nominations through. 
""If we do not pull back from the brink, my friend the majority leader is going to be remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever,"" McConnell said. 
Reid responded, ""No matter how often my friend rudely talks about me breaking my word, I am not going to respond talking about how many times he has broken his word."" 
A few days after that exchange, McConnell appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press where he argued that the president’s track record has been pretty good. 
""What is the problem here? The president has had 1,540 of his nominations confirmed, only four defeated. He’s not lost a single member of the cabinet. He’s getting them faster than President Bush was at the same time in his second term,"" McConnell said. 
There are actually three claims in that statement. Here, we will look at the last one, ""He’s getting them faster than President (George W.) Bush was at the same time in his second term."" 
We contacted McConnell’s office, and communications director Michael Brumas told us that the Senate had confirmed 28 judges, compared to 10 total by this same point in 2005. 
Brumas has those numbers exactly right. The only problem is that McConnell on Meet the Press did not specify that he was talking about judges. We brought this up with Brumas, and he told us that McConnell has used the comparison between Obama and Bush a number of times to describe the pace of judicial nominations. 
Again, that’s accurate. We found that just a few days earlier, McConnell made the point on the Senate floor about judges. 
However, he didn’t say that during this interview. All he said was that Obama was ""getting them faster than President Bush was at the same time in his second term."" 
We wanted to see how the numbers came out when we looked at all nominations in the first year of the second terms of both presidents, up to July 14, the day McConnell was interviewed. With the guidance of Anne Joseph O’Connell, associate dean at the University of California-Berkeley Law, we searched the nominations database at the Library of Congress. 
We found that the Senate has confirmed 68 of Obama’s nominees. By this point in the 109th Congress, the Senate had confirmed 129 of Bush’s nominees, nearly twice as many. 
Our ruling 
McConnell said that the Senate had confirmed more Obama nominees than it had at the same point in Bush’s term. The opposite is true. Bush had 129 confirmations compared with 68 for Obama. 
McConnell should have included the detail about judges, as he has in the past, but he did not. It is unlikely that most viewers would have been able to fill in the missing words because not everyone is familiar with McConnell’s talking points.

Robert Reich says it’s legal in Texas to shoot someone creating a ‘public nuisance’ in the dark
","Discussing the divide between states red and blue, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently said that Texans are allowed to shoot people who are causing a nuisance. ""If you want to use a gun to kill someone who’s, say, spraypainting a highway underpass at night,"" Reich wrote in a June 8, 2013, blog post at robertreich.org, ""you might want to go to Texas, where it’s legal to shoot someone who’s committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark."" Reich, who headed the Labor Department under President Bill Clinton, has a law degree and is now a University of California-Berkeley professor of public policy. He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago’s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee. Instead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration. Gilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft. Reich disagreed. ""Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft,"" he said. ""Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return,"" he said, later adding, ""It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws,"" the verdict means ""it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance."" In his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict. He later switched to saying it is ""one way"" to view the decision. Legal experts and Gilbert’s defense lawyer disagreed with him. Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich ""is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law."" The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one’s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person ""reasonably believes"" such force is necessary to prevent imminent ""theft during the nighttime"" or ""criminal mischief during the nighttime."" Jurors concluded that the ""theft"" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. ""She was committing a scam,"" he said. Even then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn’t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself. ""It is not open season on prostitutes"" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said. ""This has gone, as you know, viral with ‘It’s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,’ ‘Stupid Texans and their guns,’ "" he said. ""Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted."" As to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, ""You cannot under any circumstances do so."" University of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, ""Reich, in my view, is simply wrong."" Frago and Gilbert’s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. ""What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money,"" he said. ""In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than ‘just’ a contractual dispute,"" Dix said. ""It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid."" Even so, he said, ""The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft."" That’s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich’s assertion, the jury didn’t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force. Even if prostitution had been a crucial point, it’s not a ""public nuisance"" in Texas law. It’s classified under ""public indecency"" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02. Public nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone. Reich’s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: ""Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief,"" Abbott said. Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person’s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter. Spraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. ""It’s a ridiculous statement."" Dix said, ""I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can ‘shoot someone who’s committing a ""public nuisance"" under the cover of dark.’ It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage."" Like Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do. One final point: We wondered why the law specified ""during the nighttime."" Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone’s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because ""sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless."" Our ruling Reich said that in Texas, ""it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark,"" claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it’s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance. Legal experts and a lawyer in the murder trial told us Reich was wrong. The verdict hinged on theft; prostitution is not a ""public nuisance"" in Texas; and state law doesn’t say deadly force can be used on people creating nuisances. Notably, too, the law includes many other restrictions on deadly force, not just what type of crime is being committed. We rate the statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967352C0>],/factchecks/2013/jul/18/robert-reich/robert-reich-says-its-legal-texas-shoot-someone-cr/
"['Agriculture', 'Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Lincoln Chafee']","
Governor Lincoln Chafee says farming is one of the fastest growing areas of Rhode Island’s economy
","
While munching on a raw carrot stick last month, we noticed a quote in a Providence Journal story from Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee regarding the importance of farming in Rhode Island. 
""Fifteen years ago, you wouldn’t have thought that farming would be an important part of the Rhode Island economy, but it’s one of the fastest growing areas of our economy,"" Chafee said. ""Restaurants are looking for fresh food, and so times change and we have to adapt to that."" 
We know the so-called ""farm to table"" movement -- the use of locally sourced foodstuffs -- has taken root here. But in our travels around the state, we still don’t see many farms. Is farming really growing as quickly as Chafee said? 
It seemed that it would be simple to find out. But a search for information took us on a frustrating odyssey through five state agencies and offices and two federal departments. 
We began with an e-mail to Christine Hunsinger, Chafee’s communications director, asking for  the governor’s backup. She cited U.S. Department of Agriculture data from 2007 -- the latest available -- that shows the number of farms in Rhode Island had increased from 858 to 1,219 between 2002 and 2007, a 42 percent increase. A farm is defined as ""any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold"" in a year. 
Impressive, yes. But just because the number of farms increased by that rate, it doesn’t mean that the overall economic impact of farming increased at the same rate. The report doesn’t say whether the new farms were substantial or only large gardens. And there are no comparisons with other sectors of the economy. 
We called the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, but a spokesman said the corporation had no statistics regarding the economic profile of farming. 
We also contacted the Division of Agriculture of the state Department of Environmental Management, where division chief Kenneth Ayars directed us to ""The Economic Impact Study of Plant-Based Industries and Agriculture in Rhode Island."" 
University of Rhode Island researchers estimated in the study that agriculture, which they defined to include plant crops and animal production as well as nurseries, greenhouses, floriculture and sod production, generated $170.6 million in gross sales in 2012. 
The study was motivated, in part, by critics’ contention that federal government statistics understate Rhode Island farming. But it was only a snapshot and didn’t tell whether agriculture is growing, shrinking or static. 
In a second e-mail, Hunsinger referred us to the U.S. Census for the same period as the USDA data, 2002-2007. Unlike the USDA, the Census compared farming to 18 other business sectors in Rhode Island as defined by the North American Industry Classification System. That is a standard used by federal statistical agencies to analyze the economy. 
The 42 percent increase in the number of farms did, indeed, place farming in the upper ranks of our economy -- if all you are counting are places that call themselves farms. During the period in question, only one sector, management businesses, grew its numbers by a larger percentage, from 120 to 175, or 45.8 percent, according to the U.S. Census. 
The worst was manufacturing, where the number of businesses shrank from 2,131 to 1,825, or minus 14.4 percent. 
Ultimately, we found the most timely data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks the nation’s economic output with the famous measure called the Gross Domestic Product, and also reports on each of the Gross State Products. 
According to its report, ""Regional Data; Real GDP by state,"" during the most recent five-year period available, from 2007 through 2011, Rhode Island’s gross product from crop and animal production fell from $27 million to $17 million, adjusted for inflation, or by 37 percent. The gross product is the total value of goods and services produced annually. 
If you define the industry more broadly, under the federal classification system, as ""agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting,"" the picture is still negative. It contracted during the period, from $74 million to $67 million. 
This was a time of economic stagnation in Rhode Island. And by this measure, contrary to Chafee’s impression, farming was withering, not growing. 
In fact, if you accept the federal figures, it was next to last among the 19 Rhode Island business sectors identified under the federal classification system. Only mining, which plummeted 52.9 percent, was worse. 
The leading sector was Information, including data processing and telecommunications, with 34.9 percent growth. 
  
Our ruling 
Governor Lincoln Chafee said that farming  is ""one of the fastest growing areas"" of the Rhode Island economy. 
Six-year-old figures cited by Chafee’s spokeswoman did show an increase in the number of farms in Rhode Island. But fresher and more relevant figures on Rhode Island from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that the economic value of farming has actually fallen in recent years. 
The judges rule Chafee’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809735D740>],/factchecks/2013/jul/18/lincoln-chafee/governor-lincoln-chafee-says-farming-one-fastest-g/
"['Crime', 'Florida', 'Tweets']","
A look at statistics on black-on-black murders
","The acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, has prompted commentary from the left and right about race and murder statistics. We saw this statistic repeated multiple times by conservatives on Twitter after the July 13 verdict: ""In the 513 days between Trayvon dying, and today’s verdict, 11,106 African-Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans."" We will leave it up to others to interpret the relevance of such statistics in the Zimmerman trial or other cases. Our role here as fact-checkers is to examine the numbers and their context.  A quick note on the case before we turn to the numbers: Hispanic is an ethnicity -- someone can be Hispanic and white, as in Zimmerman’s case -- or Hispanic and black. The crime data we reviewed generally focused on whites and blacks, though it sometimes included a generic ""other"" category. Martin, 17, was unarmed when he got into a scuffle with Zimmerman in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012. A jury acquitted Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer whose lawyer argued self-defense, of second-degree murder and manslaughter. (Read our fact-checks that relate to the case and Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law.) Statistic about blacks killed during course of Trayvon case We found the claim about murders on the conservative soopermexican blog; it appears to have originated there. His blog walks readers through the math on getting to 11,106 deaths in 513 days. (We counted 503 days, not 513, but that’s a tiny quibble.) The blogger, citing an earlier blog post and The Blaze, stated that there were 8,000 to 9,000 African-Americans killed each year -- 93 percent of them by African-Americans. The numbers came from a 2007 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which stated that blacks were victims of 7,999 homicides in 2005 and said that 93 percent were killed by people who shared their race. (It wasn’t clear to us where the blogger’s 9,000 figure came from.) Using the number 8,500, that translated to 21.65 blacks murdered each day by other blacks. So the blogger came up with a mathematical formula: 21.65 times 513 days=11,106. That 8,500 figure seems high, though, especially if we look at more recent figures. The FBI reported for 2011 that 6,329 black people were murdered, for example. The blog post makes it sound as if the black-on-black murder rate is particularly significant, but we found similar high percentages for whites. The report also stated that 85 percent of white victims in single-victim and single-offender homicides were murdered by someone of their race. So that means the majority of black and white people are murdered by someone of their own race. In 2005, there were 8,017 white homicide victims. (Editor's note, May 21, 2015: We have since collected statistics on additional years and published those findings in a more recent report.) The race victim/offender data isn’t shown for every case: It is only shown in the cases in which the race was known (some murders are never solved) and in cases involving a single victim and defendant. We sent a summary of our findings to the soopermexican blogger. ""I think your criticism of the number I arrived at has some merit,"" he wrote in an email. ""I should have made it more clear that is the best extrapolation from the numbers that are available. While the FBI stats don't include all known cases, I don't see why the cases where race stats are known shouldn't be representative of the entire class of murders. Yes, it's true that murder rates have come down generally, which I'm pretty sure applies to all race/ethnic classes."" As for white-on-white homicides also representing a high percentage, he said the point he was trying to make is that it’s wrong to suggest that ""white racism is killing blacks disproportionately."" What homicide-race stats show about our relationships So statistics show that most murders in which the race can be measured are intraracial. We wanted to know why. We interviewed Professor David M. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. ""Homicides overwhelmingly happen among people who know each other,"" he said. ""There are relatively few absolutely straight-up stranger homicides. Homicide is a phenomenon of social networks. ... Most peoples’ relationships are primarily with someone of their own race or ethnicity. As long as anybody has studied homicide, this has been the pattern."" (See the historical data.) Writer Jamelle Bouie in The Daily Beast wrote a response to conservatives who have been trying to shift the conversation to black-on-black crime while ignoring that the same shared racial identity holds true for white-on-white crime, too. Bouie wrote that what is missing from the conversation about crime is that ""it’s driven by opportunism and proximity; If African-Americans are more likely to be robbed, or injured, or killed by other African-Americans, it’s because they tend to live in the same neighborhoods as each other. Residential statistics bear this out (PDF); blacks are still more likely to live near each other or other minority groups than they are to whites. And of course, the reverse holds as well—whites are much more likely to live near other whites than they are to minorities and African-Americans in particular."" Our ruling In response to the Zimmerman case, social media repeated this claim: ""In the 513 days between Trayvon dying, and today’s verdict, 11,106 African-Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans."" Some who are citing this statistic are using it to portray race as an overemphasized point in the Zimmerman trial. We’re not evaluating that opinion; we’re fact-checking the math based on the available data. The number sounds extremely precise, but it's actually something of a rough guess based on back-of-the envelope math. No one actually knows how many African-Americans were murdered by other African-Americans in that time frame, and the numbers cited are actually an extrapolation of murder statistics for 2005. More current figures from 2011 show fewer deaths. So the specific numbers are not literally accurate. Also, this claim lacks important context. Yes, it’s true that the majority of black murder victims are murdered by blacks, but the same holds true for whites: Most whites are murdered by whites. And in both cases, this race statistic is not available for all murders, but only ones where the race of both perpetrator and victim can be determined. The claim contains an element of truth, but it's not fully accurate. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4C6500>],/factchecks/2013/jul/17/tweets/look-statistic-blacks-and-murder/

House Speaker John Boehner says rushed farm bill was nearly the same as old one
","
House Republicans rushed a new farm bill to a vote last week. But it wasn’t really all that new, Speaker John Boehner argued. 
Sure, it had been stripped of more than $700 billion in nutrition spending that Republicans wanted to consider separately. But the $200 billion package of farm measures that was left essentially matched what lawmakers had already considered, Boehner said at his weekly news conference July 11. 
It passed that day 216-208. Some unlikely bedfellows cried foul. 
A policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation called it a ""game of bait and switch"" with ""sneaky changes."" Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said at a Rules Committee hearing, ""There’s been no hearing on it. There’s been no debate on it."" Ferd Hoefner, a policy advocate for sustainable agriculture who’s followed every omnibus farm bill since 1977, told us the bill contained ""incredibly significant changes — historically unprecedented changes."" 
Even without expensive supplemental nutrition programs — what most of us call food stamps — the farm bill is a lengthy, complex set of programs that covers everything from subsidies for commodities such as dairy, wheat, corn and sugar to grants for weather radio transmitters to farm loan programs to watershed protection. 
Here’s what Boehner told reporters about the new, sleeker bill the day it reached the House: 
QUESTION: Mr. Speaker, why did you use an emergency rule to get the farm bill down on the floor? And doesn't this violate what you were just saying, that members should have time to read these bills? This is a 600-page bill that's now on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
BOEHNER: It is an unusual situation, not something I would prefer to do. But the bill that we've got on the floor is the same bill that was on the floor about three weeks ago, with the exception of one or two sentences. And so we're in a situation where our members know what the bill is, and I don't believe that it violates either the rule or the spirit of the rule. 
Was that bill really ""the same bill"" with the exception of a few sentences? 
Permanent law 
The ""one or two sentences"" that Boehner talked about were really a handful of key provisions, according to a taxpayer advocacy group. 
An odd quirk of farm legislation is that the ""permanent law"" underlying commodities programs — just one section of the bill — dates from 1938 and 1949. Lawmakers merely suspend that law, usually five years at a time, and replace it with language that works in the current decade. But the old permanent law lurks in the background, motivating lawmakers to pass new farm bills lest the nation face antiquated rules that could double the prices of milk or bread. 
In January, for example, before lawmakers approved a nine-month extension of the most recent law, there was talk of a ""dairy cliff."" 
Folks disagree about the value of such a motivational tool — and even whether any administration would actually enforce Depression-era laws if Congress failed to pass new ones. 
Some lawmakers and policy advocates want to get rid of the risk altogether. 
So here’s the major difference — other than nutrition programs — between the farm bill that House lawmakers rejected in June and the one they passed on July 11: The new bill repeals the 1938 and 1949 laws and removes five-year expiration dates on commodity programs such as crop subsidies. 
The new permanent law, then, would be from 2013. 
Did the bill do that in just ""one or two sentences""? No. In the new bill, Section 1602, rather than suspend old law for five years, repeals it. That’s different language that replaces 16 lines in the bill with 11 lines. Other sections also got tweaks to eliminate expiration dates, including at least four sentences in provisions about sugar subsidies. 
""Making these new programs permanent, instead of having them sunset in five years, is a meaningful (and lamentable) difference between the two bills,"" said Sallie James, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It will make reform of these programs more difficult, for sure."" 
Hoefner, of the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, also noted the significance of the shift: ""And all just dropped into the bill by Rules Committee at instruction of leadership, with no hearings and no action by the Agriculture Committee. In fact, it is hard to imagine the Agriculture Committee ever being able to get agreement to pass such changes."" 
Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck described them to us as ""a handful of widely known changes."" 
But it’s not clear that’s the case. 
Agriculture Committee chairman Frank Lucas, R-Okla., did refer to a ""change in the status of permanent law"" as he explained the new bill to first to the Rules Committee, then House lawmakers. 
He told the Rules Committee, which agreed after 10 p.m. on July 10 to rush the bill to the House floor under emergency rules, that he requested language ""to replace the '49 law in the draft, which is permanent, by making the 2013 law permanent."" 
Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., protested on the spot. ""This is not the same bill. … This repeals, basically, the 1949 act, and you know, I don't think anybody has any idea what that means. There's been no hearing on it. There's been no debate on it. We're just trying to wing it as we go along here."" 
The next day, on the House floor, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., stood to say, ""The Rules Committee met last night and is sending us a rule today that has attached to it a bill that we have not seen and have not been able to read."" 
Joshua Sewell, a senior policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending, told PolitiFact it was clear enough that the new bill repealed the old laws. 
What wasn’t so clear was that it also got rid of expiration dates on some new programs — which, whether the 1930s and '40s law stayed in place or not, could have been up for renewal every five years. 
Those expiration dates gave lawmakers — and critics of farm bill spending — opportunities to adapt and rein in pricey subsidy programs. 
""Leadership just focused on the repeal part. They didn't talk about replace,"" Sewell said. 
And that shift went far beyond ""one or two sentences,"" other critics argued. 
""The tone of the bill is changed remarkably by the exclusion of those end dates, and so substantively it is quite a different animal,"" James of the Cato Institute said. 
Our ruling 
Boehner said, ""This is the same bill we voted on a few weeks ago, with the exception of one or two sentences."" He’s off on the numbers: interest groups identified several changes to the bill, including an entire section. 
But more to the point, he downplayed the substance of those changes, which not only repealed old law but made new programs permanent — which some Democratic lawmakers and a range of policy groups argued was a serious difference that called for open debate. 
It’s true changes didn’t affect many sentences in the 600-page bill. But that obscures a different reality, in which those sentences had a significant impact on the legislation. We rate Boehner’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C02A440>],/factchecks/2013/jul/17/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-says-rushed-farm-bill-w/

Austin legislator calls Austin largest U.S. city without congressional district anchored in it
","
During Texas House action, two Travis County Democrats discussed whether Austin is weird in a politically unique way.

From the House floor’s back mic on June 20, 2013, Rep. Elliott Naishtat asked fellow Austin Rep. Eddie Rodriguez: ""Did you know that Austin is the only major Texas city and the largest city in America without a congressional district anchored in it?""

Rodriguez replied from the front of the chamber: ""Sadly, I am aware of that fact. Austin is now the 11th largest city in America and yet we don’t have a congressional district that’s based here, anchored here in Austin.""

That so?

Austin's six districts 
We’ve analyzed Austin’s congressional districts before. In July 2012, we rated as Mostly True a Seguin resident’s claim that no like-sized or smaller city than Austin has as many congressional representatives. Austin and Fort Worth were somewhat similarly divided up in the map of Texas congressional districts imposed by federal judges, we concluded, though Austin was arguably socked harder because its voters wouldn’t necessarily determine victors in any of its districts.

And does that also mean Austin lacks an ""anchor"" district, as Naishtat said?

Six U.S. House districts take in at least a portion of the city under the interim plan imposed for the 2012 elections by a panel of federal judges. The court-imposed Austin-area districts align with how the districts were drawn by the Republican-led 2011 Legislature.

As far as Austin by itself goes, two of the congressional districts each took in 24 percent of city residents at the time the map was finalized, another drew in 22 percent of city residents, the fourth had 19 percent of the population and the remaining two districts each had less than 8 percent of Austin residents, .

And Austin residents don't dominate any of them, according to information posted online by the Texas Legislative Council in February 2012. 
By our calculation, some 27 percent of residents in both the 10th and 35th districts hail from Austin. That share of residents might be seen as signaling a little pull, but it’s also not close to a majority. Notably, too, the eastward-stretching 10th District, represented by Michael McCaul, R-Austin, is home to more Harris County than Travis County residents, while the southward-running 35th district, held by Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, encompasses more Bexar County than Travis County residents.

Each other district taking in part of the capital has a smaller share of Austin residents. About 25 percent of residents of the 21st district, extending south into San Antonio and represented by Alamo City Republican Lamar Smith, hail from Austin. Austinites make up 22 percent of the 25th district, running west and north nearly to Fort Worth; Republican Roger Williams, a Fort Worth-area businessman, moved to Austin before winning the seat in 2012. Less than 10 percent of residents of the north-running 17th and 31st districts, held by Republicans Bill Flores and John Carter, respectively, live in Austin.

What's an anchor? 
We asked two redistricting experts how to define an anchor district.

Austin lawyer Steve Bickerstaff had already aired his impression of how Austin and surrounding Travis County came out when the Republican-majority Legislature was drawing congressional districts, a task that comes around after each decennial U.S. census.

In a March 24, 2012, commentary published in the Austin American-Statesman, Bickerstaff said the legislatively-initiated splitting of Travis County among several districts was ""clearly intended to dilute, not enhance, the effect of the county's voters (especially Democrats)... These objectives are not surprising for a Republican-controlled Legislature, because Travis County is the only major Texas county in which a majority of non-Hispanic white people continue to vote consistently for Democratic candidates.""

But what about ""anchor"" districts?

By email, Bickerstaff told us that in his experience, an ""election district is ‘anchored’ in a jurisdiction in the purest sense if the district is wholly contained within the jurisdiction.""

For instance, Bickerstaff said, the Texas Constitution requires Texas House districts to be located entirely within a county, with a few specific exceptions. The next question can become, then, whether a district within a county is anchored in a particular city or neighborhood, he said.

But Bickerstaff said an election district may be called ""anchored"" in a jurisdiction (such as a county, city or neighborhood) even if it contains more than one jurisdiction if the voters of the singled-out jurisdiction constitute at least a majority of the district’s voters. ""The bigger the majority, the more secure the anchor,"" he said.

In a reminder that most everything connected to redistricting law has a wiggle or three, Bickerstaff added that one may also define the relevant majority based on a district’s voting-age population, which would be a bigger group than registered voters alone. Also, he said, one could define a majority in terms of a district’s total population or even accept less than a majority to define an anchor when the singled-out jurisdiction ""clearly has the largest plurality of voters or population in the district (and usually votes as a bloc).""

Broadly, Bickerstaff wrote, the ""key concept is that the voters of an anchor jurisdiction have the potential ability to elect the person of their choice without much, if any, regard to the vote of any other jurisdictions in the election district. Of course, the ultimate outcome of elections is more complicated. It is possible that even when a jurisdiction has a majority, or nearly so, of a district, the elected candidate may come from outside the jurisdiction especially if the voters in a smaller jurisdiction vote overwhelmingly for one candidate and the voters in the larger or anchor jurisdiction split more evenly.""

As an example, he said, the 2012 election of Doggett, long from Austin, despite the fact that Travis County residents do not account for most district residents. 
By email, Dallas lawyer Michael Li said he is unaware of a precise definition of an anchor district, but ""in general, a district's anchor has the ability to control or substantially influence the outcome of elections because it contains the majority or a substantial  plurality of the district's population.""

So, by the measure that we found accessible--raw population--Austin lacks an anchor district. 
But is that status unique among cities of like size or bigger? 
More populous cities 
Shortly before Naishtat made his claim, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked Austin as the nation’s 11th-most-populous city. A May 23, 2013, bureau press release had a link to a chart showing Austin with nearly 842,600 residents as of July 2012. More populous cities, the bureau said, were New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, Dallas and, in California, San Diego and San Jose.

Naishtat’s office emailed us a chart, attributed to Nate Walker, Rodriguez’s chief of staff, indicating that each of the more populous cities had at least one anchor district.

It was hard for us to decipher, so we checked on anchor districts in each of the larger cities with help from David Wasserman, U.S. House editor for the Cook Political Report, who told us by phone that he would define an anchor district as one in which more than half its residents live in the city.

By that gauge, he said, each of the cities larger than Austin has at least one anchor district, while Austin does not.

Specifically, Wasserman said, New York has more than a dozen House districts, Los Angeles has several and Chicago residents comprise most of the population in three districts. In Texas, he noted, Houston residents account for most of the 18th and 29th congressional districts and Dallasites largely comprise the 30th district; San Antonio residents anchor the state’s 20th district. Philadelphians account for most residents of Pennsylvania’s 1st and 2nd districts, Wasserman said, while Arizona’s 4th Congressional District is in Phoenix. In California, he said, the 52nd district draws largely on San Diego residents and most of San Jose is in the 19th district. 
Checking for ourselves 
  
Next, we looked at maps and other materials posted online by government agencies and U.S. House members, which suggested: 
  
Multiple districts within or largely within New York, Los Angeles and Chicago; 
Residents of Houston comprise more than half the population of the 7th (53 percent Houstonians); 29th (55 percent); 18th (62 percent); and 9th (74 percent) districts, according to information posted online by the Texas Legislative Council, while Dallas indeed has one anchor district, the 30th, in which six of every 10 residents live in the city; 
Pennsylvania’s 2nd Congressional District consists almost completely of Philadelphians, according to Maisha Leek, chief of staff for Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Philadelphia. And Arizona’s 7th Congressional District is largely comprised of Phoenix residents. Maura Saavedra Cordova, press secretary to Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Phoenix, told us by telephone that according to the 2010 U.S. census, nearly 595,000 of the district’s 710,224 residents--84 percent--lived in Phoenix. 
California’s 52nd Congressional District consists of nearly the entire city of San Diego, according to the August 2011, final report of California's Citizens Redistricting Commission, which drew boundaries: ""The district is highly urbanized with regional parks, lakes, and open-space preserves and is the central social and economic hub of San Diego County""; 
Our ruling 
Naishtat said Austin is the ""largest city in America without a congressional district anchored in it."" 
Austin has portions of six districts and Austinites don’t come close to comprising the majority of residents in any of them. In contrast, the nation’s 10 more populous cities have at least one such district.
