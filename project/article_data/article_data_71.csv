Amid Rachel Dolezal controvery, pundit claims blacks were jailed for trying to 'pass' as white
","White or black? By now, most of you have probably heard about the controversy surrounding former NAACP leader Rachel Dolezal, who self-identifies as black but has white parents. Dolezal’s ""passing"" for black unleashed criticism that Dolezal used her racial identity as it suited her, a tool for progressing her own goals. One CNN article reported that some people felt that Dolezal had ""diminished the real struggles of African-Americans by claiming she had suffered hurtful racism like them."" Count Michael Skolnik, Russell Simmons’ political director and the president of GlobalGrind.com, among that group. Dolezal ""took the space of a black woman, who could have been a leader of (the NAACP). ... Black people in this country don’t have that convenience,"" Skolnik said in a June 16 interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""In fact, for most black people in the history of this country who passed, it was illegal to pass as a white person. You were actually put in jail if you tried to pass. For black people, passing was about survival, it wasn’t about acceptance."" Leaving aside the question of Dolezal’s actions, PunditFact was struck by Skolnik’s statement that ""it was illegal to pass as a white person (and) you were actually put in jail if you tried to pass."" Was it illegal to pass as a white person? And was jail the consequence? The short answer is that experts say there were never laws explicity saying African-Americans could not pass a white person. But if discovered, those people passing as white would be subject to laws on the books for African-Americans, many of which could include jail time. Passing as white First, we have to address the question of what it meant to be black in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. In his book Who is Black? One Nation’s Definition, author F. James Davis stated that ""the nation's answer to the question 'Who is black?"" has long been that a black is any person with any known African black ancestry … In the South it became known as the ‘one-drop rule,’ meaning that a single drop of ‘black blood’ makes a person a black."" Using this rule, a person who identified as white could be accused of being black if any information or documents surfaced claiming that he or she had a black ancestor. Virginia's Bureau of Vital Statistics registrar Walter Plecker, for instance, became infamous in Virginia during the 20th century for using birth and death certificates, data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Confederate War Department, as well as other sources to determine who had any ""colored"" blood. Because of this, fair-skinned individuals who could pass for white would be legally identified as black. Skolnik told us he was referring specifically to slave times. ""If a slave tried to pass for white and was caught, they were oftentimes jailed and sent back to their slave masters,"" Skolnik said. That’s true, though not because they passed as white, but because they were declared someone else's property. Under the Fugitive Slave Acts in place until the Civil War, citizens and local governments were under the obligation to capture and return slaves to their owners. Failure to do so would result in penalties. Jail and other consequences After the Civil War came the rise of black codes and Jim Crow laws. While these laws were designed to create different sets of rules for blacks and whites on everything from marriage to education to the use of public facilities, they didn't target blacks specifically for passing as white. Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham is a Harvard University professor of history and African American studies.  ""I don’t believe that passing itself, although it remained the focus of numerous court cases, ended generally in imprisonment unless attached to another illegal practice, such as interracial marriage, theft, etc.,"" Higginbotham said. ""The consequences of being exposed were usually being put out of a school, losing one’s job, sued for divorce, denied access to public accommodations, and disgraced in one’s former social circles."" Martha S. Jones, associate chair of the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan, agreed. ""The consequences for attempting to ‘pass’ were that one might be denied a license to marry, or … one might be denied entry into the United States or naturalization as a citizen if discovered to be passing,"" Jones said. In Florida, for example, it was illegal for a black man or woman to cohabitate with a white man or woman, and the punishment included up to one year in prison. But the crime wasn't passing as white. Elizabeth Smith-Pryor, a history professor at Kent State University, explained one such case for us. Under Alabama law, people could be imprisoned if found to be married to someone of the other race. In 1935, in the case of Keith vs. Commonwealth, Keith was accused of having a black ancestor -- and therefore being black -- making his marriage to a white woman illegal. The court ultimately ruled there was not enough evidence to convict.  Our ruling Skolnik said that ""for most black people in the history of this country who passed, it was illegal to pass as a white person. You were actually put in jail if you tried to pass."" Skolnik said he was referring to the Fugitive Slave Acts, which could result in prison time for runaway slaves until they were returned to their owner. But those acts had nothing to do with passing as white, as slaves were considered property.  Post-Civil War Jim Crow laws did not include passing as white as a crime that could send someone to jail. However, blacks exposed as passing as white would be treated like other blacks under the law. And that, depending on the crime, could result in imprisonment.  Skolnik’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771C3C0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/18/michael-skolnik/amid-rachel-dolezal-controvery-pundit-claims-black/

Donald Trump says 'our nuclear arsenal doesn't work'
","Donald Trump’s presidential announcement speech touched on topics ranging from the economy and trade to foreign policy and the military. One of the criticisms Trump aimed at the Obama White House during his speech was for its handling of the nation’s nuclear arsenal. ""Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker,"" Trump said on June 16, 2015. ""Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. … Boy, does that send signals to (Russian president Vladimir) Putin"" that ""they don't know what they're doing."" We wondered how much truth there was to his claim, so we took a closer look. We found two distinct problems with what he said. (Trump's campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article.) Trump conflates two separate issues -- personnel and equipment In recent years, there has been significant attention given to a series of problems within the military command structure charged with handling nuclear material. In August 2007, a B-52 bomber was carrying 12 soon-to-be-retired cruise missiles. They were all supposed to be fitted with dummy warheads, but six of the missiles were discovered to be carrying actual warheads -- something that could have proven disastrous. Then, in 2013 and 2014, the Air Force gave low inspection scores to intercontinental ballistic missile crews at Minot Air Force Base and Malmstrom Air Force Base. Also in 2013, two high-ranking officials with key positions in the nuclear chain of command -- Vice Adm. Timothy Giardina and Maj. Gen. Michael Carey -- were disciplined. Giardina was suspended after an investigation into the use of counterfeit gambling chips, while Carey was reassigned after an investigation into ""personal misbehavior."" Finally, in 2014, officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base were implicated in a drug investigation, which in turn led to the discovery that 34 officers may have cheated on proficiency exams. These were widely considered to be serious issues, and they have spawned a number of official oversight actions. But the lapses do not involve ""equipment"" malfunctions, as Trump put it. Rather, they are problems in command and control -- and while significant, they don’t suggest that the nation’s entire arsenal ""doesn't work,"" experts say. ""The Air Force nuclear enterprise has been bedeviled recently by troubling lapses and poor morale, which led to two major reviews of the Pentagon nuclear mission,"" said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association. ""But this is a far cry from saying, ‘Our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.’ "" A well-funded modernization program is under way Some aspects of the nuclear program are indeed old. The youngest nuclear-armed B-52 bombers, for instance, are roughly 50 years old. While much of this aging equipment is perfectly operational, some nuclear-weapons components, such as warheads, do deteriorate with age. Still, that doesn’t mean the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile ""doesn’t work,"" experts said. For starters, the Pentagon and the Energy Department -- which share different responsibilities for nuclear weapons -- are required by law to certify the safety, security, and effectiveness of the arsenal on an annual basis. ""Over and over, the nuclear weapons laboratories, the Air Force, the Navy, and the Secretary of Defense have certified that the nuclear arsenal does work,"" said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. These reviews, Reif said, are sufficiently thorough to give comfort to policymakers. ""No U.S. military commander would trade the U.S. nuclear arsenal for Russia’s,"" he said. In addition, the United States is engaged in a multi-year program to modernize the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the rebuilding of the Minuteman III system, which launches intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the Trident II submarine-launched missile systems, as well as the refurbishment of nuclear warheads and construction of new and upgraded facilities, such as a uranium processing facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. ""While we haven’t deployed major new strategic systems in some time, we’ve been modernizing the ones we’ve got more or less continuously,"" Bunn said. This modernization effort will cost roughly $35 billion a year during the next decade, or 5 percent to 6 percent of planned national-defense spending, according to Congressional Budget Office reports released in December 2013 and January 2015. Cumulatively, the bill could reach $1 trillion over the next 30 years. ""This is a planned investment unrivaled by any other nuclear power,"" Reif said. Ultimately, Bunn said, it’s reasonable to have concerns about certain issues, ""from fixing up aging crew silos in the ICBM force, to recruiting, retaining, and motivating the right people to operate U.S. nuclear forces, to the enormous cost of replacing the aging U.S. nuclear force."" But he added that Trump is ""totally wrong -- and irresponsible, if our adversaries believed him -- in saying ‘our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.’ "" Our ruling Trump said that ""even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked."" There have been a number of high-profile lapses in the management of the country’s nuclear stockpile in recent years, but those problems have to do with personnel and training. They’re not an indication that the weapons themselves ""don’t work"" -- which, if it were true, would be a significant problem for the nation’s strategic military position in the world. In reality, the United States has been spending $35 billion a year to upgrade its nuclear stockpile, and officials tasked with certifying the safety and reliability of the current arsenal have consistently given their seal of approval. We rate Trump’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809670C540>],/factchecks/2015/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-our-nuclear-arsenal-doesnt-work/
"['History', 'PunditFact', 'Breitbart']","
No, a pear was not the original symbol of California
","Did the conservative website Breitbart get snagged by a hoax? It sure looks that way. Breitbart’s man in California, senior editor Joel Pollak, posted a short item on June 14, 2015, about a Los Angeles Times op-ed that cast the state flag as the legacy of thieves, deserters and genocidal maniacs. We’ll skip the history lesson, but the bottom line of the op-ed was that the flag and its picture of a grizzly bear should be given the heave-ho. Pollak observed that ardent liberals have shown the bear some love, but what caught our eye was his closing line. ""According to snopes.com, the inclusion of a bear in the flag was a mistake; it was supposed to be a pear."" Soon after the article went live, a few readers commented that Breitbart had been snookered. The Snopes article, they said, was a ruse. The item Pollak cited held that the original founders of the California Republic wanted to use a pear as the central image on their new flag, but through a typo or bad penmanship, the first mock-up used a bear instead. The website provided its rendition of the initial concept.  The Snopes article laid in some heavy hints that it was hokum. For starters, it listed the California rebel leaders as ""Captain Jebediah Bartlett and his two lieutenants, Albert Bosc and Emmanuel d'Anjou."" Snopes, the grand-daddy of the fact-checking sites in America, was founded in the 1990s to counteract the spread of rumors on the Web. This raises the question, why did it post a hoax of its own? Snopes' founders say it is to combat what they call False Authority Syndrome. ""No single truth purveyor, no matter how reliable, should be considered an infallible font of accurate information,"" they wrote. ""Folks make mistakes. Or they get duped. Or they have a bad day at the fact-checking bureau. Or some days they're just being silly."" That message is on a page on their site, with the link posted at the bottom of the article about the California flag. To keep their own readers on their toes, Snopes seeded its website with a few ringers. It has written that Mr. Ed the talking horse was actually a zebra, that passengers on the Titanic watched a silent version of The Poseidon Adventure as their own ship went down, and that mobile homes were named after the city that first built them. Co-founder David Mikkelson told us that team Snopes put a lot of effort into making these articles as ridiculous and humorous as possible. The California pear item, posted around 2003, was one of the last to go up, and there are no plans to add more. ""Given the plethora of fake news sites on the Web these days, our creating more stories to illustrate the pitfalls of false authority would seem awfully redundant,"" Mikkelson said. The pear story has been snagging the unwary since at least 2005. According to this blog post, the Long Beach Press Telegram repeated the tale in February that year. The blogger who reported that also wrote that he went to the trouble to research Captain Bartlett and Lieutenants Bosc and d’Anjou. After, dare we say, a fruitless effort, he ultimately found the link to the disclaimer on Snopes. Via Twitter, we asked Pollak at Breitbart about the pear reference.  ""Reported, at end, that @snopes said it,"" Pollack replied. ""You’re ‘fact-checking’ me instead of @snopes? You need to put away the Fruit Loops."" Here, we’re actually fact-checking the claim that Snopes in any way took the pear fable seriously. Pollak isn’t the first to pass along this hoax, nor likely will he be the last. But know this: It’s wrong. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3CCCC0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/18/breitbart/no-pear-was-not-original-symbol-california/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Income', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says income inequality is widest since the 1920s
","Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the 2016 Democratic nomination has focused on the gap between rich and poor. Sanders recently tweeted that the income inequality is wider than it’s been in a long time -- a very long time.   ""The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s,"" Sanders tweeted from his @BernieSanders account on June 4, 2015, after his first campaign trip to Iowa.   But is the inequality gap really that big?   Intriguingly, Sanders’ tweet mirrors a statement made by someone on the far opposite end of the political spectrum: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In January, PolitiFact Texas fact-checked a claim by Cruz that ""today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928.""   For that fact-check, a Cruz spokesman directed us to a report done by the Pew Research Center citing research from Emmanuel Saez, a University of California-Berkeley economics professor who studies wealth and income inequality. The report showed a database compiled by Pew that included the distribution of top incomes for more than 20 countries. The data compiled showed that 1928 and 2012 were the two years where the top 1 percent of the richest Americans earned the greatest share of the nation’s income.   Here’s the chart, which lists, in descending order, the top 15 years the richest American taxpayers had the greatest share of U.S. income : Year Top 1% income share 1928 19.6 2012 19.34 1927 18.68 1916 18.57 1929 18.42 2007 18.33 1914 18.16 2006 18.06 1926 18.01 1913 17.96 2008 17.89 2005 17.68 1936 17.64 1917 17.6 1925 17.6 In other words, in 1928, the top 1 percent of taxpayers collectively held 19.6 percent of the nation’s income. In 2012, the top 1 percent held 19.34 percent of the nation’s income.   So a recent year -- 2012 -- did rank second to 1928 on the list of biggest years for income inequality. But we’ll note two reasons for caution.   First, other recent years did not rank as high on this list. While the years 2005 through 2008 ranked in the top 15, the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 did not. The Wall Street meltdown in 2008, which reduced incomes at the top of the spectrum as well as the bottom, may be a reason why. But this fact does offer some doubt about whether the 2012 result was more than a blip.   Tax hikes that took effect in 2013 may have led taxpayers to time their liquidation of certain assets to avoid higher tax rates, said Saez, who with Thomas Piketty and others developed the underlying research. That suggests that 2012 could be an unusually high year, and experts say the increased taxation after 2013 could reduce how much of the nation’s income is held by the top 1 percent.   The second caveat is that the method Saez used doesn’t fully account for all of the income sources that flow to those in the bottom 99 percent.   The data used in his study looks at pre-tax, private income but doesn’t account for other sources of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans.   Accounting for those factors in the calculation could produce a narrower income gap, although a full-blown study going back to the 1920s would be required to see whether the Saez method has produced an abnormal result. (Read the PolitiFact Texas fact-check for more detail.)   Our ruling   Sanders said, ""The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s."" One commonly used method supports that argument -- at least for one recent year, 2012. However, it’s worth noting that this method tends to widen income differences more than other approaches do. On balance, we rate Sanders’ statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC9A00>],/factchecks/2015/jun/18/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-income-inequality-widest-1920s/

Jeb Bush says Hillary Clinton said 'progressive agenda' means religious beliefs 'have to be changed'
","As he tries to appeal to religious conservatives, Jeb Bush has portrayed Hillary Clinton as the enemy of those who believe in religious freedom. ""These have been rough years for religious charities and their right of conscience, and the leading Democratic candidate hinted of more to come,"" Bush said during his announcement speech at Miami Dade College on June 15. ""Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs ‘have to be changed.’ That is what she said. That is what she said. And I guess we should at least thank her for the warning."" So is that what she actually said about the need for religious beliefs to change? We looked at when and where she made her comments, and found Bush is taking her words out of context.   Clinton’s Women in the World speech A spokesman for Bush confirmed that he was referring to a comment Clinton made during her speech at the Women in the World Summit in New York City on April 23. (And he’s attacked her speech previously.) In the section Bush referred to, Clinton raised concerns about lack of access to education for girls, the rate of maternal mortality and domestic violence, and reproductive health care. It’s in that context she made the claim about religion: ""Yes, we’ve nearly closed the global gender gap in primary school, but secondary school remains out of reach for so many girls around the world. Yes, we’ve increased the number of countries prohibiting domestic violence, but still more than half the nations in the world have no such laws on the books, and an estimated one in three women still experience violence. Yes, we’ve cut the maternal mortality rate in half, but far too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth. All the laws we’ve passed don’t count for much if they’re not enforced.  Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper.  Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will.  And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed. As I have said and as I believe, the advancement of the full participation of women and girls at every aspect of their societies is the great unfinished business of the 21st century, and not just for women but for everyone — and not just in far away countries but right here in the United States."" Bush’s campaign referred to news articles about her speech including one in New York magazine which stated ""the speech had other double meanings that show fiery rhetoric geared toward a group of mostly progressive women."" The headlines from conservative media that we found such as Fox News focused on abortion: ""Hillary: ‘Religious beliefs’ must change for sake of abortion."" Clinton, who is a supporter of abortion rights, didn’t use the word abortion, but she did mention ""reproductive health care,"" which can include abortion as well as birth control or prenatal health care. But her statement is somewhat different from Bush’s claim. She didn’t say that a ""progressive agenda"" should dictate religious beliefs -- her overall point was that countries need to do more to help protect women’s rights to education, health care, and to live safely -- and that to do so requires enforcing laws and changing religious beliefs. Clinton’s speech didn’t only pertain to far flung countries -- she was making a statement to religious conservatives in the United States. ""America moves forward when all women are guaranteed the right to make their own health care choices, not when those choices are taken away by an employer like Hobby Lobby,"" she said. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that certain companies with religious objections can opt out of a mandate under the Affordable Care Act to provide free contraception to their employees. ""One would like to imagine that Clinton was speaking only about primitive cultures where children are forced into marriage and childbearing, or where genital cutting is common,"" wrote Kathleen Parker, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post. ""But we know that she also meant religious conservatives closer to home whose beliefs get in the way. She explicitly criticized Hobby Lobby for not paying for its employees’ contraception."" Clinton’s spokesman told PolitiFact that Bush took her remarks out of context. ""Hillary Clinton was talking about atrocities and horrible practices around the world that are carried out against women and girls in the name of deep-seated cultural codes and religious beliefs,"" Josh Schwerin said. ""If any candidate thinks rape, child marriage and genital mutilation -- done in the name of deeply held religious beliefs -- should be allowed to continue, they should say so directly and not try to make it into a false political attack."" Our ruling Bush said, ""Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs ‘have to be changed.’ "" During a speech about women’s rights worldwide in April, Clinton talked about the rates of maternal mortality, domestic violence, lack of access to education and ""reproductive health care."" She said that laws must be enforced to protect those rights ""and deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed."" So the only area where she says beliefs must change that has any possible connection to domestic issues is in the reference to the overall category of reproductive health. Bush is making Clinton’s remarks sound far more sweeping than they actually are. Clinton was talking about specific issues affecting women’s health and safety, in both a global and domestic context.  We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970170C0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/17/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-hillary-clinton-said-progressive-age/
"['Taxes', 'PunditFact', 'Ron  Christie']","
GOP strategist Christie: Tax revenues rose after Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003
","Bill Maher, the bawdy and generally liberal HBO comedian, recently wondered aloud why the current roster of Republican presidential hopefuls has been selective in their criticism of the last Republican president. ""I noticed that the Republicans have not been shy about throwing George W. Bush under the bus on Iraq,"" Maher said. ""They're all saying the Iraq War was a big mistake now, but none of them say the Bush tax cuts were a big mistake."" Maher targeted one of his guests, Republican strategist Ron Christie. ""Were the tax cuts a good idea?"" Maher asked. Christie, a former special assistant to Bush and deputy assistant to Vice President Dick Cheney, said they were. ""If you look at the revenue that came in after the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax rate cuts, yes, there was more money coming into the treasury,"" Christie said. ""That’s a fact."" A reader questioned whether that really is a fact. Christie’s source of information Christie filled in some of the numbers for PunditFact that he left out on television. ""Total revenue climbed from $793.7 billion in 2003 to $1.16 trillion in 2007,"" Christie said. ""A 47 percent increase."" Christie directed us to an article in Forbes that had exactly those amounts. Those figures differ widely from numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, though the bottom line is about the same. CBO says federal government revenues rose from $1.782 trillion in 2003 to $2.568 trillion in 2007 (using fiscal years). That’s a 44 percent increase. Case closed? Not really. What we found is Christie is carefully picking his starting and end points to make the most dramatic comparison. Changing the timeframe makes all the difference, as we’ll show you. Including the 2001 tax cuts While Christie touted the 2001 tax cuts, he didn’t include federal revenues collected for either 2001 or 2002. If he had, the trend line would not be as clean as the picture he painted. The Tax Policy Center, a joint project of two academic centers the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, summarized the CBO numbers. This chart based on the center’s table shows revenues initially falling, not rising. Reasonable people can use different years as a starting  point for comparison. Bush didn’t take office until early 2001 and the tax cuts didn’t take full effect until the start of 2002. Plus, economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California-Berkeley reminded us that there was a recession between March 2001 and November 2001. ""The effects of the recession on revenue are likely to swamp any effects of tax policy,"" Auerbach said. Economist William Gale at the Tax Policy Center said for those reasons, 2000 could be a fair benchmark, untouched by both recession and tax cuts. Doing so presents a very different picture. In short, federal revenues were below 2000 levels (after adjusting for inflation) until 2006. They outpaced fiscal year 2000 collections for a bit, then fell again in 2008. The same pattern roughly holds if you use 2001 as the starting point. What’s that all mean? When you adjust for inflation, the 47 percent revenue growth from 2003 to 2007 becomes 28 percent. And if you start the clock in 2001, revenue growth drops to 4 percent. By 2009, of course, the numbers look even worse. Here’s another way to look at it, using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Over Bush’s two full terms, federal revenues dropped 13 percent. Accounting for economic growth Not adjusting for inflation and cherry-picking the time period are two problems in Christie’s calculation. So is not factoring in a rising population (more people, means more taxpayers, more goods and services sold, etc.). Economists such as Gale say a better way to put federal revenues into context is by comparing them to the Gross Domestic Product. Through that lens, federal revenues as a share of the economy fell and never reached their 2001 level through Bush’s two terms. FY Percent of GDP 2000 20 2001 18.8 2002 17 2003 15.7 2004 15.6 2005 16.7 2006 17.6 2007 17.9 2008 17.1 2009 14.6 Source: Tax Policy Center/CBO Our ruling Christie said that government revenues increased after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Christie is cherry-picking his start and end dates and making flawed calculations to support his point. Data shows, and experts agree, that a complete picture of the Bush tax cuts shows that revenues initially went down, then up, then down again. Measured against the size of the economy, federal revenues at the end of Bush’s term were smaller than when he took office. Christie’s statement has some superficial accuracy but a more complete picture shows that he has omitted many details that would lead to a different conclusion.

Donald Trump: Chevrolet in Tokyo, Japan, 'doesn't exist'
","Bombastic billionaire and new GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump painted the United States as an international embarrassment these days, losing on everything from jobs to car sales to other countries. ""When did we beat Japan at anything?"" Trump said in announcing his candidacy June 16, 2015. ""They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time."" We couldn’t travel to Tokyo for this fact-check, but we did hear from Chevy and other sources to shed light on whether it’s really true that Chevy ""doesn’t exist"" in Tokyo. Literally, it’s not true. Chevy sells cars in Japan in four models: Sonic, Captiva, Camaro and Corvette. (Here's a screenshot of www.ChevroletJapan.com):  But Trump, in what we might describe as his Trumped-up speaking style, has a point in that Chevy’s Japanese sales are a big struggle story. In 2014, Chevrolet sold 597 cars in Japan. No, we are not forgetting any zeroes at the end of that figure. ""To be sure, if you visit Tokyo, chances are you won’t see a single American brand car during your entire stay,"" said Hans Greimel, the Asia editor of Automotive News who has documented GM’s troubles in Japan. ""They are incredibly rare here because their reputation is bad, and their sales are so low."" Still, GM-owned Chevys and Cadillacs, plus Fords and Jeeps, are all actively sold, Greimel said. Import sales data show Chevrolet sold 367 vehicles in the first five months of 2015. Cadillac sold 358, Ford sold almost 2,000, and Jeep sold 2,756. Japanese automakers  — Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Daihatsu, Subaru, Mitsubishi  — accounted for 92 percent of the 5.45 million vehicles sold in Japan in 2014, according to financial research group IHS Automotive.

GM sells two Chevy cars with right-hand drive in Japan, Greimel reported, but not in Cadillac. GM spokesman Jim Cain calls GM’s strategy in Asia ""a question of priorities."" The Japanese market is tough for non-domestic manufacturers to crack. ""We’re concentrating on markets and segments where we can be a successful and profitable growing enterprise,"" Cain said, ""and the reality is that the barriers to entry in Japan are very high for foreign automakers.""

Hillary Clinton’s changing position on same-sex marriage
","On the day that the U.S. Supreme Court was poised to hear oral arguments about same-sex marriage April 28, Hillary Clinton changed her ""H"" logo to rainbow-colored and tweeted: ""Every loving couple & family deserves to be recognized & treated equally under the law across our nation. #LoveMustWin #LoveCantWait."" Clinton came out in support of same-sex marriage in 2013 after more than a decade of opposing it. But her views are particularly in the spotlight now that she is a presidential candidate. We decided to put Clinton’s statements about same-sex marriage on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether a candidate has changed their views without making a value judgment about such flips. We found that as public opinion shifted toward support for same-sex marriage, so did Clinton. She has had plenty of company among members of her own party to change their stance on same-sex marriage. In 2012, we gave Obama a Full Flop when he announced his support for same-sex marriage. Currently about three dozen states allow same-sex marriage. The outcome of the decision, expected in June, could mean either that same-sex marriage will become legal in all states or that some states will institute new bans on same-sex marriage. (A spokesman for Clinton’s campaign declined to comment for this Flip-O-Meter item.) Clinton’s statements during her 2000 Senate race In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined federal marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Hillary Clinton would face questions about same-sex marriage starting with her 2000 campaign for Senate. Let’s look at the highlights of her statements between 1999 and 2015 in a timeline: December 1999: Clinton told a group of gay contributors at a fundraiser that she was against the ""don't ask, don't tell"" military policy signed by her husband. The New York Times reported that Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said she supported the Defense of Marriage Act but added that ""same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets."" January 2000: At a news conference in White Plains, Clinton said, ""Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman. But I also believe that people in committed gay marriages, as they believe them to be, should be given rights under the law that recognize and respect their relationship."" April 2000: Clinton again expressed support for civil unions. ""I have supported the kind of rights and responsibilities that are being extended to gay couples in Vermont,"" she said. July 2004: Clinton spoke on the Senate floor against a proposed federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage. (The amendment ultimately failed.) Though she opposed it, she said that she believed that marriage was ""a sacred bond between a man and a woman."" However, she said she took ""umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage, or to the fundamental bedrock principle that exists between a man and a woman."" October 2006: Clinton told a group of gay elected officials that she would support same-sex marriage in New York if a future governor and Legislature chose to enact such a law. ""I support states making the decision,"" she said. As a 2008 presidential candidate In 2007, all the presidential contenders except for longshot candidates -- both Democrats and GOP -- were against same-sex marriage, the New York Times reported. So were the majority of Americans, polls showed. May 2007: In a questionnaire for the Human Rights Campaign in 2007, Clinton backed away from the Defense of Marriage Act: ""I support repealing the provision of DOMA that may prohibit the federal government from providing benefits to people in states that recognize same-sex marriage."" In response to a question about whether marriage should be made legally available to two committed adults of the same sex, Clinton marked that she was ""opposed"" though she stated she supported civil unions. August 2007: In a Democratic primary debate sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and LOGO Network (a gay-oriented TV station) Clinton was asked ""What is at the heart of your opposition to same-sex marriage?"" Clinton replied: ""Well, I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions. You know, it’s a personal position. How we get to full equality is the debate we’re having, and I am absolutely in favor of civil unions with full equality of benefits, rights, and privileges."" As a 2016 presidential candidate As Clinton got ready for her second presidential bid, she again modified her position. March 2013: After leaving her position as secretary of state, she announced her support for same-sex marriage in a video with the Human Rights Campaign on March 18, 2013. ""LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones. And they are full and equal citizens, and they deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage. That’s why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples. I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law, embedded in a broader effort to advance equality and opportunity for LGBT Americans and all Americans."" The comments put her in line with other Democrats at the time who were mentioned as potential 2016 presidential contenders, including Vice President Joe Biden, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Obama had announced his support for same-sex marriage in May 2012. June 2013: Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton issued a joint statement about the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the Defense of Marriage Act. The congratulatory note didn’t mention that Bill Clinton had signed the law back in 1996: ""the Court recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union."" June 2014: NPR’s Terry Gross grilled Clinton about her past positions’ on gay marriage in what led to a testy exchange. Gross tried to get Clinton to explain if she had truly changed her stance or if the shifting political landscape made it possible for her to announce her support. At one point Gross asked, ""Would you say your view evolved since the '90s or that the American public evolved, allowing you to state your real view?"" Clinton replied: ""I think I'm an American. (Laughing) And I think we have all evolved, and it's been one of the fastest, most sweeping transformations."" April 2015: On the day of the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments about same-sex marriage bans in a handful of states in April, Clinton changed her ""H"" logo to rainbow-colored and tweeted a message of support: ""Every loving couple & family deserves to be recognized & treated equally under the law across our nation. #LoveMustWin #LoveCantWait."" Our conclusion Clinton opposed same-sex marriage as a candidate for the Senate, while in office as a senator, and while running for president in 2008. She expressed her support for civil unions starting in 2000 and for the rights’ of states to set their own laws in favor of same-sex marriage in 2006. As polls showed that a majority of Americans supported same-sex marriage, Clinton’s views changed, too. She announced her support for same-sex marriage in March 2013. It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about her changed stance, but on same-sex marriage we give Clinton a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097006540>],/factchecks/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/

Russ Feingold says U.S. ranks 20th in access to broadband, 50 percent behind leaders
","As a part of his plan to improve the nation’s infrastructure, U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold wants to get America plugged in. Feingold, who is looking to reclaim his old seat on Capitol Hill, outlined a plan June 5, 2015 at the state Democratic Convention for improving the country’s infrastructure: roads, bridges and even broadband. Broadband provides a high-speed Internet connection necessary for everything from streaming videos to doctors treating patients over the Web. Feingold said the United States has fallen behind and that other countries have a higher percentage of residents on broadband. ""The United States still ranks 20th in the world in access to broadband -- over 50 percent below the best nations,"" he said. We decided to see for ourselves. Do we rank 20th? In making the claim, Feingold relied on data from the Broadband Commission for Digital Development, an advocacy group established by the United Nations and the International Telecommunication Union to promote broadband access throughout the world. But he cited outdated numbers:  In 2012, the United States ranked 20th. In 2013, the most recent year  available, the United States ranked 24th. Both years, around 28 percent of residents in the United States subscribed to fixed, or wired, broadband. Fixed broadband access is an important measurement, but a country’s connectedness cannot be described using just one number. Feingold overlooked the percentage of residents with mobile broadband subscriptions, which includes cell phones and hotspots. In this category, the United States ranks 10th.   Between 2011 and 2013, The United States' access to mobile broadband increased from 65.5 percent of residents to 92.8 percent, even though its international ranking fell from 8 to 10. At the same time, the percentage of residents who subscribe to fixed broadband remained about the same. Is the distinction important? Technology experts note the reliability of fixed broadband is more important to the economy than mobile broadband. ""I think that most people would agree … that for businesses and the economy, a robust fixed-broadband network is still a key indicator,"" Vanessa Gray, a senior analyst for the International Telecommunication Union, said in an email. Wireless broadband does not boast the reliability or speed of fixed broadband, but mobile broadband has seen an increase in investment in recent years. A report from the Federal Communications Commission dated Feb. 4, 2015 said, ""Wireless providers in the U.S. have spent more than $134 billion in capital investments during the past five years, and incremental capital investment by wireless providers rose by more than 10 percent from 2012 to 2013 to $33.1 billion."" The same FCC report indicated America was behind in its goals to implement fixed broadband nationwide. The areas with the least access include rural areas, American Indian reservations, and some U.S. territories. Many American schools have access to broadband, but they are still behind in terms of broadband speed. Over 50 percent lower Feingold’s claim also noted the United States ranked ""over 50 percent below the best nations."" Monaco ranks at the top of the world for fixed broadband access, with 44.7 percent of its residents having access to fixed broadband. That is 57 percent higher than the United States, where 28 percent of residents have fixed broadband access. Singapore sits at the top of the world for mobile broadband access, with its mobile subscriptions outnumbering its population. In this tally, each device (cell phones, tablets, etc) is counted separately, so the percentage listed for Singapore is 135.1 percent of its residents. That is 46 percent higher than the United States. So, Feingold is roughly on target with the percentage difference. But there are some important notes about the comparison. At two square kilometers, Monaco is the second-smallest independent state in the world. It has a population of 30,500; the country is almost entirely urban and it has the eighth highest GDP per capita in the world. Singapore is a quarter of the size of Rhode Island with about 5.6 million people living there, again, mostly in urban areas; and it has the seventh highest GDP per capita in the world. A country's connectedness is not as closely correlated with overall population as it is with urban population, Gray said. That is, it's easier to wire in 10,000 people living in a one square-mile than it is to wire in 10,000 who live in 100 square miles.   Some countries, such as Switzerland and France, are less urbanized, but have better access to fixed broadband than the United States. The vast majority of countries ahead of the United States on the list are much smaller geographically. The only exception is Canada. ""The U.S. probably does better than expected on average, once its large -- relative to other countries -- rural hinterland is taken into account,"" said Phillippa Biggs, a senior policy analyst for the International Telecommunication Union, in an email. Our rating Feingold said ""The United States still ranks 20th in the world in access to broadband -- over 50 percent below the best nations."" The ranking he uses is a year outdated, but the new numbers paint a somewhat worse ranking (24th instead of 20th). Though fixed broadband is preferred by some as a measure, since it can mean more for the economy, Feingold oversimplifies the issue by excluding mobile broadband access. By that measure, the United States fares considerably better, with 92.8 percent of the population subscribing. Though he is literally correct in saying the United States is ""over 50 percent below the best nations"" in fixed broadband access, the countries that sit atop that list are not comparable to the United States. We rate Feingold’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974945C0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/17/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-us-ranks-20th-access-broadband-/

Donald Trump says 'real' unemployment rate is 18 to 20 percent
","Don’t trust government unemployment statistics, Donald Trump said during his presidential campaign announcement speech. ""Our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent,"" Trump said. ""Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it."" We’ve previously debunked the notion that the government somehow cooks the books when it calculates the unemployment rate. But is there a legitimate statistic that reaches as high as 18 to 20 percent? (Trump's staff did not return inquiries from PolitiFact.) As it happens, there are measures of unemployment beyond the familiar unemployment rate (which, we’ll note, is actually 5.5 percent, not 5.6 percent as Trump said). However, none of the more expansive measures comes close to the level Trump suggests. The most expansive statistic calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, called the U-6 rate, is sometimes offered as a more ""complete"" picture of joblessness. It doesn’t just include those BLS officially considers ""unemployed"" but also those working part time for economic reasons as well as those who are ""marginally attached"" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force. Currently, the U-6 rate of ""labor underutilization"" is 10.8 percent. That’s higher than the more familiar 5.5 percent unemployment rate, but it’s also well below the 18 to 20 percent Trump claimed. So is there another credible way to calculate it? Maybe. One could assemble a more expansive measurement of under-employment than U-6 -- one that ropes in even more Americans whose job outlook has been affected by the weak post-recession labor markets. For instance, U-6 doesn’t count recent graduates who never entered the labor market in the first place because they feared there would be no jobs for them, and it doesn’t count people who chose to take care of their kids full-time, went back to school or retired early to avoid having to compete for a job. Pinpointing the size of this group is not possible given the type of data BLS collects, but we can at least calculate something approximating an upper limit. To do this, we can use data that shows the number of people 16 and over who are ""not in the labor force"" -- that is, those who are neither working nor looking for work. If you take the number of people in this category at the beginning of President Barack Obama’s term and compare it to the number today, it gives a sense of how many people have shied away from the workforce in the wake of the last recession. In January 2009, there were 80.5 million Americans 16 and over who were not in the labor force. Today, that number is slightly below 93 million. So the number not in the labor force has increased by about 12.5 million. If you factor this number into the U-6 calculation (and subtract the ""marginally attached"" category to avoid double counting) you get a back-of-the-envelope rate of 16 percent. But even this is almost certainly too high, since that would assume that every one of those 12.5 million Americans staying out of the workforce in the Obama years has done so because of the poor job market. In reality, we’re in the midst of the first big wave of Baby Boom retirements, so a share of those 12.5 million likely reflect this historically large pool of retirees. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that half the additional increase in people out of the labor force comes from the Baby Boom retirement surge. That would mean the ""new"" unemployment rate -- perhaps we can call this new statistic ""U-7"" -- is about 13 percent. Other guesstimates would produce slightly higher or lower percentages, but the important thing is that the numbers in this range are well short of the 18 to 20 percent Trump mentioned. Getting the number up to 18 or 20 percent would probably require roping into the count people who are high-school and college students and people who are happily retired -- that is, people who technically aren’t working, but who have no reason to be. And that’s a bridge too far. ""A candidate for president should know the definition of unemployment,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Our ruling Trump said, ""Our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it."" Setting aside his paranoia about the federal government cooking the books, Trump is off-base even if you give him the maximum benefit of the doubt. The highest official government statistic for under-employment is 10.8 percent -- roughly half as high as Trump says. And if you make a quick and dirty attempt to expand the scope of this measurement to include other Americans left uncounted in the standard statistics, there’s no plausible way to get it past 16 percent -- and even that’s stretching it. That’s well below the range Trump cited, so we rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D5300>],/factchecks/2015/jun/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-real-unemployment-rate-18-20-per/

Donald Trump gets claim about U.S. GDP doubly wrong
","During his rambling presidential announcement speech, real estate developer and television personality Donald Trump took on many, many targets. One of those was economic growth under President Barack Obama. ""The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero."" For starters, Trump didn’t even phrase his claim correctly. He said that ""our gross domestic product … was below zero."" Real gross domestic product was in the trillions of dollars -- not anywhere close to zero. He meant growth in GDP. But even phrased appropriately, his claim is wrong. (Trump's staff did not return inquiries from PolitiFact.) The real annualized change in gross domestic product during the first quarter of 2015 was indeed negative -- it fell by 0.7 percent. But ""never below zero""? That’s way off. Negative GDP growth -- in other words, GDP shrinkage -- from quarter to quarter is one of the hallmarks of a recession. And there have been lots of recessions over the years -- 11 since World War II. The first year the government calculated the change in GDP from quarter to quarter was 1947. We looked back and found no fewer than 42 quarters over that period in which GDP shrank on an annualized, seasonally adjusted basis. That’s roughly 15 percent of the time. Here’s a summary of how frequently this has happened historically:   Year Quarters of negative GDP growth that year 1947 2 1949 3 1953 2 1954 1 1956 2 1957 2 1958 1 1959 1 1960 2 1969 1 1970 2 1973 1 1974 3 1975 1 1980 2 1981 2 1982 2 1990 1 1991 1 2001 2 2008 3 2009 2 2011 1 2014 1 2015 1 We should also note that the poor first quarter of 2015 may not end up as a negative quarter once the final revisions are made. In a couple of weeks, the government will release a final number that takes into account new and complete data, and it’s currently so close to zero that it’s possible it could slip into positive territory. It’s also worth noting that this quarterly figure should be taken with some caution. ""This estimate does not suggest a recession,"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University. ""We've had a weird pattern in the last few years of weak first quarter estimates."" Some analysts have chalked these up to unusually harsh winters that seasonal adjustments weren’t strong enough to iron out. The general rule of thumb is that it takes two quarters of negative growth to signal a recession. Finally, since Trump was attacking Obama for this bad quarter of growth, we’ll just throw this out: Of the 42 quarters of negative growth since World War II, 30 occurred under Republican presidents and just 12 under Democratic presidents. Our ruling Trump said that in ""the last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product … was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero."" He messes up his economic terms; the gross domestic product was not ""zero."" And the growth in the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years. That’s a lot more than ""never."" We rate his claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809783D0C0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-gdp-never-negative-ter/

Donald Trump: ISIS built a hotel in Syria
","Donald Trump is facing a lot of competition these days. The Republican real estate mogul announced he’s running for president -- against at least a dozen other candidates. In his June 16 announcement speech, Trump said he also has a new competitor in the hotel biz: a group of entrepreneurial terrorists who call themselves the Islamic State. ""Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East,"" he said. ""They've become rich. I'm in competition with them. They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel."" We weren’t sure if we could, in fact, believe Trump’s claim that the Islamic State built a hotel in Syria, so we decided to check it out. The grain of truth here is that the Islamic State has taken over a luxury hotel. But they didn’t build it. And it’s not in Syria. And it doesn’t really operate like a normal hotel. We couldn’t find any evidence that the Islamic State is running any sort of hotel in Syria. We tried to get in touch with a Trump spokesperson and didn’t hear back. However, this May, the Islamic State reopened a five-star hotel in Mosul that shut down when the terrorist group took over the city, one of the largest in Iraq. (Most of the information about this has come from Arabic language news sources.) So the Islamic State didn’t build the Ninawa International Hotel; they just occupied it. Also, it’s not really open for business. According to news reports, the Islamic State is using the hotel’s 262 rooms to house the group’s commanding officers, and they might use it as a wedding venue for the group’s members. You can’t book a room at Ninawa online, and the TripAdvisor page is now defunct. But pre-Islamic State reviews -- caught by Buzzfeed and others -- said the hotel had a good view of the Tigris river, a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pool and two restaurants. News reports say that, keeping with Islamic law, the Islamic State banned drinking and smoking in the hotel, and workers have removed decorations they disapprove of. Our ruling Trump claimed the Islamic State ""just built a hotel in Syria."" The Islamic State does occupy a luxury hotel, which they took over about a month and a half ago. However, it’s in Iraq, not Syria, and they didn’t build it. It’s an old hotel that the group refurbished and occupied. As far as we know, the hotel’s rooms are reserved for Islamic State commanders, and the event spaces are for weddings. At least for now, Trump doesn’t have to worry about the Islamic State running him out of the hotel business.

Liberal group claims all of Hillary Clinton's speaking fees went to charity
","We’ve seen conservatives go too far criticizing Hillary Clinton’s hefty speaking fees, saying Clinton ""makes more per hour at a speaking gig than the average CEO does in a year."" (Mostly False) Now a liberal group is bending the Truth-O-Meter in Clinton’s defense. The group, Occupy Democrats, posted a recent Facebook meme that seeks to compare Clinton’s paid speeches to those given by former President George W. Bush. The meme has been shared more than 25,000 times. It reads: ""Hilary (sic) has donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity. Bush keeps all of his speaking fees.""  We’ll leave Bush out of this for the moment. As for the claim that Clinton ""donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity,"" that’s wrong. No one from the Occupy Democrats group responded to our request for comment, but we believe its claim is based on 2014 comments by Clinton. When students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, asked that Clinton return her $225,000 speaking fee, Clinton noted that ""all of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work."" ""So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation,"" Clinton told ABC News, with regard to the UNLV speech. The UNLV donation is documented on the Clinton Foundation website. It includes this list of ""speeches by President, Secretary, and Chelsea Clinton (that) have helped support the implementation of the Clinton Foundation’s work around the world."" The speaking fee from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, for instance, is listed as a donation from the UNLV Foundation. So are other speeches at universities and colleges as well as a few speeches organized by private groups such as Citibank, Chicago House and Goldman Sachs. But that’s not all of the speeches for which Clinton has been paid. In May, the New York Times published Clinton’s 2015 financial disclosure form. Covering a period from January 2014 to March 2015, Clinton lists a total of 51 speech fees that have been added to her personal account from a variety of companies. Not including her husband’s fees which also appear on the same disclosure, Clinton’s speech fees end up totaling more than $11 million. Spokesmen for the Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s presidential campaign declined comment. Our ruling Occupy Democrats claimed Clinton ""has donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity."" That’s a misreading of Clinton’s comments in 2014, when she said speaking fees at colleges and universities were donated to the Clinton Foundation. Clinton’s financial disclosure form includes 51 speeches in which Clinton was compensated directly.

John D. Rockefeller didn’t coin term ‘fossil fuels’ to trick people and boost oil prices
","As Americans continue to pay high prices at the gas pump, some have taken to social media to claim that people have been lied to about fossil fuels and the availability of oil.  According to one TikTok video shared on Facebook, fossil fuels do not, in fact, come from the remains of long-dead organisms, and oil is one of the most abundant liquids on the planet, next to water.  The woman in the clip claims that the term ""fossil fuel"" was coined by American businessman and Standard Oil owner John D. Rockefeller to trick the public into thinking that oil was a rarity so he could drive up the price.

Rockefeller himself, he named fossil fuels to trick people into thinking that his product was scarce, in turn allowing for an increase in prices. How much did you pay in gas today? And how do you feel knowing that you're paying that much for the second most abundant liquid on the planet?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Rockefeller is not responsible for coining the term ""fossil fuel"" in 1892 — it was being used well before he was born — and fossil fuels do, in fact, come from decomposing organisms. Oil also isn’t created quickly, and while it may be abundant, experts said that doesn’t mean it’s all readily available. Tyler Priest, a history and geography professor at the University of Iowa and leading expert on the history of offshore oil and gas, told PolitiFact that the claim stems from a longstanding conspiracy theory about big oil corporations going back to Rockefeller.  The belief involves the so-called ""abiogenic oil"" theory which, he said, ""proposes that petroleum is formed by inorganic means deep in the earth’s mantle, and thus is almost infinitely abundant. Somehow, the oil industry has managed to keep most people from learning about this."" John D. Rockefeller was born in 1839 and founded the Standard Oil Company in 1870, becoming one of the world's first billionaires. While he made a lot of money off oil, he didn’t coin the term ""fossil fuel"" to drive up the price. It was, instead, conceived by a German chemist named Caspar Neumann and can be found in the index of the 1759 English translation of ""The Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann."" The term was used in other works that pre-date Rockefeller, including in the title of an 1835 book on the history of Great Britain's coal trade. But it was used more widely in the early 1900s to give people the idea that petroleum, coal and natural gas come from ancient living things, making them a natural substance. In Google Books Ngram Viewer, a tool that charts the usage of specific words or phrases in books over time, results for ""fossil fuels"" show that the term was used periodically between 1750 and 1900 and spiked after the 1940s, which was after Rockefeller’s death in 1937.  ""‘Fossil fuels’ was not really a term anyone used to refer to oil in the late 19th century, at least in the U.S. context,"" said Priest. ""People used the terms ‘oil,’ ‘mineral oil,’ ‘rock oil,’ ‘Seneca oil,’ ‘gas oil,’ or ‘petroleum.’ I’m pretty sure (John D. Rockefeller) never invented or even used the term ‘fossil fuels.’""  Fossil fuels are made from decomposing plants and animals — mainly microorganisms like phytoplankton and algae from millions of years ago. These fuels are found in the Earth's crust and contain carbon and hydrogen, which can be burned for energy. Coal, crude oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels. While water is considered the most abundant liquid on earth, we could not find an official measurement that ranks the prevalence of different types of liquids on earth. But even if oil were somehow determined to be the second-most abundant liquid on the planet, that designation doesn’t mean much, energy experts said.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration, the federal agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating energy information, told PolitiFact that, while it doesn’t have comparisons of volumes of oil versus other liquids, just because oil exists somewhere doesn’t mean it’s economically or technically possible to extract it. Experts estimate the volume of recoverable crude oil using a figure called ""proved reserves"" — estimates of the volumes of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate to be recoverable in future years under existing economic and operating conditions. The amount of proved reserves fluctuates in certain circumstances.   ""In 2020 for instance, proved reserves of oil declined from 2019 levels,"" EIA spokesperson Chris Higginbotham told us in an email. ""Lower crude oil prices in 2020 caused many operators to revise their estimates of proved reserves downward and scale back development plans for new wells … So, just because oil exists, that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily available."" Oil is also not created quickly and is not considered a self-replenishing resource. ""Petroleum, like coal and natural gas, is a non-renewable source of energy,"" National Geographic says on its website. ""It took millions of years for it to form, and when it is extracted and consumed, there is no way for us to replace it."" A Facebook post features a TikTok video that claims Rockefeller created the term ""fossil fuels"" in 1892 to trick people into thinking oil was scarce and boost prices when fossil fuels are actually ""the second most abundant liquid on the planet."" Rockefeller is not responsible for coming up with the term ""fossil fuels"" at the end of the 19th century. It was being used over 100 years earlier, first showing up in 1759 in texts by the German chemist Caspar Neumann.  Oil might be abundant but it took millions of years to yield the barrels of oil that are being drilled today, and not all oil is necessarily able to be extracted. And experts say there’s no clear measurement that puts oil as the planet’s ""second most abundant liquid.""

In Ga. governor race, David Perdue wrong that ‘secret’ deal gives George Soros hundreds of millions
","In his bid to become governor of Georgia, David Perdue accused the incumbent, fellow Republican Brian Kemp, of subterfuge in office. He alleged that Kemp behind closed doors schemed to give ""hundreds of millions of tax dollars"" to a company owned by liberal billionaire George Soros. Perdue, a former U.S. senator, and Kemp are battling for the GOP nomination to take on Democrat Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost to Kemp in 2018. Perdue made his attack in a TV ad, deriding the first-term governor as a RINO — Republican In Name Only. The narrator in the 30-second spot says: ""A secret backroom deal between a governor and liberal billionaire George Soros. A scheme to give away hundreds of millions of tax dollars to a Soros-owned company. It’s not Stacey Abrams. It's RINO Brian Kemp. Kemp’s crooked deal cost Georgians, but made Soros even richer."" Text on the screen goes even further: ""Millions of tax dollars to George Soros."" The ad misleads on several points. While the state is expected to offer a public company called Rivian Automotive, hundreds of millions of dollars in tax and other incentives, this is not a company that Soros owns. Details of the plan aren’t yet known, but it is expected that incentives would be offered to the company in exchange for a proposed factory that would bring 7,500 jobs. Once negotiations are complete, details of the deal will be made public.   The ad from Perdue, a former CEO of Reebok and two other companies, alludes to plans by California-based Rivian Automotive to build a $5 billion electric vehicle plant near Atlanta that would employ 7,500 people. Kemp announced the plans in December, calling it the largest economic project in Georgia’s history.  ""Standard economic development procedure protects privacy for companies and protects state offers from competitors during the investment decision process,"" said Marie Gordon, spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Economic Development. ""The same process was followed in this project as any economic development project."" In January, Kemp allocated $112.6 million in his state budget proposal for land and training costs associated with the factory. The state legislature approved the budget, and Kemp signed it in March. That is no secret. No deal has been reached on giving Rivian hundreds of millions of tax dollars. Perdue’s campaign argues that the deal is secret because it’s not yet known what public incentives might ultimately be offered. It’s correct that details of tax breaks and other incentives that are likely to be offered by the state and local municipalities are not known, though they are expected to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, citing senior state officials, reported that the total package would far surpass the more than $400 million that Georgia offered Kia to win a smaller project. The state is still working with Rivian and local government officials ""to negotiate and finalize the economic development agreement,"" and until the agreement is signed, the project is exempt from the state open records law, the Georgia Department of Economic Development says.  ""As with any economic development project, incentives are tied largely to job creation, and the benefits of such incentives will only be received by the company once long-term, full-time jobs are created,"" Gordon said. Rivian is not owned by Soros, the philanthropist and Democratic campaign contributor who is a frequent target of bogus claims. It is a publicly owned company, with many shareholders including Amazon, which as of April 6 had an 18% stake. In a February filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, Soros Fund Management reported it had purchased in late 2021 some 200 million shares of Rivian stock, or about 2% of the company.  The value of the shares was $2 billion at the end of December, the period covered by the filing, but it had dropped to about $1 billion by the time of the February filing. Gordon said the state’s negotiations with Rivian have not included Soros or any representative of his. Perdue, who lost his Senate re-election bid to Democrat Jon Ossoff in 2021, is challenging Kemp in Georgia’s primaries on May 24. If neither candidate gets more than 50% of the primary vote, there will be a runoff on June 21.  The Republican nominee is expected to face Abrams, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary, in the Nov. 8 general election. Kemp won his first term as governor in 2018 by defeating Abrams, a former George state lawmaker, by about 50% to 49%.  Campaign watchers rate the general election as a toss up and ""tilts Republican.""  Perdue claimed in an ad attacking Kemp that a ""secret backroom deal"" gave ""away hundreds of millions of tax dollars to a Soros-owned company."" Kemp has publicly proposed state spending of $125 million for land and training costs associated with a proposed $5 billion electric-vehicle factory planned by Rivian Automotive.  It’s expected that in total, hundreds of millions of dollars in state and local government incentives will be offered to Rivian. But that has not happened and negotiations are continuing. Soros, a frequent target of conservatives, does not own Rivian. His investment fund owns about 20 million shares of the company, or about 2%.  Perdue’s statement contains an element of truth in that negotiations are not happening in public. But he ignores critical facts about Soros’ involvement that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

No, Evers didn’t refuse to remove vets board chair who was charged with possession of child porn
","In late March 2022, the chairman of Wisconsin’s veterans board agreed to resign after being charged with possession of child pornography in January.  Curtis Schmitt Jr.’s resignation came after Republican candidate for governor Kevin Nicholson urged his removal in a letter to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. In the letter, Nicholson blasted Evers for not removing Schmitt earlier.  Nicholson, a Marine veteran who formerly served on the same board, wasted little time claiming victory after news of the resignation broke. In a March 28, 2022 fundraising email, he wrote that he’d accomplished in a day what Evers hadn’t in two months.  ""Over the course of two months, Tony Evers refused to remove (Schmitt) from the Board despite having the authority to do (so),"" the email said.  But the process of removal isn’t as simple as Nicholson’s email made it sound.  Let’s take a look.  In response to a request for evidence to back his claim, Nicholson’s office called Evers an ineffective governor who ""shouldn’t have let this situation perpetuate for as long as it did.""  But the Nicholson response also cited the very state statute that made the process more complicated: Wisconsin law dictates that the governor can only remove an appointed state officer for cause after a taxpayer files a complaint against that person and a hearing is held.  Nicholson said his letter should be considered a formal complaint. But even so, that would have meant Evers couldn’t have started Schmitt’s removal process until after Nicholson’s letter was received — two months after Schmitt was charged.   Evers’ communications director Britt Cudaback said in an email that the governor had not received such a complaint from a taxpayer previously and thus did not have the authority to remove him until the Nicholson complaint arrived. What’s more, Nicholson’s initial statement didn’t just say Evers had left the situation too long in limbo. He said the governor actually refused to remove Schmitt from the board.  That’s inaccurate. The Associated Press reported March 24, 2022 that the Evers administration sent Schmitt a letter the day after he was charged asking him to resign immediately. Schmitt and his representatives did not respond to that letter or subsequent attempts to reach him for the following two months, according to the article.  Cudaback said after that initial letter asking for Schmitt’s resignation, the governor’s office followed up three times with no response, on March 1, March 16 and March 25.  So Evers did not have the authority to remove Schmitt, as Nicholson claimed.  And he also wasn’t refusing to remove him — he was actively pursuing his voluntary resignation. Nicholson claimed ""Over the course of two months, Tony Evers refused to remove (Schmitt) from the Board despite having the authority to do (so).""  But the Evers administration says they made several unsuccessful attempts to get Schmitt to leave voluntarily — their only option without a taxpayer complaint and a hearing. Nicholsons letter itself, two months after news broke, was what would have been enough to trigger a formal removal process. We rate this claim False.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC7940>],/factchecks/2022/apr/08/kevin-nicholson/no-evers-didnt-refuse-remove-vets-board-chair-who-/

JD Vance’s ad about ‘open border’ and immigrant voters is wrong
","Ohio Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance is hitting President Joe Biden over border policies in an ad that suggests immigrants who illegally cross the border are boosting the Democratic Party. ""Are you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans?"" Vance asks in a TV ad. ""The media calls us racist for wanting to build Trump’s wall. They censor us, but it doesn’t change the truth. Joe Biden’s open border is killing Ohioans with more illegal drugs and more Democrat voters pouring into this country."" Vance then cites his mother’s drug addiction from the ""poison coming across our border."" Vance’s ad suggests that immigrants are illegally crossing the southern border and then voting. That’s not happening, said two election strategists of opposing parties who have teamed up on the Latino Vote podcast. ""That’s blatantly inaccurate for a whole lot of reasons, the main one being it's just not true,"" said Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist. ""It makes no sense what he is saying,"" said Chuck Rocha, a Democrat strategist. ""He wants people to think Mexicans are walking across the border and filling out paperwork and they are handed a Democrat voter ID card. That’s the worst stereotype."" We asked Vance’s campaign for evidence and did not receive a response. Vance is competing in a crowded May 3 Republican primary as a result of the planned retirement of Sen. Rob Portman. On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan is running against consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. Early voting is underway. There is not an ""open border"" between the U.S. and Mexico. In fiscal year 2021, which began in October 2020 and ended in September, there were 1.7 million encounters at the southwest border, numbers not seen in more than 20 years. More than 1 million of those immigrants were expelled quickly under a public health order called Title 42, which President Donald Trump began using in March 2020 due to COVID-19. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it will halt the Title 42 order on May 23. Officials are bracing for as many as 18,000 migrants per day, nearly triple the current pace, according to the Migration Policy Institute. But once Title 42 is lifted, that doesn’t create an ""open border"" that would allow anyone to walk across the border and remain in the country legally. Instead, it means that the country returns to how it handled immigrants entering the country illegally before the pandemic, a longer process that includes expedited removals, placing people into long-term removal proceedings, or some migrants leaving voluntarily or going through the asylum process.  These laws and procedures ""are not particular to Joe Biden or the Democrats,"" said Ron Hayduk, a San Francisco State professor who teaches courses on elections and immigration. Federal law requires citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form attesting under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. States can check various databases to verify voters’ citizenship status.  Cases of fraudulent voting by noncitizens do happen occasionally, but they are often the result of misunderstandings or errors.  Rutgers University professor Lorraine Minnite previously told us that the most common problem she has seen on the issue is noncitizens getting accidentally registered to vote when they go to the Department of Motor Vehicles. But the number of people who fall into this category is ""miniscule,"" she said. Minnite told us that Vance’s comments are a ""delusion."" PolitiFact has fact-checked several similar claims from Trump and others — all inaccurate — about immigrants voting illegally in the 2008, 2016 and 2018 elections.  We found little evidence of noncitizen voting in 2020 as well. In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose in February referred about 62 cases of potential voter fraud to prosecutors, including about three dozen related to potential noncitizens either registering to vote or casting ballots. Those cases remain under investigation, the attorney general said. In the 2020 general election in Ohio, about 5.9 million ballots were cast. LaRose, a Republican, said in 2021 that voter fraud is ""exceedingly rare."" In North Carolina in 2020, federal prosecutors charged 19 individuals with voter fraud after casting ballots in 2016 or 2018 elections. Sixteen pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen. Three cases were dismissed.  Voting by noncitizens carries high risks – they may face deportation or incarceration, or it may thwart their efforts when applying for naturalization. The process of becoming a citizen — and therefore earning the right to register to vote — can take a decade or longer. ""Even if many of these people found a path to legal status via asylum or other means, it would be many, many years before they would become eligible to vote given both the huge backlogs in adjudicating cases in immigration court and the fact that people spend years on a green card before being eligible for citizenship,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute.  Vance specifically mentioned Mexican immigrants. Nationally, Mexican-Americans comprise about 69% of the Latino electorate and overwhelmingly voted for Biden, Rocha said. The Latino electorate is not monolithic — Cuban Americans lean Republican, unlike non-Cuban American Hispanics. But it’s ""ridiculous"" to make assumptions about how immigrants crossing the border now will vote in 20 years if they gain citizenship, Madrid said. The majority of Latinos voted for Biden in 2020; however, Trump increased his share compared with 2016 and made gains in Miami-Dade County and the Rio Grande Valley. Trump took 38% of the Hispanic vote in 2020, compared to 28% in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center.  Vance said that  ""Joe Biden’s open border"" means that there are ""more Democrat voters pouring into this country.""  The border is not open. The majority of immigrants encountered by border agents have been expelled recently by the use of a public health order put in place by Trump. Even when that order, Title 42, is lifted in May, that won’t create an ""open"" border — the federal government will respond to immigrants arriving in the U.S. illegally using its laws and decades-old processes that include removal, court hearings and, for those who are eligible, the asylum process. Vance’s ad creates an impression that immigrants are crossing the Mexican border illegally and then turning into Democrat voters. That’s wrong. Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections, and proven incidents of noncitizens casting ballots are rare. Even migrants who cross the border now and go through the process of gaining citizenship won’t be able to vote for over a decade or longer.  We rate this statement False.  RELATED: No evidence for viral claim that ‘22 million illegal aliens’ are ‘voting illegally’ RELATED: All of our fact-checks in the Ohio Senate race RELATED: The race for the Ohio U.S. Senate seat: A guide",[<zip object at 0x0000028097892380>],/factchecks/2022/apr/08/jd-vance/jd-vances-ad-about-open-border-and-immigrant-voter/

No, this Colorado law does not allow abortions ‘up until the moment of birth’
","While state lawmakers in Oklahoma and Texas are pushing to restrict abortion access, this week Colorado became the latest state to guarantee the right to have an abortion. However, social media posts have misconstrued what the state’s new law will do. On April 4, when Colorado’s measure was signed into law, anti-abortion activist Lila Rose tweeted, ""BREAKING: Colorado Governor Jared Polis has just signed into law a bill legalizing abortions through all nine months, up until the moment of birth.""

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Reproductive Health Equity Act that Polis signed into law this week affirms an individual’s right to contraceptives and an abortion. It says that a government entity may not ""deny, restrict, interfere with or discriminate against an individual’s fundamental right to use or refuse contraception or to continue a pregnancy and give birth or to have an abortion."" These reproductive health protections already existed in Colorado, but now they are codified in the state’s statute. This means that in the event the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the Roe v. Wade precedent, access to contraceptives and an abortion will remain protected in Colorado. The new law also protects against attempts by local governments to restrict abortion access. Colorado’s law protects the right to have an abortion and does not make distinctions or regulations around a time or stage during pregnancy. Roe v. Wade banned states from prohibiting women from terminating pregnancy before viability, a standard that was defined in a later Supreme Court decision to mean when ""in the judgment of the attending physician on the particular facts of the case before him, there is a reasonable likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the womb, with or without artificial support."" While viability is determined on a case-by-case basis and dependent on a variety of factors including gestational age and fetal weight, a baby that is in the process of being born — or ""moments before birth"" — is unlikely to meet the standard under which abortion is legal.  Most abortions take place early on in a person’s pregnancy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 93% of abortions in 2019 took place at or before 13 weeks gestation. About 6% occur between 14 and 20 weeks gestation. Abortions being performed later in a pregnancy are rare; less than 1% occur at 21 weeks gestation or later, according to the CDC. Abortions around 21 weeks are often difficult to obtain because the procedure is costly, time-sensitive and only performed by a small subset of abortion providers. A screenshot of a tweet shared on Facebook claimed: ""Colorado Governor Jared Polis has just signed into law a bill legalizing abortions through all nine months, up until the moment of birth.""

Mayo Clinic describes well-baby visits as ""an important way to monitor your baby's growth and development and check for serious problems."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says seeing a doctor regularly for well-child visits and recommended vaccines is ""one of the best things you can do to protect your child and community from serious diseases that are easily spread.""  While there is a possibility that a child could get sick from a visit to the doctor, experts say the benefits of taking a healthy child to a doctor for these preventative visits outweigh the risk. Asked about her post, Margulis pointed us to a Science Daily article about a 2014 study out of the University of Iowa. The study examined data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Medical Expenditure Panel Survey spanning 1996-2008 and involving 84,595 families. It found that there was a 3.17% increase in the probability of a child under 6 getting sick with a flu-like illness two weeks after their well-child visit. Contrary to the point of Margulis’ Facebook post, the authors of that study emphasized the importance of well-child visits and instead said the data undergirded the need for strong infection control precautions. ""We believe that attendance at well-child visits is critically important for preventing infections through vaccination and that the benefits far outweigh the risks,"" the researchers wrote. ""Nonetheless, our results stress the importance of improving compliance with current infection control guidelines for ambulatory settings—not just for well-child visits, but for all office visits."" Dr. Philip Polgreen, one of the study’s co-authors, reiterated that point in the Science Daily article and in an interview with NBC’s TODAY Show, calling the risk of a child getting sick from a well-child visit ""actually quite modest."" The study’s authors also noted several limitations in their findings, including that their analysis didn’t consider flu vaccination habits among the families of the children. They also wrote that by relying on medical coding data rather than microbiological evidence, the study might have misclassified some of the cases. The study also noted that two other, smaller studies examining the question of illness transmission in children found no increased risk of infection. Dr. Michael Crocetti, associate professor of clinical pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University, said the data in the University of Iowa study is also problematic in that it didn’t break down the findings by patient age or school and day care attendance. ""You cannot make a cause and effect conclusion that having a well check two weeks prior to a viral illness is the sole cause,"" Crocetti said. ""In a two-week span, children can have multiple other exposures to viruses."" Crocetti rejected the notion that children are more likely to get sick from well-child visits. Such visits, he said, enable physicians to provide physical exams for children, monitor their behavior and mental health developments, and administer immunizations in alignment with the CDC’s recommended timeline. They also give parents the chance to ask questions related to a child’s safety, diet, growth and development. The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends physicians use well-child visits to survey for signs of developmental delay. Crocetti said that a child is more likely to get sick from being around their family, in a daycare or a school setting than they would going into the doctor’s office. In healthcare settings, he said, medical staff wash their hands often, wear masks when needed and are vaccinated against viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. ""Many offices actually separate out a sick and a well waiting room,"" he said. Indeed, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends physicians take specific precautions that include diligent hand hygiene, regular surface cleaning and targeted masking. It recommends separate waiting rooms and precautions for patients who may be contagious and are more vulnerable to infection. Dr. Joseph F. Hagan, Jr., fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics and co-editor of the Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children and Adolescents, said the benefits of well-child visits are in prevention.  ""You don’t find many very serious diseases in a well visit, thank God. But sometimes you do,"" Hagan said. ""More importantly though, you spend a lot of time with disease prevention — healthy nutrition being a good example of that, encouraging breastfeeding being an example of that.""  Margulis made three other points in response to our inquiry to back up her claim that well-child visits make children sick. First, she said that pediatricians at well visits ""routinely recommend Tylenol,"" which she said damages the brain, the immune system and can lead to autism. She pointed to a 2017 paper  published in the Journal of International Research that called for more research into links between the drug and autism. But Tylenol at the appropriate dose has been found to be safe, and links between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism are in dispute. There is no indication that healthy children attending well-child visits would be urged to take acetaminophen, which is used to treat fevers and minor aches and pains, unless it were recommended to treat short-term side-effects of a vaccination delivered during the visit.  Second, Margulis argued that doctors often ""find problems at these well baby checks that don’t exist."" She pointed to a study that found that in cases where well-checks involved routine temperature checks of asymptomatic patients, fever was detected 0.2% of the time. In about half those cases, doctors deferred planned vaccinations and in some instances prescribed an antibiotic. But that study didn’t question the need for well-child visits. Rather, it recommended a closer examination of the use of routine temperature checks during well-child visits. Finally, Margulis said doctors discourage mothers from nursing and instead promote baby formula. But this sweeping claim contradicts data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that show an overall upward trend in breastfeeding, from about 70% in 2000 to nearly 84% in 2018. The American Academy of Pediatrics has published articles and statements that support, not discourage, breastfeeding and, in 2012, it adopted a position that discouraged physicians from handing out formula promotions in clinic settings. Margulis’ Facebook post advised parents to ""skip the well baby visits"" if they ""want a healthy, happy baby"" because they ""make your baby sick."" While there is a risk a child could become sick following a visit to a pediatrician’s office, evidence linking these two is not conclusive. A study Margulis cited as evidence did indicate a small increase in the probability of a child under 6 getting sick with a flu-like illness two weeks after their well-child visit. But even the authors of that study emphasized the importance of well-child visits and said the data undergirded the need for strong infection control precautions — not an end to well-child visits. Regular check-ups for healthy babies and children are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the CDC, the Mayo Clinic and more as a means to monitor growth and development and assist with parent education and communication. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972D7C80>],/factchecks/2022/apr/07/facebook-posts/well-baby-visits-doctor-are-safe-not-harmful/

Iconic photo is from Ukraine war, not Russia gas explosion
","An iconic photo of a Ukrainian woman injured after her apartment building was attacked on the first day of Russia's invasion was portrayed on social media as being from a 2018 tragedy in Russia. The woman has been accused of being a crisis actor, including by official Russian government accounts. One Instagram post on Feb. 27 shared a compilation of photos. The two at the top show newspaper covers with an image of the woman’s heavily bandaged face. Below are images of a damaged apartment building, which the post alleges are actually from a gas explosion at an apartment building in Russia in 2018. There was no caption on the post other than multiple hashtags, including #crisisactor, #hoax and #falseflag. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The woman was identified in news reports as Olena Kurilo, a teacher, whose apartment building in Chuhuiv, Ukraine, was hit by a Russian missile on Feb. 24.  The two photos seen at the top of the Instagram post were taken by Wolfgang Schwan, a photographer for Anadolu Images, and distributed to news outlets by Getty Images. Schwan also shared a photo of Kurilo on Instagram the same day. Schwan discussed his famous photo and the false claims about it in an interview with The Independent on March 2. ""Not only is she the face of the atrocities that happen in war to civilians, but now she has been thrown into the middle of a propaganda wave and is being hated for being a victim,"" he told the publication. Kurilo was interviewed by journalists at the AFP news agency on Feb. 24. Her image was captured by at least two other photojournalists, as seen in a New York Post article. The two photos at the bottom of the Instagram post are also from Feb. 24 and show the apartment complex that was attacked, Reuters fact-checkers found. The building can be seen in a report by Anadolu Agency and in a video by Justin Yau, a photojournalist in Ukraine.  There was a gas explosion in 2018 that killed dozens of people in Magnitogorsk, Russia, but images show the building is not the same as the one seen in the Ukraine bombing. AFP fact-checkers showed a side-by-side comparison of the buildings; the building in Russia is taller. Fact-checkers at BBC, Full Fact and Maldita have also debunked this claim. A social media user claims a photo of a Ukrainian woman that went viral after her apartment building was attacked on the first day of Russia’s invasion is actually from a 2018 gas explosion in Russia. At least three photojournalists took photos of the woman on Feb. 24 and she was interviewed on camera.

Iowa’s Student First voucher bill would benefit 2 percent of Iowa school children
","Back in January, the opening of the Iowa legislative session was full of discussion about letting parents choose their children’s education. Since then, lawmakers took another step toward that goal when the Iowa Senate passed a school voucher bill known as SF 2369, the Putting Students First Act. Prior to passing the bill, House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, sent a press release condemning the legislation. She said the voucher bill would hurt more students than it helps.  ""If the bill is approved, only 2% of Iowa students would benefit while the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,"" Konfrst said in the press release.  SF 2369 would create 10,000 vouchers to use for parents in the area to transfer their kids from their local public school to a private school of their choice. Ron Robinson, Iowa’s Legislative Service Agency specialist on the bill, said that in order to apply for one of the vouchers, a student’s family must be 400 percent below poverty level, or have an Individualized Education Plan.  To pay for this, $55.2 million would be moved from Iowa’s general fund — the state’s main operating fund. Each student who uses a voucher would receive roughly $5,500, which is 70 percent of that state’s per pupil allocation, Robinson said. The bill passed the Iowa Senate 31-18 on March 30 and has moved to the House.  We cannot gauge whether ""the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,"" because that is a prediction. But Robinson confirmed Konfrst’s statement that 2 percent of Iowa’s K-12 children will have a chance at vouchers. Only 10,000 vouchers would be available for about 485,000 school children in Iowa, he said.  However, other student funding generated from taxes and federal funds will remain in the district that the student leaves. According to the governor’s fact sheet, public schools will retain roughly $1,400 per pupil in property tax dollars for each student from that particular school district who uses a voucher to attend a private school. After the Senate vote, Gov. Kim Reynolds sent a news release that said the state should create opportunities for more families to provide their children with the education choice best for them.  ""The Senate made clear tonight that parents matter. Iowans want and deserve school choice and educational freedom for their children and I urge the House to get this across the finish line and send a bill to my desk,"" Reynolds said.  In fiscal 2021, the state’s general fund ended with a $1.24 billion surplus. The $55.2 million amounts to roughly 4.4 percent of the general fund.  Jennifer Konfrst stated that only 2 percent of K-12 students in Iowa would benefit from the Putting Students First Act that is moving through the Iowa Legislature. With about 485,000 school children in the state and only 10,000 vouchers available, she is correct.  We rate the statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096943E80>],/factchecks/2022/apr/07/jennifer-konfrst/iowas-student-first-voucher-bill-would-benefit-2-p/

No evidence Josh Mandel photoshopped his face onto body of Black Marine for campaign ad
","A new campaign ad from Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Ohio, invoked Martin Luther King Jr. in an effort to blast critical race theory.  The ad drew strong criticism, and some on social media accused Mandel of editing himself into a photo with Black Marines for the spot — claims the Mandel campaign called false. The campaign released the ad April 5 on Twitter and YouTube. The 30-second spot cuts between images from Mandel’s service in the Marine Corps to Mandel on and near the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where King marched for civil rights in 1965.   ""Martin Luther King marched right here so skin color wouldn’t matter,"" Mandel says in the ad. ""I didn’t do two tours in Anbar Province, fighting alongside Marines of every color, to come home and be called a racist. There’s nothing racist about stopping critical race theory."" An unsubstantiated Twitter rumor asserted that Mandel had edited his face into one of the ad’s photos, which showed him alongside five other uniformed troops, all of whom appear to be Black. Some social media users noted with suspicion that in the image, Mandel’s hands appear darker than his face. Some also pointed out that Mandel appears to be the only person with his name on his uniform.  Some Twitter users shared posts alleging that Josh Mandel edited himself into a photo in his recent ad. Occupy Democrats, a liberal media outlet built around a Facebook page, amplified the rumor.  ""Breaking news: Ohio pro-Trump U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel puts a photo of himself standing with Black soldiers in his latest campaign ad,"" Occupy Democrats wrote in a post shared on both Facebook and Instagram. ""The only problem is that he forgot to photoshop the hands that clearly show he put his face on the body of a Black soldier.""  Occupy Democrats claimed in this April 5 Facebook post that Josh Mandel edited himself into a photo in his recent ad. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Scott Guthrie, a spokesperson for Mandel, said the charges of photoshopping are ""totally false.""  Guthrie provided PolitiFact and reporters at Politico, NBC News and the Associated Press with another version of the image in question, which he said was the original photo. In that version of the image, Mandel’s hands do not appear to be as dark as in the ad.  Josh Mandel's Senate campaign shared what they said was an original version of the photo from his recent ad. (Josh Mandel for U.S. Senate) Fred Davis, a Republican consultant who creates ads for Mandel, told PolitiFact that the version of the image that showed up in the ad reflected efforts by the video editor to make sure the text directing viewers to the campaign’s ""JoshMandel.com"" web address showed up on the video. He said it ""was vignetted slightly by the editor to make sure the URL white type was legible.""  The bottom halves of the other soldiers in the ad version of the photo also appear darker than their faces, as do the weapons they are holding. ""Look at the original photo,"" Davis said. ""It’s totally legit. No photoshopping."" PolitiFact ran reverse image searches and found no prior versions of the photo, with or without Mandel. Occupy Democrats did not respond to requests for comment but has since removed its post from Facebook.  PolitiFact also asked four digital forensics experts who know how to detect image manipulation about the social media allegations claiming that Mandel photoshopped his head onto the body of a Black soldier. All four said that the image as seen in Mandel’s ad, and the photo provided by his campaign, are both too low-quality to conduct a reliable, definitive analysis.  The ad version of the photo includes other possible inconsistencies related to its lighting and pixelation, but the quality is so low that it's impossible to determine whether they are the result of Photoshop, video compression or other factors, said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ""Analyzing the frame in the video isn't really possible because the image has been post-processed, converted to video, further post-processed, then compressed,"" said Matthew Stamm, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Drexel University. Stamm analyzed the other file that Mandel’s campaign shared with PolitiFact. He found ""no evidence of manipulation"" and said it seems ""very plausible that the image is real,"" but he also cautioned that his analysis ""isn’t really conclusive"" because that version of the image could have theoretically been altered and then printed, photographed and shared. A conclusive analysis would require the original photo in digital form, and the Mandel campaign said it does not have that. ""It’s an 18-year-old photo taken in Iraq that was printed,"" Guthrie said. The campaign did not provide information about the other people in the photo, and the Marine Corps said it was not able to do so. But if the photo shared by the campaign really is 18 years old, then ""that makes it less likely to have been digitally manipulated,"" Farid said. ""Visually comparing both versions, it is unlikely to me that the (version in the ad) was a result of Photoshop editing,"" added Siwei Lyu, a professor of computer science and engineering and the director of the UB Media Forensic Lab at the University of Buffalo. Occupy Democrats said Mandel doctored an image in a campaign ad but ""forgot to Photoshop the hands that clearly show he put his face on the body of a Black soldier."" The liberal group’s claim is based on social media users’ observations that Mandel’s hands appear darker than his face in a photo showing him beside Black soldiers in a recent ad.  No other evidence has conclusively substantiated the alleged photoshopping. The ad’s creator, meanwhile, said Mandel’s hands appeared darker in the ad because the photo had been vignetted in order to highlight the white text at the bottom directing viewers to Mandel’s website. A Mandel campaign spokesperson provided PolitiFact with a version of the photo in which Mandel’s hands and the lower half of the rest of the photo appear lighter and more consistent with the rest of the image. PolitiFact places the burden of proof on the speaker of the claim. Because the claim is unproven, we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809718C140>],/factchecks/2022/apr/07/occupy-democrats/no-evidence-josh-mandel-photoshopped-picture-black/

Construction is not resuming on hundreds of miles of border wall that Trump promised
","While in office, President Donald Trump didn’t fulfill his promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and make Mexico pay for it. So, is his successor now picking up the slack? That’s what one Facebook post would leave readers to believe. ""Biden changes his mind and now wants to resume building Trump’s wall,"" read the headline on an April 3 post that included a link to an April 2 story on the American Web Media website.

But the headline is misleading and gives the false impression that construction will commence on hundreds of miles of border wall that Trump promised. That’s not what’s happening. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is planning repair work on the existing border wall,  including closing gaps, cleaning up work sites and stabilizing eroding areas. The work will address ""life, safety, environmental and remediation requirements,"" the department said in a December 2021 press release. Regarding the gaps, ""in the scramble to build as quickly as possible before Biden took office, construction crews in several areas of southern Arizona skipped over locations that required additional engineering or custom wall panels,"" the Washington Post reported. Some gaps are a few feet across and others are much wider, and they have become crossing points for migrants and smugglers. In one area where remediation work is needed, demolition crews carved roads and gouged paths through the mountains in preparation for sections of the wall that were never built. Now, ""the abandoned border wall site is a liability for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with loose rocks and boulders sliding down the mountainsides,"" according to the Washington Post. On the day Biden was inaugurated, he signed an executive action that called for a pause of border wall construction with the goal of ending it. His campaign promises included saying that there would ""not be another foot"" of the wall constructed. The Texas Tribune reported on work underway on a 13-mile section of new construction in Texas. Critics noted that it looks like a border wall. But the government says it isn’t. It says earthen levees are being replaced with concrete levees topped with guard rails.

Vaccines are not linked to sudden death in any age group
","Even though vaccines are among the safest medical products, baseless claims about their safety continue to circulate widely on social media.

We noticed another post on Twitter that said, ""‘Sudden death’ for adults and ‘Sudden Infant Death’ for babies. BOTH ARE DEATH BY VACCINE."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of the platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

And research studies and safety reviews do not show any links between childhood vaccines and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The causes of SIDS are unknown, but many health professionals believe it is associated with a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood and low levels of oxygen. ""Since immunizations are given to about 90% of children less than 1 year of age, and about 1,600 cases of SIDS occur every year, it would be expected, statistically, that every year about 50 cases of SIDS will occur within 24 hours of receipt of a vaccine,"" according to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. ""However, because the incidence of SIDS is the same in children who do or do not receive vaccines, we know that SIDS is not caused by vaccines."" There are recommended ways to reduce an infant’s risk of SIDS, such as avoiding smoking during pregnancy, putting infants to sleep on their backs and adapting their sleep environment. Vaccines are tested in clinical trials prior to public use, and multiple systems are in place to monitor their safety after they are released for public use, according to the CDC. Those include the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the Vaccine Safety Datalink and the Clinical Immunization Assessment project. Serious adverse reactions to vaccination are rare, and the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks. A Twitter post says sudden death in adults and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome are caused by vaccines. Research studies, as well as safety and scientific reviews, have not found any links between childhood vaccines and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or between vaccination and deaths in people of any age — adults or children — except in rare cases.
