Did FDA regulations slow testing for the coronavirus?
","Accusations about the responsible party behind the United States’ struggle to accelerate coronavirus testing have come from every which way and the blame has fallen, often inaccurately, on the shoulders of different public officials. In a March 13 tweet, President Donald Trump said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied its testing system for decades but wasn’t prepared for a large scale pandemic, an issue that was complicated by policy changes made by former President Barack Obama.  U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., retweeted Trump’s remark and added his own comment: ""Trump is once again trying to blame the previous administration for the number of tests available. This is his #DailyLie.""  U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, retweeted Schumer’s remark and said: ""It’s not Obama’s fault and it’s not Trump’s fault. We have stringent FDA regulations, long in place, that created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly."" PolitiFact looked at a different Trump claim blaming Obama for a lack of testing and rated it False. We also looked at a Mostly False claim from Democrat Joe Biden about the Trump administration rejecting tests from the World Health Organization (they were never offered). Trump also inaccurately stated that any individual who wants to be tested for the coronavirus can get a test — we rated that statement Pants on Fire. We wanted to dig deeper into Crenshaw’s claim, which attributes the delays in the availability of widespread testing to Food and Drug Administration regulations. Justin Discigil, spokesman for Crenshaw, pointed to articles from ProPublica, the New Yorker, The Atlantic and the Washington Post, all of which highlighted the role FDA regulations played here. He added: ""Just to be clear – nowhere did we say that these regulations were the sole/only reason for the testing issue, we said that they created barriers."" A timeline of events The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States came at the end of January, when a man in Washington state developed symptoms after returning from a trip to Wuhan.  One month later, federal health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was inevitable that the U.S. would experience a spread of the virus and urged people to take precautions. In these early days of the virus, tests were not widely distributed to local and state laboratories. Instead, testing for the new coronavirus was conducted almost entirely by the CDC — samples collected at the local level were sent to the agency. Initial test kits developed by the CDC for use in local and state labs were flawed and produced inaccurate results in some labs, meaning they couldn’t be distributed. As the agency worked to correct the tests, health officials turned to the FDA.  The U.S. Association of Public Health Laboratories submitted a letter asking the agency to use ""enforcement discretion"" and authorize local and state labs to develop and use their own tests. During a public health emergency, labs and drug manufacturers must seek an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA to use diagnostic tests and medical treatments that have not gone through the typical clearance process — to share them faster in the emergency. (These authorizations were begun in 2004 under President George W. Bush.) For laboratory-developed tests, like the ones in question, FDA policy has stated that they cannot be used in clinical diagnoses without the FDA’s approval during an emergency.  Although the goal of these regulations is to ensure only accurate lab tests are conducted, health officials have said they prevented them from quickly responding to the virus. One doctor in a Seattle lab described the process for getting an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA and said the agency asked for a level of testing that didn’t make sense in the context of an emergency, according to a GQ profile. A doctor in North Carolina told NBC News that she had developed a test using the World Health Organization’s protocol but had yet to receive the use authorization from the FDA, putting the state ""way behind"" in its ability to test patients.  On Feb. 29, the FDA announced a change in the process: Labs would still need to seek the agency’s approval for their tests, but the labs could begin testing while waiting for the official green light. On March 16, (three days after Crenshaw made his claim) the FDA announced another change to its policies and put state officials in charge of coronavirus tests developed by laboratories in their states, meaning labs would engage with state officials and not the FDA. It also removes the requirement for these labs to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization for their tests. The changes also expand which labs and manufacturers are included in FDA guidelines and which kinds of tests can be developed. ""We believe the unprecedented policy set forth in today’s updated guidance, which addresses laboratories and commercial manufacturers, will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the number and variety of diagnostic tests, as well as available testing capabilities in health care settings, and reference and commercial laboratories,"" reads a release from the agency. After the changes After the FDA announced changes to its policies, Labcorps and Quest Diagnostics both announced plans to start testing for the new coronavirus, crediting changes in federal policy with their ability to do so.  ""We applaud the FDA for providing the flexibility for innovative, quality lab developed tests to be brought to patients and providers quickly to advance effective response to the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Steve Rusckowski, chairman and chief executive officer of Quest Diagnostics, in a statement. But even as state and local authorities move to ramp up testing, the number of available tests is still lacking.  In Austin, for example, there is still a gap between available test kids and demand for testing, as officials prioritize testing for health care workers, people living in nursing homes and people at high risk for complications from the virus. Our Ruling Crenshaw said in a tweet that longstanding FDA regulations ""created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly"" for the coronavirus. Crenshaw’s statement is accurate. FDA procedures adopted in 2004 meant laboratories had to seek the agency’s approval before developing and using tests in communities, a policy many health care officials have said prevented the country from taking early action in response to the novel coronavirus. It is important to keep in mind that other factors have contributed to the low levels of testing for the virus, beyond the FDA regulations. But Crenshaw’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/23/dan-crenshaw/did-fda-regulations-slow-testing-coronavirus/
"['Public Health', 'Wisconsin', 'Coronavirus', 'Facebook posts']","
Yes, Wisconsin is the only state where all Republicans opposed coronavirus bill
","In just over 24 hours, some 12,000 people shared a post from the Kenosha County Democratic party slamming the coronavirus vote by Wisconsin’s Republican congressional delegation. The emergency measure — which includes free testing for COVID-19, paid emergency leave and other emergency appropriations — easily passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 18, 2020. But it passed without much help from Wisconsin. The Kenosha Democrats seized on that fact in a March 19, 2020, Facebook post. The post explained the bill, commented on gerrymandering and noted the GOP no votes from purple Wisconsin went beyond the breakdown from even the deepest red of the red states.  It was accompanied by a graphic with pictures of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Reps. Mike Gallagher, Glenn Grothman, Jim Sensenbrenner and Bryan Steil that said this: ""WI is the ONLY state where all Republicans voted against protecting its citizens."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Let’s check it out. The bill passed 363-40 in the U.S. House and 90-8 in the U.S. Senate.  Indeed, all five Republicans in the Wisconsin delegation cast a no vote, according to roll calls published by ProPublica. All four state Democrats voted for the bill. And, yes, that clean sweep of Republican votes was unique around the country. In Oklahoma both Republican senators voted against the bill, but two of three Republican representatives supported it. Iowa’s lone Republican representative voted no, but both Republican senators there supported the bill. That leaves us to look at the characterization that Wisconsin Republicans ""voted against protecting (the state’s) citizens""? Like anything in politics, it’s more complicated than that. In various statements issued after the votes, the state’s Republican lawmakers didn’t object to the concept of providing help amid the pandemic, but they took issue with numerous specifics in the bill and how the process was handled. Sensenbrenner objected to spending money on a bill that he said stretched 100 pages and was presented with less than 30 minutes to review. ""We do not know the full cost of this legislation,"" he said in a statement. ""I am not a fan of passing bills to find out what is in them."" Steil told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he voted against the bill because it ""places a heavy government mandate on Wisconsin small businesses that are already suffering negative consequences from coronavirus."" Gallagher echoed those comments in a statement, saying he feared the bill would hurt small businesses. ""This bill, while well-intentioned, contains a number of unclear provisions that could force small businesses in Northeast Wisconsin to lay off workers or cause them to close their doors altogether,"" Gallagher said. ""Let me be clear: H.R. 6201 contained a number of good provisions like free testing that we’ve already successfully fought for. But I have serious questions as to whether the best way to support those needing paid and sick leave is through tax credits to small businesses instead of direct payments to those affected."" Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democratic Party, defended the description in the Facebook post. She said the bill guided both testing and treatment to help control the spread of the disease. ""A 'no' vote by our elected officials was a vote against protecting their constituents from this highly contagious disease which has already been deadly to residents in Wisconsin,"" she said in an email. A viral Facebook post said Wisconsin ""is the only state where all Republicans voted against protecting its citizens."" It is indeed the only state where all Republicans opposed the bill, which has now become law. But it’s a bit of an exaggeration to summarize their decisions as a vote ""against protecting (Wisconsin) citizens."" And of course this is expected to be just the first of many bills addressing the coronavirus fallout.  We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/20/facebook-posts/yes-wisconsin-only-state-where-all-republicans-opp/
"['New York', 'Coronavirus', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
Cuomo correctly says no quarantine without state approval
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo, trying to calm fears amid the spread of the novel coronavirus, told reporters there are no plans to issue quarantine measures for entire cities. And if mayors are talking about that, they can’t do it without state approval, he said.  ""Mitigation is continuing and is ramping up,"" Cuomo said on Tuesday. ""There are many rumors out there - part of the fear, the anxiety. People spread rumors. Well, maybe you're going to quarantine New York City. We hear New York City is going to quarantine itself. That is not true. That cannot happen. It cannot happen legally. No city in the state can quarantine itself without state approval, and I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city."" Later that day, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said city residents should prepare for a shelter-in-place order, though he said the decision needs to be ""made together with the state.""  De Blasio said that quarantine and shelter-in-place represent different approaches. ""Shelter in place, to me, is a kind of way of life, if you will, and a more total strategy and quarantine suggests when you're dealing with a very specific, narrow area and who goes in and who goes out of that area,"" he said.  In an interview on Wednesday with The Daily podcast, Cuomo said whatever it’s called, quarantine or shelter in place, he’s not interested.  ""That is not going to happen, shelter in place, for New York City,"" Cuomo said. ""For any city or county to take an emergency action, the state has to approve it. And I wouldn't approve shelter in place. That scares people, right? Quarantine in place - you can't leave your home. The fear, the panic is a bigger problem than the virus."" We wondered if a city or a county could unilaterally order its residents into isolation, whether by ordering a quarantine or shelter-in-place, or if Cuomo is right in his claim that only the state can do that. We spoke with Thomas Merrill, who retired in January as general counsel for the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.  ""It’s a complicated answer,"" Merrill said. ""Local governments have the authority under state law to enact curfews and take other emergency actions. But state law also gives the governor emergency powers, including the right to suspend any law or local order he feels impends a response. So ultimately the state likely has the final say,"" he said.  ""The practical answer is they have to be working together,"" Merrill said of local governments and the state.   He directed us to state Executive Law Section 24, which says that the New York State Legislature can override a local action, and Executive Law Section 29-A, which gives the governor power to override local laws or orders in a state emergency. In addition, Cuomo issued an executive order on March 7, requiring that local actions be approved.   Merrill was the top lawyer for the state Department of Health during the H1N1 pandemic, Ebola outbreak, and a recent measles outbreak. He said that during a quarantine, specific people are told that they are confined at home. In some cases, during an Ebola outbreak, police officers stood at patients’ doors to ensure they did not leave, he said. But with Covid-19, the novel coronavirus, the pandemic is past the phase when quarantines of specific patients would be effective in slowing the spread of the virus, he said.   Whether the directive is to ""shelter in place,"" which is common during an active shooter situation, or ""quarantine,"" the goal is that people socially distance themselves as much as possible, Merrill said.  Other experts we spoke with said the state has broad powers.  Generally, matters of public health are allocated to the state level, not the local level, said James A. Gardner, SUNY distinguished professor at the University at Buffalo. ""Generally, the state is in a better position than a locality to make defensible decisions that restrict public travel on health grounds,"" he said.  We reached out to Cuomo and de Blasio’s press offices but did not hear back.  However, de Blasio said in an interview on Wednesday morning with TODAY on NBC that any shelter in place order would need to be done in cooperation with the state.  ""It’s only a decision we would make with the state of New York, of course,"" de Blasio said.  Cuomo said that cities do not have the power to order quarantines without state approval.  Based on the powers of the state to override local orders contained in state Executive Law and in Cuomo’s recent executive order, we rate his claim True.   ",/factchecks/2020/mar/20/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-correctly-says-no-quarantine-without-state-a/
"['Marriage', 'Missouri', 'Adam Schnelting']","
Despite Schnelting claim, replacing marriage licenses with domestic union contracts would hurt benef
","Critics of a bill that would have replaced Missouri marriage licenses with ""contracts of domestic union"" said it was an end-run around the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.  The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Adam Schnelting, R-St. Charles, said he just wants the government out of the marriage business.  The bill, HB2173, which died in the House Rules Committee on March 5, also would have eliminated the mandate requiring a judge or minister to perform a ceremony solemnizing the marriage. Schnelting does not know whether he will reintroduce the bill in next year's session.  In pushing the changes in a Missouri Times op-ed last month, Schnelting wrote ""HB2173 does not alter state or federal benefits.""  We reached out to Schnelting and asked him how it could be guaranteed that domestic unions, which have no federal definition, could qualify for federal benefits. Schnelting responded that contracts of domestic union are the legal equivalent of marriage and ""treats everyone equally under the law.""  That’s a big claim. Our research shows it doesn’t pan out.  Problems begin with the phrase ""domestic union.""  The state and federal governments define marriage as a legal contract between two spouses. That contract opens the door to an expansive list of federal benefits including Social Security, Medicare, joint tax returns and employment benefits.  Schnelting and his bill define a domestic union as the legal equivalent of marriage. But there is no other state that recognizes that term.  So, let’s consider alternatives: Groups that condemn the bill for undermining marriage equality such as the Missouri chapter of The American Civil Liberties Union and PROMO, an LGBTQ advocacy group, have focused on existing terminology of ""domestic partnerships"" and  ""civil unions.""  Both include two individuals who consistently live together and have a personal relationship. These marriage-alternative unions were often utilized by same- sex couples seeking legal benefits prior to the 2015 Supreme Court ruling.  Unlike marriage, civil unions and domestic partnerships are not recognized in all 50 states. They are also not recognized by the federal government and thus are not eligible for most federal benefits. In states where domestic partnerships and civil unions are recognized, individuals can receive benefits that parallel those of marriage such as healthcare benefits from employers. These benefits differ greatly by state.  Following the Supreme Court ruling, several states including New Hampshire, Delaware and Connecticut converted all civil unions into marriages. Domestic unions, like civil unions and domestic partnerships, are not recognized under federal law, so eligibility for federal benefits depends on the state.  For example, the United States Social Security Administration’s website states it recognizes ""some"" civil unions and domestic partnerships for determining entitlement  to Medicare, Social Security and Social Security Income. However, it recognizes marriages in all states. The Department of State also does not consider individuals in domestic partnerships or civil unions as spouses for immigration purposes.  Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service does not consider civil unions or domestic partnerships as married for purposes of federal tax benefits. These marriage alternative unions cannot apply for joint tax returns.  We couldn’t find any example of marriage benefits specific to Missouri that would be affected.  Schnelting wrote that replacing marriage licenses with domestic union contracts ""does not alter state or federal benefits."" While domestic unions could be recognized in Missouri as legally equivalent to marriage, there is no guarantee that the other states would recognize the union, or the dissolution of the union as such. And, with no federal definition, there is also nothing in federal law qualifying domestic unions for the expansive list of spousal benefits, privileges and rights.   With that, we rate this claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2020/mar/20/adam-schnelting/despite-schnelting-claim-replacing-marriage-licens/
"['Coronavirus', 'Marco Rubio']","
Young people are being hospitalized for COVID-19, too. Let’s look at the numbers
","With plenty of college students congregating for spring break, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warned on Twitter that coronavirus is not only afflicting the elderly. ""We only have 3 months of information on  #Covid_19,"" Rubio tweeted March 19 to his 4 million followers. ""We have created the perception that younger people have nothing to worry about. We now need to stop saying that. In the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35. In France half of those in the ICU are under 65."" We only have 3 months of information on #Covid_19We have created the perception that younger people have nothing to worry about. We now need to stop saying that.In the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35.In France half of those in the ICU are under 65. Rubio’s overall point that younger people are vulnerable has merit. But his U.S. number is wrong. For the record, his numbers on France were correct. The head of France’s national health agency said March 15 that 50% of people in intensive care are under 60 or under age 65. But we wanted to focus on the U.S. numbers. Experts warn that U.S. hospitalization data is preliminary, which means the numbers could change in the coming weeks as testing becomes more widespread. One day before Rubio’s tweet, the CDC reported there were 508 patients known to have been hospitalized as a result of coronavirus. The hospitalizations represented 12% of U.S. cases between Feb. 12 and March 16. The data did not include an age group breakdown specific to those under 35. What the CDC did report was that 20% of those hospitalized were ages 20-44, and 18% were 45-54. If we add up those two age groups, we get a total of 38%. We asked Rubio’s spokespersons if that was the 38% he was referencing, but we did not get a response. Major news outlets including the New York Times and NPR used that 38% statistic to point out that younger populations are also vulnerable to coronavirus. That’s an important message amid spring break, as some college students have ignored the recommendations to avoid large gatherings and have poured onto beaches in Florida, leading many counties or cities to close beaches.  The CDC data shows that the elderly have the highest fatality rate. The March 18 report by the CDC states that the figures are based on preliminary data and include several limitations, including that data on age and outcomes, including hospitalization, were missing for between 9% and 53% of the cases. Also, further follow-up is needed to determine the outcomes among active cases and data on other risk factors, including if patients had underlying health conditions. ""At the current point, the data is too fluid to have confidence in the accuracy of any statement regarding how COVID-19 affects different age groups,"" said Volker Mai, a University of Florida epidemiologist. However, Mai said, it’s important to clear up any misperception that young people are immune from the disease. Younger populations are at risk of contracting COVID-19, especially young people with underlying conditions. ""Since we are just at the start of the epidemic here, we don’t have enough data to make strong conclusions about age-specific risk of serious illness and/or death in the U.S. yet,"" said Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, in an email. The reason, Prins said, is a lack or lag in testing Rubio tweeted ""in the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35."" We could not find any current data that matches Rubio’s tweet. It is possible that he was citing widely reported data that included people up to age 54. The CDC reported that 20% of the hospitalizations were ages 20-44 and 18% were 45-54. But the data is preliminary, so it’s challenging to draw conclusions at this stage about the ages of people hospitalized.  Rubio’s office didn’t get back to us but we have to wonder if the mistake in his tweet amounted to a simple transcription error. Rubio does have a point that younger people are vulnerable to coronavirus — it’s not only older people who have been hospitalized. But because the data point is wrong, we rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/20/marco-rubio/young-people-are-being-hospitalized-covid-19-too-l/
"['Facebook Fact-checks', 'Coronavirus', 'Chain message']","
Chain message is wrong about the National Guard, military and a nationwide quarantine
","In the past few days, several state and local governments have taken drastic action to try to contain the spread of the 2019 coronavirus.  In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced March 19 a statewide ""shelter in place"" order. On March 20, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all nonessential businesses to keep their employees home. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has ordered all restaurants to close except for takeout and delivery. One popular chain message takes these measures a step further. ""Homeland security is preparing to mobilize the national guard. Preparing to dispatch them across the US with military,"" reads the message, which claims it was sent by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. ""They will also call in 1st responders. They are preparing to announce a nationwide 2 week quarantine for all citizens, All businesses closed."" (Screenshot from iMessage) A reader sent us the message on March 19. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted a screenshot of a very similar text on March 20. ""Here we go again with the ‘my friend whose dad works in the government’ rumors,"" he said. We’ve seen several other chain messages that falsely claim the federal government is set to announce a nationwide quarantine to stem the spread of COVID-19. So we checked this one out, too. The text contains kernels of truth, but its primary message is bogus.  There is no evidence that the federal government is set to announce a lockdown like the ones seen in France, Italy and Spain. While the National Guard and the military have been dispatched to some areas of the country hard-hit by the coronavirus, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor FEMA have ordered them to. And the message misinterprets the Stafford Act, a federal disaster relief law that activates FEMA and sends aid to state and local governments. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he is not considering a nationwide quarantine or curfew. He first answered a question about it during a March 16 press conference and reiterated his point in another briefing the following day. ""It’s a very big step. It’s something we talk about, but we haven’t decided to do that,"" he said. More recently, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned misinformation about lockdowns during a March 20 press conference. ""Just urge everyone as they’re seeing information — information that at one time suggested that somehow this virus emanated from the United States Army, information about lockdowns that are taking place — every American, indeed people all around the world, should ensure that where they turn to for information is a reliable source and not a bad actor trying to create and flow information that they know is wrong,"" he said. RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic One of the first places where officials did mandate a lockdown is New Rochelle, N.Y., where Cuomo ordered a one-mile containment zone on March 10. Large gathering spots were closed for 14 days and National Guard troops are delivering food to people at the request of the state. In California, nonessential businesses — such as bars, dine-in restaurants and gyms — are closed as part of the statewide lockdown. The state has also asked the U.S. Navy for a hospital ship and two mobile hospitals to help treat COVID-19 patients. State and local governments retain the power to quarantine Americans within their own borders. On the federal level, the Department of Homeland Security can screen and quarantine individuals reentering the U.S. from other countries. But forced quarantines are historically rare, and most infected people are allowed to self-quarantine. As for the Stafford Act, Trump invoked the law March 13, thereby authorizing aid for state and local governments grappling with the coronavirus and waiving certain regulations that impede access to health care. The Stafford Act is commonly used during hurricanes and does not necessitate a nationwide lockdown. The chain message is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Trump beat Obama’s Iowa caucus turnout, but turnout record claim needs explaining
","Team Trump is telling supporters that President Donald Trump received record support from party voters during the Iowa caucuses.  ""Did you see President Trump’s RECORD TURNOUT? Iowa - 32,389 Republicans. New Hampshire - 151,602 Republicans,"" Brad Parscale, the Trump 2020 campaign manager, wrote in a Feb. 25 tweet.  It followed the theme from Trump on Twitter earlier in the month, just after the Iowa presidential precinct caucuses, when the president wrote that he had ""the largest re-election vote in the history of that great state, by far."" Also, after the Iowa caucuses, the Iowa Republican Party sent a press release claiming that Trump broke turnout records set by former president Barack Obama in 2012 and that the caucuses had ""smashed turnout records for similar caucus years.""  Did Trump set a record in Iowa? Aaron Britt, communications director for the Iowa Republican Party wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan the ""smashing turnout records for similar caucus years"" claim referred to ""caucus turnout in general for years with an incumbent president.""  Britt said turnout for the Republican caucuses in 2004 when George W. Bush was the incumbent totaled around 7,000, and around 4,800 Republicans turned out in 1992, when George H.W Bush was the incumbent.  Turnout for the Republican caucuses this year in Iowa totaled 32,340. That compares with an estimate of more than 25,000 when Barack Obama was the incumbent in 2012, according to a statement from Sue Dvorsky, who chaired the Iowa Democratic Party then.  Trump received 97% of support in the Iowa caucuses, according to the Iowa Republican Party. Challenger Bill Weld received one pledged delegate from Iowa. In 2012, Obama received 99% of delegates, with 1% of delegates committed to undecided.  We found Trump, his campaign and the Iowa GOP were accurate in claiming that turnout for Trump was higher on the Republican side than that from Democrats for Obama in 2012 and also for recent Republican incumbents — George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush — in Republican caucuses, and for Democratic incumbent Bill Clinton in 1996. The tweet included New Hampshire, where Trump set a record turnout for an incumbent. But the broad statement of smashing turnout records from Iowa requires qualifiers like the one Britt provided when asked. That’s because news reports from previous caucuses show in years when an incumbent was not running far exceed the 2020 Republican turnout. In 2012, more than 122,000 Republicans voted during their caucuses, the Des Moines Register reported.  While Trump’s campaign encouraged Iowa Republicans to show their support for the president at the caucuses, preference votes weren’t taken at the caucuses for the uncontested nominations for incumbents Ronald Reagan in 1984, George H.W. Bush in 1992 and George W. Bush in 2004.  Democrats still caucused when their incumbents ran, and Obama supporters could point to their candidate’s 99% support from Iowa Democrats in 2012 as being more than 97% for Trump from Republicans. Bill Clinton could do the same with his 98% support in 1996. David Redlawsk, a University of Delaware political science professor who has researched Iowa’s caucus evolving history in person for several elections, said preference polls have not been taken at every caucus for an incumbent candidate. ""It’s fairly rare for the incumbent party to even have an active caucus,"" he said. ""That’s ultimately the problem of that claim. Historically, when the party holds the caucus there was no real vote.""  And there’s this: Incumbent Jimmy Carter was opposed by Edward Kennedy in the 1980 Iowa Democratic caucuses, which news reports from then say drew about 100,000 participants. Carter won 59% of the delegate support that year, which could be construed to be support from about 59,000 attendees.
  Dave Nagle, a former Iowa Democratic Party chair and former U.S. congressman from Iowa, said in a Daily Iowan interview the 59,000 figure for Carter sounds about right but that he could not be 100% sure. Redlawsk also said that figure would be reasonably accurate. Donna Hoffman, a University of Northern Iowa political science professor, said determining turnout in an incumbent year can be difficult, especially in cases where no straw poll is taken.  ""If you look at 2004, when George W. Bush was the incumbent, the Republicans didn’t even take a poll,"" Hoffman said. ""So any estimates there would be ballpark … in my notes I don’t even have an estimate in terms of Republican turnout.""  Hoffman said another problem with comparing caucus turnout is that, before 2020, Democratic caucuses did not report an exact turnout number — just an estimate based on the number of state delegate equivalents. ""It’s a little bit comparing apples to oranges because the Democrats are not reporting a vote like the Republicans do,"" Hoffman said.  University of Iowa political science Professor Timothy Hagle said Republican turnout this year likely was driven by Trump encouraging Republicans to turn out to caucus, which not all incumbent candidates have done.  ""If you look back at some of the other candidates …. they weren’t really trying to get people to turn out — it wasn’t necessarily an indication of how energized the base was,"" Hagle said about incumbents seeking re-election during the Iowa caucuses. ""What happened that was a little bit different this time is that the Trump campaign was actually trying to get people to turn out because they wanted it to look good, they wanted to have good turnout here and New Hampshire.""  The Trump campaign said that Trump garnered record support in the Iowa caucuses. Republican turnout for Trump topped turnout for Barack Obama in 2012 in terms of numbers but not for the percentage of votes cast by those turning out. Jimmy Carter’s 59% support of 100,000 attendees would be the record for an incumbent, though we don’t know a precise number because of the lack of records for that. Trump’s Iowa turnout did not smash records for a nonincumbent caucus. Turnout in 2020 for the Democrats was 176,000 in 2020, around 171,000 in 2012, and 238,000 in 2008, according to the Associated Press.   The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True. ",/factchecks/2020/mar/20/brad-parscale/trump-beat-obamas-iowa-caucus-turnout-turnout-reco/

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the one-on-one debate, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders used the term ""day one"" seven times, according to a transcript.  Biden, however, did not use it once.  Biden was speaking quickly during the debate and his words were not as precise as they have been at other times. But when we reached out to his campaign, a spokesperson clarified Biden’s intent.   Here’s exactly what Biden said on oil drilling: ""Number one, no more subsidies for fossil fuel industry. No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one."" Taken literally, the former vice president’s debate comments could be read to mean that he would end oil drilling. Or it could mean that he would not allow any new drilling, which is how the Biden campaign described the candidate’s position.   Biden’s campaign pointed us to the policy on Biden’s campaign website of ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters."" It says nothing about drilling on private land. On fracking, the process of blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals into shale rock miles underground to extract natural gas, Biden said: ""No more — no new fracking."" Moments later, he repeated ""no more drilling on federal lands."" A Biden campaign spokesman clarified afterward that Biden wouldn’t ban fracking — he was referring only to his stated policy to ban new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore, the Wall Street Journal reported. A Facebook post says Biden ""just announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration."" In a CNN debate, Biden said ""no more drilling"" for oil. Taken literally, that could be interpreted to mean he supports ending oil drilling. But he did not use the words ""shut down"" and his stated position has been to ban new oil drilling on federal lands and water, not end ongoing work. Biden was more clear in his debate statements regarding natural gas, saying he would not allow any new fracking.  He did not say he would take either step on day one as president.  For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/20/facebook-posts/debate-joe-biden-said-no-more-oil-drilling-and-no-/
"['Wisconsin', 'David Crowley']","
David Crowley says opponent Chris Larson hasn’t passed any bills in the Legislature. That’s not true
","The coronavirus is affecting nearly all aspects of our lives, but the wheels of democracy grind  on. Milwaukee County voters will still (at this point) be tasked April 7, 2020 with choosing a new county executive — and state Rep. David Crowley says voters should factor in how effective he and state Sen. Chris Larson have been as lawmakers. In a March 11, 2020, debate on WISN-TV, both Milwaukee Democrats were asked what sets them apart from their opponent. Crowley said this: ""The biggest difference is that I’ve actually been able to be effective in the state Legislature,"" he said. ""I’ve passed more bills than Sen. Larson has, because if I’m not mistaken he hasn’t passed any."" Is he right? It turns out that – just like deciding whether Minnesota or Wisconsin has the most lakes — it’s all about how you define the term. Bills passed is an interesting place for Crowley to plant his political flag, given that neither he nor Larson has been exactly prolific. Larson has been in office since 2011, and Crowley since 2017. Both the Assembly and Senate have been under Republican control since 2011, meaning slim odds for bills from Crowley, Larson or any other Democrat. Spokesman Garren Randolph said Crowley’s claim referred to bills signed into law on which the legislators were the ""lead author."" Bills can originate in either the Assembly or the Senate, and they must have at least one author or sponsor in each chamber. Other lawmakers in favor of the legislation can also sign on as coauthors or cosponsors. Crowley here is referring to only the first author in the originating house. By that tally, Crowley comes out ahead: 1-0. He was the lead sponsor on a bill enacted in April 2018 that provided a $210,000 grant for a nonprofit organization to set up a website and phone system to provide referrals for community-based services and crisis intervention. It passed unanimously in both chambers. The grant continued an existing program administered by 2-1-1 Wisconsin. So it didn’t create anything new — but it was a bill, and it was authored by Crowley, and it passed. Larson, indeed, has not been the lead author on any bills passed into law. But Crowley’s definition is narrower than the authorship criteria used by the state. The nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau maintains an ""author index"" of all legislation. The bureau’s requirement for authorship is established by a Joint Rule of the Legislature. It says lawmakers are listed as the author if they are one of the first two authors in the originating house or the first cosponsor in the other house. By that criteria, both Crowley and Larson have passed three bills into law, according to the author indexes from the 2019, 2017, 2015, 2013 and 2011 sessions. Here those bills are with their official description: Crowley  AB779 — the referral grant referenced above (2017 session)  AB780 — Relating to notice to a school of a permanency review or hearing, notice to a school district of a foster home or group home license or out-of-home care placement, and transfer of pupil records (2017) SB99— Relating to venue requirements for domestic abuse, child abuse, and harassment cases (2017) Larson SB700 — Relating to creating a fee schedule for certain laboratories (2019) SB99 — Relating to designating and marking the Richard A. Grobschmidt Memorial Bridge (2017) SB512 — Relating to deposits on the sale of certain lead acid batteries (2013) Crowley claimed he has ""passed more bills than Sen. Larson has, because ... he hasn’t passed any."" Crowley’ staff leaned on a narrow definition of authorship — only the first author in the chamber where the bill originated. If we consider authorship as being the person primarily responsible for a bill, Crowley has a point. But his claim didn’t specify such a strict definition, and he’s referring to a subject where the state already has an official definition. Under the state standard, both Crowley and Larson have passed three bills. We define Mostly False as having an element of truth but ignoring critical facts that would give a different impression. And that’s how we rate Crowley’s claim.",/factchecks/2020/mar/20/david-crowley/david-crowley-says-chris-larson-hasnt-passed-bills/

No, sunlight has not been proven to kill coronavirus
","As the nation tries to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, politicians are offering tips of their own. U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican, is one of them. Murphy is a physician who won the seat in a special election last year after longtime congressman Walter Jones passed away. Murphy has been posting videos on Twitter, wherein he explains the effects of the virus and the federal government’s response. In a video posted March 16, Murphy stands next to a white board wearing his scrubs. Most of his tips are on-point. He says cold weather won’t kill the novel coronavirus (true). He says gargling hot water doesn’t kill coronavirus (also true). But Murphy also says this. ""Sunlight actually can kill the virus. But we have to be cautious about that. It’s good to be out in the sun, but away at a distance from each other,"" Murphy says. Is that true? We reached out to Murphy but didn’t receive a response. So we did our own research. As it turns out, PolitiFact has already reported on a variation of this claim. Sunlight has not been proven to kill the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. This is one of many unverified claims about the novel coronavirus. At first, the reasoning might make sense. There is, in fact, some evidence that viruses don’t like heat. ""The droplets that carry viruses do not stay suspended in humid air as long, and the warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,"" Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, recently told Time Magazine.  But, at this point, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control isn’t sure the sun or heat will affect COVID-19 the same way. CDC physician and researcher Nancy Messionnier said on Feb. 12 that ""it’s premature to assume"" the heat and sunlight will temper the virus. ""We haven’t been through even a single year with this pathogen,"" she told NPR. Sun exposure can also raise a person’s vitamin D levels, potentially reducing the incidence of acute respiratory infection, Harvard University professor Marc Lipsitch wrote in his recent paper: ""Seasonality of SARS-CoV-2: Will COVID-19 go away on its own in warmer weather?"" But, Lipsitch wrote, ""On the other hand, we found that this effect was unlikely to be a large factor in the variation in influenza incidence between summer and winter."" Neither the World Health Organization nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control list sunlight exposure as a method for preventing the coronavirus. In fact, on its ""mythbusters"" webpage, the WHO says COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, ""including areas with hot and humid weather."" One reason people might believe sunlight can kill the virus is because sunlight contains ultraviolet light. In Rep. Murphy’s video, he stands next to a white board that mentions UV light from the sun.  High-intensity UV light can indeed kill viruses. But natural sunlight doesn’t provide the UV light intensity needed to kill the virus, according to Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health. ""Exposing surfaces to plain sunlight should not be considered sanitation,"" she said, adding: ""I would never ever, ever rely on sunlight to kill coronavirus."" Graham’s claim about UV light is supported by Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  To kill a virus, temperatures must rise to about 140 degrees fahrenheit, Bloomfield told the BBC.  Murphy said ""sunlight actually can kill the virus."" This claim has not been proven true. His whiteboard mentioned UV light in sunlight. But experts claim the UV rays in sunlight aren’t intense enough to COVID-19. We found no conclusive evidence that someone could prevent the virus by exposing themselves to the sun for long periods of time. And we found no evidence that sunlight exposure could help an infected person defeat the virus.

Novel coronavirus could live up to 3 days, depending on the surface
","The No. 1 thing Americans can do to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is wash their hands. That’s because you can contract the virus by touching surfaces that have the respiratory droplets of an infected person on them. But how long can coronavirus germs live on those surfaces? An infographic from KIRO-TV in Seattle offers some clarity. According to the graphic, which was published March 18 on Facebook, the coronavirus can live for ""up to 3 hours in the air, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, the latest research backs it up — so keep washing your hands and disinfecting your home. The graphic cites an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17. Researchers tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard. ""SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),"" the authors wrote. ""SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard."" Aside from air, the worst surface for the virus is copper; researchers could only detect viable virus particles there for up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel — up to three days. It’s worth noting that the article is not a peer-reviewed study, and researchers tested the lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 in a lab setting. But their findings reflect what others have found about the potential longevity of the coronavirus outside the body.  How Long Coronavirus Stays Active on Surfaces⁠ ⁠ A new unpublished, un-peer reviewed analysis has received some attention in recent days for its findings that the #COVID19 virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours, on copper for up to 4 hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel up to 2 to 3 days. ⁠ ⁠ To date, there have been no published studies specifically looking at the novel #Coronavirus but there was research published this past February in The Journal of Hospital Infection which analyzed several dozen previously published papers on human coronaviruses. While it did not include #COVID_19, it may provide a better idea of how long this pathogen can survive outside of the body. ⁠ ⁠ The authors concluded that if this new coronavirus resembles other human coronaviruses, such as its ""cousins"" that cause #SARS and #MERS, it can stay on surfaces — such as metal, glass or plastic — for as long as nine days. ⁠ ⁠ This is in comparison to flu viruses which can last on surfaces for only about 48 hours.⁠ ⁠ But there are some important caveats to consider. Some #coronavirus don't remain active for as long at temperatures higher than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). ⁠ ⁠ The authors also found that coronaviruses can be effectively wiped away by common household disinfectants. ⁠ ⁠ For now that is the best information we have.⁠ ⁠ To follow the continually updated coronavirus dashboard, tap the link in our bio and bookmark the page.⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ A post shared by  Medscape (@medscape) on Mar 17, 2020 at 2:29am PDT An article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about how long human coronaviruses can survive on different surfaces. The authors found that viruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19, could live for a couple of days on steel, plastic, wood, paper and glass surfaces. What about money, which many Americans handle every day? The World Health Organization advises people to wash their hands with soap and water after handling banknotes, coins and credit cards. The Journal of Hospital Infection article says human coronaviruses could live on paper for anywhere between one to five days. The U.S. Dollar is made up of 75% cotton and 25% linen, as opposed to wood pulp, which is the base for most paper. Still, you’re probably safer handling coins. The New England Journal of Medicine article found that COVID-19 can only survive for up to four hours on copper, which is what quarters, nickels and dimes are primarily made of. Ironically, pennies are made primarily of zinc, although they have a copper exterior. Based on the information available, KIRO-TV’s infographic is accurate.

Post on black voter turnout in swing states gets the numbers right
","A viral Facebook post singles out Milwaukee as one of a handful of cities where large numbers of black voters didn’t vote. The image, shared from numerous different sources, is usually accompanied by some kind of call for black voters to get to the polls. It lists several states with narrow margins in the 2016 election and black turnout in their large cities. For Wisconsin it says, ""(President Donald) Trump won Wisconsin by 23,000 votes … in Milwaukee, 93,000 blacks didn’t vote."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Here’s what we found. The graphic is a screenshot from a Feb. 26, 2020, opinion piece in the New York Times by Karthik Balasubramanian, an information systems professor who worked for the Barack Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012. The numbers are consistent with the story, but they are presented without context.  The various versions of the graphic we saw didn’t include the header explaining this was based on the 2016 election — though that’s implied by the Trump reference — or the statistical note that the data is based on metropolitan statistical areas (cities plus surrounding areas), not just cities as the labels on the graphic imply. Most were also missing the bottom state or two, presumably because they don’t fit on a typical phone screen. The victory margin figures are accurate. The black turnout numbers are a little squishier. There isn’t firm data on turnout by race since voter registration doesn’t capture that data, so the figures on the right side of the graphic are an estimate based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey that breaks down race and voter participation by state and the demographic makeup of each city. Nationwide, the Census found black voter turnout was 59.6% in 2016, down sharply from 66.6% in 2012 — and the lowest black turnout rate since 2000. The 2016 rate was lower than white voters (65.3% of whom turned out) but higher than other minority groups. In 2012, black voters had a higher turnout than white voters for the first time, according to the Census.  Of course, many people of other races did not vote as well, but the thrust of the message was to boost African American turnout in the 2020 election. A Facebook post says Trump won Wisconsin by 23,000 votes, while in Milwaukee alone 93,000 blacks didn’t vote. It makes a similar comparison for a series of other states decided by close margins in 2016, including Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Those numbers are in line with what the story reported. But the screenshotted graphic leaves off the statistical detail that the numbers include the surrounding area for each city, and doesn’t specify that these numbers reflect only 2016.

Canadian government doesn’t separate children from parents due to gender identity disputes
","When lawmakers in Ontario, Canada updated the province’s child welfare laws in 2017, some social media users and news sites misconstrued the effects of the legislation. Some of those claims are now resurfacing online. On April 24, an Instagram post shared a screenshot of an October 2017 article headlined: ""Canada’s new law allows government to take children away if parents don’t accept kids’ ‘gender identity.’"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The 2017 Child, Youth and Family Services Act sought to strengthen and modernize the province’s child welfare services. Among the key changes: Eligibility for child protective services raised from 16 years old to 18; Services had to be more inclusive and culturally relevant for young people, including Indigenous and Black children and youth; Greater focus on early intervention to prevent children and parents from reaching crisis situations at home; and Improved accountability and oversight for child and youth service providers. The law also expanded the list of factors to be considered by child protection workers when determining the best interest of a child and whether they should be placed in foster care. The terms ""gender identity"" and ""gender expression"" were added and given the same protections as race, ethnicity, citizenship, creed, disability, sex and sexual orientation, among other factors. This change aligned the child welfare laws with Ontario’s human rights code. The Instagram post grossly exaggerated what this change would mean for children and parents in Ontario. Ontario’s Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services told PolitiFact that ""child protection workers cannot remove children from their families solely on the basis of a parent refusing to accept a child’s gender identity or expression."" The ministry oversees the child welfare system, but child protection services are provided exclusively by children’s aid societies, which are nongovernmental, independent legal entities. Each children's aid society is governed by a board of directors that is elected by the local community it serves. Children’s aid societies are required to assess and verify all reports of child abuse and neglect, according to the ministry. During an investigation, an aid society must determine whether there are reasonable and probable grounds that the child is in need of protection. These grounds include physical harm, sexual abuse, emotional harm and neglect. If an aid society receives a report that a child is in need of protection because their parent did not accept the child’s gender identity or expression, then the society would open an investigation to determine if the parent’s conduct amounts to abuse or neglect. If a judge determines that’s the case, the aid society would intervene. ""The government can’t take a child away from a parent,"" Michael Coteau, who introduced this law in 2017 when serving as Ontario’s Minister of Children and Youth Services, told PolitiFact. It is children’s aid societies that can take a child away from their parents — if a judge determines the child has been abused, said Coteau, who now serves as a member of Canada’s Parliament. The 2017 article cited in the Instagram post has since been taken down. An archived version of the article shows it quoted information from an article published by the now-defunct, conservative news site Heat Street. An Instagram post claimed, ""Canada’s new law allows government to take children away if parents don’t accept kids’ ‘gender identity.’"" Child protection services are provided by independent children’s aid societies, not the Canadian government.

Sean Hannity falsely credits conservative Twitter follower gains to lifting of ‘shadow ban’
","Soon after Tesla CEO Elon Musk struck a deal to buy Twitter, many prominent users of the platform noticed dramatic swings in the number of followers they had. Several outspoken conservatives gained thousands of followers. On the left, some lost followers in droves. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, gained more than 50,000 new followers the day after Musk’s April 25 announcement, according to Social Blade, a social media analytics tracker. Former President Barack Obama, the most followed person on Twitter, dropped thousands of followers in the same time. A USA Today analysis of the official congressional Twitter accounts for 529 members of the House and Senate found that 72% of the Republican accounts picked up followers in the 24 hours after the announcement, while all but two Democratic accounts lost followers. Twitter said in a statement to PolitiFact and other news organizations that the follower count fluctuations in either direction were because of new accounts signing up and existing accounts deactivating, rather than any company action. But that answer hasn’t satisfied everyone. On his primetime TV show, Fox News host Sean Hannity offered a different explanation for the boosts to conservative accounts — one involving a nefarious Silicon Valley conspiracy. ""It's almost as if Twitter employees lifted a broad anti-conservative, anti-Trump shadow ban, which we all knew was taking place anyway, in an effort to cover their tracks before the new boss takes over,"" Hannity said in the April 27 segment. ""Now, Twitter claims that there's nothing nefarious at play here, but they've said that all before.""   Shadow-banning, generally speaking, means making someone’s posts invisible to everyone but them or otherwise limiting their reach on the internet. The Fox News host, whose own Twitter account gained more than 165,000 followers in the three days after Twitter announced Musk’s purchase, referenced the company’s decision shortly before the 2020 presidential election to limit sharing options on an unverified New York Post story about a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden. But Hannity provided no evidence to prove that the bumps to conservatives’ follower counts happened because Twitter employees had lifted a ""shadow ban"" — or that the platform had ever been systematically suppressing conservative accounts in such a way.  A Fox News spokesperson pointed to the USA Today analysis of the follower count fluctuations. ""We don’t have any systematic studies providing evidence of a shadow ban,"" said Anjana Susarla, a Michigan State University professor who has studied information systems, social media analytics and the economics of artificial intelligence. ""It does appear that the fluctuations are organic and driven by shifts in the user base of Twitter."" Caroline Orr Bueno, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Maryland who has looked into the recent follower count changes, said what she and other online researchers have seen suggests that conservatives added followers because people responded to the Musk news by joining Twitter, creating new accounts or logging into old accounts that were long dormant.  Orr Bueno told PolitiFact that she reviewed preliminary data on the Twitter followers behind a number of accounts belonging to conservative political figures and media outlets such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Breitbart News. Of those who newly followed those accounts in the 24 hours after the Musk deal became public, about 60% had created their profiles that week.  ""This does not support the idea that the increase in followers among many top conservative accounts was due to accounts being reinstated or ‘surfaced’ after being shadowbanned,"" Orr Bueno said.  There is also no evidence that Twitter changed any policies following the announcement of the Musk takeover, Orr Bueno said. In fact, various news organizations reported that Twitter had locked down its employees’ abilities to make changes to the platform in light of the acquisition.  The Twitter page of Elon Musk is seen on a computer in Sausalito, Calif., on April 25, 2022. (AP) Hannity’s claim echoes years of accusations from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, that Twitter has shadow banned their content. Those allegations ramped up in 2018, after Vice reported that Twitter was limiting the visibility of some prominent Republicans in the automatic drop-down lists that generate when users start typing in the platform’s search bar.  But Twitter attributed the autofilling problem detailed in the Vice report to a glitch and quickly fixed it. Shortly after, then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called into Hannity’s radio show and told him, ""We do not shadow ban according to political ideology or viewpoint or content. Period.""  The company’s website says the same: ""Simply put, we don’t shadow ban! Ever."" Some recent research has supported that stance, including a 2021 New York University study that called conservative allegations of censorship ""unfounded.""  One Twitter study from 2021 found that right-leaning news outlets were algorithmically amplified more than left-leaning news outlets, and that tweets from right-leaning accounts outpace tweets from left-leaning accounts in the U.S. and other countries. The study was peer-reviewed. An April study from researchers at Yale University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Exeter followed 9,000 accounts, half Republican and half Democrat, for six months. The authors found that Republican accounts were more likely to be suspended, but they said the divide was not conclusive evidence of ""political bias"" because ""users’ misinformation sharing was as predictive of suspension as was their political orientation."" ""I know of no academic research that concludes there is a strong systemic bias — liberal or conservative — in how social media platforms identify what to show to users or in how they enforce their terms of service in content moderation decisions,"" Steven L. Johnson, associate professor of commerce at the University of Virginia, told PolitiFact in March. Some Republicans, including Trump, have had accounts suspended, restricted, or marked with fact-checking labels. But those penalties have generally resulted from specific violations of Twitter’s community guidelines, including its rules around spreading COVID-19 misinformation. Twitter also has policies against spam and platform manipulation, the enforcement of which has in the past led some users to notice sharp and sometimes sudden drops in their follower counts. Hannity said that conservatives gained Twitter followers after the company announced its deal with Musk because ""Twitter lifted a broad anti-conservative, anti-Trump shadow ban."" Hannity provided no evidence that right-leaning accounts on Twitter were subject to a shadow ban before Musk agreed to buy the company, or that prominent conservatives saw their follower counts spike because such a ban was ""lifted"" as employees ""cover(ed) their tracks.""  Twitter locked down employees’ abilities to make changes to its platform after announcing the deal with Musk, according to news reports.  The company said that the follower count fluctuations were organic, triggered by people creating and deactivating accounts.

No proof that Ukraine President Zelenskyy owns a $35 million home in Florida
","A Facebook post shared false claims about Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including the allegation that he owns a $35 million home in Florida. The April 17 post was shared by Nicolas Tetrault, a former Canadian politician, and features a TikTok video of a screenshot of another social media post.   ""The president of Ukraine owns a 35 million dollar home in Florida, and has $1.2 billion in [an] overseas bank account,"" the post in the TikTok video read. ""Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of 11 million dollars."" The post implies Zelenskyy misappropriated Ukrainian aid money to buy the homes and planes.   In a caption with the video, Tetrault echoed the post’s sentiments and also falsely claimed Zelenskyy was the cousin of billionaire philanthropist George Soros — which PolitiFact rated Pants on Fire. Tetrault’s post has since been deleted, but it’s a claim that still circulates on social media. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video does not provide proof to back up its claims, and the TikTok account that shared it no longer exists. The earliest mention of the claim we could find on the internet was from a post on Feb. 23, 2022, on a website called EPrimeFeed. The site appears to only publish posts written by anonymous authors, and the claim was published the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The post only cites the Nezygar channel on the messaging app Telegram as the source of the claim and offers no other evidence to corroborate the allegation. A 2018 investigation by the investigative journalism site Proekt found the Nezygar channel was controlled by the Russian government. Tetrault appeared to provide context in his post by mentioning the Panama Papers and quoting an unnamed source about Zelenskyy’s use of offshore companies. The Panama Papers were a series of documents made public in 2016 from the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. The papers detailed how the wealthy and powerful were able to hide their money and circumvent taxes. However, Zelenskyy was not named in the Panama Papers and the unnamed source Tetrault used was from an investigation done by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, or OCCRP, on the Pandora Papers. Similar to the Panama Papers but larger in scope, the Pandora Papers were a trove of financial documents made public in 2021 that outlined how wealthy individuals used offshore tax havens and, in some cases, money laundering to hide their assets. The papers revealed Zelenskyy and several of his allies oversaw several offshore companies that were formed as early as 2012, the OCCRP reported. The companies were used over the years by people close to Zelenskyy to purchase several expensive properties in London. The Pandora Papers don’t reveal how much money the offshore companies held, nor were there any mentions of a $35 million home in Florida, private planes or Zelenskyy having a monthly income of $11 million. However, the documents did reveal some of his assets included three offshore companies, property and cars. An internet search of property records in Florida yielded no results for anything connected to Zelenskyy or the offshore companies named in the Pandora Papers. We did not find Zelenskyy’s name on any deed or mortgage records. A now-deleted Facebook post shared the claim that Ukraine President Zelenskyy owned a $35 million home in Florida among several other assets.  The claim appears to have originated from a Russian-backed source, and no other corroborating evidence for the claim could be found.  While leaked financial documents showed Zelenskyy owned several offshore companies and other assets like cars and property, they made no mention of a Florida home.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/may/02/facebook-posts/no-proof-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-owns-35-milli/

Mark Kelly’s votes did not give benefits to immigrants in the country illegally
","Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz. is back on the ballot this year after winning a special election in December 2020. An ad by a national Republican group is challenging his reelection and attacking his voting record on benefits for immigrants illegally in the country.  The National Republican Senatorial Committee’s ad begins with the narrator saying Kelly ""votes the party line in Washington and says the opposite when he’s home in Arizona."" The ad goes on to make a number of claims, including that Kelly voted ""for benefits to illegals."" We asked the NRSC for evidence and it pointed us to two votes related to the stimulus checks provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We found the NRSC claim is not accurate since none of Kelly’s votes on the issue made it possible for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become eligible for the stimulus checks.  NRSC's ad ""Against Arizona""  Over the course of the pandemic, Congress has approved three rounds of stimulus checks. Each of these has had slightly different eligibility criteria. Immigrants in the country illegally largely have not been eligible for any of the payments. According to the IRS, to be eligible for any of these checks, people must have filed their taxes using a Social Security number, which immigrants illegally in the country generally do not have.  The IRS issues Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers to people who aren’t eligible to have a Social Security number so they can pay income taxes. This can include immigrants in the country legally or illegally.  In February 2021, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced an amendment ""to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund"" that he said would ""ensure that any new round of economic impact payments does not go to those in this country illegally."" Kelly voted in favor of the amendment, breaking away from most Democrats who voted against it. A deficit-neutral reserve fund is often used by legislators to ""express support for a cause and there is often no follow-up legislation,"" Steven S. Smith, a political science professor at Washington University, told PolitiFact via email. ""They are inconsequential in the vast mast of cases."" A day after this vote, Kelly voted to strike the text of three provisions from the proposed federal budget, including the deficit-neutral reserve fund that he had previously supported, the NRSC said. Kelly’s vote, however, didn’t change the qualifications for the stimulus checks. Because the vote was in reference to a deficit-neutral reserve fund, its inclusion in the federal budget would not have had any impact on the eligibility qualifications laid out for stimulus checks under the American Rescue Plan, which already didn’t include immigrants in the country illegally. The second vote cited by the NRSC was on an amendment to the American Rescue Plan presented by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The amendment sought to ""ensure that the 2021 Recovery Rebates are not provided to illegal immigrants."" Kelly voted ""No"" on that amendment, and the amendment was defeated.  NRSC spokesperson T.W. Arrighi issued a statement on Kelly’s vote, saying: ""Senator Kelly voted with Republicans a few weeks ago against a provision to allow stimulus checks for illegal immigrants. Today, he flip-flopped and stood with Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats to send Americans’ taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants."" However, the amendment was largely symbolic, since the American Rescue Plan, as proposed by Democrats, already prevented immigrants in the country illegally from being eligible for the checks. The American Rescue Plan, like previous legislations, required that people have Social Security numbers in order to get a check. It’s also worth noting that immigrants illegally in the country are generally ineligible for most federal benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. A video ad from the NRSC claimed Kelly voted ""for benefits to illegals,"" citing two votes related to the stimulus checks sent out during the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, immigrants in the country illegally, for the most part, have not been eligible for any of the three versions of stimulus checks sent out during the pandemic since a Social Security number is required for eligibility. Neither of the two votes cited by the NRSC changed these eligibility requirements. The statement is not accurate.

Claim that Ohio US Senate candidate Matt Dolan sought gun grabs for social media posts is False
","Did a Republican U.S. Senate candidate sponsor legislation to allow citizens to send SWAT teams to confiscate guns from gun owners? That’s the attack made by a gun-rights group against Matt Dolan, an Ohio state senator who’s seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in Ohio’s May 3 primary. In a minute-long video ad, Ohio Gun Owners said that another candidate for the Republican nomination, former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, would expand gun rights.  Then the ad alluded to 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, a gun control advocate. It claimed that Dolan ""sponsored Bloomberg's red-flag gun confiscation law, letting the people reporting your social media posts send SWAT teams to your house to take your guns."" This description of the bill distorts how a policy Dolan sponsored would have worked. Red-flag laws, which have been adopted in some states, provide a mechanism for a court to order that guns be taken from people who exhibit dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others.  An Ohio bill that Dolan sponsored, which did not become law,  would have required a court to order gun confiscations. But it would have applied to people being evaluated for involuntary hospitalization, not to people in the community at large.  It would not have allowed for citizens to direct SWAT team confiscations based merely on a person’s social media posts. Under red-flag laws — also known as extreme risk protection order laws — police or citizens can petition a court for an order removing guns from a person who is in the community. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have adopted such laws, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. That includes 14 laws that came after the 2018 mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, according to Stateline, a project of the Pew Charitable Trusts. In December 2019, Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, proposed a number of gun-control measures, including a federal red-flag law, as part of his presidential campaign platform. In October 2019, Dolan introduced a gun bill known as ""STRONG Ohio"" in the wake of a mass shooting in Dayton. It was known as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s bill.  It did not receive a vote and did not become law. DeWine initially had indicated that his gun bill would include a red-flag provision, but one was not included, disappointing gun-control advocates. At the time, DeWine’s administration said it opted not to include a red-flag provision because one that protected gun owners’ due process proved ""inadequate and unworkable.""  Instead, DeWine proposed expanding the state's ""pink slip"" system, which places mentally ill Ohioans in hospitals for up to 72 hours, to include people dealing with chronic alcoholism or drug dependency.  After a hearing, a court could decide to take away that person’s guns.  Writing about the bill at the time, Dolan suggested that this provision was essentially the same as a red-flag law, but it was taking a ""constitutional route to achieve the same goals."" Dolan wrote: ""SB 221 builds upon current Ohio law, which allows a person to report an individual to authorities for an involuntary exam assessing threatening behavior, mental illness and/or addiction. The results of the medical exam are then utilized to, first, determine if medical intervention is needed to treat the individual, and, second, if the individual is mentally unfit to have access to firearms during this treatment. ... ""If, after a full due-process hearing, a court finds the individual should be prohibited from having a gun, law enforcement or family members can, under court order, safely remove the firearms from the individual."" Ohio Gun Owners responded to PolitiFact’s request for evidence behind its claim by alluding to the pink slip system. But the group did not provide any other supporting information. We didn’t receive a reply from Dolan’s campaign. In states with red-flag laws, guns can be taken temporarily from a person who is reported to police as being dangerous until a court hearing is held on whether the guns should be removed for a longer period. The Ohio law applies only when a person is being considered for forced hospitalization for, for example, mental illness. There is no factual basis to idea that, under the Ohio bill, a gun owner’s guns could have been taken away — by SWAT teams or by any other law enforcement means — simply due to a person reporting the gun owner’s social media posts to authorities. Court orders must be issued. Even with the more expansive red-flag laws, a judge or other judicial official such as a court commissioner hears a request from police or a citizen and decides whether to issue a preliminary order without holding a hearing or notifying the gun owner on whether the gun owner’s guns should be seized. These orders are temporary and last a couple of days to a few weeks, depending on the state. The gun owner then has a chance to make his or her case at a hearing before a judge decides on a final order. That order commonly lasts for a year. Ohio race could help decide Senate control The Ohio Senate seat is opening because Republican Rob Portman, who was elected in 2010, is not seeking reelection.  Besides Dolan and Mandel, the Republican candidates include businessman Mike Gibbons, former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken and author and venture capitalist J.D. Vance.  The leading Democratic candidates are U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. Overall, the race is rated by campaign watchers as ""leans"" Republican, ""likely"" Republican and ""solid"" Republican. Ohio Gun Owners claimed that Dolan ""sponsored Bloomberg's red-flag gun confiscation law, letting the people reporting your social media posts send SWAT teams to your house to take your guns."" Dolan sponsored a bill in Ohio, which did not become law, that would have allowed for guns to be taken from a person if a court determined, in certain situations, that person was a danger to himself or others. The bill would not have allowed for confiscations by SWAT teams based on citizens reporting a person’s social media posts. We rate the claim False.

Orland Park Mayor says crime at lowest in nearly three decades
","Orland Park Mayor Keith Pekau claims the village’s crime is the lowest it has been in 27 years. Since Pekau first announced his GOP bid last year for Illinois’ 6th Congressional District, he has repeatedly touted Orland Park’s low crime numbers. ""We’ve reduced crime to its lowest level in 27 years,"" Pekau said in a recent Facebook campaign ad with more than 88,000 views. So we decided to check. One of Pekau’s campaign spokesman said the mayor was referring specifically to index crimes, which include larceny, theft, motor vehicle theft, homicide, burglary, rape, aggravated assault, robbery and arson. These crimes are reported to the FBI to create their annual crime index. Illinois includes human trafficking in their list of index crimes. When asked for evidence to back Pekau’s claim, the spokesman sent a presentation former Orland Park Police Chief Joe Mitchell gave to the Village Board during a meeting earlier this year. The chief showed the board a chart showing the number of crimes each year from 1996 through 2021. In 1996, there were 1,295 index crimes reported, compared to 628 in 2021. We also checked the chief’s numbers with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which collects crime statistics data from law enforcement agencies throughout the nation. The chief’s numbers match, at least through 2020. The village’s 628 reported crimes in 2021 have not yet been officially reported by the FBI. Never in the past 27 years have there been fewer reported crimes in Orland Park, the statistics show. Mitchell told the board he credited his police force, new technology and community engagement for the downward trend.Mitchell also said a ""crucial"" tool has been a stepped up social media campaign called, ""Wanted Wednesdays"" in which the community is asked to help track down suspects. Wanted Wednesday: It was all a BLUR! A victim was pickpocketed at the local Jewel grocery store. What a SPECTACLE. I-RIS we knew who they were. Don't LASH out, but if you recognEYES them, call 708-349-4111 or email [email protected] #wantedwednesday #orlandparkpolice pic.twitter.com/y7eCxpYyiz The report showed crime generally fluctuated over 25 years, including a spike in violent crime in 2017 — the year Pekau took office. The 35 reported violent crimes in 2017 was more than in any other year between 2012 and 2021, according to statistics provided by the police department.  We also reached out to Orland Park Police to determine whether any changes in police tactics or policies may have contributed to the downturn of reported crimes, but our phone messages were not returned. Just because reported crimes are down in Orland Park, that doesn’t mean there is no crime problem. Consider the Orland Square Mall, which continues to be the ""busiest beat"" for criminal related offenses according to the most recent OPD annual report. After several instances of shoplifting and brawls — some of which included gunfire, the mall owner Simon Property Group, Inc. implemented a first-ever curfew last year. After 3 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, anyone younger than 18 must now be accompanied by an adult. We rate this claim True.

In New York State, so many bills
","Gov. Kathy Hochul said that she has passed more than 400 bills since she became governor in a recent campaign ad.  The ad, called ""Hard Work,"" starts: ""It’s late at night, and a light is on in the Governor’s office. Kathy Hochul is hard at work, and it shows. Since taking office, she’s passed over 400 new bills.""   More than 400 bills sounds like a lot. Is she right? And what are all these bills about?  Hochul became governor Aug. 24. When she came into office after the resignation of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, she had 471 pieces of legislation to review, according to a Buffalo News article. The legislation had been passed by lawmakers but had not yet been sent to the governor’s office for consideration. At the time, state government was in the midst of trying to get more people vaccinated against COVID-19, craft a budget for introduction to the legislature in January, and rebuild the economy.  We asked Hochul’s campaign for a list of the bills that she signed, and communications director Jerrel Harvey directed us to a database that tracks legislation, called LegiScan. The database showed that between Sept. 2, 2021 and April 9, 2022, Hochul signed 585 bills, according to a count by the campaign that that PolitiFact confirmed.  We wondered if this many bills are common in other states. New York has a 213-member legislature that meets in regular session six months of the year. It is a complex state, home to the biggest city in the country and also a $3.6 billion agriculture industry.  It’s true that relative to other state legislatures, the New York State Legislature introduces an uncommonly high number of bills and passes an above-average number of them into law.  New York lawmakers introduce on average almost 16,000 bills a year, the highest among all states, according to an analysis of more than 20 years of data, said Brenda Erickson, a program principal with the National Conference of State Legislatures. Of the thousands that are introduced in New York, an average of about 650 are enacted every year, Erickson said.  By comparison, the national yearly average of bills introduced is 2,200, with 425 bills enacted, she said.  Several reasons account for why so many are introduced in New York, said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University. The legislature has a professional staff, which can work on drafting new laws. The state government also spends more money per person than many other states. New York also has a large state government that runs many programs, and sometimes those operations need adjustments, which can require changes to the law.  ""It’s a liberal state, it’s more active, it spends a lot of money, there’s more stuff to manage,"" Reeher said.   A lot of the introduced bills, however, don’t have sponsors in both the Senate and the Assembly. They are known as one-house bills. Both houses must pass a bill for it to be sent to the governor. Some of these one-house bills are introduced every year and have a slim chance of ever becoming law.   We asked Reeher about Hochul’s use of the word ""passed"" in her campaign ad. He said technically she didn’t pass those bills, the legislature did. But the language is plausible, because they became law after she signed them. (Under certain circumstances, bills that have been passed by the legislature can become law even without the governor’s signature.)  Hochul said that she passed more than 400 bills since taking office.  According to a database of legislation, she signed 585 bills since taking office in late August and mid-April.  We rate this claim True. ",/factchecks/2022/apr/30/kathy-hochul/new-york-state-so-many-bills/

No, using Tylenol isn't killing ‘at least 100,000’ people per year
","You probably don’t spend much time thinking about the safety of the bottle of Tylenol tucked inside your medicine cabinet, but a post circulating on social media seems to want you to do just that. ""Did you know that Tylenol is the #1 cause of acute liver failure in the US with 27% of people dying & kills at least 100,000 per year from its use?"" read the April 21 Facebook post. It also alleged Tylenol is unsafe for pregnant women and children and concluded by promoting the use of herbal remedies instead. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact found no evidence to suggest Tylenol itself is the No. 1 cause of acute liver failure in the U.S. And there are simply too few overdose-related deaths per year to ever reach 100,000 per year.  (Screengrab from Facebook) Acetaminophen, the main active ingredient in Tylenol, is a commonly used fever reducer and pain reliever.  It is the most common drug ingredient in the U.S. and each week 23% of adults use a medication that contains acetaminophen, according to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association. Tylenol contains acetaminophen, but so do many other over-the-counter drugs, such as NyQuil, DayQuil and Excedrin. As with all medications, some people might have an allergic reaction, and everyone has to follow the dosage instructions. The label on a box of regular strength Tylenol, for example, warns of the potential for severe liver damage if the medication is taken incorrectly. Annette Reichel, a spokesperson for Tylenol, said the drug has over 60 years of use to show that it is safe.  ""When used as directed at recommended doses, Tylenol does not cause acute liver failure,"" Reichel said. ""However, per the Tylenol (over-the-counter) Drug Facts label, severe liver damage may occur if an individual takes more than 4000 mg of acetaminophen in 24 hours.""  For Extra Strength Tylenol, that means liver damage may occur if someone took two 500-milligram caplets over the recommended dose within a single day. That’s not a lot of pills, a fact that has raised concerns that the dosage guidelines should be tighter. That doesn’t, however, change the data problems with this claim.  Acetaminophen has been tied to acute liver failure, the condition mentioned in the post. In fact, research referenced by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration shows that acetaminophen is the No. 1 cause of acute liver failure in the U.S. Many medications contain acetaminophen, however, meaning that Tylenol, by itself might not be the leading cause of acute liver failure. Dr. William Lee, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, has researched the connection between acetaminophen and acute liver failure for more than 20 years.  His research into acetaminophen and acute liver failure has continued to show that acetaminophen overdose, both accidental and intentional, is the ""leading cause of acute liver injury and acute liver failure in the developed world."" ""I think that’s a little specious to blame it on Tylenol, specifically, because (acetaminophen) is such a ubiquitous product,"" Lee said.  About 1,600 to 2,000 cases of acute liver failure occur in the U.S. each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Lee’s research. The condition is considered rare. Far from all cases are fatal. One 2005 study conducted by Lee and University of Washington Medical Center researchers found that of 275 patients who were diagnosed with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, 178 patients (65%) survived, 74 (27%) died without transplantation and 23 (8%) underwent liver transplants. That 27% mortality finding could be the origin of the 27% in the Facebook post, but the finding was not linked to Tylenol specifically. From 1990 to 1998, FDA research indicated there were about 458 deaths per year related to acetaminophen-associated overdoses.  Even if each of the people who died from overdosing on acetaminophen had taken Tylenol — and there is no indication that that is the case — that number is still nowhere near the 100,000 deaths the post alleges. Lee said the most he has found is about 250 acute liver failure cases per year — only some were due to acetaminophen, and fewer still were fatal. Even assuming his nationwide registry missed cases, ""you’re never going to get up to"" 100,000 deaths per year. ""There’s no way that’s correct,"" Lee said. He said that there are many people who use acetaminophen medications safely every day to manage chronic pain. When people follow the dosing limitations included with the medication, ""they’re never going to get into trouble with that level of medication,"" Lee said.   A post claimed that ""Tylenol is the #1 cause of acute liver failure in the US with 27% of people dying and kills at least 100,000 per year from its use."" Acetaminophen is the active ingredient in Tylenol and hundreds of other medications.  Acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the U.S., but the condition is rare — there are around 2,000 cases annually — and not always fatal.  About 450 deaths per year are related to acetaminophen-associated overdoses, according to the FDA. That number is nowhere near 100,000 deaths — and there is no reason to think that each of those deaths was due to Tylenol, specifically.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/apr/29/facebook-posts/no-using-tylenol-isnt-killing-least-100000-people-/

On April 28 — the day of her supposed jailing in Cuba — she posted on Facebook about Hololcaust Days of Remembrance and recalled a visit she made to Jerusalem in 2009. Later that day, she shared a photo of herself paying tribute to Albright and recalled a recent phone call with her fellow former secretary of state.   On April 29, Clinton tweeted an appeal to Americans to consider sponsoring a Ukrainian family fleeing from the warzone there.  Understandably, she didn’t post anything on social media about being detained, because she wasn’t. There are no news reports to support this unfounded claim, nor any other credible sources.  We rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2022/apr/29/facebook-posts/no-hillary-clinton-isnt-guantanamo-bay/

No, Elon Musk didn’t just fire the Twitter board
","On April 25, Twitter announced that it had agreed to sell the company to entrepreneur Elon Musk for approximately $44 billion.  The news was cheered by some of the social media platform’s critics. When, on April 28, a Facebook post started to circulate declaring that Musk had just ""F-I-R-E-D the entire Twitter board,"" some users gloated.  ""GOOD,"" one account said. Another just posted multiple laughing while crying emojis. But others still were skeptical that this latest development was accurate.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to Twitter about the claim but did not immediately hear back.  But Musk doesn’t own Twitter yet. The deal won’t be final until shareholders vote to approve it. Twitter hasn’t said when that vote will take place, but there’s some speculation it could happen at the company’s annual meeting on May 25.  On April 18, before the board agreed to sell Twitter, Musk tweeted that director salaries ""will be $0 if my bid succeeds,"" saving approximately $3 million annually.  But it’s not accurate that Musk just fired the board.  We rate that claim False.  ",/factchecks/2022/apr/29/facebook-posts/no-elon-musk-didnt-just-fire-twitter-board/

act-checking premature posts about the death of Mino Raiola
","UPDATE, May 3, 2022: On April 30, two days after Mino Raiola refuted premature claims of his death, his family announced that he had died. Publication of this fact-check preceded that announcement. Mino Raiola, a powerful and high-earning soccer agent, has been hospitalized in Milan, Italy, with an undisclosed medical condition. He is not, however, dead, despite online rumors falsely describing his demise. ""Italian football agent Mino Raiola has died after suffering from an illness,"" read an April 28 Facebook post featuring a Raiola’s photo and the dates 1967-2022. ""RIP.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Raiola was alive enough to tweet his ""current health status for the ones wondering"" later that day.  ""Pissed off,"" he said. ""Second time in 4 months they kill me. Seem also able to ressuscitate (sic)."" This followed comments from Dr. Alberto Zangrillo at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan who said ""I’m outraged by the phone calls from pseudo-journalists speculating on the life of a man who is fighting to survive,"" the Guardian reported.

No trace of Elon Musk tweeting about twisted logic with loans for young adults
","An image making its rounds on social media shows a purported tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk lamenting the logic of letting an 18-year-old amass six figures of student debt but not allowing them to acquire a business loan. ""The fact that an 18 year old can't take out a $10,000 business loan. But can take out a $100,000 student loan tells you everything you need to know,"" reads an April 25 Facebook post showing the supposed tweet (poor grammar included). The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Musk has, on occasion, made national headlines for bizarre remarks on social media. Shortly after announcing a majority stake in Twitter, for example, Musk referred to himself as being in ""goblin mode.""  But PolitiFact found no evidence that Musk tweeted this comparison of restrictions for business loans and student loans for young adults. The purported tweet did not appear on Musk’s official Twitter, and we could not find an archived version.  The Facebook post provided no defining information for the tweet, such as a date or a time stamp.  Our search of the internet turned up another version of the quote that wasn’t attributed to Musk and used different loan figures. We found copies of it on Twitter going back to at least Feb. 8, 2021.  Musk did tweet on Dec. 28, 2019, that he worked his way through college and ended up with around $100,000 in student debt.  But that’s not the same tweet that’s being circulated here.

Yes, it’s true cannabis reform supported in Wisconsin, including by Republicans
","The effort to make marijuana legal at the federal level gained ground as the U.S. House passed a measure April 1, 2022 that would eliminate criminal penalties for anyone who manufactures, distributes or possesses the substance.  The proposal faces an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate, but a Wisconsin state senator who has advocated for similar reforms in the state argues the time is right for such a move. ""The people of Wisconsin are ready for cannabis reform,"" state Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison, said in an April 11, 2022 tweet. ""It is supported by the majority of the residents of our state, including a majority of Republicans.""  The last part of the tweet caught our attention. There have long been differing views on permitting marijuana for medicinal uses, when compared to outright legalization. Has the needle on legalization really moved that far? When asked to provide backup for her claim, Agard’s office cited a Marquette Law School poll of 802 registered Wisconsin voters taken from Feb. 22 to 27, 2022. It has a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points for the full sample.  A summary of the poll noted that ""support for legalization of marijuana has grown since the question was first asked in 2013, with 61% now in favor of legalization and 31% now opposed."" It also noted that support has grown in each partisan group since that time, with a slim majority of Republicans now supporting legalization. According to the poll, 51% of those who identified as Republican supported legalization, while 42% were opposed and 7% undecided. (In 2013, the situation was the virtual opposite – 43% support, 51% opposed). In the new poll, among Democrats, 75% supported legalization, with 19% opposed. Another 5% said they didn’t know. Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, said Agard’s statement ""is basically right, but depends on whether ‘Republican’ includes those who say they are independent but lean Republican or not."" Franklin said that for many purposes the MU poll includes leaners with partisans, but ""for other analysis we keep them separate.""  In this case, the 51% figure included independents who lean Republican.  Indeed, those who say they are ""Republican"" are still just slightly more opposed to legalization, by 0.6 percentage points. The ""leaners"" are much more likely to support legalization, which dramatically shifts the over picture.      Party                  Legal          Illegal                     Don’t know 1 Rep       46.5    47.1         6.43        2 Lean Rep  59.2    33.6         7.20        3 Ind       60.2    27.6         11.5     4 Lean Dem  79.6    16.9         3.52        5 Dem       71.5    20.8         6.51      Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, noted cannabis reform can mean many different things including changing regulations about buying, selling, and using marijuana for either medicinal or recreational purposes.  ""What share of Wisconsinites support changing laws surely depends on exactly what kind of reform is being proposed,"" Burden said.  ""It appears that Democrats and Independents in Wisconsin are generally supportive of legalization but that Republicans' opinions probably depend more on the kind of reform being considered."" The results of the Wisconsin poll are on par with residents across the United States.  A CBS News poll released April 20, 2022, found that two-thirds of Americans want recreational marijuana use to be legal under federal law and in their own state. And most people said they wouldn't mind if a licensed marijuana business opened in their neighborhood. Most Democrats, liberals, independents and moderates favor legalization under federal law, the poll found, but Republicans and conservatives are split on the issue, mainly based on age.  In terms of supporting legalization,  79% of Democrats, 67% of independents and 49% of Republicans were in favor. Opposed were 21% of Democrats, 33% of independents and 51% of Republicans.  The picture changes when age is added to the equation for Republicans.  When looking just at Republicans under age 45, some 59% said it should be legal and 41% opposed legalization. For Republicans over age 45, some 44% said it should be legal, and 56% said it should not be legal.  Agard claimed cannabis reform ""is supported by the majority of the residents of our state, including a majority of Republicans.""  Recent polling of Wisconsin residents found  61% in favor of legalization and 31% opposed. Among Republicans, 51% supported legalization, while 42% were opposed.  But that comes with a footnote: To reach the 51% level, one has to include those who identify as Republican, as well as those who lean Republican. This is often done in polling, so it’s not surprising here. But it is worth noting. We rate the claim True.

RNC tweets distortion of what Biden said to teachers about kids in their classrooms
","At a White House Teacher of the Year event, President Joe Biden praised educators for their work throughout the pandemic and condemned efforts that make them ""culture war targets."" His comments come amid controversy over new laws prohibiting lessons on gender identity and claims that critical race theory is being taught in schools. Several conservative organizations quickly jumped on his comments. The Republican National Committee's official Twitter account offered this caption:  ""Biden to teachers: ‘They're not somebody else's children. They're yours when you're in the classroom.’"" Other organizations like the Daily Wire, for example, published an article with the headline: ""Biden Tells Teachers: Children Are ‘Yours When They’re In The Classroom.’"" Both misrepresent what Biden said. The RNC tweet includes the video that shows Biden saying ""like"" before ""yours,"" which changes the meaning of the sentence. It also snips out what he said before and after. The RNC’s caption makes it sound like Biden said kids belong to the teachers and that teachers can ignore the wishes of parents and do whatever they want. That's not what he was saying.  PolitiFact reached out to the RNC for comment but did not hear back. Here's Biden’s full comment (emphasis added): ""We always talk about 'these children.' They're not someone else's children. They're our children. And they are the kite strings that literally lift our national ambitions aloft in a literal sense. Think about it. If you got to do one thing to make sure the nation succeeded in the next two generations, what would you do? You'd want, I would say, literally, have the best-educated public in the world. Have our students gain confidence enough to know what they can do, to reach in. We have an obligation. We have an obligation to help them teach and reach their potential. ""You've heard me say it many times about our children, but it's true: They're all our children. And the reason you're the Teachers of the Year is because you recognize that. They're not somebody else's children; they're like yours when they're in the classroom. You represent a profession that helps them gain the confidence — a confidence they believe they can do anything."" Biden was saying that the nation's future depends on the successful education of American children — not that children belong to their teachers.  The RNC tweeted, ""Biden to teachers: ‘They're not somebody else's children. They're yours when you're in the classroom.’"" In his speech to teachers, Biden was talking about educators’ responsibility to their students and urged them to treat kids in the classroom with care, as if they were their own children. He told teachers students were ""like"" their own. By omitting that key word and dismissing his full comments, the RNC’s tweet misrepresents Biden’s statement and changes the meaning of his message to provoke emotion.  We rate it False.",/factchecks/2022/apr/28/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-tweets-distortion-what-biden-said-teachers-abo/
