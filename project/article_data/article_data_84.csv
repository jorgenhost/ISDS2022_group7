No evidence rocket crash was intentional, and it was not visible from Earth
","A Facebook post made false claims about a real rocket crash that happened last month.  The April 11 post suggested that when a rocket part crashed into the moon in March, it was planned by the government and visible from Earth. It shows two videos side by side, each depicting an object puncturing the moon. ""Everyone been so focused on Wiil & Jada, Ukraine & Russia. That we missed the event of what happened to the moon on March 4th, 2022,"" the caption says, with misspellings. ""Don't believe Google it. The question is what the hell is the government up to??

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

Scientists have said the rocket part was ""space junk"" from a Chinese rocket mission in 2014. On another occasion, in 2009, NASA intentionally crashed a rocket into the moon for experimental purposes, and information about that mission was made public. The impact of the March crash was not visible to humans. And the videos in the post that suggest it was were made in 2020 and 2021 using visual-effects software, said Greg Pietrantonio, the person who created them. The March rocket strike occurred when ""a discarded rocket stage that’s been drifting through deep space since at least 2015 collided with the moon,"" according to National Geographic, which reported that the rocket was ""completely obliterated."" The impact occurred on the far side of the moon, out of range of ground telescopes. The crash was thought to be ""the first time a man-made space missile has unintentionally hit the moon,"" NPR reported. It did not pose any risk to Earth. The videos included in the Facebook post are labeled ""Texas"" and ""California"" — though they were filmed in Pennsylvania and Florida, Pietrantonio said — and each shows something striking the moon. But the videos, which were first posted to TikTok in 2020 and 2021, were made using Adobe After Effects software, Pietrantonio said. He said making sci-fi/apocalyptic videos is his hobby and he eventually gained a sizable following; he has 617,000 followers on TikTok, and his two videos that are included in the Facebook post have been viewed millions of times each.

E15 fuel does not pose a danger to the vast majority of vehicles on U.S. roads
","In an effort to address high gas prices, President Joe Biden directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue an emergency waiver and allow gasoline that uses a 15% ethanol blend to be sold this summer. This type of fuel, commonly called E15, is usually prohibited between June 1 and Sept. 15 because of concerns that it adds to smog in high temperatures, the Associated Press reported.  On the same day of Biden’s announcement, a Facebook post claimed that  E15 will ruin a car engine. ""Anyone that uses gasoline - sure you heard the gov't will be selling E15 gasoline to lower prices. Do ya'll have any idea what that could do to the internal components of your engine?"" the April 12 post said. ""Ethanol is a corn by-product, folks, it's proven to gum up and ruin carburetors on all of your 2 and 4 cycle engines...Boy...they really want us to go electric...don't they?"" The post also included a question — ""Will E15 gas hurt my engine?"" — and this answer: ""One of the major complaints by E15 opponents is that ethanol can corrode many of the plastics, metals, and rubber components used in internal-combustion engines and their fuel systems. Hence, using fuel with a higher concentration of ethanol than the manufacturer recommends may damage your vehicle."" It concludes: ""Save that 10 cents a gallon, but ruin your engine…"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The EPA and an academic study have said that fuel containing 15% ethanol is safe for cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles made in 2001 or later — which make up more than 90% of the vehicles on U.S. roads. Since 2011, E15 has been approved by the EPA for use in cars, trucks and SUVs from model year 2001 and later, a decision that followed ""many years of extensive tests, making E15 one of the most tested fuels in history prior to its permitted use,"" according to the EPA.  In 2013, researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory reviewed 43 studies about E15 use in vehicles from 2001 and later.  ""The data presented in these studies did not show any evidence of deterioration in engine durability or maintenance issues for E15… in comparison to E0 and E10,"" the study said. And many car manufacturers have okayed the use of E15 fuel in their vehicles made in the past 10 years. According to the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association: General Motors says the fuel can be used in vehicles from model year 2012 and later; Ford says model year 2013 and later; and the fuel is also approved for use by Volkswagen, Audi, Toyota, Land Rover, Porsche, Jaguar, Honda and Subaru (though the association did not specify for which model years). E15 is a blend of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, and it is also sold under the name Unleaded 88. While it can be used in many vehicles, it cannot be used in on-highway and non-road motorcycles; vehicles with heavy-duty engines, such as school buses; non-road vehicles like boats;  engines in non-road vehicles such as lawnmowers; light-duty trucks; and medium-duty passenger vehicles, according to the EPA.  ""Most U.S. drivers pump what is known as E10, a fuel blend that contains 90% gasoline and 10% ethanol,"" according to the Des Moines Register. ""Ethanol is a clear alcohol that derives from a manufacturing process that starts with biomass — overwhelmingly, corn starch. E15 is a blend of the fuel that relies on a larger amount of ethanol."" E15 is slightly cheaper than conventional gasoline, but it is not widely available in the U.S. Out of approximately 150,000 gas stations across the U.S., E15 is sold at about 2,300 stations, the New York Times reported, adding that E15 to be sold in the summer is expected to cost about 10 cents less per gallon than conventional gasoline.

No evidence that Ukraine attacked a train station in one of its cities
","On April 8, at least 59 people, including seven children, were killed after a missile strike hit a railway station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. The attack came as thousands were attempting to flee heavy Russian shelling across the region.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy initially said at least 300 people were wounded in the strike. ""People (were) crowded, waiting for the trains to be evacuated to the safe territory"" at the station, Zelenskyy said in an address to Finland's parliament. ""They hit these people. There are witnesses, there are videos, there are remnants of the missiles and dead people … Why do they need to hit civilians with missiles? Why this cruelty that the world has witnessed in Bucha and other cities liberated by the Ukrainian army?"" As Zelenskyy condemned the attack, some started to spread rumors that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that carried it out.  This unsubstantiated rumor has been pushed by Russian state media and Kremlin-linked social media accounts, and was bolstered by a supposed BBC News story that placed the blame on Ukraine. ""Very interesting how the train station was a war crime until we realized Ukraine did it,"" reads a screenshot of a tweet that was shared on Facebook on April 13. These false claims are amplified by a conspiratorial video that appears to show the BBC’s logo and watermark. But the video isn't legitimate. It doesn’t appear on the BBC’s official social media accounts, website or YouTube channel. The news organization confirmed it’s fake and said it was working to have it removed. Claims blaming Ukraine by Russian-state accounts fall short on evidence and contradict earlier posts taking credit for the strike. There is evidence of Russian military forces using the same kind of missile that hit the train station.  Posts promoting this rumor were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The one-minute-27-second clip shows several graphic scenes, including the site of the bombing with dead people on the ground and a shot of the Tochka-U missile found nearby. ""The serial number of the Tochka-U missile is identical to the series of missiles from the arsenal of the 13th AFU missile brigade,"" text overlaid on the video says. ""The same type of missiles and the same serial number were previously fired by the Ukrainian army at the cities of Khartsyzsk, Logvinovo, Berdyansk, and Melitopol.""  The video also claims that Ukrainian media stopped reporting on the bombing after the missile factory numbers were revealed. The video was circulated by pro-Kremlin accounts on Telegram and appeared in multiple Twitter posts before most were taken down by the platform.  The BBC did not report that Ukraine was behind the Kramatorsk attack. Inconsistencies with the placement of logos, location tags and style — like the lack of background commentary — are signs that the video wasn’t created by the news group. ""We are aware of a fake video with BBC News branding suggesting Ukraine was responsible for last week’s missile attack on Kramatorsk train station,"" the news organization said in an April 13 statement on its Twitter account. ""The BBC is taking action to have the video removed. We urge people not to share it and to check stories on the BBC News website."" At a background briefing on April 8, the U.S. Defense Department said that the Kramatorsk bombing was carried out by Russian troops likely using a short-range ballistic missile known as an SS-21.  ""Obviously, we are not buying the denial by the Russians that they weren't responsible,"" said someone only identified by the Defense Department as ""a senior defense official."" ""I would note that they originally claimed a successful strike, and then only retracted it when there were reports of civilian casualties. So it's our full expectation that this was a Russian strike.""  German journalist Julian Röpcke tweeted that Kremlin-affiliated media initially reported that Russia attacked the train station, but then blamed Ukraine after learning of the casualties. His tweet included screenshots of what he said were Telegram posts boasting about the attack. Kremlin affiliated media first proudly reported the #Kramatorsk massacre, claiming their missile hit an ammunition train that arrived yesterday evening.After the appearance of civilian casualties, they started blaming Ukraine.Same story as with #MH17 in 2014.#PutinAtWar pic.twitter.com/D3yMZSshbJ The Russian Defence Ministry has since denied using the Tochka-U missile, yet military analysts say that images and videos on social media refute those claims. News reports and an Amnesty International report have also pointed out recent instances of Russia using the missile system. Russian media also claimed that the serial number on the missile proves it came from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The markings on the rocket discovered at the scene of the bombing indicate it was a Soviet-era OTR-21 Tochka missile, and the serial number, the same that appears in the fake BBC video — Ш91579 — shows it was produced in the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a machine and ballistic missile factory in Russia’s Udmurtia region. The plant mass-produced missiles in the Soviet era, which were then transported at different times to different countries including Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, according to reporting by Ukrainian fact-checkers at StopFake.com.  The missile’s serial numbers are unrelated to the country they were shipped to, so Russia’s logic that the number indicates that the missile could only come from Ukraine is flawed.  Facebook posts claim that Ukraine was responsible for the Kramatorsk train station bombing. A video used to bolster this rumor is fake. Although the video has a BBC logo, it was not produced by the news organization. There’s no credible evidence that Ukraine was behind the attack. The Tochka missile used in the attack, and the serial number on it, isn’t proof that it came from the Ukrainian army. Several news reports, legitimate photos and videos show that Russia has used these missile systems recently. The rumors that Ukraine attacked the train station have largely been spread by pro-Kremlin social media accounts.

No proof that sugar directly causes cancer, as claim suggests
","There are many misconceptions about sugar consumption and cancer causes, as well as how the two relate to one another. One common myth found on social media is that sugar causes cancer. ""It’s been proven that sugar triggers and causes cancer,"" said Dr. Eric Berg in a 30-second video on Facebook. Berg, who describes himself as an expert on the keto diet and intermittent fasting, went on to say that sugar ""in large amounts over a period of time"" causes cancer. ""And the other thing that’s interesting about this is that cancer has an avid, greedy hunger for sugar. It will compete for normal cells for its glucose. So the best thing to do to prevent cancer is to avoid sugar,"" said Berg, who was a previously practicing chiropractor, but is no longer licensed. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Additional research is needed to explore the relationship between sugar in a person’s diet and cancer, according to the Mayo Clinic. To date, studies have not found a direct link between sugar and cancer. However, there is some evidence that consuming large amounts of sugar can put a person at a higher risk of certain cancers. Eating a lot of sugary foods, such as cookies, cakes and soda, can lead to weight gain and excess body fat. Being overweight or obese can increase a person’s risk for 11 different cancers, including colorectal, postmenopausal breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. However, that doesn’t mean it’s necessary to completely avoid consuming sugar, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute said. Simple sugar, known as glucose, is the body’s main source of energy. All cells, including cancer cells, use glucose as their fuel. Glucose can come from any food with carbohydrates, including healthy foods and foods with added sugars. ""The idea that sugar, or glucose, could fuel the growth of cancer cells can lead some people to unnecessarily avoid all carbohydrate-containing foods. This approach assumes that if cancer cells need glucose, then cutting it out of one’s diet will stop cancer from growing,"" the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute said. But it’s not that simple. Since all cells need glucose to function and grow, there is no way for the body to only give glucose to healthy cells, rather than cancerous ones. In fact, health experts warn that not consuming enough carbohydrates can lead to muscle loss and malnutrition. This can also make it more difficult for a person to undergo cancer treatment and recovery. ""It’s been proven that sugar triggers and causes cancer,"" a video on Facebook said. ""So the best thing to do to prevent cancer is to avoid sugar."" Although consuming large amounts of sugar can put a person at higher risk of certain cancers, sugar itself is not carcinogenic. Avoiding sugar altogether will not stop cancer from growing and doing so could also lead to unhealthy weight loss.

""NYPD: Shooting suspect Frank James, now in custody, had nine prior arrests in New York, three prior arrests in New Jersey,"" reads a tweet re-shared in a Facebook post.

James’ arrests included charges of possession of burglary tools, theft of service, trespassing and petit larceny. None resulted in a felony conviction. James Essig, Chief of Detectives at the New York Police Department, went through James’ arrest record in a news conference following his arrest in Manhattan.  According to Essig, James has nine prior arrests in New York, dating from 1992 to 1998, that included four arrests for possession of burglary tools, one for a criminal sex act, and two arrests for theft of service. He was arrested once on a warrant out of New Jersey and again for criminal tampering. The NYPD said James also had three arrests in New Jersey in 1991, 1992 and 2007 that include charges of trespassing, larceny and disorderly conduct. According to reporting by North Jersey Media Group, James had a fourth arrest in New Jersey, in 1995 for making terroristic threats. He was convicted on a lesser charge of harassment in that case and sentenced to probation for one year, the Essex County Prosecutor's Office told the newspaper. James had no felony convictions that would have prevented him from buying the gun he allegedly used in the subway attack. The NYPD said James has ties to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. We were unable to find a criminal record for him in these states.  Recent justice reform efforts in Democrat-led states like New York and New Jersey involve actions like ending cash bail for all but the most violent crimes.

Rep. Mary Miller says White House is encouraging kids to take ""castration"" drugs, undergo surgeries
","U.S. Rep. Mary Miller claimed in a tweet that the Biden administration is encouraging children to use ""chemical castration drugs"" and undergo gender-reassignment surgeries. ""The Biden Administration is engaging in extreme ‘woke’ politics by encouraging children to take chemical castration drugs and undergo surgeries, and they are lying to children by telling them puberty blockers are ‘reversible,’"" tweeted Miller, a Republican from east central Illinois, on April 8. The Biden Administration is engaging in extreme “woke” politics by encouraging children to take chemical castration drugs and undergo surgeries, and they are lying to children by telling them puberty blockers are “reversible.”We must protect our children! https://t.co/OhOlyZbxna The target of Miller’s claim was Biden’s White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, who told reporters at her April 7 daily briefing that Alabama’s new law prohibiting such surgeries and medications for anyone under 18 years old would be challenged by the administration as ""discriminatory"" and a possible violation of the Constitution. The Alabama measure is the most strident in a spate of similar laws passed in recent years by more than a dozen Republican-controlled state legislatures throughout the country. In Alabama, doctors and nurses could face felony charges and potential prison time for providing health care related to gender reassignment — including hormone therapy, puberty blocking drugs, or any form of gender reassignment surgery. To support her claim, Miller retweeted a 44-second clip of Psaki’s press briefing. ""Alabama’s lawmakers and other legislators who are contemplating these discriminatory bills have been put on notice by the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services that laws and policies preventing care that health care professionals recommend for transgender minors may violate the Constitution and federal law,"" Psaki said. Asked for any other evidence to support the claim, Miller’s spokesperson provided a recent guidance issued by the Office of Population Affairs, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services. ""For transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents, early gender-affirming care is crucial to overall health and well-being as it allows the child or adolescent to focus on social transitions and can increase their confidence while navigating the healthcare system,"" the guidance says. The BGA could find no language in either Psaki’s statements or in the Department of Health and Human Services guidance that encourages children to take ""chemical castration drugs"" or undergo gender reassignment surgery. Both Psaki’s statements and the guidance, however, cite potential outcomes for transgender and nonbinary children who receive gender-affirming care, such as improved mental health and a lower risk of suicide. Miller’s team did not provide clarification on what the congresswoman meant by her usage of the term ""chemical castration drugs."" Experts we spoke with said it is not a medical term and not commonly used by medical professionals, but generally seems to be used to describe hormone therapy. Puberty blockers, however, are gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, or GnRH agonists, approved by the Food and Drug Administration. ""They put — exactly as it sounds — puberty on pause,"" said Dr. Sumanas Jordan, director of Northwestern Medicine’s Gender Pathways program. Jordan said the drugs prevent the secondary sex characteristics such as breast development, hair growth and voice deepening. The American Medical Association, Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health support the use of hormonal treatments for children who — with medical consultation — decide to delay puberty. Professional medical organizations recommend against puberty blockers for children who have not reached puberty, which typically starts between ages 10 and 12. Hormone treatment for feminization or masculinization of the body is typically not considered until patients are at least 16 years old. Gender reassignment surgery is typically only available to those 18 and older in the United States. Jordan confirmed that the effects of puberty blockers are indeed reversible. Paula M. Neira, program director of LGBTQ+ Equity and Education at Johns Hopkins Medicine Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Health Equity, said access to gender affirming care reduces the risks of depression, anxiety and suicide for youth struggling with gender identity. Neira also said while puberty blockers are reversible, they cannot be used indefinitely. We asked Miller to provide evidence the Biden administration is ""lying"" about puberty blockers being reversible. She sent guidance published by the Mayo Clinic, a non-profit health organization not overseen by Biden’s administration. The clinic cites the potential long-term effects of puberty blockers — including bone growth and density, future fertility and growth spurts. But there was nothing in the guidance to suggest the effects of puberty blockers are irreversible, as Miller seems to contend. Nor were there any statements from any government official saying anything about puberty blockers. Either way, experts conclude the effects of puberty blockers are indeed reversible. The Mayo Clinic’s guidance acknowledges some changes caused by puberty blockers could require surgery to reverse the effects, but it also said puberty can resume once the drugs are no longer taken. Miller said the Biden administration is ""encouraging children to take chemical castration drugs and undergo surgeries,"" and ""are lying to children by telling them puberty blockers are reversible."" The administration made no such assertions in the video Miller cited as evidence. If they had, most credible scientific studies show the effects of puberty blockers are reversible. We rate this claim FALSE. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2022/apr/17/mary-miller/rep-mary-miller-says-white-house-encouraging-kids-/

In claim about crime in other states, context needed
","Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, defended New York state’s bail law amid charges by Republicans and others that changes to it in 2020 are contributing to rising violent crime.  ""Cities in notoriously ‘tough on crime’ states like Texas and Florida saw a more significant increase in violent crime than cities in NYS,"" she said in a statement.  Changes to the bail law were intended to make the system fairer. Advocates said poor people should not remain in jail awaiting trial simply because they cannot afford to post bail, while those who can afford it are released. We wondered if Peoples-Stokes was correct. Did cities in Texas and Florida, where bail laws did not change, also see bigger increases in violent crime?    Because Peoples-Stokes said ""cities,"" we looked at the four violent crime categories -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- in the 10 largest cities in each state during 2020. This is the most recent year with the most complete data available, and we looked at data reported by city police departments and published by the public safety division of each state government. In general, murders and aggravated assaults increased, while rapes and robberies did not. But we found no clear pattern in the state data among the cities in each state. Murders went up 34% in Buffalo and 17% in Yonkers. In New York City, they went up 46.7%, slightly more than the 45% increase in Rochester. There are cities in Florida and Texas where the percentage increase was roughly the same or even higher than the New York cities. In Houston murders increased by 45%. In Fort Worth, they went up 59%. Murders rose 42% in Miami and 76% in Fort Lauderdale.  But in San Antonio, the increase was only 20%. And in some cities in all three states, the number of murders fell. In El Paso, for example, the number of murders went down by 30%. When we calculated the overall increase among the cities in each state -- disregarding cities that had just a few murders, where a small increase would lead to a large percentage increase -- the increase in New York state came to 46%, compared with 31% in Texas and 22% in Florida.  According to Pew Research Center, which used data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, murders rose by 30% between 2019 and 2020 across the country. Pew’s analysis showed that on a statewide basis, per 100,000 people, New York’s increase in murders was higher than the increases in Florida and Texas. The number of homicides per 100,000 remains lower in New York, at 4.7 at the end of 2020, than in Florida, 7.8, and Texas, 7.6.  Robberies fell in all 30 cities, except for San Antonio, Austin and Tampa. New York City reported a 1.6% decline in robberies. Nine of the 10 Florida cities posted bigger percent declines. Eight of the Texas cities had bigger percentage declines. Overall, the data showed a percentage increase in aggravated assaults in the 10 cities we looked at in each of the three states. In New York, the overall increase was 4%, less than the 21% increases in Florida and in Texas.  The number of reported rapes fell in most cities in each of the three states. Nine of the 10 Florida cities had fewer reported rapes, as did nine of 10 Texas cities. Rapes fell in seven of the 10 New York state cities. The percentage decline in rapes in New York was 19%. Rapes declined in the Florida cities by 15% and in the Texas cities by 17%.  We approached Peoples-Stokes’ office for evidence of her claim, and her staff sent several sources, including a report from November 2020 regarding violent crime rates through Sept. 30, 2020, from the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit organization whose members are high-ranking police officials. The report found a 66% increase in homicides and a 39% increase in aggravated assaults in Fort Worth while El Paso saw a decrease in homicides of 66%. Tampa  had an increase in aggravated assaults of 35%. There was no mention of New York cities in the report.   To Peoples-Stokes’ point about the effect of bail law changes in New York, other investigations have found that among people who were released under the 2020 bail changes, few committed violent offenses after release.  Peoples-Stokes said that ""cities in notoriously ‘tough on crime’ states like Texas and Florida saw a more significant increase in violent crime than cities in NYS."" It is true some cities in Texas and Florida that saw greater increases in some categories of violent crime than cities in New York state between 2019 and 2020. The percentage increase in aggravated assaults, considered a violent crime, grew more in large cities in Texas and Florida than it did in New York.  But there are also cities in New York state that had greater increases than cities in Texas and Florida. Statewide, the increases in murders per 100,000 people was greater in New York than it was in Texas and in Florida.  Her claim is partially accurate, but leaves out important context. We rate this Half True.  ",/factchecks/2022/apr/16/crystal-peoples-stokes/claim-about-crime-other-states-context-needed/

Godlewski off-base with claim on Johnson’s view on coverage for those with pre-existing conditions
","It’s no secret that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson isn’t a fan of the Affordable Care Act, the signature health care law of the Obama administration, passed in 2010.  A hallmark of the law was its rule that health insurance companies can’t refuse to cover people or charge them more if they have a pre-existing condition — a health problem they had before the insurance coverage started.  Wisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, a Democrat who’s vying to unseat Johnson this fall, targeted Johnson this way in a April 1, 2022 tweet:  ""Ron Johnson is trying to let insurance companies deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like cancer, depression, pregnancy, diabetes — or even COVID.""  That coverage, of course, is a key provision in the ACA. But does that mean Godlewski is right? When asked to provide evidence of her claim, Godlewski’s office sent a list of votes Johnson has cast in favor of repealing or scaling back the health care law.  Soon after he took office, Johnson cosponsored a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying in a Jan. 26, 2011 news release that it was ""the single greatest assault on our freedom in my lifetime."" He voted multiple times to drop the law’s individual mandate, which required most people to have health insurance or pay a penalty, and voted for a series of attempted repeals during the summer of 2017.  But just because he wanted to get rid of the law doesn’t necessarily mean he wanted people with pre-existing conditions to go without protections. After all, many Republicans have said they support that provision, and it is widely popular with voters.  Godlewski’s strongest evidence stems from a vote Johnson cast for the Better Care Reconciliation Act, an amendment to the GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The final version of the amendment — which failed — would have allowed insurance companies to offer plans that could deny coverage to sick people as long as they carried at least one comprehensive plan that followed the Affordable Care Act’s rules.  Insurance companies and patient groups decried the amendment, saying it would make those comprehensive plans more costly and create two systems of insurance, one for healthy and one for sick people.  In that specific instance, then, Johnson did vote for legislation that could have allowed insurance companies to have plans that denied people with pre-existing conditions coverage.  But — to get technical — all of those companies would also have had to have at least one plan that did cover people with pre-existing conditions, even if it was likely to end up being expensive. Johnson’s office said the senator has committed to protections for people with pre-existing conditions. They pointed to his introduction of the Protect Act in February 2021, which would prohibit health insurers from imposing exclusions on plans based on pre-existing conditions. (The bill has not moved from committee.)       They also cited a response Johnson gave to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel inquiry about his views on health care on March 17, 2022: ""The first step in any health care reform would assure everyone that people with preexisting conditions would be protected by having their insurance rates subsidized so that they pay the same rates as those without preexisting conditions.""   In a June 26, 2017 New York Times opinion piece criticizing the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act, Johnson wrote that he was in part dissatisfied with the bill because it ""leaves in place the pre-existing condition rules that drive up the cost of insurance for everyone.""  But he followed that by writing that the country ""should look to improve successful models for protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, models underway prior to Obamacare.""  To be sure, his statements are just that — statements. Skeptics may question whether the views are sincere, or if political roadblocks would prevent it from happening. But given current facts as they’re known, Godlewski’s claim doesn’t quite hold up.  Godlewski claimed Johnson is trying to let insurance companies deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.  The senator did cast a vote in 2017 that would have opened the door for insurance companies to offer such plans, but still would have required them to offer other plans that did provide that coverage.  And he’s said consistently that he aims to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here. ",/factchecks/2022/apr/15/sarah-godlewski/godlewski-base-claim-johnsons-view-coverage-those-/

Attack ad hits Sen. Richard Burr on votes to cut taxes for millionaires
","The first television ad from Senate hopeful Deborah Ross, a North Carolina Democrat challenging Republican Sen. Richard Burr, paints Burr as a self-serving politician. It shows Ross talking on the phone with an actor playing Burr, lounging in a posh office. ""You took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut your own taxes and raise taxes on working folks,"" Ross tells the fictional Burr in the ad. A press release announcing the ad was even more direct: ""While Burr’s own wealth has tripled since he has been in the Senate, he has voted to raise taxes on the middle-class and working families while cutting them for millionaires like himself."" The ad’s claim is a mouthful, but it makes some hefty allegations. We wondered if it was true that Burr became a millionaire in Washington then voted to cut taxes for millionaires like himself. And did he also vote to raise taxes on middle class and working families? Burr’s growing wealth The ad says Burr ""took millions from special interests, went (to D.C.) and cashed in."" That’s a bit misleading, since special interests can’t give directly to politicians. That’s called bribery, and there’s no evidence Burr has taken bribes. But his campaigns have received millions from special interests. When Burr first ran for Senate in 2004, he received the most PAC contributions of any Senate candidate, according to a News & Observer report. This year, not much has changed. Burr’s campaign is the No. 1 recipient of contributions from the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Through June 30, 82 percent of the $8.7 million he has raised came from political action committees or large individual donors. By comparison, 74 percent of the $3.9 million Ross raised has come from PACs and large donors. Burr’s successful campaigning gives him a congressional salary of $174,000. That salary – plus investments in real estate and the stock market – helped Burr become a millionaire during his two decades in the House and Senate. He served in the House from 1995 to 2005, and in the Senate since 2005. In that time he has made about $3.6 million in pre-tax salary. We don’t know exactly how much he’s worth because of the rules about what liabilities and assets members of Congress do and don’t have to report. Roll Call, which compiles an annual ranking of members of Congress by minimum possible wealth, said Burr was worth a minimum of $1.6 million last year, ranked 44th in the Senate and 152nd overall. He was worth about $500,000 in 2004, when he first ran for Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Taxes on the wealthy Ross’ claim about Burr’s record on taxes is nearly identical to a claim made in a 2012 Wisconsin Senate race that PolitiFact rated Half True. Four years have passed, though, and we were curious if there was any new information. Both that previous claim and Ross’ ad cited votes cast in 2011 and 2012 in support of Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposals. Neither budget passed. But Ross spokesman Austin Vevurka said the ad specifically talked about what Burr voted to do, not what he has done. And the ad is correct that Burr did vote to cut taxes on wealthy people like himself. Ryan’s plans both years would’ve lowered the tax rates of all the highest income brackets, including Burr’s. Not counting his stocks, in 2012 Burr made $174,000 in Senate salary and owned real estate that brought in income somewhere between $115,002 and $1,050,000, according to his financial disclosure forms. His taxes would’ve dropped substantially had the budget passed, as it would’ve created just two income tax brackets: 10 and 25 percent. The income tax system, at that time and now, has six brackets and reaches nearly 40 percent at the top. Burr’s votes to help his fellow millionaires haven’t all been unsuccessful. In 2012, he and other Senate Republicans blocked discussion on the so-called Buffett Rule, which would’ve raised taxes on wealthy investors. That wasn’t a vote to cut taxes, but it was a vote to keep them at the same level. Taxes on the middle class The question of whether Burr voted to increase taxes on middle class or working people is trickier. That’s because Ryan’s budgets promised to cut income tax deductions and loopholes – but did not provide many specifics about what would be cut and what would remain, leading to speculation. ""Depending on which think tank you ask about the Ryan Budget, you will get a different answer,"" said Burr’s communications director, Becca Watkins. ""This is because the Ryan budget suggested tax simplification, but it did not specify how taxes should exactly be changed."" Watkins is right. However, Ryan’s budget was clear that it would’ve kept the low tax rates on capital gains, dividends and other investment wealth. As a result, Peter Orszag, a banking executive and former budget wonk under both Bush and Obama, wrote in 2012 that of what remained to be cut, ""most of the other big tax breaks — such as the mortgage interest deduction, state and local tax deductibility, and pension and health tax benefits — help the middle class."" That same year, an analysis found that households earning between $50,000 and $100,000 would see their taxes increase by $1,358 annually if Ryan’s budget passed, and upper middle class households making between $100,000 and $200,000 would see an increase of $2,681. However, like anything else analyzing the budget, that report had to rely on speculation. It also was commissioned by a Congressional committee led by Democrats. Ross did cite one piece of evidence the previous Half True claim did not – a 2013 study that found tax reforms that Burr voted for that year (which, yet again, failed) would have possibly raised taxes on middle class families. But again, its numbers were speculative and it was done by a liberal think tank. It also acknowledged there could’ve been ways to avoid increasing taxes on the middle class, such as increasing the deficit. Watkins said Burr didn’t think Ryan’s budgets were ""perfect,"" but he feared budgets proposed by Democrats would’ve led to even higher taxes. ""To suggest he supports increasing taxes on the middle class is baseless,"" she said. Our ruling Ross said Burr ""took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks."" The part about special interest money needs clarification. The part about tax cuts for the wealthy is accurate, but the part about raising taxes on the middle class is purely speculative – it could be right or it could be wrong, and we simply can’t know for sure. The ad’s claims are partially accurate but need additional information, so we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/25/deborah-ross/attack-ad-hits-sen-richard-burr-votes-cut-taxes-mi/

On DACA funding, Ruben Kihuen oversimplifies votes taken by Republican opponent Cresent Hardy
","Democratic congressional candidate Ruben Kihuen is accusing his Republican opponent of voting to defund programs that protect millions of people not legally in the country from being deported. At a recent press conference celebrating the fourth anniversary of President Barack Obama’s signing of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, the state senator directly accused incumbent Republican Rep. Cresent Hardy of voting to defund the program. ""In Congress, he voted to defund DACA,"" Kihuen said. ""He voted to get rid of the DACA program."" Hardy represents one of the nation’s few true swing districts. We decided to check this claim because the topic of immigration reform is critical in a district with a huge Latino population. Reviewing Hardy’s voting record and public statements on the topic of DACA funding presents a more complex picture than the one Kihuen asserts. DACA funding Kihuen’s claim refers to House amendments on a 2015 Department of Homeland Security funding bill. The debate turned into a political fight over Obama’s immigration executive orders. Several amendments sought to block funding to DACA and similar programs. Then-Speaker John Boehner said the measures were in response to Obama ""unilaterally"" rewriting immigration law through executive orders. But Hardy and fellow Nevada Republicans Joe Heck and Mark Amodei broke with their party, joining 23 other Republicans in voting against an amendment defunding the original 2012 DACA program. It still passed on a 218-209 vote. The three Nevadans fell back in the party fold on a separate amendment blocking funding of Obama’s expanded DACA program and a separate executive order shielding parents of U.S. citizens or lawful residents from deportation (commonly known as DAPA). That amendment passed on a larger 237-190 vote margin. At the time, Hardy’s office said his votes represented a desire to not take away rights already granted to people in the program, but he was still opposed to what he called the president’s ""executive overreach"" in creating the programs. Hardy (and the other Nevada House Republicans) voted in favor of the final funding bill that included the amendment defunding DACA. The final bill languished in the Senate (Hardy signed on to a letter demanding the measure be taken up) until nearly reaching the point where the department would run out of funds. Republican leadership eventually stripped out the contentious immigration riders attached to the funding bill. Hardy voted in favor of the ""clean"" spending bill, joining Democrats and 74 other Republicans to pass the measure and send it to President for approval just hours before the funding deadline. In a statement at the time, Hardy decried the ""unacceptable, unconstitutional and temporary"" immigration executive orders, but said voting for the funding bill was necessary to ensure that the department didn’t fall victim to a ""political stalemate."" ""Funding for the Department of Homeland Security should always be a top priority and not used as a political football,"" Hardy’s campaign manager Ross Hemminger told PolitiFact Nevada in an email. So is Kihuen right to say that Hardy voted to get rid of DACA? The answer really depends on which vote is highlighted — the Republican technically voted for a version of the funding bill that included language defunding the program, but he voted against that amendment in particular and went against the majority of House Republicans to vote for the ""clean"" version of the legislation. Hardy’s stance  Hardy initially took a tougher stance on DACA before taking office. In an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal’s editorial board before the 2014 election, Hardy said he would have voted for a bill ending the initial DACA program but still wanted young undocumented workers to be able to stay in the country and apply through citizenship. He told the Las Vegas Sun soon after being elected in 2014 that he would oppose any executive action ""granting amnesty"" to the millions not legally in the country. More recently, Hardy joined with fellow House Republicans in voting to allow Republican Speaker Paul Ryan to file an amicus curiae brief in a state-driven lawsuit over the expanded DACA and DAPA programs. That case only dealt with the expansion of DACA and the DAPA program, which are consistent with Hardy’s votes. The DACA expansion and DAPA are stalled after a 4-4 Supreme Court ruling left a lower court’s injunction in place. Our ruling  Kihuen said Hardy ""voted to defund DACA"" while in Congress. Kihuen oversimplifies Hardy’s record on DACA, which is more mixed than the claim lets on. Hardy did vote for a version of a bill that included an amendment defunding DACA. But Hardy also voted against that specific amendment when it came up on the floor, and he broke with the majority of his party to send the final bill to the president. There’s some truth here, but Kihuen is gross oversimplifying the matter and taking things out of context. We rate his comments as Half True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/25/ruben-kihuen/daca-funding-ruben-kihuen-oversimplifies-votes-tak/

Mostly False: Lamar Smith claim that one third of federal inmates are 'illegal' immigrants
","A San Antonio congressman, already on record in support of Donald Trump for president, told Texas delegates to the Republican National Convention that Trump’s on target characterizing some immigrants as criminals. U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said at the Texas delegation’s July 17, 2016, breakfast in Cleveland that Trump ""knew what he was talking about. One-third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants. They have committed some of the most worst crimes; they have committed the rapes and the murders and everything else."" We wondered if indeed one-third of federal prisoners were in the country without legal authorization. Not so, we ultimately found. Smith was citing a slightly outdated figure of individuals sentenced to the federal pen in a given year, not the total federal prison population. Right off, we suspected Smith was off base. Our June 2016 fact check of a different claim took note that as of April 2016, nearly 80 percent of the federal system’s approximately 195,000 inmates were U.S. citizens; 15 percent were citizens of Mexico, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. A bureau breakout up to date as of late July 2016 showed the citizenship percentages to be about the same; so, you’d expect inmates living in the country without legal authority to comprise an even smaller share of the prisons’ population. Yet Smith spoke before that breakout was posted. When we asked his House spokeswoman, Jennifer Pett, the basis of his claim, she said by email that he was referring to ""illegal alien""  immigration statuses shown for nearly 37 percent of individuals sentenced to federal prison in the fiscal year running through September 2014, as shown in a chart from the U.S. Sentencing Commission. This turned out to be the latest-available breakdown we could find of incoming prisoners by immigration status. According to the chart, 58 percent (43,479) of the 74,911 individuals that year were U.S. citizens. Otherwise, the chart notes 27,505 ""illegal"" residents sent to prison plus 3,017 foreigners living here with legal permission, 206 people under extradition and 704 individuals with unknown statuses. Of the ""illegal"" residents, 20,333 — 74 percent of them — were primarily sentenced for immigration violations, not violent crimes, according to the chart. Nine unauthorized immigrants were primarily convicted of murder, 50 of assault, 19 of sexual abuse, the chart shows. Next, we inquired into the share of federal inmates, as Smith put it, who are currently held after living in the country absent legal permission. On behalf of the sentencing commission, which gathers information on federal crime and sentencing issues, spokeswoman Christine Leonard confirmed the validity of Smith’s fiscal 2014 chart. Leonard said the agency hasn’t posted a similar analysis for the fiscal year running through September 2015. But in fiscal 2015, she pointed out, 29,166 noncitizens--not necessarily living in the U.S. without legal permission--accounted for 42 percent of the 70,255 people sentenced to federal prison. According to the fiscal 2015 chart, 19,240 of the sentenced noncitizens, 66 percent of them, were primarily sentenced for immigration violations. Among 9,926 noncitizens primarily convicted of a non-immigration violation, 62 were primarily convicted of assault, 24 of sexual assault, 15 of murder, the chart indicates. We also asked the Bureau of Prisons for the percentage of undocumented immigrants among the entire federal prison population — the group that Smith singled out in his statement. No such data are available, spokesman Justin Long advised us by email. But the bureau does tally  the proportion of inmates by citizenship status--and noncitizens have recently accounted for 22 percent of all inmates. We sought a longer view. Long replied with numbers indicating the share of noncitizens among federal inmates has gradually decreased. Noncitizens comprised nearly 30 percent of inmates in September 2000; 27.3 percent in September 2005; 25.4 percent as of September 2012 and 22.4 percent as of September 2015, similar to the 22 percent of late, Long said. Still, could it be there’s been fluctuation with the share of immigrant-inmates spiking some months? Doesn’t look like it. Since January 2016, Long replied, the greatest monthly share of noncitizens among inmates was 21.9 percent, the least 21.6 percent. Next, we asked outside experts why it’d be that noncitizens make up 22 percent of inmates of late despite the fact that ""illegal aliens"" accounted for nearly 40 percent of the people sentenced to federal prison in fiscal 2014. Their consensus: The standing population of inmates reflects a good number of prisoners serving longer sentences while most noncitizens sent to prison were convicted of immigration crimes, which mostly entail shorter sentences. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration, summed up by email: ""With immigration offenders, there is high volume but shorter sentences, so faster turnover, which translates to a smaller percentage of the average daily population"" in prison. Meantime, Julie Samuels of the Urban Institute pointed out an institute chart showing that people convicted of immigration violations in fiscal 2014 accounted for a greater share of people sent to prison than they did of the total prison population:  SOURCE: Report, ""Transforming Prisons, Restoring Lives Final Recommendations of the Charles Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections,"" the Urban Institute, January 2016 Another authority, Nazgol Ghandnoosh of the Sentencing Project, which says it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, pointed out that as of the end of December 2014, some 69,000 of the 1.6 million state plus federal prisoners were noncitizens, per a September 2015 report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, though we noticed that report lacked counts for several states including California. After we circled back to Smith’s office with the figures we’d found, Smith’s deputy chief of staff, Chris Philp, said by email that Smith had meant to tell the delegates that ""one-third of federal sentences go to illegal immigrants, not that one-third of federal prisoners are illegal immigrants."" Our ruling Smith told his fellow Texans: ""One third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants."" Not so. Rather, this figure ties to the 37 percent share of individuals sentenced to prison in fiscal 2014 who weren’t legally living in the country--and there doesn't appear to be a more recent breakdown. More to the point, the government doesn’t sort all inmates by immigration status, which leaves us with its guidance that as of mid-2016, 22 percent of inmates weren’t U.S. citizens. It seems logical to conclude that unauthorized residents comprised a smaller share of all the prisoners. We rate Smith’s statement Mostly False.

Donald Trump offers misleading statistics about Hispanic poverty
","Furthering his efforts to reach out to minorities, Donald Trump at a rally in Tampa decried how Hispanics have fared economically under President Barack Obama. ""Hispanic citizens have been suffering under this president,"" Trump said Aug. 24, 2016. ""Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanics have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Two million have joined the ranks of poverty, not of wealth. I want you to join the ranks of people that are making phenomenal livings. ... The number of Hispanic children living in poverty increased by 15 percent in that short period of time."" To test the accuracy of Trump’s comment, we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tracks poverty by age and race, among other characteristics. The most recent full year for which data has been published is 2014. Overall Hispanic poverty The data shows that Trump is on target if you start the clock in 2008, the year before Obama took office. Between 2008 and 2014, the number of Hispanics in poverty rose by a little over 2.1 million. But using that time span means using the year before Obama took office -- not ""since"" he took office -- and it also cherry-picks the data to largely precede the severe recession that began before Obama took office. Starting the clock in 2009 produces a smaller increase (754,000). If you started the clock in 2010, Hispanic poverty decreased by 418,000. Meanwhile, Trump’s comment also uses raw numbers of people in poverty, when statisticians usually prefer poverty rates, since rates take into account changes in the overall population being studied. If you use poverty rates instead of raw numbers, then Hispanic poverty has risen slightly since 2008 (0.4 percentage points), but has fallen by 1.7 points since 2009 and by 2.9 points since 2010. The chart below shows that Hispanic poverty rates have been declining for the latter part of Obama’s tenure. So Trump has presented a misleading picture of overall Hispanic poverty trends. Hispanic child poverty As for the Hispanic child poverty figures, the Census Bureau does show an increase of 15 percent in raw numbers between 2008 and 2014. But the same caveats from the previous statistic apply -- namely, starting at 2008 is problematic. If you instead start the clock in 2009, the increase in raw numbers was less than 1 percent, and if you start in 2010, it fell by 5 percent. As for the poverty rate among Hispanic children, it’s up by 1.3 percentage points since 2008, but down by 1.9 percentage points since 2009 and down 3 points since 2010. So, here too, Trump’s statistic is misleading. Our ruling Trump said that ""since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanics have joined the ranks of those in poverty. … The number of Hispanic children living in poverty increased by 15 percent in that short period of time."" The numbers are close to accurate only if you start counting in 2008, before Obama took office and before the full effects of a recession that Obama inherited. And overall, the comment ignores that since the recession hit, Obama has overseen a general decline in Hispanic poverty. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1470c814-acc9-4771-b28f-79ed83d914a8",/factchecks/2016/aug/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-offers-misleading-statistics-about-hi/

Reince Priebus' False claim that 80% of Clinton Foundation costs are overhead
","In a radio interview Aug. 23, 2016, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus wrongly interpreted tax forms submitted by the Clinton Foundation to claim that the foundation spends the vast majority of its donations on overhead and not charitable work. Speaking on The Mike Gallagher Show, Priebus described the foundation as a way to make the Clintons rich and said he couldn’t find examples of charitable work that they do. ""And so, these people ask the question in interviews, especially in the liberal media, you know, well ‘don’t you think they do great work?’ Well, I don’t know what great work they do,"" Priebus said. ""I mean the fact is, is if they’ve got about 80 percent overhead and 20 percent of the money's actually getting into the place that it should, then it seems like the only work that the Clinton Foundation is doing is lining the pockets of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And that, to me, should be investigated …"" The claim that 80 percent of the money the foundation raises goes to overhead -- a term used to described expenses that go to management and fundraising costs -- is something that has been made by Carly Fiorina and Rush Limbaugh in varying forms. But, despite what Priebus says, it’s an incorrect reading of tax forms submitted by the foundation, experts who monitor and study charitable organizations say. We did not hear back from RNC spokesman Sean Spicer. A wrong reading  Priebus’ case is built on the notion that the only charitable work the Clinton Foundation does is in grant-making and, by extension, everything else is overhead. We’ll use the Clinton Foundation’s most recent IRS tax form, for 2014, as an example. (It starts on Page 28 of this document.) The foundation reported total expenses in 2014 of a little over $91 million but grants of just $5.1 million. That’s close to 6 percent of the foundation’s money being spent on grants. Over a five-year period from 2009-12, the foundation raised over $500 million, the conservative website The Federalist reported, but only 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went toward grants. But that doesn’t mean everything else is overhead, people who monitor charities and their practices say. ""Although it has ‘foundation’ in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity,"" Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, wrote in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. ""In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment. ""Failure to understand the difference led to the widespread claim (covered by the New York Post, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and others) that only a small portion of Clinton Foundation spending goes toward charity. While measuring charitable endeavors by the amount of grants awarded may be appropriate for many private foundations, it is not for an organization that acts as a direct service provider like the Clinton Foundation."" What kind of activities? The Clinton Development Initiative is helping farmers in Malawi grow and sell more crops and has built a warehouse where farmers can store their crops for sale. The foundation is doing something similar for coffee farmers in Haiti. In 2013, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership launched the Acceso Centro de Formacion to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia. A lot of what the foundation does is have its employees help facilitate partnerships. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, for instance, has gotten credit for providing access to lower-cost drugs for millions of people with HIV/AIDS. The foundation program consolidated both the supply of raw materials to make the drugs and the bidding to supply the finished product. The result was lower production costs and lower drug prices. Today, the initiative tracks the going price for a menu of treatments and posts them to help health departments around the world as they negotiate with drug companies. Mittendorf and other people who study charities say the most general way to address how much a group spends on charities versus overhead is to look at the audited financial statements that consolidate the financial results of the entities that make up the Clinton Foundation. That include the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Clinton Global Initiative, Clinton Climate Initiative, Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, Clinton Development Initiative, and Clinton Health Matters Initiative. Financial statement rules require a nonprofit to split its expenses between program services, fundraising, and management/general costs (the latter two are collectively what are referred to as ""overhead""), Mittendorf told us. He said that in 2014, 87.2 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses were on program services. ""Of course, this only speaks to how the organization used its funds and not whether that 87.2 percent was allocated to the most effective program efforts, but it is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this question,"" Mittendorf said. The American Institute of Philanthropy’s Charity Watch, reached the same conclusion. It has given the Clinton Foundation an A rating and says it spends only 12 percent of the money it raises on ""overhead."" ""The Clinton Foundation is an excellent charity,"" Charity Watch president Daniel Borochoff said Aug. 24, 2016, on CNN. ""They are able to get 88 percent of their spending to bona fide program services and their fundraising efficiency is really low. It only costs them $2 to raise $100."" Sandra Minuitti at the group Charity Navigator used the same general calculation when talking to our colleagues FactCheck.org, though she did not include the Clinton Foundation’s affiliates. By that measure, in 2013, 80.6 percent of spending was on program services. Our ruling Priebus said, ""The fact is"" the Clinton Foundation has ""got about 80 percent in overhead and 20 percent of the money is actually getting into the places it should."" Priebus is incorrectly reading IRS documents. Only a small amount of the donations collected by the Clinton Foundation are awarded as grants to other nonprofit groups. But that doesn’t mean that every other dollar is ""overhead."" The Clinton Foundation spends between 80-90 percent on program services, which experts say is the standard in the industry to define charitable works. It spends the majority of its money directly on projects rather than through third-party grants. Conversely, only between 10-20 percent is spent on management of the foundation and fundraising activities, which is tagged as ""overhead.""

In PA, Pence repeats half-true claim that Clinton would raise taxes by a trillion dollars
","During a campaign stop in Bucks County this week, Indiana Gov. and Donald Trump’s running mate Mike Pence made an ear-catching claim about Hillary Clinton’s tax plan. ""Hillary,"" he said, ""wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars."" That claim was also made in April by New Day for America, a super PAC that was working to elect Ohio Gov. John Kasich as the Republican nominee for president. PolitiFact rated the claim Half-True. Here's why: To put that $1 trillion number in perspective, the national debt has reached nearly $19.2 trillion, or more than $60,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. PolitiFact has looked at the presidential candidates' tax plans and, for the Clinton proposal, we relied on a March 3, 2016, analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. The center says that Clinton's proposal would indeed increase tax revenue by $1 trillion — $1.1 trillion in fact. But that money would be raised over 10 years. Clinton, even if she were elected in November and reelected in 2020, wouldn't be in office that long. Reagan's message on behalf of New Day misses another point that may make the increase less onerous to most voters: ""Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes,"" according to the report. For example, filers with an adjusted gross income higher than $1 million would have to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Any money earned above $5 million per year would be assessed an extra 4 percent surcharge. (The surcharge would kick in at $2.5 million for married couples filing separately.) Clinton's plan also aims to discourage multinational corporations from using various schemes to lower or eliminate the taxes they have to pay in the United States. However, according to the report, her proposal would make the tax code more complex and the higher tax rates for the people who earn the most money would reduce ""incentives to work, save and invest."" When we heard back from New Day for America, spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp directed us to Clinton's interview with the New York Daily News and an analysis by the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, both of which make it clear that the $1 trillion would be raised over 10 years, a distinction made by neither New Day nor Reagan. ""Liberals may think increasing taxes by $1 trillion is a good idea, but we very strongly disagree,"" Wehrkamp said in an email. Our Ruling New Day spokesman Michael Reagan said, ""Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion."" Pence repeated a similar claim in Pennsylvania during a campaign stop this week, saying ""Hillary wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars."" Her plan does, in fact, call for raising a trillion dollars, but it would do so over 10 years — longer than she could serve as president, even if she were re-elected. So if she brought in roughly $100 billion per year, even a two-term Clinton administration couldn't fulfill a promise to bring the total to $1 trillion. Also, the statement ignores another key bit of data — that the money would be raised by tax changes targeted to the richest Americans, a group that has seen its top tax rate drop dramatically since the 1950s and early 1960s, when the marginal tax rate was over 90 percent. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/25/mike-pence/pa-pence-repeats-half-true-claim-clinton-would-rai/

Celia Israel repeats unverified claim that Donald Trump's campaign hats are made in China
","Not welcoming Donald Trump to the Texas capital, a legislator said she can’t wait for Hillary Clinton’s election and improved chances of comprehensive immigration reform. State Rep. Celia Israel, joining fellow Austin Democrats at a press conference before Trump’s August 2016 Austin events, also declared that voters wouldn’t forget the Republican presidential nominee’s vows to build a wall on the border with Mexico and to round up and deport people living here without legal authorization. ""Your words are cheap, Mr. Trump,"" Israel said, ""as cheap as the made-in-China gimme caps that proclaim that you will make America great again."" Hold on; PunditFact in October 2015 found incorrect and ridiculous tweets claiming that Trump’s ""Make America Great Again"" caps were made in China. Snopes.com reached a similar conclusion; the campaign hats were made in California, each organization found, with knockoffs sewn elsewhere. At the time, Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, told PunditFact: ""All product for sale on DonaldJTrump.com is made in the USA."" Hicks was more specific when we asked about Israel’s comment, saying by email: ""All official campaign product, including the hats, are made in the USA."" A November 2015 Los Angeles Times news feature story centered on a tour of Cali-Fame, the company credited with making the hats. It quoted Brian Kennedy, a co-owner, saying the company--employing about 100 people, many of them Latino--had been making hats for Trump’s golf courses for about a decade, which is how Kennedy got connected with the campaign, the story said. The story called the made-in-China claim about Trump’s hats a ""short-lived rumor."" We’re unsure about that. A web search combining Trump and ""hats made in China"" yielded more than 3,000 results. Meantime, a July 2016 Associated Press news story said that its commissioned tests of fabric in five Trump campaign hats showed that one sampled hat was stitched from cloth of unknown, possibly foreign origin. Federal law requires that items labeled ""Made in USA"" be made from materials ""all or virtually all"" from the United States, the story said. Kennedy told the AP: ""I'm not using imported materials. We're playing by the rules."" Hicks, the Trump spokeswoman, previously confirmed other facts about the authentic Trump campaign hat, which continues to be sold for $25 to $30 in patriotic and camouflage shades at Trump’s campaign store. Separately, Kennedy said the company had been making that style of hat since the 1970s. PunditFact found the hats were distributed by Ace Specialties LLC, a Lafayette, La., company. Ace Specialties president and owner Christl Mahfouz said: ""Definitely everything on our side is made in the USA."" For this fact check, we called Cali-Fame to check on changes in where the hats are made, if any. Tim Kennedy, a co-owner, declined to comment except to direct us to Hicks. There’s heft to claims that some Trump gear has been made outside the U.S. In 2011, then-Late Show host David Letterman brought out various buttoned shirts and ties included in the Trump brand clothing line for Macy’s (which later dumped Trump after his fiery statements about Mexicans in July 2015). Letterman pointed out that his ties and shirts were made in China. At the time, Trump was supporting Republican Mitt Romney for president and had been accusing China of taking American manufacturing jobs. Trump smirked as the crowd cheered before he defended himself, saying ""it’s very hard to get product that’s not made in China"" because of the country’s currency manipulation. By email, Israel initially told us she’d misspoken. Asked if she intended her China mention to be factual, Israel said by phone: ""I did. I am surprised that the hats were not made in China because everything else around him seems to be outsourced."" She said she’d also seen an ad featuring the Letterman interview of Trump about his namesake items made abroad. Our ruling Israel said Trump’s Make America Great Again caps are made in China. Far as we can tell, that’s still not correct--as widely reported starting 10 months ago. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Donald Trump ad says illegal immigrants would be collecting Social Security under Hillary Clinton
","Donald Trump's first ad of the general election campaign focuses on immigration, predicting what will happen if Hillary Clinton is elected. ""In Hillary Clinton's America,"" it warns, ""illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay, collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open, it's more of the same, but worse."" We've previously looked at whether illegal immigrants convicted of crimes get to stay in the United States, a statement that rates Half True. But what about his other claim about immigrants getting Social Security? If you take the Trump ad literally, it is accusing Clinton of wanting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the United States and collect Social Security benefits — an easily disprovable assertion. Instead, for this fact-check, we’ll examine another interpretation: whether a Clinton administration would have Social Security benefit checks going to the 11 million people currently in the United States illegally. This reading dovetails with information cited by the ad, an article by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors strict immigration policies. There's some truth to that argument that immigrants would be getting Social Security benefits under policies favored by Clinton. But, like all things related to immigration, it can get complicated. Let's take this a step at a time. Undocumented residents can remain in the United States without fear of deportation if given ""deferred action"" designation by the Homeland Security Department. That means, in essence, we know you're here, we know you're undocumented, but we're not going to deport you for now. It's a temporary designation that must be renewed every two years. It doesn't make them citizens or legal; they can be deported if they are convicted of a felony, a serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors, excluding traffic tickets. But if they behave themselves (and the government keeps renewing their ""deferred"" designation), they get to stay. This ""deferred action"" status alone does not make them eligible for Social Security or most other federal benefits. Once they have a deferred action designation, they are also given permission to work. The idea is, if we're willing to let you stay, you should be able to make a living and do it without being exploited by unscrupulous employers. In the past, the deferred action designation has been granted to groups like victims of human trafficking, foreign students affected by a natural disaster, or family members of citizens killed in combat. People with a deferred action are considered to be ""lawfully present"" in the United States, but only for the purpose of work authorization. They are not eligible for food stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income or other federal entitlement benefits available to citizens and people considered lawful permanent residents. However, they are not barred from federal programs associated with working in the United States, such as Social Security and Medicare, where a portion of income goes toward funding the benefits. This is nothing new. Congress and President Ronald Reagan set up this system in 1986. It was updated in the late 1990s. To be eligible for Social Security, the program Trump is focusing on, a person would have to pay into the system for at least 10 years and, like everyone else, couldn't start collecting until retirement age. But first they have to be given that ""deferred action"" designation, which brings us to two Obama administration programs designed to do precisely that. Both are supported by Clinton. Neither have been passed by Congress. The first is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It took effect in 2012 and has given deferred action designations to nearly 730,000 people who came to the United States as children and have lived here since 2007. As a practical matter, the children and young adults put into the deferred action category by DACA — and who start working — aren't going to be covered by Social Security for decades. That would be long after a Hillary Clinton administration — if there is one — has come and gone. As the Washington Post's Fact Checker noted, ""if Clinton serves two terms and leaves office in 2025, the oldest DACA grantees would be 43."" The second program supported by Clinton is the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. It would have given deferred action designations to as many as 4 million of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. It would have applied to people whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Their designations would have to be renewed every three years. It would let them apply for work permits if they passed background checks and paid a fee. Unlike DACA, this program has not taken effect because 26 states challenged it. A 4-4 Supreme Court decision blocked its implementation. That legal fight has also blocked an expansion of DACA. Because Clinton has vowed to defend both programs, Trump argues that illegal immigrants would get to collect Social Security if Clinton had her way. But there are a few things to remember. Granting deferred action to someone who came into the United States illegally means they have a ""lawful presence"" in the United States. They are still considered to be in the country illegally. (""Lawful presence"" is often confused with ""lawful status"" or ""legal status,"" which means you are not in the U.S. illegally.) ""They are getting a deferral of deportation, not a legal status,"" said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Only Congress can grant a legal status. Work authorization comes with the package when they get deferral, but by itself does not confer legality."" Even if Clinton succeeds in implementing DAPA, these undocumented workers won't be eligible for any Social Security benefits for a minimum of 10 years. That's how long you have to work to be eligible. (Again, the children and young adults covered under DACA wouldn't be eligible for a Social Security retirement check until much later.) If Clinton were elected and subsequently re-elected, she would be gone from office for nearly two years before anyone would start collecting, and the amount they received would be tied to the amount they were taxed. And that assumes Clinton's successor continues the DAPA and DACA programs. In addition, these immigrants would have been working legally for a long time. They might not have become citizens or permanent residents, but they would have been working in the country legally for at least a decade, paying taxes and contributing to the Social Security Trust Funds. Finally, it should be noted that undocumented workers paid about $13 billion into Social Security in 2010 while the program paid those workers only about $1 billion in benefits, including people who have overstayed their visas or who obtained a Social Security number through fraudulent means. That extra $12 billion per year is money those workers would have a hard time claiming. We didn't hear back from the Trump campaign, but Trump's policy director, Stephen Miller, responded to the Washington Post, which ruled on the question of whether immigrants can collect Social Security benefits now, by saying that the net payments made to Social Security ""will be dwarfed by net withdrawals"" by people under DAPA and DACA. Our request for documentation to support that assertion went unanswered. But a 2015 report by the Social Security Administration says Miller is wrong. It projected that DACA and DAPA would initially increase the solvency of Social Security — which is due to run out of money in 2033 — by about three months. It would produce a small overall increase in revenue through 2045, a smaller overall decline from 2046 through 2082 and be neutral after 2082. Our ruling Trump says in his television ad that, under a Clinton presidency, illegal immigrants would get to collect Social Security benefits. It is correct that Clinton has supported plans to give many undocumented immigrants the right to stay in the country through deferred action, which has already been done under the Obama administration's DACA program. As a consequence of that, they are allowed to work and become part of the Social Security system under rules that have long been in place. But Trump's ad gets at none of that nuance, instead insinuating that all illegal immigrants would be getting immediate handouts under Clinton's presidency. Even if the broader DAPA program were to be adopted today, it would take a minimum of 10 years of working — and paying into the Social Security system — before these immigrants would be able to start getting their retirement money back. With few exceptions, the first payments wouldn't be collected until after Clinton leaves office. Trump's statement has an element of truth but gives a misleading impression that all illegal immigrants will be getting Social Security paychecks during a Clinton administration. We rate the statement Mostly False.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d39bdebd-51f8-492b-ac4a-0b7604c7cf73",/factchecks/2016/aug/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-ad-says-illegal-immigrants-would-be-c/

Conservative group attacks Arizona GOP candidate for calling Hillary Clinton ‘effective’
","Conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth is weighing in on the crowded GOP race for Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District ahead of Tuesday's primary. Former GoDaddy executive Christine Jones of Phoenix, state Senate Majority Leader Andy Biggs of Gilbert, state Rep. Justin Olson of Mesa, and former Maricopa County Supervisor Don Stapley of Mesa all seek the strong Republican seat. The Club for Growth television ad, which started running Aug. 4, takes aim at Jones, attempting to make her synonymous with Hillary Clinton. ""Jones called Hillary Clinton ‘a capable and respected leader,’ and an ‘effective’ secretary of state,"" the ad states. ""Hillary Clinton effective? Christine Jones thinks so."" Club for Growth, which endorsed Biggs, has spent more than $340,000 against Jones, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. We wanted to know whether Jones really talked about Clinton in the way Club for Growth described. The ad cites a couple of Jones’ personal blog posts, dating back to 2012. On her blog, Rudy Syndrome, Jones did reference Clinton in a Jan. 2, 2012, post with political predictions. She notes that the predictions are her ""purely unscientific, objective opinion."" Here’s how the Clinton prediction reads: Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, will continue to stand out as a capable and respected leader and a commanding presence in US international relations, causing even more Democrats to wonder why she wasn’t their candidate in 2008, and calling for her to replace vice president Biden as president Obama’s running mate in the 2012 general election, or better yet, to challenge the president in a Democratic primary. In a year-end recap on Dec. 30, 2012, Jones notes that her prediction was true. ""She has made her boss and her party look good with her tireless efforts to represent the U.S. abroad for the past four years. She will be a formidable force in the coming years,"" Jones wrote. In her 2013 prediction post, Jones also calls Clinton an ""effective Secretary of State."" Americans, regardless of party-affiliation or political involvement, will begin to realize what an effective Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was, as her replacement begins to be scrutinized for failing to live up to the incredibly high standard she set. During her unsuccessful run for governor, Jones started to change her message about Clinton and her predictions. In a January 2014 post recapping the results of her 2013 predictions, Jones said her prediction about Clinton did not amount to an endorsement. ""Nothing could be further from the truth,"" Jones said. ""My politics and hers could not be more different: she is a big government, tax and spend liberal; I am a committed conservative, dedicated to fiercely defending the constitution and the principles upon which this country was founded."" While Jones did once have supportive words for Clinton, that does not reflect her present-day tone -- as the ad attempts to show. We did not hear back from Club for Growth, but Jones spokesman Brian Seitchik reiterated Jones' disdain for Clinton. ""Christine Jones opposes Hillary Clinton and will do everything possible to defeat her,"" Seitchik said. Our ruling  Club for Growth said, ""Jones called Hillary Clinton ‘a capable and respected leader,’ and an ‘effective’ secretary of state ... Hillary Clinton effective? Christine Jones thinks so."" In multiple blog posts dating back to January 2012, Jones does characterize Clinton as capable, respected and effective. What the ad does not mention is how Jones started walking back her remarks in 2014. By saying ""Christine Jones thinks so,"" in present tense, Club for Growth neglects to account for her more recent perspective.

Clinton surrogate spins Clinton Foundation defense
","A batch of newly released emails between Hillary Clinton’s aides and a Clinton Foundation official set off another debate over whether Clinton blurred the lines dividing the nonprofit bearing her family name and the State Department. In an Aug. 10 interview with Clinton surrogate and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, CNN’s Brianna Keilar brought up one email thread in particular: Clinton Foundation official Doug Band asking Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills on behalf of Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire and foundation donor of Lebanese descent, to ""speak to the substance person re Lebanon,"" at the department. Given Clinton’s promise of a firewall between the foundation and the state department, was that exchange ""really appropriate?"" Keilar asked Granholm. Granholm pushed back, saying that Band wrote the email as an aide to former President Bill Clinton, not on behalf of the foundation, and the meeting request also didn’t lead to ""official action taken on the part of the State Department on his behalf."" Pressed further by Keilar, Granholm then argued that Clinton actually kept her word. ""She has abided by the ethics agreement she signed at the beginning, which was not to take any action on the part of the State Department that mixed foundation business,"" Granholm said. Granholm's claim about an ethics agreement is narrowly focused and misses the big picture about concerns of conflict of interest. While Clinton personally has not been directly implicated in mixing the business of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation, there are clear connections between her top aides and Clinton Foundation interests. We'll walk you through it. The emails in question The email about the Nigerian billionaire Chagoury is one of two out of 44 email exchanges released by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch that link the State Department directly with the Clinton Foundation. In the email, Band, a member of the Clinton Global Initiative's board, wrote to Clinton top aides Abedin and Mills. ""We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person regarding Lebanon. As you know, he’s key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon,"" said the April 2009 email. ""Very important.""  ""It’s Jeff Feltman. I’m sure he knows him,"" Abedin replied, referring to ambassador to Lebanon until 2008. ""I’ll talk to Jeff."" Chagoury’s spokesman said in a statement that Chagoury, who donated between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, ""was simply passing along his observations and insights about the dire political situation in Lebanon at the time. But nothing ever came of it."" Feltman, who Clinton named the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, confirmed this and told media he had never met with Chagoury or spoken to him. In a separate thread, Band recommended an unidentified person for a job at the State Department. ""We have all had him on our radar,"" Abedin wrote back. ""Personnel has been sending him some options."" ""Great,"" Band replied. Clinton herself wasn’t involved in either exchange, and the Clinton campaign referred us to a State Department spokeswoman’s comments on the matter. ""The department does not believe it was inappropriate for Mr. Band or any other individual to recommend someone be considered for employment at the State Department,"" spokeswoman Jennifer Trudeau said. ""We also do not believe it’s inappropriate for someone recommended in this matter to be potentially hired insofar as they meet the necessary qualifications for the job."" New emails released after Granholm made her statement, detailed in an Associated Press investigation, show that Clinton took many meetings with foundation donors as secretary of state and offered assistance to several. The ethics agreements, plural Clinton pledged to keep her distance from foundation matters as secretary of state. ""I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which The William J. Clinton Foundation (or the Clinton Global Initiative) is a party or represents a party ...,"" she said. The Clinton Foundation signed its own, separate memorandum of understanding with the Obama administration, promising to disclose donors annually and report material donation increases to the State Department among other things.  ""The parties also seek to ensure that the activities of the Foundation, however beneficial, do not create conflicts or the appearance of conflicts for Senator Clinton as Secretary of State,"" the memorandum of understanding reads. What's clear is that both agreements were intended to minimize conflicts of interest. And in that regard, experts told us Granholm's comments amount to poorly masked spin that focus on Clinton's personal involvement while ignoring the involvement of her top aides.  Granholm is right that neither agreement prohibits aides facilitating meetings or taking job recommendations, but that's only technically accurate because terms of the agreement were pretty specific to begin with, said John Wonderlich, the director of the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation. ""The letter of the memorandum of understanding is not the standard by which they’re being judged,"" Wonderlich said. ""By trying to use that as a defense, that just highlights the deficiencies of the memorandum of understanding."" Granholm offered a lawyerly response that reflects ""a certain tone-deafness on the part of the Clintons, their staff and surrogates,"" said Kathleen Clark, a law professor who specializes in government ethics at Washington University in St. Louis. ""It keeps you out of jail but it doesn’t really address the underlying concern."" That concern is that donors and those with ties to the Clinton Foundation could use their connections to curry favor with the U.S. government, ""not just whether Clinton is technically violating an ethics statute"" narrowly tailored for legal purposes. So while the emails contain no smoking guns that point to pay-to-play, Wonderlich said, they contribute to ""a sense of commingling the personal and the official."" Clark held up the Clinton campaign’s argument that Band sent the emails as Bill Clinton’s aide as an example of a flimsy response. ""That’s nice, but that doesn’t mean there’s not a foundation connection,"" she said. ""The foundation’s work is no doubt laudable, but it’s not at all clear how they are addressing a reasonable perception that giving money to the foundation may help one accomplish goals related to the U.S. government."" Craig Holman of the government accountability think tank Public Citizen said the new emails at least show ""an effort was made to secure official favors"" for donors. ""The Clinton Foundation itself did not live up to the expectations of the ethics agreement,"" he said. Violations elsewhere Outside of the emails, the Clinton Foundation has actually violated its memorandum of understanding with the State Department. As previously mentioned, the foundation agreed to disclose donors every year while its various initiatives would do the same and report material increases from existing donors to the state department. But in 2015, numerous media outlets reported several instances of the Clinton Foundation breaking its promises. There were three major examples: • Not reporting to the State Department a $500,000 donation from Algeria in 2010 • Not disclosing over 1,000 donors who passed $2.35 million total through the Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative  through a Canadian foundation (the foundation simply reported the revenue from the Canadian foundation) • Not updating or notifying the State Department on the Clinton Health Access Initiative’s donor list, which included five new foreign countries and two with material increases in giving, from 2010 to 2013 To be clear, none of these disclosure failures are proof of quid pro quo. But experts told us that the Clinton camp and the public should have higher standards. ""The fact that it’s not a bribe may help keep you out of federal prison, but is that good enough?"" Clark said. Our ruling Granholm said Clinton ""abided by the ethics agreement"" between the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration. That's a misleading response that ignores what occurred at Clinton's State Department. Experts told us emails between Clinton aides and a foundation aide may not have been prohibited by the specific terms of the ethics pledges. But they demonstrate a blurring of the lines between official government business and Clinton’s personal connections — breaking the firewall Clinton agreed to preserve. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e0c97970-d37f-4572-bb2b-4d9ab6e116d8",/factchecks/2016/aug/24/jennifer-granholm/clinton-surrogate-spins-clinton-foundation-defense/

Donald Trump's Mostly False claim that $400 million payment to Iran was 'ransom'
","Back in January, Iran released five American prisoners back to the United States. On the same day, the United States transferred $400 million in cash to Iran, holding onto the money until three of the freed Americans were in the air, on their way home. Some critics of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy -- including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump -- are putting the two happenings together and calling it a ""ransom"" payment. The administration denies that characterization. ""Iran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism, has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash, where they just yesterday caught Obama in yet another lie,"" Trump said in an Aug. 21 speech in Michigan. While some in the national security community might consider the transaction unsavory, ineffectual, or legally questionable, calling it ""ransom"" isn’t quite accurate.  The word ""ransom"" implies that Iran refused to release the prisoners unless the United States turned over $400 million of its own money to Iran, and American officials capitulated. In reality, the United States owed Iran $400 million as part of a longstanding dispute, and negotiators used that pending settlement as leverage to release the detained Americans. Experts said this kind of exchange is standard issue in U.S.-Iran relations over the past few decades. The important but subtle nuance is this: While settling the $400 million helped ensure that the prisoners got home, it wasn’t an illicit payment. Iran, according to the claim adjudicators, had a legitimate right to the money. ‘Business as usual’ In 1979, Iran’s then-monarch Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi paid $400 million to the United States government to purchase military parts. But that year’s revolution toppled the shah, and the military parts were never delivered. To regain its funds, Iran filed a claim against the United States in 1981 in the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, which adjudicates disputes between the two nations. The body, located at the Hague, was established amid negotiations to end the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis, in which pro-revolution students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The tribunal's first priority was to address claims from private individuals, including 4,700 now-resolved U.S. claims filed against the Government of Iran. Over the past several years, the tribunal has focused more of its attention on claims the two governments have made against each other, including this dispute over the $400 million weapons deal. The State Department announced its settlement in the dispute — the United States would pay Iran $400 million plus $1.3 billion in interest — on Jan. 17, the same day Obama announced the return of the Americans detained in Iran, as well as the formal implementation of the nuclear deal. The first installment of the settlement was also transferred that day, via an unmarked cargo plane, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal in early August. The administration paid the funds using various European currencies because U.S. law bars financial transactions with Iran in U.S. dollars, and Iran’s access to banking is limited because of international sanctions.   The administration has explained that the $400 million settlement and the prisoner release were negotiated in separate channels and coincidentally reached their resolutions near the same time. Negotiators took advantage of the convergence in order to ensure that Iran returned the prisoners by withholding the payment until the American detainees were in the air and headed out of Iran. ""While there is no connection between the $400 million and the return of our American citizens, we did, however, in those endgame hours, hold back that payment until we knew that our Americans were safe and sound and on their way out of Iran, because, in the very last few hours, Iran was playing a few games here on us,"" said State Department spokesman John Kirby in an Aug. 19 PBS interview. We may never truly know how intertwined these two negotiation channels were, but two experts personally familiar with the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal told us that the administration’s explanation is plausible. ""As for the timing of this particular settlement, the Obama administration’s account is entirely consistent with my experience,"" said Nancy Combs, who was a legal adviser to the tribunal until becoming a professor at William and Mary Law School in 2004. Combs said this particular claim was massive in size, complexity and value, so it is likely that lawyers had been working on this case prior to and separate from the prisoner issue, as well as the nuclear deal talks. Given that these cases are hashed out by career lawyers over many years, it’s likely that the lawyers approached the administration with the news that they were in a position to settle, as opposed to the administration directing them to settle, said John Bellinger, who served as the State Department’s chief legal adviser under President George W. Bush. (Bellinger has publicly opposed Trump.) ""I suspect that these two negotiations, the claims settlement and detained persons, were completely separate and happened to come together at the same time,"" Bellinger added. ""I don’t think it’s appropriate to call this ransom, and the intent of the money was not to gain the return of these detainees."" We should note that some have pointed out an article Bellinger wrote for the Washington Post in 2009, in which he seemed to say the tribunal had already dismissed this claim. Bellinger told us that it is his understanding that the January 2016 settlement involved a different dispute. We talked to five people who study national security and Iran. The only one willing to call the payment ""ransom"" was Clare Lopez,  vice president for research and analysis at the Center for Security Policy, a right-leaning think tank. Lopez has called the broader Iran deal unconstitutional and has written for conservative websites. ""There's simply no other way to call an unmarked cargo plane delivery of pallets of shrink-wrapped European currency in the middle of the night to the foremost state sponsor of terror in the world that remains under U.S. financial sanctions for terrorism,"" Lopez said. The majority of experts said the ransom label was inaccurate. ""In no sense can this payment be considered ransom,"" Combs said. ""A ransom is a payment made to secure the release of a detained person.  This sum, by contrast, was made to satisfy a legitimate debt that the U.S. owed to Iran."" Gary Samore, executive director for research at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and a former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction under Obama, said it's not ""technically ransom in that the money that was returned was Iran’s money."" Samore said he was not surprised by the exchange because there’s a history of using financial tools to settle deals with Iran. He specifically noted that in 2011, the nation of Oman paid Iran $1 million on the United States’ behalf for the release of two American hikers who had been jailed in Iran for two years. ""It’s business as usual,"" he said. ""I don’t think the Iranians are going to release prisoners if they don’t get something."" Our ruling Trump said the Obama administration gave Iran ""$400 million in ransom payment cash."" On the same day in January, the United States paid Iran $400 million dollars, and Iran released several American prisoners. While there appears to be a quid pro quo — the United States would not give Iran the cash until the prisoners were on their way home — this does not equate to ransom, experts told us. Iran had a legitimate claim to the money, as the United States owed it to Iran as part of a resolution to a decades-long financial dispute. It’s unclear whether the prisoner and financial disputes were connected in just the final hours of the prisoner transfer or if there was more advance coordination. Trump’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/aug/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-calls-400-million-payment-iran-ransom/

Rubio voted against the Violence Against Women Act, Murphy says
","Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy is attacking Marco Rubio, his presumptive general election opponent in the race for Senate, for allegedly voting against domestic violence measures. Murphy lambasted Rubio for having a ""terrible record on women’s health"" in an Aug. 19 post on his website. Murphy’s post said Rubio opposed the right to choose an abortion, Obamacare and Planned Parenthood. ""He even voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act,"" Murphy’s campaign wrote. That sounded like a ready-made attack for election season, so we checked the voting record. Sure enough, Rubio voted against the legislation. But he had his reasons. Qualified support The original 1994 Violence Against Women Act was championed by then-Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. It provided grants to authorities on the state and local levels for domestic violence hotlines, police training, legal and housing assistance, and more. It has been credited for a decrease in domestic violence and an upswing in reporting incidents to police. The act was reauthorized in 2005, then due to expire in 2011. That brings us to Rubio’s first term. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sponsored a Senate bill in 2011 to continue the provisions of the act. It didn’t come to a vote until the following year. Rubio said he supported reauthorizing the law. But he voted against it. On April 26, 2012, Rubio and 30 other Republicans voted against Leahy’s bill, which still passed with at least some support from both sides of the aisle. Rubio released a statement after the vote saying he was in favor of the act, but opposed portions of the bill. Rubio pointed out he had voted for a proposed amendment he thought better addressed rape kit backlogs, sentencing guidelines and law enforcement databases. He added that he was against Leahy’s bill because it didn’t deal with spending controls the way he liked and gave the Justice Department control over state programs. ""I support reauthorizing the current Violence Against Women Act as written and hope we can vote for it once it comes out of the House-Senate conference committee,"" Rubio said. Leahy’s bill passed the Senate, but died in the House that year. The reauthorization came back in 2013, with Rubio again voting against it in the Senate, where it passed Feb. 13 with bipartisan support, 78-22. All 22 nays were Republicans. Rubio released another statement saying he liked provisions of the bill and was proud it included human trafficking protections, but he again said he wished the original law had been reauthorized. ""Unfortunately, I could not support the final, entire legislation that contains new provisions that could have potentially adverse consequences,"" he said. He echoed some concerns from the year prior, saying he disagreed with how the bill shifted funding from domestic violence programs to sexual assault programs and took power out of state hands. He also opposed a provision allowing Native American tribal governments greater jurisdiction in abuse cases, giving tribal courts the power to prosecute non-Native American men. On Feb. 28, 2013, the House reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act with a bipartisan vote of 286-138, with 87 Republicans voting for it. Our ruling Murphy said Rubio ""voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act."" Rubio voiced support for the original law, but he and some Republicans in both the Senate and House opposed certain provisions added to the bill pertaining to spending and federal oversight. Rubio voted against the bill in 2012 and 2013, but it passed with bipartisan support the second time. Even though he had clearly stated his reasons why, Rubio still voted nay.

General public and the press not allowed to attend Gov. Scott Walker's 'listening sessions'?
","Wisconsin state Sen. Chris Larson earned a Pants on Fire when he claimed, more than halfway into 2013, that Gov. Scott Walker ""hasn't done a public event"" the entire year. The Republican governor had attended public meetings, presided over military ceremonies and given speeches, among many other public events. Nevertheless, Walker has been criticized for not being more accessible. And on July 15, 2016, a claim made by another Democratic lawmaker caught our attention. State Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire, a lawyer and four-year lawmaker who has been mentioned as a possible 2018 gubernatorial candidate, said in a tweet: ""Walker holding listening sessions: Good. Making them invite-only & excluding the press: Not so good."" Is he right that the listening sessions are invitation only and exclude the media? Wachs’ evidence Wachs’ tweet included a link to a Capital Times news article that was posted the same day. The article said that, according to state records, Walker's office had asked lawmakers, lobbyists, state agency heads and local economic development agencies to help select attendees for his invite-only listening sessions throughout the state. The article said Walker had held 50 such sessions, all of which were open only to invited guests. The general public and the press were excluded. This wasn't disputed. The governor’s office issued a statement in connection with the 50th session that quoted Walker as saying: Before every listening session, we’re in contact with area state legislators, no matter what party they represent, as well as community leaders to help us reach out and invite a good cross-section of people with different experiences and opinions. We also focus on ensuring those from a particular community are the primary attendees. The statement continued: Advance notice of participation is intended to ensure that there are no threatening criminal backgrounds and to avoid people whose intent is to be disruptive.

While listening sessions are closed to members of the press to encourage an honest and candid conversation between attendees, local members of the media are given the opportunity to sit down for one-on-one interviews following the listening session in the interest of transparency. A few weeks earlier, residents in Pierce County held signs outside one of Walker’s listening sessions to protest not being allowed in. But such protests have not been common. Walker had touted the tour six months earlier in his ""State of the State"" address. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted criticism from Democrats, including Russ Feingold, who is running against Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson for the seat he lost to Johnson in 2010. As a senator, Feingold’s listening sessions were open to the public, and that wasn't always pleasant during the emotional debates over President Barack Obama's health-care law in 2010, the Journal Sentinel noted. If the meetings aren’t open to the public, Feingold told the newspaper, ""you're going to have a pre-selection process and you're not going to get the full picture."" Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the governor speaks to local media after each session. Our rating Wachs says Walker's ""listening sessions"" are ""invite-only and excluding the press."" As he travels Wisconsin to meet with residents, Walker asks various people, including Democratic lawmakers, for suggestions on who to invite to his listening sessions. But the sessions are not open to the public or to the press, only to people who are invited.

Anti-Duckworth Super Pac ad goes nuclear on Iran deal
","In a new television ad supporting U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC went after his opponent, U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Hoffman Estates. In the 30-second spot, a female narrator attacks Duckworth’s national security track record, slamming her for supporting the Iran nuclear deal. The ad portrays the Iran nuclear deal as a bad one and says recently unearthed information makes the deal even worse. The narrator says, ""...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told. And Tammy Duckworth voted ‘yes’ (on the Iran nuclear deal)."" The Politico Illinois Playbook said the spot is running in ""Rockford and number of downstate markets, namely Peoria, Champaign and Springfield."" Tammy Duckworth did vote yes for the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). That’s an established fact. But did secret documents reveal Iranians could have access to nuclear weapons earlier than the 15-year window outlined in the JCPOA? We took a look into the PAC’s claim to find out. Independent Voice for Illinois PAC First off, what is the Independent Voice for Illinois (IVFI) PAC? It’s what’s known as an independent expenditure PAC or a Super PAC. Independent expenditure PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money in support of or in opposition to political candidates, but are prohibited from coordinating their activities with or donating directly to candidate campaigns. This means that Kirk would not have known about the IVFI ad before it appeared. There’s not much information out there on the group. But we did find the PAC’s treasurer Jo Merlau submitted its statement of organization in February 2015, according to the Federal Election Commission. The political research website Open Secrets shows IVFI has raised more than $1.6 million in 2016 with hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations coming from people like Chicago businessman Ken Griffin and New York hedge fund manager Paul Singer. Open Secrets also showed IVFI spent money on vendors supporting failed Republican presidential candidates John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal. Notably, IVFI filed three independent expenditures in late July and early August with the FEC for media production. The payments went to the Washington, D.C., media firm Strategic Media Services, Inc., and the documents showed a media placement/media production order opposing Duckworth. Strategic Media Services did not return calls to confirm whether they were responsible for the ad. The Iran deal, the IVFI advertisement and the Associated Press Next, let’s look at the Iran nuclear deal. In the original document outlining the deal, the JCPOA never says it would allow Iran to build or obtain a nuclear weapon before the 15-year deal expires. In fact, the JCPOA says, ""Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons,"" and reiterates that point throughout the deal. The IVFI PAC video ad says secret documents that were leaked contain information about the Iran deal. An illustration in the video indicates they are referencing information reported in a July 18 article by the Associated Press. The Associated Press reported an unnamed source leaked unpublished information about an add-on agreement to the JCPOA. The source told the Associated Press members of Congress knew about the add-on agreement, but its contents never were made public. However, the Associated Press only references one confidential document in its story. The Associated Press, in fact, says this ""confidential document is the only text linked to last year’s deal between Iran and six foreign powers that hasn’t been made public."" IVFI’s ad incorrectly says there are multiple secret documents. That implied the federal government was hiding more information than was actually reported in the Associated Press story. Investigating the specific language of the IVFI ad reveals another discrepancy with the Associated Press story. The IVFI ad says ""Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told,"" according to ""secret documents."" However, the Associated Press story never says that. The story says the leaked document revealed that Iran’s nuclear limitations will ease up earlier than what is outlined in the 15-year deal approved in January. It also says the internally negotiated deal would advance ""Tehran's ability to build a bomb even before the end of the pact."" Even though Iran will have the ability, it would not be allowed to create a fully completed weapon until the deal ends. The Associated Press goes further, saying the contents of the secret document give Iran fewer limits on installing more advanced centrifuges to churn uranium for the core of a nuclear weapon. However, the Associated Press explicitly says Iran’s ability to install these newer centrifuges doesn’t mean it would be allowed to build bombs before the 15-year pact ends. From the Associated Press story: (The centrifuge machines) will give Iran a huge potential boost in enrichment capacity, including bomb making should it choose to do so. But it can be put to use only after the deal expires. The story never reports Iran can obtain a nuclear weapon sooner than outlined in the JCPOA, as claimed in the IVFI advertisement.   The secret document and the JCPOA The Associated Press story reveals the contents of a secret document showing an add-on agreement imposing fewer restrictions to the JCPOA. But Daniel Joyner, the director of international programs at the University of Alabama School of Law, says not so fast. ""The (Associated Press) story isn’t wrong. It’s just a little misleading,"" he said. Joyner points out the contents of the leaked secret document aren’t much different from pages 6 and 7 of the JCPOA, which deals with centrifuge and uranium enrichment regulation. ""You’ll see there that the commitments with regard to centrifuges last for 10 years, not for 15. So the confidential document, which discusses years 11-13, does not contradict the terms of the JCPOA. So why would anyone interpret this new information as something that conflicts with the JCPOA? ""There are people out there who are out to kill (the JCPOA),"" Joyner said. ""The fact that it was from a confidential source throws up some red flags. There’s nothing contradictory in the leaked documents."" Our ruling In their anti-Duckworth campaign ad, the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC says ""...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told. And Tammy Duckworth voted ‘yes.’ "" Duckworth did vote in favor of the JCPOA, but the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC’s ad is still incorrect on several fronts. The advertisement indicates there are multiple documents. But according to the Associated Press story the ad references, there is only one secret document. The ad also says these ""secret documents"" would allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon sooner than we were told. This, too, is incorrect. The document explains the secret agreement would boost uranium enrichment capacity, but never says Iran would be able to obtain a weapon sooner. Finally, an expert told PolitiFact Illinois that there is actually no contradiction between the main agreement and the secret document, just a bit more detail. Together, these points show a manipulation of the facts. IVFI misinterpreted information from the Associated Press in their advertisement, potentially leading people to believe Iran will have access to a completed and usable weapon before the deal expires. For that, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/aug/23/independent-voice-illinois-pac/anti-duckworth-super-pac-ad-goes-nuclear-iran-deal/

Donald Trump fundraising email takes CNN anchor's comments out of context
","The media has been one of Donald Trump’s most consistent targets during his 2016 presidential campaign. In a recent fundraising email, his campaign called out CNN. ""Friend, a CNN anchor acknowledged that the media has given Hillary Clinton a ‘free ride,’ "" the email said. It then quoted a comment attributed to CNN morning anchor Chris Cuomo: ""We couldn't help her any more than we have. She's got a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign."" The email, signed by Brad Parscale of ""Team TRUMP,"" provides links to donate money and includes the following GIF of CNN’s Cuomo.  We decided to see whether Cuomo did in fact say, ""We couldn't help her (Hillary Clinton) any more than we have. She's got a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign."" We found that Cuomo did say those words -- but that their meaning is not as clear-cut as the Trump campaign indicates. (CNN declined an opportunity to comment. Trump’s campaign did not respond to inquiries.) Cuomo’s comment came on the show he co-anchors, New Day — but a crucial fact not mentioned by the Trump campaign email is that the comments came more than two years ago, on June 9, 2014. That timing makes a significant difference for the meaning of Cuomo’s words. In mid 2014, Clinton was widely believed to be a presidential candidate in waiting, but she had not officially announced that she was running for the White House. She did not officially announce her candidacy until April 12, 2015,  more than 10 months after the CNN exchange aired. The news peg for the CNN discussion was the media promotion that Clinton was doing in advance of the June 10, 2014, publication of her book, Hard Choices: A Memoir. For someone who was officially a non-candidate for president, Clinton’s book-promotion efforts enabled her to get some ""earned"" media, meaning news coverage without having to pay for ads. That’s the backdrop for the CNN discussion, as this excerpt shows: Brianna Keilar, CNN correspondent: ""So, trying to downplay the issue there, but this book is part of the big book rollout. There will be other interviews. There will be a lot of speeches. There will be book signings. And all of it, Brooke and Chris, is designed to sell books and keep her well positioned for a 2016 run."" Brooke Baldwin, CNN co-anchor: ""We talked about this before, nothing is on accident, this is all perfectly choreographed to read through the tea leaves of whatever it is she says this week. But, you know, Diane Sawyer (of ABC) said to her, you know, listen, it sort of seems the party is frozen right now. So, let me ask you about that about the people who may possibly run against her at least on the left side of the aisle. She said that they can do whatever they choose to do in whatever timetable they decide. But that's not entirely true."" Keilar: ""No, it's not really true. I mean, there's not a whole lot maybe she can do about it right now, because I think pretty much, everyone agrees, the sooner she gets into this race, the trickier it is for her. But largely right now when you're looking at staff picks and fundraising, those folks are kind of holding their fire. So, I think she has, if she decides she is probably going to run, she's got a little more time. If she's thinking she may not run, then she kind of needs to get out of the way and let some of these Democrats, you know, make headway when it comes to fundraising and stuff."" Cuomo: ""What your guys’ take on this? I was actually happy that Diane pressed her the way she did. You know, it's a dicey move because when Hillary becomes candidate and becomes the presumptive candidate, that can come back and hurt you. But Diane pressed her anyway and got her to say, yes, by the end of the year. That's early, by the way, right, Brianna? I mean, you know, if she says end of the year, I'm in, she's early."" ... Baldwin: ""Okay, Brianna, thank you very much. We'll be talking about this later on in the morning. But just quickly, to your point, I mean, if it does take quite a while longer, what happens to the other folks who want to attempt to run against her?"" Cuomo: ""Because she's doing what they call in politics, freezing pockets, because the donors are giving her money thinking she's going to run. That means they're not going to have available money for other candidates --"" Baldwin: ""Exactly."" Cuomo: ""-- if she doesn't and I don't think she's going to give it to them."" Baldwin: ""She's on her way."" Cuomo: ""We'll see. We couldn't help her any more than we have. She's got just a free ride, so far, from the media. We're the biggest ones promoting her campaign. So, it better happen."" So those were Cuomo’s words. But there is a strong argument for an alternative, and far less controversial, interpretation than the one the Trump campaign offered. The first thing to note is that the ""help"" Cuomo is referring to is the advance coverage of Clinton’s book release. This is the same type of ""earned media"" that Trump has built his campaign on. For both candidates, political celebrity plus newsworthy comments equals media coverage. And by ""free ride,"" Cuomo isn’t saying that the media has been unquestioning toward Clinton. Quite the opposite — Cuomo applauded what he saw as Sawyer’s tough questioning of Clinton. Moments before the quote highlighted by the Trump campaign, Cuomo specifically said, ""I was actually happy that Diane pressed her the way she did. You know, it's a dicey move because when Hillary becomes candidate and becomes the presumptive candidate, that can come back and hurt you."" The ""free ride"" for Clinton seems to refer to the earned — literally, ""free"" — media coverage that Clinton was enjoying at the time, much as Trump eventually would. It was ""free"" in the sense that Clinton didn’t have to pay a dime for the coverage of her book release. The same logic can be used to support Cuomo’s comment that ""we’re the biggest ones promoting her campaign."" He doesn’t mean ""promote"" in the sense of ""support the election of,"" but rather ""give a media platform to,"" at a time when she would not be able to run paid presidential campaign ads. It’s also worth noting that, if you watch the original video, Cuomo is smiling as he banters with Baldwin. When Cuomo says, ""So it better happen,"" which is a portion of the quote that doesn’t appear in the Trump email, he appears to be joking that it would all be a big waste of journalists’ time if Clinton didn’t end up running for president. Our ruling The Trump campaign email says that Cuomo said, ""We couldn't help (Hillary Clinton) any more than we have. She's got a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign."" Cuomo did literally say those words, but the Trump campaign has taken them significantly out of context. Cuomo said these words more than two years ago, before Clinton declared herself a presidential candidate. Given this backdrop, the most plausible interpretation is that Cuomo was noting Clinton’s reliance on ""free"" media from outlets like CNN at a time when she would not have been able to run campaign ads or other electoral-advocacy efforts. And Cuomo’s smile — along with his comment that the campaign ""better happen"" after all the time they spent covering Clinton’s book — suggests that he’s being a bit smart-alecky rather than fully serious.

Did Jacky Rosen flip-flop on Iran nuclear deal?
","The National Republican Congressional Committee accused a Nevada Democratic candidate of flip-flopping on an important national security issue — the nuclear deal with Iran. In a recent blog post, the NRCC claims Democratic House candidate Jacky Rosen, a former Henderson synagogue president, is flip-flopping on support for the arrangement. ""Despite all warning signs, Rosen initially supported the deal,"" the group said. ""Then, realizing how detrimental her position could be to her election prospects, Rosen reversed course and said she would have opposed it."" Rosen’s position isn’t exactly a complete flip-flop. Her initial support for the deal wasn’t as clear or as strongly stated as the blog says. We decided to weigh her statements on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate’s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes. Republicans have sought to tie Democrats (including in Nevada) to the 2015 diplomatic arrangement with Iran, which aims to extend the time it takes for the country to make a nuclear bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Rosen, a former Henderson synagogue leader and political newcomer, has addressed the deal publicly on just a handful of occasions. She made her first remarks about the deal in an interview (audio) with the Las Vegas Sun and a PolitiFact Nevada reporter in April, saying Obama ""made the best deal"" he could. ""Just being an ordinary citizen, I do believe that he made the best deal that he thought he could at the time or he probably wouldn't have made it,"" she said at the time. ""That being said, it doesn't mean that we don't watch everything they do. It doesn't mean that we don't watch where money gets invested into Iran. Where they're spending their money. It doesn't mean that we don't keep watching them. It doesn't mean we don't keep improving on the agreement where we have to or imposing sanctions where we have to. A month later, Rosen again addressed the deal, but this time she struck a different tone. She told political reporter Jon Ralston that she would have voted against the deal had she been in Congress at the time.She said it said didn’t reflect a change in position. ""I guess as I have had a chance to think about and clarify it, it hasn’t changed,"" she said. ""I did say I want to hold their feet to the fire, I want to look at where the money goes, and I don’t want a nuclearized Iran."" PolitiFact reached out to the Rosen campaign, which provided a statement from the candidate saying that her position on the deal has been ""clear and consistent."" To help prove the point, the campaign also provided an email exchange from late March to early April between Rosen campaign manager David Furr and a staff member at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee over an Israel policy paper including her position on the Iran deal. The paper reflects what Rosen said to Ralston in May. ""If Jacky had been in Congress when the vote on the Iran deal had occurred, she would have opposed the deal,"" the paper reads. ""But now that it has been agreed, the United States must demand that Iran abide by the agreement completely, and any cheating or subversion of the agreement should be dealt with swiftly."" A few caveats do apply — this paper wasn’t previously available publicly, so there would be no way for voters to know her position. Rosen also doesn’t list any foreign policy positions (or any issues, for that matter) on her website. Our ruling Rosen has only been quoted a handful of times on the Iran deal. In April, she expressed measured support of the deal (without using the word ""support""), saying she believed it was the best deal Obama could have reached, and that it could be improved. Her view the next month was more articulated. She said she would have voted against it as a member of Congress. Because she has partially changed her position, we rate Rosen’s position as Half Flip.",/factchecks/2016/aug/23/jacky-rosen/did-jacky-rosen-flip-flop-iran-nuclear-deal/

Ohio Democrats' ad ties Sen. Rob Portman to Haitian dictator
","As part of their campaign to help Democratic candidate Ted Strickland to the U.S. Senate, the Ohio Democratic Party announced an August onslaught of web videos, ads and editorials called ""The Portman Files."" The campaign will highlight Ohio’s Sen. Rob Portman’s ""career as a D.C. lobbyist and lawyer for a series of nefarious clients and interest groups,"" according to the Ohio Democrats. First in this launch is a web ad titled, ""Baby Doc."" Text scrolling across the screen reads, ""In the 1980s, Haiti is ruled by the brutal dictator Jean-Claude ‘Baby Doc’ Duvalier."" A quick 60 Minutes clip describes Duvalier as having ruled Haiti with ""unchecked brutality."" The scrolling text continues over spooky music: ""In 1985, Rob Portman joined a D.C. lobbying firm and became a ‘registered foreign agent’ for the government of Haiti."" An unidentified voice says, ""Thousands of Haitians were killed, disappeared, tortured. Those who spoke out against Duvalier were just taken away."" Finally, the scrolling words conclude, ""In 1985 Portman’s lobbying firm revealed traveling to Haiti to meet with Baby Doc. Who would sign up to speak for a dictator? Rob Portman, decades of fighting for the rich and the powerful."" Linking Portman’s first job, post-college, with the regime of a corrupt dictator seemed extraordinarily far-fetched, even for this election season. We looked for the source. Portman started working with the law firm Patton, Boggs & Blow after graduating from University of Michigan’s law school in 1984, according to a 2012 Cleveland.com article. Responding to our inquiry, the Ohio Democratic Party provided us with a copy of a short-form registration statement signed by Portman on May 5, 1985. We asked Brett Kappel, a partner at Akerman LLP and an authority on lobbying, campaign finance and government ethics laws, to take a look at the registration form. Kappel confirmed, via email, that it ""does show that Senator Portman did register as a foreign agent for Haiti, as well as four other Patton Boggs clients.""   Kappel also said that lobbying regulations would not have required Portman to register for all of Patton Boggs’ clients. The other clients for which Portman registered were the Government of the Sultanate of Oman; the Guatemala Sugar Association; Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd.; and a group of cigar and tobacco makers. On Portman’s campaign website, the Haiti registration is explained as ""standard procedure"" at the lobbying firm, and required of all of its attorneys. Portman’s staff supplied PolitiFact Ohio with an affidavit from a former managing partner of Patton Boggs & Blow, Stuart Pape, dated April 12, 2005. In his affidavit, Pape explained how Portman filed the May 5, 1985, registration statement because he was working on the Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd. account, a foreign principal based in Hong Kong. Pape further said that he reviewed the records and confirmed that Portman did no work for the Republic of Haiti or any foreign government while with the firm. This affidavit became necessary in 2005, the year President George W. Bush tapped Portman as his United States Trade Representative. Rules dictate that the U.S. trade representative position cannot be held by anyone who has ever lobbied for foreign governments. Haiti did not come up as an issue during the Senate confirmation process. Sen. Evan Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana, briefly sought to hold up Portman's confirmation until he got a commitment from Portman to get tough on trade with China. Portman was confirmed as trade representative by a unanimous vote. The ad is careful in its wording. Its claim is that ""Portman’s firm revealed traveling to Haiti to meet with Baby Doc."" That, records show, really happened. But the shade that the ad attempts to throw on Portman’s record is undeserved. Portman did not lobby on behalf of Haiti or its dictator while with Patton Boggs & Blow. Our ruling The anti-Portman ad ominously asks, ""Who would sign up to speak for a (Haitian) dictator? Rob Portman."" Portman worked for a lobbying firm that required its attorneys to register as foreign agents in case they were assigned to work for overseas clients. One of the firm’s clients was the Republic of Haiti, which was under the power of dictator ""Baby Doc"" until 1986. Portman was with the firm from October 1984 to October 1986. He did register as a foreign agent for the Republic of Haiti in 1985, and four other foreign-based clients. But the only work Portman performed directly for a foreign account was on behalf of Hong Kong-based Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., according to a sworn statement by a managing partner of Patton Boggs LLP in April 2005. We rate this ad Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/aug/23/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democrats-ad-ties-sen-rob-portman-haitian-dic/
