Claims cap-and-trade will cause job losses
","EnergyCitizens.org  has a new complaint about the cap-and-trade bill: It's a job killer.
 
In an Oct. 4, 2009, ad in the  Washington Post  , the group said that ""2 million jobs lost"" is ""another unfortunate truth about Congress's climate bill.""

The organization, which includes business associations, antitax groups, transportation companies and the American Petroleum Institute, has ramped up criticism of the sweeping cap-and-trade bill since the Senate took up its own version of the legislation in late September. The House has already passed its version of the bill; it aims to lower carbon pollution 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 by capping carbon emissions and requiring firms to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting.
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. They argue that phasing out fossil fuels will require big job cuts and many employment opportunities will be sent overseas.
 
EnergyCitizens.org is among the critics.
 
The group's ad cites a May 27 study of the House bill written for the National Black Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the bill, by private consulting firm CRA International. The study predicts that net job losses could be as high as 2.5 million by 2030 and 3 million in 2050.
 
CRA International does not dispute the fact that cap-and-trade would create new jobs. But, ""despite the promise of green jobs, ACESA would, if enacted, inevitably depress total employment from baseline levels. The bill would divert resources now used to produce additional goods and services into the work of obtaining energy from sources that are more costly than fossil fuels.""  That outlook doesn't square with what we've been hearing from lawmakers who support a cap-and-trade plan. The backers of the House version say the legislation would create ""millions of new clean-energy jobs.""

The authors of the Senate version say, ""This bill includes targeted protection for our manufacturing sector to ensure that American companies remain competitive and jobs remain here at home. New programs will train workers to succeed in the new energy economy. Agriculture and rural America will see a boom in investments in biofuels and alternative energy sources.""
 
Both bills include funding for worker training and expanded unemployment benefits; for example, the House bill would provide 156 weeks of benefits, helping to pay for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance  to those who lose their jobs  as the result of cap-and-trade.
 
But neither House nor Senate lawmakers working on the legislation have pinned down exactly how many jobs their bills would eliminate and create, so we decided to look at other estimates.
 
The Center for American Progress, another liberal group, says the bill could create a net increase of about 1.7 million jobs so long as $150 billion is dedicated to the clean-energy industry every year.
 
""These job gains would be enough — on their own — to reduce the unemployment rate in today’s economy by about one full percentage point, to 8.4 percent from current 9.4 percent levels — even after taking into full account the inevitable job losses in conventional fossil fuel sectors of the U.S. economy as they contract,"" according to the June 2009 report.
 
And a second analysis done by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a group that is supporting the bill, estimates that the cap-and-trade bill could create anywhere between 600,000 and 1 million new jobs by 2030.
 
Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in September 2009 that the cap-and-trade plan would have a minor effect on employment in the long-run.
 
""The small effect on overall employment would mask a significant shift in the composition of employment over time,"" according to the report. ""A cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the number of jobs in industries that produce carbon-based energy, use energy intensively in their production processes, or produce products whose use involves energy consumption, because those industries would experience the greatest increases in costs and declines in sales."" But ""the shifts in demand caused by the policy would also create new employment opportunities in some industries.""

Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said, ""Estimating jobs is a very difficult task for the limited modeling tools that we have."" Jobs will almost certainly be lost and created under a cap-and-trade program, it's just a matter to what degree, he said. The CRA International report used in the EnergyCitizens.org ad ""falls on the high end.""

So, back to EnergyCitizens.org's claim that 2 million jobs will be lost under cap-and-trade. As we've shown, the job predictions are all over the map. Supporters of cap-and-trade predict an increase. CRA, which was hired by an opponent of the proposal, says jobs will be lost. The independent CBO characterizes it as a wash.

Of all these groups, we're inclined to believe the CBO, since it is independent. But we can't rule out the possibility that there could be gains or losses on either end, as the predictions aligned with supporters and opponents suggest. So we find the ad's claim to be Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2009/oct/05/energycitizensorg/claims-cap-and-trade-will-cause-job-losses/

Offshore oil drilling has cost tourism industry before
","
A leading advocate for oil drilling off the west coast of Florida is making his case by saying drilling has never been bad for tourism.
 
Ever.
 
""There's no evidence anywhere that offshore drilling has hurt tourism in any area where it has been allowed,"" said Barney Bishop, president of Associated Industries of Florida, a statewide business lobbying group. ""High energy costs and high unemployment kill tourism more than anything. Without affordable gas, we can't get tourists to Florida.""
 
Can oil and tourism mix?
 
Bishop's statement is focused on offshore drilling and not spills in general. It's an important distinction. Large-scale oil spills are more likely to be caused by tanker and barge crashes, not offshore drilling, according to the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.
 
So while Florida beaches and tourism were affected by a three-barge collision that sent 330,000 gallons of oil and jet fuel into Tampa Bay area waters in 1993, it wasn't as a direct result of offshore drilling.
 
To get to the root of Bishop's claim, then, offshore oil drilling itself has to be the culprit.
 
The record there is thin, but not bare.
 
An oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico 600 miles south of the Texas coastline malfunctioned in June 1979, sending oil pouring into gulf waters. According to estimates, the well, called Ixtoc 1, spewed 3.3 million barrels of oil before being capped in March 1980. The oil traveled north to soil 200 miles of Texas beach.
 
Did that spill, one of the worst in history, hurt Texas tourism?
 
""Sure it did,"" said Tony Amos, a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute. ""Because vast amounts of tar came up on our beaches.""
 
Private groups and people connected with the tourist trade filed more than $300 million in lawsuits after the Ixtoc spill, saying the damage cost them that much in business, according to a 1980 Associated Press article.
 
On South Padre Island, the mayor at the time, Glenn McGehee, said the spill cost his area $15 million. After the spill was cleaned up, the island's tourism bureau spent $200,000 on a new ad campaign: ""Come on down, the coast is clear.""
 
Tourism in other parts of south Texas was reported down anywhere from 30 to 60 percent, according to newspaper accounts, and several communities said they lost millions of dollars as a result from the spill.
 
And a 1982 study conducted for the U.S. Interior Department found that Texas beaches in the South Padre Island area lost tourism revenues between $3.98 million and $4.44 million.
 
""The Ixtoc well spill pretty much shut down tourism,"" said F. Charles Lamphear, a retired University of Nebraska at Lincoln professor who co-authored the 1982 study. Lamphear did point out that some of the losses were offset by cleanup-related funding.
 
Another oft-discussed incident, a 1969 oil drilling accident off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif., also affected tourism in that community, according to Santa Barbara County officials. The U.S. Coast Guard estimated that 100,000 barrels of crude oil spilled during the accident.
 
""The tourist industry suffered in 1969; however, tourism recovered in subsequent years,"" county officials in Santa Barbara write on their government Web site. ""A class-action lawsuit awarded nearly $6.5 million to owners of beachfront homes, apartments, hotels and motels.""
 
A public relations firm representing Bishop provided a six-page brief to PolitiFact to support his comments. The brief acknowledges direct impacts on tourism, but calls them somewhat rare and short-lived.
 
One synopsis of a study of the Santa Barbara spill notes that the region lost ""only"" $3.15 million in recreational activity dollars. In 2008 dollars, that translates to almost $18.5 million.
 
Another study said that while losses by beachfront businesses in Santa Barbara may have suffered, other businesses farther inland benefited.
 
Using superlatives and absolutes might make for the best sound bite, but it also makes it more difficult to be right. Bishop said, ""There's no evidence anywhere that offshore drilling has hurt tourism in any area where it has been allowed,” and the record shows otherwise. Though infrequent, incidents of offshore drilling directly and adversely affecting an area's tourist economy do exist. For that, we rate Bishop's statement False.

"['Environment', 'Energy', 'Foreign Policy', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Bill Nelson says offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico no guarantee for lessening U.S. dependence on foreign oil
","The whole fervor behind ""Drill, baby drill!"" was to reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil, right? We thought so, too. So listen to this: U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat opposing drilling closer to Florida's shoreline, says increased drilling in the Gulf of Mexico might not help America at all. ""Supporters of opening up the eastern gulf say that we need to do it to help get America off foreign oil,"" Nelson  said  on the Senate floor in June. ""Tell me then why isn't there a clause in the drilling amendment that was passed specifying that all oil and natural gas that would be produced in the eastern gulf … stay in the United States for domestic consumption? ""But no, that's not there. Because the truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop."" Naturally, we wondered if Nelson's claim about oil drilling in the gulf is true. His comments refer to the massive energy bill sitting in the U.S. Senate. The bill, officially called the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, would allow oil drilling within 45 miles of the Florida coastline and closer in areas near the Panhandle. We examined the 532-page bill to see what would become of that newfound oil and found no restrictions on where it ends up. We confirmed that with David Marks, press assistant at the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. ""There are no restrictions in the bill,"" he said. While the bill contains no limits on where the oil can flow, there have been limits placed on American oil previously. During the 1973 Arab oil embargo, Congress authorized the construction of a Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to funnel oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, Alaska. But the approval came with a restriction: Alaska oil could not be exported. The ban remained in place until 1996, according to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. So without a ban, the crude oil collected in the eastern Gulf of Mexico could indeed be shipped anywhere. Would it though? The answer is most likely not. Currently, almost all of the crude oil pumped in the western Gulf of Mexico is transported via a 10,000-mile pipeline network to U.S. shores. That crude oil is then mixed with imported crude oil and refined at onshore facilities into gasoline, jet fuel and kerosene. Some of the oil even becomes asphalt. Paul Hess, an analyst at the Energy Information Administration, said ""very little"" gulf crude oil is exported, if any. ""It's a very small amount,"" Hess said. ""We don't track that level of detail."" Offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico produced about 1.17 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2008. In 2006, for instance, the EIA recorded crude oil exports in its gulf coast region — which is made up of more than just the Gulf of Mexico — at 1,000 barrels of crude oil a day. In 2008, there were no recorded exports. Mickey Driver, a spokesman with Chevron, said that all of his company's 200,000 barrels a day of gulf oil is shipped via pipeline to the United States, where it is consumed. ""It would make no economic sense and it would absolutely make no process sense to do anything else,"" Driver said. In other words, why pay to ship gulf crude around the world when an oil-hungry U.S. market is right there waiting to pay for it? The United States already has to import about two-thirds of the crude oil it uses. It should be noted that a Brazilian company, Petrobras, is in the process of building a type of offshore refinery that would process crude oil offshore rather than build a pipeline to the Louisiana coast. That refined oil then would be moved by tanker ship. Petrobras America spokesman Ciro Ribeiro said the offshore processing facility will be up and running in 2010. ""The destination should be the domestic market,"" Ribeiro said. ""Any port in the Gulf of Mexico."" Nelson is right when he says that ""oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world,"" because the federal legislation doesn’t now include any limits. But he doesn't offer the broader context. History shows that most domestic crude oil is used domestically. On the whole, we rate Nelson's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2009/oct/05/bill-nelson/Bill-Nelson-says-offshore-oil-drilling-in-the-Gulf/

Michael Moore says young people are increasingly warm to socialism
","
Responding to conservative critics of President Barack Obama who say the president is leading the United States toward socialism, filmmaker Michael Moore says that wouldn't necessarily be out of step with public opinion.


In his just-released documentary,

Capitalism: A Love Story

, Moore recites an episode from the 2008 campaign that prompted critics to say Obama was a socialist. But Moore then cites poll statistics to show that socialism is surprisingly popular with American young people.

 

""By Election Day, the Rasmussen poll reported that only 37 percent of young adults now favor capitalism over socialism,"" Moore says in the film.


He added in footnotes to the movie on MichaelMoore.com that ""despite fear-mongering about the word, particularly around the time of the 2008 presidential election, young people are increasingly interested in socialism.""

 

The footnotes say the Rasmussen Reports poll found that ""adults under 30 are essentially evenly divided: 37 percent prefer capitalism, 33 percent socialism, and 30 percent are undecided.""


We located the poll in question. It was taken in April 2009 using automated telephone calls. It had 1,000 adult respondents and a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.


But the Rasmussen poll was taken five months after the election. So in the movie, Moore incorrectly describes the timing. At the point the poll was taken, Obama had been in office for nearly three months and the nation was in the depths of a recession.

 

We should point out that over the years, critics have faulted Rasmussen for using machines rather than human interviewers, although it and other ""robo-call"" pollsters have won some acceptance. But more importantly, Rasmussen made no effort to make sure the people taking part in the survey understood the difference between capitalism and socialism. Rasmussen asked, ""Which is a better system, capitalism or socialism?"" The survey did not define either term.

 

Among survey participants of all ages, 53 percent preferred capitalism, 20 percent preferred socialism and 27 percent said they were unsure. But for adults under 30, the group Moore was talking about, the results broke down as 37 percent for capitalism, 33 percent for socialism and 30 percent undecided.


So Moore reported those results accurately. Let's look closely, though, at how Moore phrased his assertion. He said on his Web site that young people ""are increasingly interested in socialism."" That means their attitudes had to have changed to some degree over time. And we can't find evidence of that. And in the movie, he incorrectly pegged it to the November 2008 election.


The polling firm's president, Scott Rasmussen, told PolitiFact that he has only asked that question once. So there's no way to compare his April poll question against other Rasmussen questions taken at different times.


As for data by other pollsters, we contacted Karlyn Bowman, a veteran polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. She said that as soon as the Rasmussen question about socialism came out in April and began attracting media attention, she asked an intern to trawl through her polling databases to locate similar questions over the years. The intern found about a dozen items that addressed the question of socialism or free markets, but most of them aren't especially comparable to Rasmussen's question.


For starters, the questions' wording is all over the map — a problem because pollsters warn that questions asked with different wordings can elicit different answers. One asked whether respondents agreed with the statement, ""The United States would be better off if it moved toward socialism,"" while another asked whether they agreed with the statement, ""Most people are better off in a free market economy, even though some people are rich and some are poor.""


More importantly, though, Bowman could find only a few polls for which the response data was broken down by age. She said that age breakdowns are not typically included in the public versions of polls.

 

Still, we'll report the two other polls with age breakdowns that we or Bowman were able to locate.

 

One was a January 2009 Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll. It asked, ""Do you think it would be a good thing or a bad thing for the United States to move away from capitalism and more toward socialism?"" Among respondents of all ages, 23 percent said it was a good thing, 65 percent said it was a bad thing and 12 percent didn't know. But among the under-30 crowd, 31 percent said it was a good thing, 54 percent said it was a bad thing and 15 percent didn't know.

 

That's more favorable to socialism than the all-age sample as a whole, but the poll doesn't exactly show that under-30s are ""evenly divided,"" as they were in the Rasmussen poll. So this result undercuts Moore's claim that socialism is running strong among America's young people.

 

Not convinced by a poll sponsored by Fox News, which liberals accuse of having a conservative bias? Then try one from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, which has a reputation for being nonideological.

 

The Pew center took a poll in March 2009 that asked, ""Generally, do you think people are better off in a free-market economy, even though there may be severe ups and downs from time to time, or don't you think so?"" Among all respondents, 70 percent agreed that people were better off in a free-market economy, while 20 percent disagreed and 10 percent said they didn't know.

 

Among respondents under 30, the numbers weren't much different: 69 percent agreed that people were better off in a free-market economy and 26 percent disagreed, with 6 percent saying they didn't know. So, these responses also undercut Moore's notion that younger Americans are looking fondly at socialism.

 

Scott Rasmussen has a theory. He suggested that support for capitalism as it is currently practiced is weakening, even as support for the theory of free markets remains strong.

 

He cites an April Rasmussen survey that asked whether respondents favored a free-market economy or a government-managed economy. Overall, 77 percent of respondents favored a free-market economy, while just 11 percent favored a government-managed economy. For those under 30, free markets led, 79 percent to 8 percent.

 

These results simultaneously bolster and undercut the claim in

Capitalism: A Love Story

. On the plus side for Moore, Rasmussen suggested in an interview that ""the word 'capitalism' had taken on a lot of baggage partly because it was seen through the lens of taxpayer bailouts"" and other scandals and collapses on Wall Street. These developments are a primary target of Moore's movie.

 

“It’s hard for people to embrace a system that lets big business keep profits in good times and then asks for taxpayer bailouts when times are tough,"" Rasmussen wrote in a news release announcing the poll results.
 
On the other hand, the fact that Rasmussen found Americans under 30 supporting a free-market economy over a government-managed economy by nearly 10-to-1 undermines Moore's notion that young people are warm to socialism.


After we inquired about it, Moore's camp acknowledged to PolitiFact that the ""increasingly"" reference on the Web site was wrong.


""It looks like the problem here is with the fact-check section of the our Web site,"" said Jonathan Schwarz, a spokesman for Moore. ""Now, I’m completely sure that the attitudes of young adults toward economic matters ARE different than those of young adults during (say) the Reagan administration or the late '90s, but the movie doesn’t make that specific claim."" He said that the Web reference will be changed.


But while that item may be corrected on the Web site, the statement in the movie still says that ""by Election Day,"" socialism was more popular with young people than it used to be. There does not appear to be much, if any, poll data to support that. So Moore has not convincingly shown that young people are reacting to the U.S. economic system by moving toward socialism. We rate Moore's statement False.

Michael Moore's film Capitalism claims richest paid top tax rate of 90 percent in the 1950s
","
In his new film,

Capitalism: A Love Story

, Michael Moore makes a case that the richest Americans used to shoulder a much bigger portion of the tax burden back in the years of his childhood.
 
In the 1950s, ""A lot of people got rich — and they had to pay a top tax rate of 90 percent,"" Moore says in the film.
 
Considering that the top marginal tax rate for the wealthiest Americans today is 35 percent, that figure seems astounding. But it's true that in the 1950s, the top

marginal

tax rates were over 90 percent.
 
So does that mean that someone in 1955 making a half million dollars had to fork over $450,000 of it to Uncle Sam? No.
 
We are talking here about ""marginal"" tax rates. Moore doesn't go out of his way to explain this, so we will. The marginal tax rate is the top rate of income tax charged to individuals on their last dollar of earnings. So in 1955, for example, when the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent, that was the tax rate owed on a person's income over $300,000. That person would, however, pay 20 percent on the first $2,000 of income; 21 percent on the next $2,000 in income; 24 percent on the next $2,000 and graduated on up to the highest rate. On average, a person making, say, $500,000 would pay substantially less than 90 percent of their income in federal taxes.
 
The top marginal tax rates peaked in 1952 and 1953 at 92 percent for income over $300,000.
 
Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center did some math for us to give this some perspective.
 
In 1952 and 1953, Williams said, when the top income tax rate was 92 percent for income over $300,000, a person would have to make waaaay more than $300,000 to actually end up paying an average of 90 percent of their income. According to Williams, someone would have to make $2,328,400, and therefore pay $2,095,560, to get to that 90 percent threshold.
 
But people with income of less than $2.3 million — remember we're talking about 1952 and 1953 — would have paid, on average, something less than 90 percent, and perhaps much less.
 
Still, Moore's point is valid. The top marginal tax rates paid by the richest Americans were far higher in the 1950s than they are now. In 2009, the top marginal rate was 35 percent on income above $372,958. And although Moore didn't use the term ""marginal tax rate,"" he did say ""top tax rate."" People without CPAs might mistake that for a person's average tax rate (it's not), but it's valid wording. And so we rule this one Mostly True.

Michael Moore claims a majority favor a single-payer health care system
","
On CNN's

Larry King Live

on Sept. 26, 2009, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore was asked if he thought President Barack Obama would get his health care plan through Congress.
 
""Well, I certainly hope so,"" said Moore, whose 2007 film

Sicko

focused on health care. ""Seventy-five percent of the American people are expecting it. That's what the polls show. The majority of this country voted for him in large part because they want universal health care. The majority actually want single-payer health care.""
 
Moore repeated the claim about support for a single-payer plan, with a couple of qualifiers, in a Sept. 29 news conference that coincided with the release of his new film,

Capitalism: A Love Story

.
 
""Not only do three-quarters of the American people want universal health care and support the public option, a majority, depending on which poll you look at, either a simple majority or a plurality of Americans support single-payer, support health care for all.
 
""You don't have to go out on a limb,"" Moore said, referring to politicians. ""You don't have to take a risk. You've already got the people with you.""
 
First, let's explain some of the terms we're talking about here. The Democratic health care plan in the House calls for most people to keep the private insurance they have through their employer. But for people on their own, the government would create a national health care exchange, a kind of one-stop shop for people to compare plans from various insurance companies. Within that exchange, the House plan calls for a government-run plan that provides basic coverage at a price likely to be lower than private insurers. That's the so-called ""public option.""
 
A single-payer health care system is one in which the government pays all health care bills.
 
With the controversial public option floundering in Congress, is it possible a majority of Americans actually support a single-payer system with way more government involvement?
 
Asked to back up his claim, Moore's people directed us first to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in July 2009. The nonpartisan Kaiser is considered by many to be the gold standard of health care polling.
 
In that July poll, people were asked about different ways to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance, and whether or not they favored (strongly or somewhat) or opposed (strongly or somewhat) those options.
 
One of the options posed was: ""Having a national health plan — or single-payer plan — in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan."" In all, 50 percent said they favored it; 44 percent said they opposed it.
 
So that's what the poll found in July.
 
But Kaiser has posed this very question in six polls dating back to December 2008. The July poll is the only one that shows a majority of people saying they ""favored"" a single-payer system.
 
In fact, more recent polls seem to suggest the public is getting less enamored of single-payer health care. In August, the same Kaiser poll showed a slightly higher percentage opposed single payer (49 percent) than favored it (48 percent) — still within the margin of error. And the September poll showed 40 percent favor it, while 56 percent oppose it. We'll cut Moore some slack regarding the September poll. It wasn't publicly released until Sept. 29, a couple of days after Moore first made the comment.
 
But we'd like to note something else about the Kaiser poll. Among the eight options posed to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance, the single-payer option fared the worst.
 
For example, 68 percent in the September poll said they favored a plan to require all Americans to have health insurance, either from their employer or from another source, with financial help for those who can’t afford it.


And 67 percent said they favored offering tax credits to help people buy private health insurance. The same percentage said they favored a plan to require employers to offer health insurance to their workers or pay money into a government fund that will pay to cover those without insurance.
 
In other words, people weren't asked directly to pick the one option they favored the

most

. But in an October 2008 Kaiser poll, they were asked just that. There, the public is all over the map. Fifteen percent said they most prefer that ""all Americans get their insurance from a single government plan."" A similar percentage said they prefer ""requiring employers to either offer health insurance or pay money into a government pool."" And 14 percent each said their top choice was ""offering tax breaks to businesses that do offer health insurance"" or ""requiring all Americans to have health insurance, with tax credits or other aid to help those who can’t afford it."" That's hardly a consensus for single-payer.
 
We also came across a recent Rasmussen telephone poll in early August that contradicts Moore's claim.
 
In the Rasmussen poll, people were asked, ""Do you favor or oppose a single-payer health care system where the federal government provides coverage for everyone?"" The results: 32 percent said they favored it; 57 percent oppose. Support generally fell along party lines, with 62 percent of Democrats in favor; and 87 percent of  Republicans opposed.
 
Moore's people cited two other polls to back up his statement.
 
The first was a December 2007 poll commissioned by AP that asked: ""Do you consider yourself a supporter of a single-payer health care system, that is a national health plan financed by taxpayers in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan, or not?"" The result: 54 percent said yes; 44 percent said no.
 
And a Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll in October 2007 found that 53 percent agreed with creating a ""government-run, government-financed health insurance program that would cover all Americans. This program would be administered like the current Medicare for citizens 65 and over.""
 
Both those polls are nearly two years old, though, and we think it's safe to say Americans are far more tuned in to the health care question now than they were then. We also note that the Bloomberg poll doesn't use the word ""single-payer"" (even though it amounts to the same thing).
 
""Single-payer is not a concept that people are very familiar with,"" said Karlyn Bowman, polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute.
 
Which brings us to this point: Words matter. Drop in the words ""like Medicare"" and some polls have found the public responds better. People generally like Medicare. Call it universal health care run by the government, and you often do better than calling it ""single-payer."" And if you call it a ""socialized"" system, well, you can guess the results.
 
A fair reading of recent polls just doesn't support Moore's claim, Bowman said. ""He's wrong.""
 
We have a few problems with Moore's claim. First, he cherry-picked the results from a July Kaiser poll. There have been five other Kaiser polls since last December, including two since July, that asked that exact same question, and only the July results showed a majority, slightly over 50 percent.
 
But our bigger problem is that in the same Kaiser poll, people were much more supportive of plans that largely kept intact the private insurance model.
 
Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans want some form of universal health care coverage — they want uninsured people to have insurance. But there's wide disagreement about the means to achieve that. Some think we ought to keep the system as is, but offer tax credits so that uninsured people can afford to buy private insurance. Some think companies ought to be required to provide insurance to employees, or else pay into a government fund that will pay to cover those without insurance. In the poll that Moore's people cited to back up his claim, the single-payer plan has consistently polled the worst among seven other posed options.
 
We think it's misleading, at best, for Moore to cite that July study to back up his claim that a majority support a single-payer plan. In fact, one could make a strong argument that those very polls suggest there is more support for private insurance options than for a single-payer system. And so we find Moore's statement False.

Michael Moore said Bush's approval rating dropped, but it rose first
","
Michael Moore talked about his new movie,

Capitalism: A Love Story

, at a Washington news conference a few days before the movie's nationwide release.
 
A reporter asked him why his movies didn't have more of an impact, citing

Roger and Me

as not doing much to change the auto industry and

Sicko

as not changing public opinion about health care.
 
Moore disputed the premise of the question, saying

Roger and Me

postponed layoffs in his hometown of Flint, Mich., and that

Sicko

spurred advocacy for health care reform.
 
He then said that his film

Fahrenheit 9/11

kicked off criticism of President George W. Bush during his second term.
 
""It's funny how that movie gets judged as, 'Well, Bush got re-elected.' That movie comes out four or five months before the election, and somehow a movie was going to change the election. I'll tell you what it did do.
 
""At that point, people were afraid to speak out about the war, and about Bush. He had a high approval rating. Someone had to fire the first salvo. And that's what I did, and I took a lot of abuse for it.""
 
Moore said that many liberals had supported the Iraq war and were afraid to criticize it, but that changed after his movie came out.
 
""From

Fahrenheit

on, Bush's approval rating never was better, it only got worse,"" Moore said. ""Within a couple of years, after more and more millions of Americans saw the truth in that film, he could never recover.""
 
We wanted to check Moore's statement about Bush poll numbers to see if they declined like Moore said they did.
 
To do this, we turned to the Gallup Poll, which has tracked presidential approval ratings since 1940s.
 

Fahrenheit 9/11

came out at the end of June 2004, when Bush's approval rating was at 48 percent. But his approval rating climbed through the rest of the summer and hit 53 percent around Election Day in early November.
 
After the election, Bush's approval peaked at 57 percent during the first week of February 2005. A year after

Fahrenheit

, Bush's approval rating was about the same as when the movie came out, hovering around 47 percent.
 
Bush's approval ratings started to noticeably decline about a year after his election, sliding into the low 40s and high 30s in the fall of 2005 and staying in that range for most of 2006 and 2007.
 
Bush's ratings hit their all-time low in October 2008, during the financial crisis, when he had an approval rating of 25 percent.
 
So Moore was incorrect when he said that ""Bush's approval rating never was better, it only got worse"" after the movie came out. The ratings actually increased and were pretty much the same a year after

Fahrenheit

. On the other hand, Moore qualifies his statement by suggesting that it took years for the film to have an impact, and indeed, Bush's ratings did decline overall for much of his second term. So we rate Moore's statement Barely True.

Michael Moore movie says that top 1 percent owns more financial wealth than bottom 95 percent
","
In his new movie

Capitalism: A Love Story

, liberal provocateur Michael Moore tries to build a case that the rich keep getting richer while everyone else is left behind. One statistic he cites in the film, which he repeated at a Sept. 29, 2009, news conference in Washington, is that ""the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined.""


On his Web site, Moore provides a list of sources to back up his claims. For this one, the filmmaker cites a memo written by Citigroup's research staff — a memo that plays a key role in the film as a symbol of Wall Street excess.


The Citigroup document, which was provided to PolitiFact by Moore's staff, cites a table using statistics assembled by New York University and Bard College economist Edward N. Wolff. Wolff uses Federal Reserve Board findings on family wealth drawn from the Survey of Consumer Finances, a once-every-three-years study. The Citigroup document uses numbers from the 2001 survey.


But before we look at the data, let's parse Moore's words closely. He didn't say the top 1 percent have ""more wealth"" than the bottom 95 percent. Nor did he say that they have more income than the bottom 95 percent. Rather, he specifically said they have more ""financial wealth.""


So what is financial wealth? That's subject to debate.


Wolff uses two key measurements of wealth. One is net worth, which means someone's total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth includes cash holdings, financial assets like stocks and bonds, real estate, the value of life insurance policies and retirement plans, equity from unincorporated businesses, and the value of trust funds. The amount owed from mortgages and consumer debt are subtracted from this amount, while household appliances and the future value of Social Security benefits and private pension plans are kept out of the calculations, because they cannot be easily converted into cash.


Wolff's second measurement is called either ""financial wealth"" (as Citigroup's memo labeled it) or ""non-home wealth"" (as Wolff himself called it in a 2007 paper analyzing the Fed survey data). Put simply, it's net worth minus the net equity of one's home. Wolff justifies separating out house equity for two reasons. One is that it is not easy to convert a home to cash on short notice. The other is that primary homes serve a dual purpose — they provide shelter as well as storing wealth.


In the news conference, Moore correctly reported what the Citigroup memo said about the second category, financial wealth. According to the document, which uses numbers from the 2001 Fed survey, the top 1 percent owned 39.7 percent of the financial wealth, while the bottom 95 percent owned 32.5 percent.


Because the Fed has released two surveys since its 2001 study, we wanted to see whether the same pattern has held.


In his 2007 paper, Wolff used 2004 survey data, which found that the top 1 percent owned 42.2 percent of the non-home wealth, compared to 31 percent for the bottom 95 percent. Once again, Moore's right.


We crunched the raw numbers using the 2007 survey data, which had been published in early 2009. Moore is right again: the top 1 percent held 48.4 percent of non-home wealth, compared to 20 percent for the bottom 95 percent. For the second straight survey, in fact, the concentration of wealth increased.


So Moore's right? Not so fast.


Arthur B. Kennickell, a Fed economist, periodically publishes papers analyzing the survey statistics in great detail. In his most recent paper, published on Jan. 7, 2009, Kennickell provides a breakdown of dozens of key statistics based on income level. Deep inside his data-laden paper is a statistic called ""financial wealth."" That shares a name with the measurement Wolff used (and which was later cited by Citigroup and Moore) but Kennickell calculates it differently.


""Financial wealth,"" as defined in Kennickell's paper, starts with Wolff's measurement but then subtracts several other categories, including vehicles (not just cars but also boats, airplanes and helicopters); other real estate held (including equity in second homes); the equity from closely held businesses; and the value of antiques, artwork and similar items.


These mathematical differences are enough to switch Moore's assertion from correct to incorrect. By Kennickell's measurement of ""financial wealth,"" the top 1 percent own 31.5 percent of the financial wealth — less than the 40.2 percent for the bottom 95 percent. That indicates a large chunk of the wealth for the top 1 percent comes from vehicles, second homes, businesses and hobbies. (We presume it's the top 1 percent that owns the Ferraris and summer homes in the Hamptons.)


Moore deserves credit for correctly reporting the Citigroup statistic, and the data it's based on — both the Fed survey and Wolff's analysis — are respected. But this comparison shows that you can crunch numbers different ways and get different results.


Indeed, Alan Reynolds, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, expresses skepticism of most narrower definitions of ""wealth,"" suggesting that removing factors like home equity — a more widely held asset than stocks and bonds — biases these calculations. In fact, Moore would be wrong if he used the broader category of net worth to make his assertion. According to the 2004 Fed survey, the top 1 percent held 34.3 percent of the nation's net worth, compared to a collective 41 percent for the bottom 95 percent. (In fact, Moore or his staff was careful enough to actually correct a mistake that Citigroup had made on this point; the memo had said, incorrectly, that the top 1 percent possessed greater net worth than the bottom 95 percent.)


Moore's camp emphasizes that however you slice the numbers, the richest Americans continue to hold a disproportionate share of the wealth — and on this point, other experts concur. ""The important point is that there's an enormous disparity"" in wealth in the United States, said Brookings Institution scholar Ron Haskins.
 
The Fed survey may actually understate the true concentration of wealth. The survey specifically excludes members of the Forbes 400 richest families in America. Because ""the closer you get to the top, the bigger the disparity"" between rich and poor, a lot of concentrated wealth gets left out, Haskins said. (The new version of Forbes' list, released on Oct. 1, 2009, found that the collective worth of the 400 richest families fell $300 billion compared to the previous year; if the wealth of slightly less rich households also decreased, that could change the numbers.)


So let's recap. Moore correctly cited the Citigroup memo's contents, and on the larger question, he's correct that the richest 1 percent of Americans own a vastly disproportionate share of the nation's wealth. But we'll take him down a notch because, using another methodology, his statement would not be correct. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'EnergyCitizens.org']","
EnergyCitizens.org claims gas will cost $4 a gallon under a cap-and-trade plan
","In a full-page ad in the Sept. 30, 2009, edition of the  Washington Post  , was this eye-catching claim about gas prices:
 
""$4 GAS - Another unfortunate truth about the House's climate bill,"" said the ad from  EnergyCitizens.org  . ""As Congress considers new climate legislation, Americans aren't getting the whole truth. A recent study found the House-passed bill could lead to $4 per-gallon gasoline. America is in the middle of a harsh recession. Think about the impact of $4 gas.""
 
We've heard a lot about the cap-and-trade plan — that it  will increase   the cost   of energy  and that it will  eliminate jobs  — but it's been a while since we put  claims about the price of gas  to the Truth-O-Meter.
 
The concept of cap-and-trade is relatively easy to understand. A cap is put on greenhouse gas emissions, and firms are required to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting. Iterations of a cap-and-trade plan have been introduced in Congress previously, but the most recent legislation, written by Democrats Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, has been passed by the House of Representatives. Their bill aims to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass on the cost of buying those permits. And that's where the argument from EnergyCitizens.org comes into play. The group, a coalition of business organizations, antitax groups, transportation companies, and Washington heavy hitters such as the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau Federation, says those higher prices will hit consumers in the form of higher gas prices.
 
The ad cites a Heritage Foundation study of the bill published on June 16. The conservative think tank, which has been critical of the Waxman-Markey bill, contends higher energy prices ""will spread throughout the economy as producers everywhere try to cover their higher production costs by raising their product prices. ... Even after adjusting for inflation, gasoline prices will rise 58 percent over the 2035 baseline price.""
 
We checked with the Heritage Foundation to find out if EnergyCitizens.org was correctly interpreting Heritage's study, and were told that the group was. Heritage also pointed us to another study the think tank did that looked at gas prices per state. Heritage assumes that under Waxman-Markey, gas will be at a minimum $3 a gallon in 2035, depending on where you live. A 58 percent price increase as a result of cap-and-trade would put the cost of a gallon of gasoline at more that $4.
 
So, based on Heritage's data and assumptions, EnergyCitizens.org is in the ballpark. However, the group leaves out an important detail in its ad: These predictions are for 2035, 26 years from now when, presumably, our economic landscape will be very different. EnergyCitizens.org plays on people's anxiety about the recession by portraying these prices as something that would take effect immediately.
 
To get more perspective, we looked at other estimates. For comparison, keep in mind that the current national average is $2.60 for unleaded regular.
 
The Energy Information Administration, a branch of the Energy Department, published an analysis of the bill on Aug. 4, 2009, which predicts gas price increases will be relatively small compared to increases in the electricity sector, in part because emissions reductions from the fossil-fuel sector will only account for 12 to 20 percent of overall reductions. If the bill is enacted, gas prices will only be about 20 cents more per gallon in 2020 and 35 cents more in 2030, the report predicts.
 
Another analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency predicts impacts on future gas prices would be minimal under the Waxman-Markey bill. Specifically, prices would go up $0.13 in 2015, $0.25 in 2030, and $0.69 in 2050, according to the June 23 report.
 
Clearly, there's a difference of opinion on how much the price of gas will change as the result of cap-and-trade. For the most part, those differences have to do with what kind of assumptions are made about nonfossil fuels, such as nuclear and wind power. The EPA, for example, assumes that cleaner technologies and renewable energy will replace fossil fuel more quickly, which would translate to lower costs to consumers. Heritage takes an austere approach, assuming that traditional energy sources would be scaled back to meet new emissions standards, but would not be immediately replaced by new technology or renewable fuels. As a result, fossil fuel prices will go up and continue to rise.
 
Another point to put this all in perspective: Gas prices fluctuate dramatically. In January 2009, a gallon of gas cost about a $1.80 a gallon. This week, gas costs $2.60 — about a $1.20 less than it was a year ago. So predicting how much gas will cost next week — let alone in 2035 — is an imperfect science.

Based on the estimates, it's probably a safe bet that the price of gasoline will ultimately increase as a result of cap-and-trade. And the estimates vary based on reasonable disagreements about methodology. But Energycitizens.org is guilty of a significant exaggeration because the ad strongly implies the price hike would happen very soon. It fails to mention that $4-a-gallon gasoline wouldn't be the norm until 2035 — if it ever is. The group also leaves out other important studies that predict smaller increases. For a serious case of cherry-picking, we rate the ad Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2009/sep/30/energycitizensorg/energycitizensorg-claims-gas-will-cost-4-gallon-un/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'House Republican Conference']","
Humana is a Medicare contractor, AARP is not
","A controversial mailing from Humana to Medicare recipients has Republicans charging unfair treatment in the way the government handled private insurance companies versus the AARP. The House Republican Conference said the government is silencing Humana about reforms that would change Medicare Advantage, while the AARP — a notable reform supporter — gets off scott-free. ""This week the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it was investigating Humana for providing 'misleading' information regarding the administration's proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage policies — and prohibited other Medicare Advantage plans from providing similar information on how Democrat health 'reform' could take away their current coverage,"" the release said. ""Yet the administration's edict prohibiting plans from communicating with their beneficiaries failed to include AARP, which sponsors a Medicare Advantage plan but has been a prime advocate of Democrats' government takeover of health care — quite possibly because AARP has been supporting a health care overhaul from which it stands to gain overall handsomely,"" the statement said. We wanted to investigate whether there were two different standards at work. We found that AARP and Humana actually have very different roles with Medicare plans. AARP makes money by licensing its name to a private insurer that offers a Medicare Advantage plan. Humana is a different private insurer that takes money from the government to provide an Advantage plan. Humana contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a program called Medicare Advantage. Often called Medicare's HMOs, Advantage is an optional program in which the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. The program was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened, and Medicare Advantage actually costs the government more. President Barack Obama and groups like AARP have said it's time to bring the costs of Medicare Advantage in line with the cost of regular Medicare. Humana is the second-largest insurance company that handles Medicare Advantage, right after UnitedHealth Group. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that runs Medicare and is often referred to as CMS, recently announced it was looking into mailings that Humana sent to its Medicare Advantage and Part D patients. (Part D is Medicare coverage for prescription drugs.) ""We are concerned that the materials Humana sent to our beneficiaries may violate Medicare rules by appearing to contain Medicare Advantage and prescription drug benefit information, which must be submitted to CMS for review,"" said Jonathan Blum, acting director of CMS's Center for Drug and Health Plan Choices. ""We also are asking that no other plan sponsors are mailing similar materials while we investigate whether a potential violation has occurred."" According to the CMS, Humana's mailing warned beneficiaries that they might lose benefits under health care reform, a claim that Democratic officials dispute. The  Huffington Post  said it has obtained  a copy of the mailer  and posted it to its Web site. The impact of health care reform on Medicare recipients has been a matter of considerable debate. We examined a claim by President Barack Obama that  Medicare benefits would not be cut  and found it to be Half True. Experts told us basic benefits would stay in place but that it's conceivable or even likely that Medicare Advantage patients could see reduced benefits. In a letter to Humana, a CMS official said that Humana's communication could be considered ""misleading and confusing to beneficiaries"" and might be construed as official Medicare communications. The House Republican Conference said CMS did not target the seniors' group ""quite possibly because AARP has been supporting a health care overhaul ..."" Our research shows, however, that AARP has a very different relationship with its members than Humana does with seniors on Medicare Advantage. Here's how it works: AARP lends its name to insurance companies to sell policies specifically for AARP members. The insurance companies then pay AARP a fee for the policies they sell with the AARP name. AARP calls these payments royalties. (Read our story for more details on  AARP's royalties  .) AARP does profit indirectly from selling Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental policies, and it uses that money to fund its efforts as a nonprofit advocacy group. AARP partners with UnitedHealth on its Medicare plans. UnitedHealth is the No. 1 seller of Medicare Advantage, with 16 percent of the market, followed closely by Humana with 14 percent of the market, according to Mark Farrah Associates. So when AARP mails seniors, it's using its own private membership list for communication. Humana, on the other hand, is mailing people using personal information it receives as a government contractor. UnitedHealth would be bound by similar rules. We find that the House Republican Conference is off base when it claims that the CMS and the Obama administration have two different standards for AARP and Humana. Humana is a government contractor for Medicare Advantage; the AARP is not. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2009/sep/30/house-republicans/medicare-aarp-humana-politics/

Beck and others repeat claim that White House Political Director Patrick Gaspard was once the political director for Bertha Lewis, chief organizer of ACORN
","
A throwaway line in a blog posting in May — which turns out to be wrong — provided just enough fodder to allow political pundits to brand a top White House official with the political scarlet letter A, for ACORN.
 
Under the spotlight is Patrick Gaspard, director of the White House Office of Political Affairs. It's a high-level position. In fact, that's the title Karl Rove held in President George W. Bush's White House (though senior adviser David Axelrod is probably closer to Rove's role for President Barack Obama). Gaspard had kept a very low media profile until this week, when some political pundits began calling him ACORN's man in the White House.
 
The hosts of

Fox and Friends

ran with the claim about Gaspard's alleged ties to ACORN in a Sept. 29, 2009, interview with Fox News commentator Glenn Beck.
 
""The White House political director is a fellow by the name of Patrick Gaspard,"" said host Steve Doocy. ""And he apparently has been in bed with ACORN and, in fact, Bertha Lewis, who heads up ACORN. He, Mr. Gaspard, was her right-hand man.
 
""So does ACORN have somebody in the White House in one way or another?"" Doocy asked.
 
""The answer to that is yes,"" said Beck. ""You know what's really weird is he was also one of the top guys at SEIU (Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, United Healthcare Workers East, the largest local union in America). SEIU and ACORN, the same organization . . . The president has zero credibility when he says, 'I haven't been following this ACORN thing.' This is his army, SEIU and ACORN.""
 
Fox News host Sean Hannity also ran with the story.
 
""And now questions are being raised about a top White House adviser's connections to the group,"" Hannity said on his Sept. 28 show. ""Now the director of the White House Office of Political Affairs, Patrick Gaspard, is said to be closely affiliated with ACORN and, according to the

American Spectator,

he previously worked as the political director for none other than Bertha Lewis, who is now the chief organizer of ACORN.
 
""Sounds like ACORN has somebody on the inside of the White House. Now there's a real comforting thought.""
 
The accusations about Gaspard's employment at ACORN have their roots in an article written by Matthew Vadum for the

American Spectator

on Sept. 28 under the headline,

""ACORN's Man in the White House.""

Vadum is a senior editor at Capital Research Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank that studies the politics of philanthropy.
 
""Newly discovered evidence shows the radical advocacy group ACORN has a man in the Obama White House,"" Vadum's article begins.


""This power behind the throne is longtime ACORN operative Patrick Gaspard.""


""Evidence shows that years before he joined the Obama administration, Gaspard was ACORN boss Bertha Lewis's political director in New York.""
 
So what is the evidence?
 
Vadum cites a May 16, 2009, posting from ACORN founder Wade Rathke's ""Chief Organizer"" blog. Rathke resigned last year as ""chief organizer"" for ACORN amid speculation about his role in helping to conceal from the full board almost $1 million embezzeled from ACORN by his brother. Bertha Lewis, then head of New York ACORN, took Rathke's place.
 
In May, Rathke wrote this on his blog: ""Tell me that 1199's former political director, Patrick Gaspard (who was ACORN New York's political director before that) didn't reach out from the White House and help make that happen, and I'll tell you to take some remedial classes in 'politics 101.'""
 
The part in parenthases comes from Rathke.
 
But current ACORN officials say Rathke was wrong.
 
""He (Gaspard) never worked for us,"" said Brian Kettenring, a spokesman for ACORN.
 
It's a case of mistaken identity, Kettenring said. Rathke worked for ACORN national and not ACORN in New York. He clearly confused Gaspard with someone else, Kettenring said.
 
Scott Levenson with the Advance Group, which does PR work for ACORN, echoed that in an e-mail saying, ""There is NO accuracy to the fact that Patrick Gaspard ever worked for ACORN.""
 
And so we e-mailed Rathke.
 
""I misspoke,"" Rathke responded.
 
Rathke also addressed the issue in a postscript to a blog posting on Sept. 29.
 
""Patrick was never on the staff of ACORN,"" Rathke wrote. ""I double checked with people I still know there, and it appears that I dropped a stitch there.  Hopefully my misstatement won’t lead to the White House throwing him in front of the bus in this rush to neo-McCarthyism that has become so prominent. In this case, my memory tricked me.  I’m glad to carry the weight and simply say I made a mistake, and damned if I’m not sorry and hope no damage is done to a good man doing a hard job.""
 
Interestingly, Gaspard's brother, Michael Gaspard, works for the Advance Group. And again, the Advance Group in New York does communications work for ACORN. But Kettenring said he was not aware that Michael Gaspard has, himself, actually done any work for ACORN.
 
But back to Patrick Gaspard. The White House provided a resume for him going back 20 years. It showed he worked for SEIU and the Howard Dean campaign, among other places, but had not worked for ACORN.
 
We're not saying Gaspard has had no interaction with ACORN, or that he doesn't have ties to ACORN's Bertha Lewis. They both were involved in New York politics and SEIU and ACORN officials run in similar circles.
 
In fact, in an April 28, 2009, story in

Roll Call

, Lewis is quoted as saying that while ""we don't have our own special ACORN entrance at the White House or our own special hot line,"" she did say she has particularly good relationships with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Gaspard. The conservative

Red State

recently ran a story that Gaspard's contact info appears in Lewis' Rolodex, for whatever that's worth.
 
But the claim here wasn't just that the two are friends. It's that Gaspard was employed by ACORN as Bertha Lewis' political director in New York. ACORN officials say he was not. And the source of that information, ACORN founder Wayne Rathke, said he misspoke when he made that claim in a blog posting.
 
For their part, Doocy, Beck, Hannity and others are relying on the reporting of Vadum in the

American Spectator

. And Vadum relied on Rathke's blog posting. So the mistake is understandable. But in their zeal to paint an ""A"" on Gaspard's sweater, the pundits never made an effort to find out if it was right. And it wasn't. We rule the statement False.

AARP profits from insurance sales; GOP calls it a health reform conflict
","
AARP, the nonprofit advocacy group for seniors, has often said it does not endorse a particular plan for health care reform. But the group has been a high-profile supporter of overall reform and hosted a town hall event with President Barack Obama in July.
 
That advocacy has bothered some Republicans.
 
Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite of Florida sent AARP a blistering letter after the group wrote her, questioning her statements about the health care reform bill under consideration in the U.S. House of Representatives.
 
""Every day I hear from constituents who are concerned that AARP no longer represents their values,"" Browne-Waite wrote. ""They are surprised to learn that AARP is the largest reseller of insurance in the country and as such has a vested interest in seeing that the market for reselling supplemental insurance expands.""
 
""AARP unfortunately has become a mouthpiece for this president at the expense of what is best for America's seniors,"" she added.
 
The two letters are long and contain many details about the House health care bill. You can read

AARP's letter here

and

Brown-Waite's response here

. (AARP's letter cited PolitiFact.com as a source on employer mandates. See

our full item here

.)
 
We wanted to check Brown-Waite's statement that ""AARP is the largest reseller of insurance in the country and as such has a vested interest in seeing that the market for reselling supplemental insurance expands."" Other critics have made similar charges, alleging more directly that AARP is supporting health care reform to bring in more money.
 
We'll start with an explanation of AARP's involvement in the insurance business. AARP lends its name to insurance companies to sell policies to AARP members. The insurance companies then pay AARP a fee for the policies they sell with the AARP name. AARP calls these payments royalties.
 
Medicare, the government-run health plan for seniors, requires people to pay a percentage of their health care costs, and there is no limit on this cost-sharing. For seniors with many health issues or catastrophic illness, this can be very costly. So seniors can buy ""Medigap"" policies from private insurers that help cover those costs, and this is the supplemental insurance that Brown-Waite mentioned.
 
So AARP is not a reseller of insurance as Brown-Waite claims. It licenses its name to companies that sell the policies.
 
Still, we wanted to know if we could quantify whether it's the biggest royalty collecter from insurance companies. Unfortunately, we were not able to quantify this. We checked with several insurance authorities, including the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). None of them kept data on branded plans as such, and none of the experts or private tracking organizations we asked had data on that point, either.
 
When we asked Brown-Waite's office about why she said AARP was the biggest reseller of insurance, the staff said she drew that conclusion because AARP calls itself the largest membership organization for people age 50 and over in the United States. But in our view, that doesn't necessarily mean Brown-Waite is correct.
 
On our own, we found that AARP's partner in selling Medigap insurance is the private insurer UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co., a division of UnitedHealth Group. UnitedHealth is the No. 1 seller of Medigap coverage, with nearly 30 percent of the market, according to Mark Farrah Associates, a health insurance analytics company that analyzes data filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
 
So how would health reform goose Medigap sales? Brown-Waite's argument centers around Medicare Advantage, a program in which the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. Some Medicare Advantage plans offer extra benefits, so their patients don't need Medigap insurance. AARP has been critical of Medicare Advantage, because the program was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened, and Medicare Advantage actually costs the government more. AARP has argued that people on Medicare are effectively subsidizing Medicare Advantage, and that should stop.
 
We should point out here that AARP gets royalties from Medigap plans

and

from Medicare Advantage plans. It partners with UnitedHealth on both plans. UnitedHealth is also the No. 1 seller of Medicare Advantage, with 16 percent of the market, followed closely by Humana with 14 percent of the market, according to Mark Farrah Associates.
 
We also found, through the public records that AARP is required to file as a nonprofit, that AARP derives significant income from its royalties. In 2008, it earned $652.7 million from royalities. Not all of this is from Medigap and Medicare Advantage, because AARP also offers life insurance, car insurance, dental insurance, credit cards and other services. All those royalties account for 57 percent of its total revenues. (The total is an eye-popping $1.14 billion.)
 
Brown-Waite asked AARP to disclose how much money it makes off the Medigap policies and other health insurance products; her office told us it has not received a reply. AARP said in its annual report that 65 percent of its royalties are from health-related products, but it did not provide a detailed breakdown.
 
AARP objects vigorously to Republican claims that AARP is motivated by money in the positions it takes on health care reform. Many of its younger members, aged 50 to 64, don't qualify for Medicare and have a difficult time finding insurance if they lose coverage, the group said. The royalty money goes to fund its advocacy work, and the attacks on it for its royalties are politically motivated, it said.
 
AARP executive vice president Nancy LeaMond said in a statement, ""Similar to 'death panels' and other scare tactics, this latest effort is a misguided attempt to talk about anything other than the health care reform this country needs. ... The only benefit AARP is looking for in health reform is relief for the millions of Americans who are crushed by soaring prescription drug prices, relief for the millions of Americans who are told they can't get coverage because they’re too old or too sick, and relief for the millions of Americans who need Medicare strengthened. Period.""
 
It's difficult to assess how AARP would fare under the many versions of health care reform being considered in Congress. If the Medicare Advantage plan was reduced, it's not clear to us if AARP would benefit or not. Keep in mind, it gets royalties off Medicare supplemental insurance and Medicare Advantage, so its mix of policy types might change but it's hard to say if that would affect its overall royalties.
 
Another argument in AARP's favor is that AARP has marketed health insurance to its members since its inception, even predating Medicare's creation in 1965. (We found several confirmations of this in the history books we reviewed on the history of Medicare.) Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus founded AARP in 1958, and the AARP site says that even back then, part of her intent was to help seniors buy insurance.
 
Andrus started the organization to help retired school teachers find health insurance, according to AARP's history. ""Dr. Andrus approached dozens of insurance companies until she found one willing to take the risk of insuring older persons,"" the site said. ""She then developed other benefits and programs, including a discount mail order pharmacy service. Over the years (the National Retired Teachers Association) heard from thousands of others who wanted to know how they could obtain insurance and other NRTA benefits without being retired teachers. After 10 years, Dr. Andrus realized the time had come to create a new organization open to all Americans.""
 
Still, AARP's royalties have grown in recent years. Last year, the news organization Bloomberg reported a lengthy story about AARP's insurance royalties, including anecdotal complaints that some seniors were able to find cheaper policies. AARP disputed some of the article's details, as well as the notion that it was motivated by royalty payments.
 
But Marilyn Moon, a noted Medicare expert and the former director of the AARP’s Public Policy Institute, said the organization is becoming too reliant on royalty payments.
 
""There's an inherent conflict of interest,"" Moon told Bloomberg. ""A lot of people there are trying to do good, but they're ending up becoming very dependent on sources of income.""
 
We talked to Moon last week and she said she still considered the organization's growing royalty payments to be problematic, and a downside of its organizational growth. ""It's very hard for the tail not to wag the dog,"" she said.
 
Getting back to the statement we're rating, Brown-Waite said, ""AARP is the largest reseller of insurance in the country and as such has a vested interest in seeing that the market for reselling supplemental insurance expands."" It is not a reseller, a word that suggests a greater financial involvement than AARP has. But AARP does attach its name to policies that private insurers sell and receive royalty payments. Is it the largest licensee? It might be — it certainly makes millions — but there is little data to confirm or refute that it is the largest. Does it have an interest? Yes, although we can't conclusively say health reform will lead to more money for AARP. So we rate her statement Half True.

Conservative group says you'll be imprisoned for not having health insurance
","
As the Senate Finance Committee took up its version of health care legislation, conservatives ramped up their opposition to a variety of provisions in the bill. One of them touches two hot buttons for conservatives: taxes and the long arm of the federal government.


On Sept. 29, 2009, a subsidiary of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity sent out an e-mail headlined, ""Health Care Mandate Will Require Imprisonment and Fines for Americans Who Can’t Afford to Purchase Insurance or Pay Hefty Government Penalties.""


The group was referring to an exchange in the Senate Finance Committee between Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., and Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff Thomas Barthold on Sept. 24, 2009. Both the House and Senate bills would impose taxes designed to prod Americans who are currently uninsured into buying insurance. Exemptions would be provided for families of limited means. The idea is that by expanding the pool of Americans paying for coverage, insurers can use the additional revenue to improve benefits, eliminate barriers for pre-existing conditions and reduce costs for others enrolled in the plans.


Initially, the Senate version would have had families above 300 percent of the federal poverty level pay $3,800 a year if they did not have health insurance. Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., later agreed to lower that amount by half, to $1,900. Backers hope that no American actually pays the tax; they want to see people spending those dollars on health insurance instead.


Still, Ensign is among those who balk at the idea. ""Some people hold the Constitution pretty high in their lives, and if they believe that this thing is unconstitutional and they then say ... 'I choose not to have health insurance. I'm not going to buy it,'"" Ensign said at a markup of the contentious bill. ""We could be subjecting those very people ... to fines or the interpretation of a judge potentially all the way up even to imprisonment.""


The bill summary that the Senate committee considered did not mention specifics about enforcement and sentencing for violations.


So, at the markup, Ensign questioned Barthold — the top professional staffer on the joint House-Senate panel that advises both chambers on tax legislation — about what penalties would be assessed.


Barthold told him that they would be ""penalties under the Internal Revenue Code."" Ensign asked for ""the maximum penalty"" for a ""willful"" — that is, intentional — violation. Is it ""possible that somebody could go to jail over this?"" Ensign asked.


Barthold answered, ""Could be criminal, yes, if it were considered an attempt to defraud.""


Later, several news outlets reported that Barthold delivered a hand-written note to Ensign after the hearing confirming that violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in prison or a $25,000 penalty. When PolitiFact contacted the Joint Committee on Taxation to confirm the contents of the letter, a spokeswoman said that such communications were confidential, but she pointed us to Section 7203 of the Internal Revenue Code, titled, ""Willful failure to file return, supply information or pay tax.""


The text of that section appears to jibe with the reported contents of Barthold's note. It says, ""Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution."" (A House Ways and Means Committee spokesman said that the same rules would apply to the House bill.)


After the hearing, Patients First, a project of the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, issued a news release that played up the possibility that people who didn't buy health coverage could end up in prison.


The release was headlined, ""Health Care Mandate Will Require Imprisonment and Fines for Americans Who Can’t Afford to Purchase Insurance or Pay Hefty Government Penalties,"" and its first sentence referred to ""a draconian health care measure under consideration in Congress that would imprison uninsured Americans who fail to pay a penalty for not buying health insurance.""


We were struck by the statement that the bill would ""require imprisonment and fines"" for nonpayment of the tax. Nothing in the Internal Revenue Code suggests that violators would have to go to jail. It's simply one of the possible penalties that could be assessed.


When we contacted Eric Novack, the senior fellow in health policy for Patients First and Americans for Health Prosperity who was quoted in the release, he conceded the point.


""I would make the case that the headline is hyperbole, but it got people's attention,"" Novack said. ""It is a bit of artistic license. I guess I would agree that it's a bit strongly worded.""


He added that he believes the news release's larger point stands. Such enforcement of the tax would be ""turning people who can't afford health insurance into criminals.""


The headline would have been correct if it had said the mandate ""

could

require imprisonment

or

fines."" In fact, further down, the text of the release reports more accurately that ""under the health care bill outline[d] in the Senate Finance Committee, uninsured Americans who fail to pay a stiff penalty for not purchasing insurance would face up to one year in prison or a $25,000 fine."" That part of the release, with its ""or,"" acknowledges that violators would likely face just one of those penalties.
 
And it's worth noting that, as with other violations in which people have refused to pay taxes, sending someone to prison is an extreme measure used as a last resort.


First off, as Barthold testified to the committee, the Internal Revenue Service would likely undertake normal collection procedures such as wage garnishments before resorting to a criminal case. Tax lawyers we spoke to said it's possible for an unsuccessful debt collection to be referred to federal criminal prosecutors, though criminal prosecutions more commonly arise from audits.


If a nonpayment case with ""willful"" aspects did make it to the criminal docket, then it still has a long way to go until prison time kicks in.


Of the 3,749 criminal investigations initiated by the IRS in fiscal year 2008, the agency recommended 2,785 prosecutions. Of those, 2,547 led to an indictment or criminal information and 2,144 produced convictions. And of those, 1,957 defendants were sentenced to prison, a halfway house or home detention.


To put this in perspective, the IRS audited almost 1.4 million tax returns in 2007. That year, the number of confinement sentences was 2,123, meaning that less than two-tenths of 1 percent of audits resulted in prison time.


And based on past prosecution trends, it's highly unlikely that someone would be sentenced to prison for a debt as small as $1,900, tax lawyers said.


Larry A. Campagna — a Houston-based tax lawyer with the firm Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White, Williams & Martin and vice chair of the American Bar Association Tax Section's Committee on Civil and Criminal Tax Penalties — said that judges in tax cases use sentencing guidelines based on the size of the financial loss to the government. The chart is complicated — and factors like a guilty plea or help in prosecuting others could reduce the sentence — but he suggested that only a tax conviction involving a sum of higher than $12,500 would give a taxpayer a reasonable probability of going to prison. And prison still wouldn't be likely until someone owed $30,000. Both of these sums are vastly more than the $1,900 unpaid amount envisioned in the Senate Finance bill.


Much more common in nonpayment cases are fines. On this point, the critics of the Baucus plan have a point: the $25,000 fine in the plan is unusually high compared to fines for other tax matters involving such a small amount of money.


Most fines are calculated as a percentage of the sum owed, at a rate as high as 75 percent if fraud is involved. For a $1,900 nonpayment, the fine would be $1,425 — if prosecutors even bothered to chase a haul that small with criminal charges, something they generally don't.
 
One more hurdle before anyone goes to prison: a likely court battle. ""I would have a hard time imagining someone going to jail on the health care issue without the case first going to the Supreme Court to test the constitutional merit of the government forcing everyone to get health insurance,"" said Steven Street, general manager of the Alexandria, Va., accounting firm Ross & Moncure.
 
So let's recap. It is a significant exaggeration to say that the Baucus bill's ""health care mandate will require imprisonment and fines for Americans who can’t afford to purchase insurance or pay hefty government penalties."" It won't ""require imprisonment and fines"" — those are simply two of the options for enforcement, and experts say that neither a prison term nor a fine anywhere near that high is likely to be used.


The official responsible for the Patients First release acknowledges that his headline overstated what the Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff said, but the release does accurately report the penalties in the body of the text. The notion that one could go to prison for not buying insurance is certainly attention-grabbing, but based on past patterns of prosecution, the likelihood of it happening is extremely small. So while the fear seems to us to be overheated, the possibility exists. We rate the statement Barely True.

Did the Wall Street Journal run two different headlines on the same day to influence voters?
","As claims of media bias plague news organizations around the world, one widely shared social media post is helping to fuel that fire. The post features a photo of two copies of the Wall Street Journal, placed side-by-side. The papers appear to be from the same day with the same centerpiece story — but with starkly different headlines. Both newspapers feature a front-page photo of then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shaking hands with then-Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto. But, below the centerpiece photo, one paper’s headline reads, ""Trump softens his tone,"" while the other says, ""Trump talks tough on wall."" In the Facebook post, text along the bottom says, ""Same paper, same dates, different markets. What did you just learn? Feeling manipulated yet?"" The post, shared on March 18, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo itself is authentic and displays two real copies of the Wall Street Journal from the same day — but the opposing headline editions represent editions from different times in the day. The stories underneath the differing headlines are different. Colleen Schwartz, vice president of communications at the Wall Street Journal, told PolitiFact the papers are from different times in the day according to a printing schedule designed to make sure papers are delivered on time to various readership areas. These two editions went to different geographical locations, another Wall Street Journal spokesperson confirmed. ""There are different editions of the Journal published at different times during the evening in order to meet delivery demands,"" Schwartz wrote in an email. ""This often means that the content is updated to reflect new reporting on news and events as they evolve. The different editions are distinguishable by the number of stars in the upper right corner (under the L in Journal)."" Newspapers will sometimes go through multiple revisions throughout the day and usually mark each to distinguish the edition. As Schwartz stated, the Wall Street Journal labels its editions by the number of stars in the top right corner. The newspaper on the left of the photo has two stars and came out earlier in the day, while the paper on the right displays four stars and was published later in the day: Different print editions of newspapers are often distributed to different geographical areas based on the time it takes to get newly printed papers from printing facilities to their destinations on time. The two editions under scrutiny here feature two different versions of the story based on the fact that the news story itself was developing throughout the day. Steve Severinghaus, senior director of communications for the Wall Street Journal, said it’s hard to pinpoint by looking at the pictures exactly where each of these two editions went. That’s because the Wall Street Journal utilizes 26 printing plants across the nation to print and then distribute the various editions in a timely fashion. If the printing plant in one area is located in an urban center, for example, then readers inside the city are more likely to get a later, more up-to-date edition than those in a rural area that demands more delivery truck travel time (and therefore an earlier print edition). Wall Street Journal describes its different circulation areas on its website. But why such different headlines? Well, a lot can change over the course of a day. The stories in question were published in the print version of the Journal on Sept. 1, 2016, and covered Donald Trump’s Aug. 31 visit with former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto, as well as a campaign rally stop he made in Phoenix later that day. The final web version of the story is found online here with a Sept. 1, 2016, 1:55 a.m. time stamp, and features the headline, ""Donald Trump Vows Deportations After Easing Tone in Meeting With Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto."" An earlier web version of the same story, which we found at the same url using the web archive tool Wayback Machine, is dated Aug. 31, 8:31 p.m. and has a headline that reads ""Donald Trump Eases Tone on Immigration, Trade After Meeting With Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto."" The meeting between Trump and Nieto, according to reports, was subdued and struck a cooperative tone, with Trump saying at the joint news conference in Mexico that he and Peña Nieto didn’t discuss who would pay for his proposed border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That’s why the earlier version of the print story and the web story stress Trump’s ""ease"" of tone. But hours later at the rally — after Nieto reportedly tweeted that he told Trump Mexico would not pay for the wall — Trump indeed changed his tone, reiterating his tough stance on immigration and insisting that Mexico will pay for the wall. That’s why the later version of the story (and the headline) is different; it contains news of more developments and Trump’s fluctuating rhetoric on the topic over the course of the day. The edition on the left of the photo, Schwartz confirmed, was produced after the meeting in Mexico and the edition on the right was published after Trump delivered his speech in Phoenix, though both papers used the same photo from the meeting between the leaders. ""The edition on the left was published after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto early in the day (and referenced the seemingly cooperative tone of their discussion). The edition on the right was published after Trump delivered a speech on immigration later in the day (and referenced Trump's reasserting his stance that he would force Mexico to pay for the building of a wall along the US Mexico border),"" Schwartz wrote in an email to PolitiFact ""The images represent two different editions, published at different times, with different stories according to the developing news. The headlines represent the news at the time of publication—before and after his speech."" A photo shared on the internet shows two copies of the Wall Street Journal from the same day, but with two different headlines, and suggests the organization distributed it to different markets to influence readers. While the photo is real and depicts two legitimate editions of the Journal, it is actually displaying two different editions of the paper that were produced at different times of the day and with different stories—one written before Trump made a speech at a rally and one after. We were not able to pinpoint what geographical areas these two papers were circulated in. But we do know that they were distributed in separate areas, as different editions are produced in response to geography-based delivery schedules. It is not accurate to say that the Wall Street Journal printed the same story with two different headlines in an attempt to influence readers in different markets. The paper altered its headlines and story in response to developing news and according to different print deadlines.

Viral photo does not show Harriet Tubman with gun she used to kill Democrats
","Harriet Tubman is one of the most famous abolitionists in U.S. history. Born into slavery, she eventually escaped, guided scores of slaves to freedom with the Underground Railroad, and acted as a union spy during the Civil War.

Text beneath it says: ""The Awkward Moment when leftist feminists find out Harriet Tubman — who they voted to kick Andrew Jackson— the founder of the Democratic Party — off the $20 bill — was a gun-toting, democrat-shooting 2nd Amendment-supporting Republican!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

While her anti-slavery efforts and support of the union were certainly in line with the Republican party’s ideals, Tubman wasn’t permitted the right to vote, and thus couldn’t have officially joined any political party. Larson told PolitiFact that Tubman said she followed Susan B. Anthony's politics, who was a Democrat. ""Anthony was a Democrat because she felt betrayed by the Republican Party,"" Larson wrote, ""which refused to give women the right to vote when they passed the 15th Amendment giving black men the suffrage."" The only time Tubman is said to have been in possession of a long gun, like the one pictured in the post, was during her time as a spy in the Civil War.  ""She carried a sharp-shooter's rifle during the Civil War to fight Confederates — not Democrats — who were fighting to keep her enslaved,"" Larson said. Tubman more often carried a pistol to protect herselves from slave-catchers, Larson said. Other historians and biographers said her pistol was mainly used to urge on people who grew tired or afraid on their journey and might be having second thoughts. A recycled social media post offers a supposed photograph of Harriet Tubman and says she was a ""gun-toting, 2nd Amendment-supporting Republican"" who ""shot Democrats."" The woman in the photograph posing with a rifle is not Tubman, but Mary Fields. While Tubman did carry a pistol for protection, there is no evidence she sought to harm members of the political party.

Did marijuana use in Colorado spike after legalization?
","  Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democratic candidate for president, got some laughs during a CNN town hall when he discussed the experience of overseeing the legalization of recreational marijuana in his state. Marijuana officially became legal in Colorado in December 2012, but legal adult sales did not begin until Jan. 1, 2014. At that point, it took the better part of a year for localities around the state to fully come online and get businesses licensed. Hickenlooper, who initially opposed legal weed, grew to accept it. During the town hall, a participant asked him for his reflections on this evolution. Here’s what Hickenlooper said: ""As my mother would say, you couldn't control what things would come in your path, what bad things life might throw at you. And in the end, we were very concerned about this. And I was opposed to it originally. No other government had ever legalized marijuana. Even Amsterdam just decriminalized it. We were worried about teenage consumption going up, when kids' brains are rapidly growing, what it could do. We were worried about the risks of, you know, more people driving while high. And partly, it's no fun to be in conflict with the federal government.  ""But I believe that states are the laboratories of democracy, as Justice Brandeis said so famously, and that we would give it our best shot. And I have to say, at this point, most of our fears haven't come true. We haven't seen a spike in consumption. A significant increase among senior citizens, but I leave that to your own imagination."" The mention of seniors getting baked sparked laughter in the audience, but we wondered whether Hickenlooper was correct that after legalizing marijuana in Colorado, ""we haven't seen a spike in consumption."" We found there hasn’t been a spike, per se. However, marijuana use by adults has gone up consistently for a decade, before and after legalization.  Experts told us that the most comprehensive source for data on marijuana use is the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual survey put together by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. We found two relevant measurements, each broken down by state, each of which showed similar patterns for Colorado. Here’s the data for reported marijuana use in the past month, broken down by a variety of age groups in Colorado: And here’s the data for reported marijuana use in the past year, again broken down by age groups: Each of the blue lines shows the trend for an adult group — 18 and older, 26 and older, or 18 to 25. All of these blue lines show the same general pattern: The usage rates rose, slowly and steadily, between 2008-2009 and 2016-2017. Hickenlooper has a point that usage rates didn’t ""spike."" However, it’s easy to hear his comment and assume that reported use of marijuana flatlined or even declined. And that’s not the case. For the 30-day rates — the more common metric that policymakers use, experts say — the increase in adult marijuana use ranged between a one-third jump and a doubling over eight years, depending on the age range. Other data backs this up. A state government report from 2018 summarized data from the Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a statewide telephone survey conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. This study’s data on marijuana use goes back to 2014. The past-month figures for adults rose from 13.6 percent in 2014 to 15.5 percent in 2017, a jump the report called ""a significant increase."" The responses for daily or near-daily use grew from 6 percent in 2014 to 7.6 percent in 2017, which it also deemed ""a significant increase."" The patterns in Colorado did not surprise Jonathan P. Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie-Mellon University and the former co-director of RAND’s Drug Policy Research Center. An upward trend is to be expected. Between 1992 to 2017, Caulkins said, the nationwide number of past-year users more than doubled, and past-month use tripled. The number of days of use went up several fold, and the number of daily or near-daily users increased tenfold, from 0.9 million to 9 million, he said. Oh, and about those toking seniors? Their numbers have gone up, as Hickenlooper said, according to Colorado data — from 3 percent in 2014 to 5.6 percent. Younger age groups showed increases between 2014 and 2017 as well. But use by seniors wouldn’t have been large enough to drive the trends. One likely reason for the rise among seniors: Every year sees more and more Baby Boomers turning 65, and they are used to using marijuana from their younger years. The one age group that bucked the pattern — and an important one from a policy perspective — is teenagers. They’re marked with the red line in the charts above. Strikingly, the use of marijuana by teens has, at most, stayed much the same, and perhaps even dropped a little. Experts cautioned that for teen use, the sample sizes of the SAMHSA study we used above are not very large. Other studies with larger sample sizes bear out the general pattern, however. Colorado has been tracking 30-day marijuana use among high-school students every two years since 2013 in its Healthy Kids Colorado survey. In 2013, 19.7 percent of respondents said they’d used marijuana in the past 30 days. That number rose slightly in 2015 to 21.2 percent, but then fell back to a new low in 2017, at 19.4 percent. So, if Hickenlooper had specified youth usage, he would have had a stronger argument. In fact, Hickenlooper’s own state government issued a news release in July 2018 that summed up the results this way: ""Marijuana use in Colorado rises for adults, stays the same for kids."" And when we reached out to Hickenlooper's campaign, they confirmed that he had meant to refer to usage by youths. ""He did mean to specify youth,"" said Lauren Hitt, a spokesman for Hickenlooper. ""He tells that story a lot."" For instance, he said in February 2017 on NBC's Meet the Press that ""we didn't see a spike in teenage use"" after legalization. He also said in July 2018, ""Preventing young people from using marijuana is a statewide priority. While youth use hasn’t gone up, we are working hard to educate Colorado parents and their children about the health and legal risks of underage marijuana use."" We should mention one notable caveat to all the studies cited above. ""These surveys are all based on self-reporting, and people are probably more likely to admit to using cannabis when it is legal compared to when it is illegal,"" said Mason Tvert, the former director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project who is now with Vicente Sederberg, a marijuana-focused law firm. This could account for some of the increase over time, he said. Hickenlooper said that after legalizing marijuana in Colorado, ""we haven't seen a spike in consumption."" He has a point that legalization didn’t produce a rapid, sudden increase in marijuana use. But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t a continued increase. In Colorado, reported marijuana use climbed, slowly and steadily, for adults between 2008 and 2017. The one exception was teenagers, for whom usage rates largely remained steady.

Preckwinkle repeats urban myth about third-grade test scores, prison beds
","On the campaign trail, mayoral candidate Toni Preckwinkle is quick to remind voters of the years she spent as a schoolteacher before entering the world of politics. ""I’m a teacher by profession and I know the importance of good public education,"" Preckwinkle told an audience during a recent forum at Malcolm X College before calling for greater investment in early childhood education, something she’s identified as a priority in her campaign. But then she went on to say something we hadn’t heard from her before. ""Let me talk about elementary schools for a minute,"" said Preckwinkle, who is currently the Cook County Board president. ""Nationally, they predict prison populations on the basis of third-grade achievement. So people who are falling behind in third grade are more likely to end up in our criminal justice system, and we have to address that challenge."" It follows that students who don’t do well in school might face fewer opportunities and be more likely to struggle in other areas of life. But do states really use the academic performance of eight-year-olds to calculate how many people are likely to end up in prison years down the road? In 2013, a mayoral candidate in Florida earned a Pants on Fire! rating from PolitiFact for making a similar claim that invoked private prison operators. And other variations of it have been repeatedly debunked over the years. That hasn’t stopped a long list of educators, writers and political leaders from repeating it, however. So we decided to vet Preckwinkle’s claim to see if anything had changed in the years since PolitiFact last took up the case. The short answer: No. Preckwinkle’s campaign didn't respond to our repeated calls and emails, so we don’t know what source she was relying on when she made her claim, or even whether she meant the practice was applied only in specific states or in every state across the nation. But a historical review of the talking point — which varies somewhat in each retelling but almost always focuses on third-grade scores — shows it’s never held up to scrutiny. Peter Leone, a University of Maryland education professor who specializes in behavioral disorders and school discipline, told us he has seen no evidence any state uses student scores in the way Preckwinkle described. ""This is an urban legend that refuses to die,"" he wrote in an email. Leone directed the National Center on Education, Disability and Juvenile Justice, which during its operation from 1999 to 2006 produced a report noting that ""at least one state"" used third-grade reading scores to project future prison bed needs. Others have cited that report as backup for the claim, but Leone set the record straight years ago. He explained to PolitiFact Florida in 2013 that detail was included in the report by a colleague ""before he got the facts."" The 2013 fact-check also highlighted a 1999 Education Week article that included the claim, but the independent education consultant who wrote it told PolitiFact Florida he couldn’t corroborate it and no longer repeats it. The author of a book that used the talking point gave a similar response. Years before PolitiFact Florida weighed in, FactCheck.org, the Washington Post and the Oregonian also debunked versions of the claim. A quick Google search also led us to a 2016 fact-check from WRAL.com in North Carolina. Once again, it was deemed baseless. We wanted to make sure Preckwinkle’s own state — and presumably the only one in which a Chicago mayor might exert some level of control — was no exception, however. So we checked with the Illinois Department of Corrections. ""I do not consider third-grade reading, or other grade school achievement levels when developing projections,"" the department's research manager, Sharon Shipinksi, told us in an email. Instead, IDOC estimates the size of future prison populations based on factors such as trends in the number of people admitted in previous years and the anticipated impact of policy changes designed to shorten sentences, reduce recidivism and more. There is a connection between academic failure and crime, however, which may be why this inaccurate talking point has enjoyed such a long shelf life. Some studies show a correlation between elementary school reading proficiency and high school graduation. Others reveal a correlation between high school dropout rates and incarceration. A 2010 Chicago study found students who read below grade level as third graders were much less likely to graduate high school within five years and attend college than better-performing students. Similarly, a 2012 study showed that one in six children who couldn’t read proficiently by the end of third grade didn’t graduate high school on time, a rate four times greater than that of their proficient peers. And a 2009 study from Northeastern University found that nearly one out of every 10 young men without a high school degree was incarcerated between 2006 and 2007, compared with one out of 33 high school graduates. While that’s not a direct correlation between education and incarceration, it strongly suggests a link. Preckwinkle said, ""Nationally, they predict prison populations on the basis of third-grade achievement."" That’s a riff on a well-worn and startling urban legend that has been debunked repeatedly by PolitiFact and other news outlets over the years. It’s not true in Illinois and we could find no credible evidence that suggested it was true elsewhere. We rate it False. FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

Cuomo claims Buffalo has seen a surge in young people
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks often about his administration’s efforts to revitalize Buffalo. His recent stop on Buffalo’s East Side was no exception. ""Every number is up. Every arrow is pointed in the right direction,"" Cuomo said. ""It is undeniable. Unemployment is down, jobs are up. Young people coming back. Twenty percent increase in young people coming back to Buffalo after a decade where we lost 10 percent of our young people. So a new energy. Jobs, businesses, growth. … Buffalo is a national urban recovery story."" That's a lot to unpack, and we chose to look at the part about the young people. Is he right? Has there been a 20 percent increase in young people coming back to Buffalo? Cuomo relied on the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for population estimates for people ages 25 to 34. The governor’s spokeswoman pointed to Erie County data from 2010, the year Cuomo was elected, through 2017. The estimated number of people in that age group in Erie County grew by 21 percent. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of people in that age group fell by 8.6 percent, according to the data. Cuomo said Buffalo, but he used data for Erie County. Buffalo is in Erie County, but separate population statistics are available for Buffalo. Analysis of Census Bureau data for Buffalo shows an even greater increase. The 25-34 age group increased from 38,051 in 2010 to 49,207 in 2017, a 29 percent increase, according to the U.S. Census and American Community Survey. We reached out to William Frey, a senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, which employs experts of different perspectives. Frey has studied the movements of different population groups, including millennials. Frey said ""some of this gain"" is because the large millennial generation that lived in Buffalo aged into this cohort, not because people returned to the area from elsewhere.   Erie and Niagara counties, according to a January study by the Brookings Institution, reported a negative net domestic migration of those 25 to 34 years old between 2012 and 2017. It is possible that Buffalo attracted some young adult migrants from the rest of the Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls metro area, or had gains from immigration from other countries, said Frey, the study's author. Looking strictly at data for Buffalo, we wanted to see if the 29 percent growth in young people was mainly from people who had aged in place. The age range we're looking at, 25 to 34, would have been ages 18 to 27 in 2010. The 2010 Census breaks out the popularion by age each year. The population of 18- to 27-year-olds in 2010 was 49,734. The population of 25- to 34-year-olds in 2017 was 49,207. The data suggest ""there is quite a bit of aging in place,"" Frey said. But some of those numbers could reflect domestic out migration countered by a similar immigration from abroad, he said. Showing similar numbers for this cohort does suggest that not many people left, he said. E.J. McMahon, research director of the conservative Empire Center think tank, also said that while the population of young people increased, it’s unclear how many of those people came back to Buffalo. Some of the gains could be because people stayed, or they could be from refugee resettlement programs, McMahon said. McMahon, who has tracked New York's population shifts and is a frequent Cuomo critic, said that every community has some people who leave and some who stay, and that is ""clearly"" what happened in Buffalo. ""On a net basis, Buffalo is doing better with this population segment than it has in the past,"" he said. ""From this, the governor and others weave a story of millennials flocking back to redeveloped inner cities, because they are different from previous generations and don’t live in suburbs.  That’s grossly overstated, in my view."" Cuomo said there has been a 20 percent increase in young people ""coming back"" to Buffalo after a decade when their numbers fell by 10 percent. Census figures show a 29 percent increase in people ages 25 to 34. In the previous 10 years, the size of that age group fell by 10 percent. If the governor had just said their numbers grew, he would have been generally correct. He actually understated Buffalo's increase. But he said they were ""coming back."" The data he relied on does not prove they came back. In fact, one expert called the claim they were coming to be ""grossly overstated."" While the number of younger people living in Buffalo increased, the cause could be a large millennial population aging into this age group, not solely because people are returning. So his statement is partially accurate but makes a sweeping, unproven conclusion. It is unclear how many young people have returned to Buffalo, or settled there after living elsewhere.  We rate Cuomo’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2019/mar/23/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-claims-buffalo-has-seen-surge-young-people/
"['Elections', 'Texas', 'John Carter']","
Who was the first Republican elected in Williamson County?
","Speaking before Republican leaders from Williamson County in Texas, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, highlighted his conservative credentials while honoring Bill Fairbrother, the outgoing chairman of the county GOP organization. ""I was the first elected Republican in Williamson County history,"" Carter said to those gathered for the Williamson County Reagan Dinner on Feb. 18. ""That was 1983. And think what we’ve done since Bill Fairbrother has been here. We have become the dominant power in Central Texas for the Republican Party."" But was Carter really the first Republican to be elected in this conservative stronghold north of Austin? County lore says Carter was first Republican Emily Taylor, a spokeswoman for Carter, said the congressman, should have said that he was ""the first county-wide elected Republican in Williamson County in modern history."" Carter, an attorney, became a district judge in Williamson County in 1981, when he was appointed by Republican Gov. Bill Clements after a new judicial district was created. He was elected to the post by voters in the county the following year, when he ran unopposed. Several current and former county and GOP officials interviewed for this fact check agreed that Carter was the first Republican to be elected countywide in modern history. ""It is commonly believed within Republican circles that he was the first Republican elected this century,"" said Fairbrother, who served as chairman of the Williamson County Republican Party for 20 years. Judge Billy Ray Stubblefield, the presiding judge of the Third Administrative Judicial Region who got his start in Williamson County, said there is no doubt in his mind that Carter was the first Republican elected to office. ""Through the entire history of Texas and the entire South post-reconstruction, everybody was a Democrat,"" Stubblefield said. ""I remember asking my mother when I was a little boy, 'what's the difference between Republicans and Democrats?' and she said that we were all Democrats and the Republicans live up north."" ""That's not the whole story, but it was largely true,"" he added. We conducted a thorough search of newspaper archives and election returns to verify this claim ourselves. Historic lection returns from the Texas secretary of state are available through the Texas State Library, but many local races from several years were not listed. Newspaper archives helped fill in some gaps and offer insights into state political trends, but publication of county-by-county election results was inconsistent at best. Texas supported Democratic candidates Like much of the South after the Civil War, Texas was dominated by the Democratic Party. The Republican Party was not established in Texas until 1867, according to the Texas State Historical Association. After the Civil War, several Democratic incumbents in Texas were removed from office and replaced with Republican leaders by federal military officers occupying the state. One of these Republicans was A.J. Hamilton, who was appointed to be the state’s provisional governor 1862. Williamson County supported his election in 1869, according to results published in the Texas Almanac. ""The county did vote for a Republican in the 1860s,"" said Walter Buenger, chief historian for the Texas State Historical Association. ""But in reality, (Hamilton) and many who supported him, including a majority of voters in Williamson County, were in the midst of a transition back to the Democratic Party."" While he can’t say for certain (and local election records from this time period are scarce), Buenger said it is also possible that the county supported Republicans in some local elections, especially as the black population in the area started to grow. ""(Black voters) remained Republicans pretty consistently, with some exceptions and variations within particular elections,"" he said. ""The basic divider, as is often the case in Texas politics, is race, as far as I’m concerned."" Even if complete election records were available, Ann Evans, Curator of The Williamson Museum, said it would have been unusual for candidates seeking local office at the time to list a party affiliation at all. In more recent memory, voters in Williamson County supported Republican candidates at the top of the ticket while continuing to elect Democrats to serve in local office. In 1972, voters in the county supported President Richard Nixon’s re-election bid and also voted for U.S. Sen. John Tower, the first Republican Senator to be elected from Texas since reconstruction. In 1980, the county went for President Ronald Reagan. Locally, Republicans first started running in 1976, according to an American-Statesman story at the time.   When Carter was elected as district judge in 1982, after being appointed a year earlier, he was one of two Republicans elected that cycle. Rose ""Dusty"" Gilliam, a Republican, defeated Democrat Margaret Wood and was elected to serve as Justice of the Peace for the 1st Precinct in Williamson County that same year. Our ruling Carter said he was ""the first elected Republican in Williamson County history."" It’s hard for Carter to say definitively that he was the first Republican ever elected to serve locally because of inconsistencies on early ballots, incomplete records and newspaper reports. The same year he was elected, another Republican was elected to serve as a Justice of the Peace for the 1st precinct. We rate this claim Half True.

Bad math. Iran nuke deal dollars wouldn't cover 30 walls with Mexico
","A Facebook page called ""Veterans of War Memorial"" posted the statement, ""We could build 30 walls with the $150 billion Obama gave to Iran."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We assume that since 5 X 30 = 150, the author is comparing the $5.6 billion President Donald Trump wanted for a wall in the recent government shutdown to the dollars often bandied about for the Iran nuclear deal. Both elements have holes. A plain reading of the post is that America could build a wall along the border with Mexico for about $5 billion. Not so. The Homeland Security Department never claimed it would. Its plan was to use the funds to build 215 miles along its highest priority sectors. As things stand today, by the time CBP builds the sections Congress has funded, the United States will have barriers that cover a bit less than a third of the 2,000-mile border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimated it would cost $18 billion for 722 miles of barriers. And that is just for 17 priority locations. The Government Accountability Office said that number is suspect, because it ""was based on an average cost per mile and is not intended to reflect the costs of individual construction projects.""   The point is, $5 billion wouldn’t build a wall with Mexico. (For what it’s worth, at the rate for the 215 miles Trump sought, it would cost about $30 billion to cover every remaining mile of the border. Other estimates have put the total at over $25 billion.) So, now let’s look at the money in the multinational deal to head off Iran’s nuclear development work. While critics of the deal, such as President Donald Trump, liked to say that Iran got $150 billion out of it, our research shows that’s wrong in several ways. First, according to testimony from U.S. Treasury Department Secretary Jacob Lew, the total is at most about $56 billion. Some analysts say the sum is even lower than that. Second, it’s not right to say the United States gave Iran that money. Very little of the total was under American control. The only dollars strictly in the U.S. government’s hands were about $1.7 billion from American weapons that Iran bought, but were never delivered. The rest of the money was Iran’s to begin with and held in banks around the world. Third, seven governments signed off on the deal, including China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. So to pin the deal on President Barack Obama alone is off the mark. While he could have scuttled the agreement, so could any of the others. A Facebook post said that for the money Obama gave Iran, America could build 30 walls with Mexico. The underlying numbers are $150 billion for Iran and $5 billion for a wall with Mexico. None of the numbers hold up. The Trump administration said the $5 billion it sought for a wall would only build 215 miles worth. That would leave over half the border without a barrier. The money from the Iran deal netted it perhaps as much as $56 billion, and probably less. So, $5 billion doesn’t build a wall and Iran didn’t get $150 billion.

No, Albert Einstein did not say technology would create a 'generation of idiots'
","Albert Einstein was one of the most renowned and celebrated scientists of the 20th Century, so it is no surprise that people continue to quote the German-born physicist more than 60 years after his death. But, the internet has a way of twisting people’s words, or in this case, making them up altogether. A quote attributed to Einstein about his fear of the day technology ""will surpass human interaction"" leading to a ""generation of idiots"" has resurfaced on social media recently, despite being debunked several times. Most versions of the quote circulating online, like this one, feature a photo of Einstein with the quote’s text: ""I fear the day technology will surpass human interaction. The world will have a generation of idiots."" Pasted below it is an image of a five young people standing side by side while looking down, their eyes glued to their cellphones. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could find no record of Einstein ever saying or writing this, despite his papers and quotes being archived in several databases, including the definitive collection ""The Ultimate Quotable Einstein"" from Princeton University Press. The closest iteration of the quote (at least the first half) was said, and linked to Einstein, in a scene from the 1995 movie ""Powder."" Actor Jeff Goldblum, who plays the character Donald Ripley, says ""It’s become appallingly clear that our technology has surpassed our humanity,"" to which Powder, played by Sean Patrick Flanery, responds ""Albert Einstein."" Quote Investigator, a website that tracks down quotations, found that variations of the quote started to appear on webpages in 2012,the same year the scene in ""Powder"" was uploaded to YouTube. The website concluded that the quote is likely fake, as ""the phrasing of the saying has changed over time and different sets of pictures have been attached."" Einstein did, however, note the negative impacts of technology. The closest Einstein quote to share the sentiment, that we could find, was in a letter to Otto Juliusburger on April 11, 1946: ""I believe that the abominable deterioration of ethical standards stems primarily from the mechanisation and depersonalisation of our lives—a disastrous byproduct of science and technology. Nostra culpa! (We are to blame!)"" On the other hand, Einstein supported the advancement of technology, too. In another quote recorded by the Quotable Einstein collection (p. 246), he said it internationally chained economies together. ""Technology resulting from the sciences has internationally chained together economies and this has caused all wars to become a matter of international importance. When this situation has entered the consciousness of mankind, after sufficient turmoil, then men will also find the energy and goodwill to create organizations that have the power to end wars."" Jimena Canales, historian of science and author of ""The Physicist and the Philosopher: Einstein, Bergson, and the Debate That Changed Our Understanding of Time,"" told PolitiFact that she has never heard of such a quote by the physicist, either. ""I could be wrong, but (it) doesn’t sound like Einstein to me at all,"" Canales wrote in an email. ""He had quite the opposite view of radio technology, which he believed would unite people."" A post on the internet claims that Einstein once said he feared ""the day technology will surpass human interaction."" And when that happened ""the world will have a generation of idiots.""

Did African-American incarceration drop 65% under Amy Klobuchar?
","EDITOR’S NOTE, March 22, 2019: We initially rated this statement Half True, in an article we have archived here. However, we reviewed our findings after the Washington Post Fact Checker subsequently noticed problems with the Vera Institute’s data. We have changed our rating to False. Public sentiment about criminal justice policy has evolved in recent years, putting pressure on the former prosecutors who are running for president to answer for their records in the judicial system, particularly about any racial disparities in arrests and sentencing. We previously reviewed the criminal justice record of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who served as both the district attorney for San Francisco and the state attorney general for California. Now, the scrutiny is coming for Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who served as county attorney of Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, between 1999 and 2007. CNN’s Jake Tapper brought up the issue during an interview with Klobuchar on March 17, 2019. Tapper: ""A study from around that time, from during your time heading that office, by one of your predecessors, then with the Council on Crime and Justice, found wide racial disparities in the justice system at the time you took office. It preceded you, but they issued this report during your time there. Minnesota Public Radio wrote, ‘The ratio of blacks sent to Minnesota prisons compared to whites is the highest in the country. People who are black account for 70 percent of Hennepin County's drug cases. If convicted, they are sentenced to time behind bars at three times the rate of whites guilty of the same offense.’ Now, that was data from the start of your term. When you were the county attorney, did you do anything to try to improve these broad, stark racial disparities? And, if so, what did you do?"" Klobuchar: ""Of course I did, Jake. In fact, if you look at the data, you will see there was a 65 percent decrease in incarceration of African-Americans when you go from the beginning of my term to the end."" We initially rated Klobuchar’s statement as Half True, based on data from the Vera Institute of Justice, which collects data on criminal justice topics. However, the Washington Post Fact Checker subsequently noticed problems with the institute’s data for jails in the county, so we took a new look. After this review, we concluded that the data for jails is too compromised for us to rely on it. However, other data does show a decline in African-American incarceration on her watch, though the scale is smaller. The Vera database includes historical data on incarceration rates in a wide variety of jurisdictions around the country. Hennepin County is one of them. The data includes both jails and prisons. On air with Tapper, Klobuchar didn’t specify which metric she was using. After the interview aired, Klobuchar’s staff contacted CNN to clarify that she was referring to jails. Here’s a chart comparing incarceration rates for African-Americans in Hennepin County (in shades of red) with incarceration rates for African-Americans in the United States as a whole (in shades of blue). The ""rate"" used in the data is the number of African-Americans who are incarcerated per 100,000 residents between the ages of 15 and 64. Keep in mind that this is the data that we (and Klobuchar) saw initially looking into this question; shortly, we’ll explain why some of the data is problematic. Keep your eye on the big drop between 2000 and 2001. The problem with this data only becomes clear from the underlying figures. Between 2000 and 2001, the percentage of jail inmates who were classified as ""unknown"" roughly tripled to about 50 percent. This makes comparisons for pre-2001 data and post-2001 data problematic. It seems reasonable to think a change in classification accounted for the big drop in African-American jail incarceration. In our initial article, Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project, had characterized the 70 percent decline as substantial. When we showed him the more complete data, however, he withdrew that assessment. ""Vera has been around for 50 years and is viewed as a very credible source, so I generally assume that their data is correct,"" he said. But seeing the full data, he said, ""it's clear that there should have been a qualification attached."" Mauer said that Klobuchar’s instinct to rely on Vera Institute data is understandable, but he added that, given her years of experience as a prosecutor, ""she probably should have questioned the figures before speaking out."" Mauer recommended that we discount the jail data entirely. So here’s what else we found. That still leaves another set of data that does not appear to be compromised: the one for the prison population. Jails generally hold people awaiting trial or serving a sentence of less than one year, often a misdemeanor. Prisons, by contrast, generally hold felony offenders whose sentences are one year or longer. We confirmed with Jasmine Heiss, outreach director for the Vera Institute, that the prison data comes from a different source than the jail data. In our chart, the lighter blue line at the top is the national trend for African-American incarceration in prisons, while the lighter red line shows the trend for Hennepin County. The rate for African-American prisoners in Hennepin County fell by about 12 percent, and that’s bigger than the decline for the nation as a whole, at 7.6 percent. And a second data point — prison admissions — shows a sharper decline, 22 percent. Such a decline ""is hardly trivial and certainly represents progress, even if we can't fully identify the causal factors,"" Mauer said. The trend line for African-American prison incarceration, he said, was ""clearly going in a good direction"" during Klobuchar’s tenure. Heiss, of the Vera Institute, said decrease in African-American prison admissions ""is significant on its face."" She noted that the drop occurred as the number of working age African-American people in the overwhelmingly white county increased, affecting the denominator in the calculation. But for the purposes of our analysis, the bottom line is that the rate did in fact fall. The county attorney can have an impact on incarceration trends by the policies they set, Mauer said, although he added that other factors can come into play, too. The factors can include ""changes in policing practices, such as making fewer arrests in cases of drug possession), as well as increased availability of treatment and diversion programs,"" Mauer said. Some of these changes might stem from actions taken by state legislators, the governor, or other state or local officials, rather than the county attorney. Still, county attorneys like Klobuchar have a degree of discretion over several important factors affecting the incarceration rate, including their stance on demanding money bail, their willingness to negotiate plea deals that do not include jail time, and their desire to utilize diversion programs or drug courts for first-time offenders. ""Overall, it's much more likely that a combination of factors produced these outcomes, though certainly prosecutors have a role to play,"" Mauer said. So what policies does Klobuchar point to during her tenure that would have made a difference? She cited several during the interview with Tapper: • ""The first is to diversify the office and to add more people of color to the ranks of prosecutors. And I did that."" • ""The second was to look at how we were handling drug court and make sure that we were doing it in a way that wasn't racist. And you can always do better. I can tell you, you learn in retrospect, when you look back, things you can do better."" • ""The third thing was to up our focus on white-collar crimes. Things that are committed in the boardrooms are just as bad as things that are committed with a crowbar if someone is trying to break in a house."" • ""I was one of the first prosecutors in the country to work with The Innocence Project to do a DNA review on our cases, to do something differently when it came to eyewitness identification."" • ""And then, finally, we had videotaped interrogations in Minnesota. We were one of the only states that did it at the time to make sure that suspects were treated fairly, Miranda rights were being read."" But David Schultz, a political scientist at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., who also teaches law at Hamline and the University of Minnesota, cautioned against giving Klobuchar too much credit for any declines. On Klobuchar’s watch, racial disparities in the Minneapolis-area justice system remained significant, he said. Incarceration rates, he added, don’t tell the whole story of racial disparities in the justice system; a fuller picture would also include probation rates. ""I was teaching undergraduate criminal justice classes at the time she was county attorney and there was no indication that she was cognizant of the racial implications of her policies,"" Schultz said. Klobuchar’s tough-on-crime approach was common among prosecutors everywhere at the time, even among Democrats. That has only changed in Democratic circles relatively recently. Klobuchar said that during her tenure as county attorney in Minnesota, ""there was a 65 percent decrease in incarceration of African-Americans."" Klobuchar’s statement hinged largely on unreliable data for jails. The only credible data we can use, for prisons, shows the African-American incarceration rate fell by 12 percent, and the admission rate fell by 22 percent. That's a drop, but both are well below 65 percent. Experts said that Klobuchar’s policies could have contributed to the decline, though other factors beyond her control could have made a difference as well. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2019/mar/22/amy-klobuchar/did-african-american-incarceration-drop-65-under-a/

Do 65% to 75% of Missourians lack college degrees?
","Gov. Mike Parson used his first State of the State address to announce his goals for Missouri, one of the primary ones being job force development. He’s allocated $22 million toward a new scholarship program called Fast Track that can be used by Missourians at community colleges, technical schools and universities. The program is for ages 25 and older and is intended to help fill jobs in ""high-demand"" industries, although Parson didn’t clarify what these jobs are. ""And I want to be clear too: We are always going to need architects, doctors, we’re going to need professionals with four-year degrees. But 65 to 70 percent of the people in Missouri don’t have degrees,"" Parson said in an interview on KCUR on Jan. 24. We wondered if he is right that about two-thirds of Missourians don’t have a college degree. We found government data to support his claim. According to 2017 census data from the Missouri Department of Higher Education, an estimated 39.9 percent of working age adults had an associate degree or higher in 2017. Just 19.6 percent of them had bachelor’s degrees. Such a large percentage could seem staggering at first. However, rankings from the U.S. News and World Report reveal that these numbers are pretty average in comparison to the rest of the country. They ranked Missouri 27th in higher education — based on the share of citizens with a college degree and factoring in time spent completing degree programs, tuition cost and the amount of student debt. Missouri’s educational attainment has been steadily increasing over the years. In 2015, 27.8 percent of Missourians had a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to just 24.3 percent in 2008. The number of associate degrees also rose, jumping to 7.7 percent in 2015 from  6.7 percent in 2008. As the share of Missourians with degrees rises, the state receives an economic boost. ""It makes the state’s labor market more competitive at attracting industry and employers, and it also makes individuals who receive those credentials much more likely to improve their quality of life as measured by ability to work and earn money,"" said Mark Ehlert, an associate research professor of economics at the University of Missouri. Ehlert’s research specifically focuses on the economics of education. According to him, the share of the state’s population with college degrees is the highest it’s ever been, and younger people are more likely to have a college degree. Ehlert says his research also shows a ""latent pool of labor"" being overlooked in older people without certification, degrees or technical training. This pool of non-traditional college students is FastTrack’s target. Some state lawmakers proposed a $4.2 million cut to the Fast Track program, arguing it was too much money for a first year program. The money would be moved to funding for the Department of Higher Education and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. A Senate committee also raised similar questions about the need for the program. Parson said, ""65 percent to 70 percent of the people in Missouri don’t have degrees."" His number is accurate, according to census data and the Missouri Department of Higher Education .

Nygren says Wisconsin Republicans have cut taxes by $8B, still grown revenue
","Editor’s Note: This item was updated March 22, 2019, with the rating changed from Half True to True, based on additional research and to remain consistent with past ratings given to similar claims. The budget battle is raging in Madison, where new Gov. Tony Evers is seeking to make his mark on the state and Republicans are making the case that fiscal policies enacted under all-GOP control are worth continuing. State Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, co-chair of the powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, hammered that point in a string of tweets on Feb. 12, 2019, including one that claimed Wisconsin’s financial outlook ""is the strongest in a generation."" But it was a tweet later in the string that caught our eye: ""Over the last eight years, we’ve shown that even though we’ve cut … taxes by $8 billion, revenues continue to grow,"" Nygren said. Revenue generally comes from, well, taxes, so can one go up while the other goes down that much? Let’s see if the numbers add up. There are two parts to this claim — that taxes were cut by $8 billion and that revenues are growing. Tax cuts get complicated, so let’s warm up the revenue side of the equation. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s report on tax collections shows consistent growth in recent years. Going back eight years to 2010-’11 -- the period referenced in Nygren’s claim -- the state’s overall general fund tax collection has grown every year but one. The revenue increase was generally 3 to 4 percent annually, with the exception of 2013-’14. That year revenue dropped slightly after the Legislature implemented a series of tax cuts. Overall from 2010-’11 to 2017-’18, general fund tax collections rose from $12.9 billion to $16.1 billion. And they’re expected to rise to $16.6 billion in 2018-’19 according to the latest fiscal bureau estimate. So, yes, revenues have grown. As proof of the $8 billion cut cited by Nygren, his staff provided a fiscal bureau memo that listed changes to a variety of taxes since 2011. They include things like health savings accounts, farm loss limit, sales tax exemptions and technical college funding. The chart tallies up the tax changes relative to the 2010-’11 level across the eight-year span. So if a tax dropped by $1 million the first year and stayed at that same level each of the next seven years, it is counted as an $8 million ""cut"" over the eight-year span — since the total is $8 million below where it would have been if the 2010-’11 level remained in place each year. The taxes paid in this simplified example would only get lower once, in the first year. But the approach used in the memo — and by Nygren — counts the savings generated each year relative to the 2010-’11 level. The tally shows $4.8 billion in reductions to income and franchise taxes and a $3.6 billion reduction in property taxes compared to the 2010-’11 baseline. The property tax reductions cited are not given directly to taxpayers, they are sent to local municipalities. Local officials could choose to cut property taxes by an identical amount and pass those savings on to taxpayers, but that doesn’t always happen. That property tax relief did reduce taxes that otherwise would have been paid, though. Experts disagree on whether it’s correct to call all these changes tax ""cuts,"" since it counts reductions in multiple years when the level of the tax is only ""cut"" once. But the net effect is to cut the amount of tax paid. And we’ve rated claims in this vein True in the past. In 2015, we rated then-Gov. Scott Walker’s statement True when he used the same approach from the fiscal bureau to refer to what was then $4.7 billion in tax cuts. We gave Walker another True in 2017 for referring to what would become $8 billion in ""tax cuts."" And we gave Walker a True for using the figure on the campaign trail in June 2018, touting it as ""$8 billion in cumulative tax relief."" Nygren’s verbiage calling that tally a ""tax cut"" differed from Walker’s statement in 2018 but is in line with how Walker referred to it in our 2015 and 2017 fact checks Nygren said under eight years of Republican leadership Wisconsin has ""cut taxes"" by $8 billion while revenues have risen. The revenues portion of the statement is clearly accurate. The tax cut element is a bit more nuanced, but the changes Republicans made did result in a net savings of $8 billion for taxpayers compared to if the 2010-’11 tax levels had remained in place. And we’ve rated very similar claims as True in the past. We rate Nygren’s statement True.",/factchecks/2019/mar/21/john-nygren/john-nygren-says-wisconsin-republicans-have-cut-ta/

Conservative pundit gets schooled on history of American slavery after Fox News remarks
","A proposal for the United States to pay reparations for its history of slavery is gaining traction among some Democratic presidential candidates. After White House hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered tentative support for the idea, a panelist on Fox News’ Outnumbered expressed her view that the policy is misplaced. ""They keep blaming America for the sin of slavery. But the truth is that throughout human history slavery has existed,"" said conservative pundit Katie Pavlich. ""And America came along as the first country to end it within 150 years. And we get no credit for that."" Either Pavlich is saying that America was the first country to end slavery, or the first country to end it within 150 years. Either read of history is wrong—and her attempt at a clean up also missed the mark. Pavlich declined to comment for this story. Slavery in the United States began in 1619 with the arrival of a Dutch ship that carried 20 African slaves to the British colony of Jamestown, Va. Slavery continued through the nation’s founding in 1776. President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation can be considered the beginning of the end of slavery in America, though slavery wouldn’t be formally outlawed across the United States until after the Civil War in 1865. In terms of dates of abolition, Spain (1811, except Cuba), Portugal (1819, and later its colonies in 1858) and France (1848) are among the countries that banned slavery earlier. Pavlich’s comments were panned on Twitter. In response to critics, the pundit amended her on-air comments. But that only led to more tweet-checks. ""Should have said one of* first countries, from the point of founding,"" Pavlich tweeted. ""My argument stands, but please @soledadobrien please continue name calling as your argument and the smearing of America as the originator of slavery."" But that, too, got the facts wrong. ""Your argument still stands,"" Princeton historian Kevin Kruse tweeted, ""but it’s still completely wrong."" Kruse listed more than a dozen countries that abolished slavery earlier in their country’s history than the United States did, including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Kruse told PunditFact that he compiled the historical data to rebut similar claims about slavery that have been made before.   Years between independence and abolition of slavery:Haiti: 0Costa Rica: 3 El Salvador: 3 Guatemala: 3 Honduras: 3Chile: 5Bolivia: 6Uruguay: 8Nicaragua: 17Mexico: 19Paraguay: 29Colombia: 41Venezuela: 43Argentina: 45Brazil: 66USA: 87https://t.co/ARxH1YDBWL Pavlich said, ""America came along as the first country to end (slavery) within 150 years.""

Farmer suicides as high as in the Great Depression? No data says so
","In a campaign swing through Iowa, Cory Booker said the people he met there ""are right to be angry"" over what they see going on in their state. ""Attacks on public education, attacks on labor,"" said Booker, U.S. senator from New Jersey and Democratic presidential candidate, in a March 18 interview with MSNBC. ""Attacks on farmers. Farmer suicide rates are as high as they have been since the Great Depression."" Booker’s specific claim about farmer suicides is not accurate, our review found. There are no known numbers for farmer suicides going back to the 1930s, and Booker's staff did not provide any. ""The information I can find suggests that rates of suicide did increase in general during that time,"" said Lorann Stallones, an epidemiologist and psychology professor at Colorado State University. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at 17 states and compared suicides for major occupational groups in 2012 and 2015. In 2012, the rate of suicides by farmers was 44.9 per 100,000. In 2015, it was 32.2 per 100,000. (The CDC previously reported much higher rates, which generated a lot of news stories and legislative action. But ultimately, those numbers didn’t stand, and the CDC retracted its report.) Does that mean the rate dropped between those years? Technically, yes, but beware: The total number of suicides was low — 59 in the first year and 54 in the other. With numbers that small, a few incidents can change the rates considerably. Washington defines farmers as people who play a role in managing a farm. That’s in contrast to agricultural workers, meaning laborers who plant, weed and pick the crops. For that group, the CDC found rates of 20.4 and 17.3 per 100,000 in the two years. That offers no support for Booker’s contention, but the study only covered 17 states. It did not include major farming states such as Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and California.  Another factor makes the data less than perfect. Brandi Janssen, director of the Center for Agricultural Safety and Health at the University of Iowa, cautioned that part-time farmers are often left out of the farmer statistics, and their deaths are not included in the tallies. ""I think it’s fair to say that we know with some confidence that suicide rates among farmers are higher than the general population, and that they’re probably underreported,"" Janssen said. Based on the 2015 CDC numbers, the rate for farmers, 32.2, was more than twice the rate for the general population as a whole, 13.3. (The general rate in 2017 rose to 14.) For context, people in the construction and extraction industry, which includes roofers, oil drill operators and electricians, had the highest suicide rate — 53.2 per 100,000, or more than triple the national average. The only other data point researchers noted comes from the early 1980s, a time when family farms collapsed at a fierce pace. The National Farm Medicine Center based in Wisconsin gathered suicide reports from Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana. It found that rates peaked in 1982 with 58 deaths per 100,000 among farmers and ranchers. Because of the smaller number of states, that figure isn’t directly comparable to recent data. That said, it undercuts Booker’s statement. Farmer advocates note growing economic pressures. Farm incomes are expected to show a decline in 2018. Bankruptcies are up in some states, although we found that nationally, they are holding steady. The group Farm Aid said a 30 percent rise in calls to its hotline shows, ""farmers are under incredible financial, legal and emotional stress."" However, Stallones said many forces shape suicide trends. ""Economic difficulties can contribute to suicide rate increases,"" she said. ""My own research has suggested that poisoning from pesticides may contribute to mood disorders, which can then lead to (higher) risk of suicide."" Booker said that ""farmer suicide rates are as high as they have been since the Great Depression."" Broadly stated, the data on farmer suicide is not comprehensive, but what there is does not support that statement. Limited data from the 1930s suggests the suicide rate in general was a bit lower at the time, but we didn’t find any specific numbers to farmers. The latest government report on farmer suicides offers a narrow comparison between 2012 and 2015. The rate was higher in 2012, but the number of suicides in both years are too small to draw firm conclusions. In a group of upper-Midwest states, the rate was markedly higher in 1982 than rates reported today.

Kamala Harris gets it mostly right on America’s rapid growth of student loan debt
","In her book, ""The Truths We Hold,"" California Sen. Kamala Harris asks ""How can you dream when you are drowning in student loan debt?"" in a section on the rising cost of living in America. On the campaign trail, the Democratic presidential hopeful has called student loan debt ""one of the biggest challenges facing our country and our students."" In the Senate, she helped re-introduce the Debt-Free College Act, a bill she says will help reverse the growing student debt crisis. Specifically, it would provide states incentives through matching grants to increase investments in public higher education. The senator then made this eye-popping claim about how fast student loan debt has grown in a news release on March 6 announcing her support for the bill: ""College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt."" She tweeted a similar claim a few days later.  But is student loan debt really growing that fast? And is it really second only to mortgage debt? We decided to crunch Harris’ numbers in this fact check. Our research To support the statement, a spokesman for Harris cited a Federal Reserve table showing the nation’s cumulative student loan debt for each year from 2006 through 2018. He also cited articles from The Washington Post and MarketWatch.   The Federal Reserve table shows student loan debt at the end of 2006 was $521 billion. By the end of 2018, the most recent period available, it had grown to $1.57 trillion — which matches with Harris’ claim that it ""now exceeds $1.5 trillion."" But after calculating the numbers, we found an increase of 201 percent, an even faster rate than the 170 percent Harris referenced.   ""I’d say that her statement is mostly correct,"" said Mark Kantrowitz, a national financial aid expert. ""The one slight error: She actually underestimates the growth of student loan debt outstanding."" Kantrowitz is publisher and vice president of research for SavingforCollege.com, a guide to college savings plans.   ""The only way I get to 170 percent,"" he added, ""is if I compare the current debt outstanding to 2007 instead of 2006. That works out to be 170 percent."" Hans Johnson, director of the Public Policy Institute of California’s Higher Education Center, also reviewed the data and found a 200 percent increase based on the most current Federal Reserve figures. SOURCE: Federal Reserve student loan data. Why is college debt growing so fast?  More students going to college accounts for some of the growth of student loan debt, but only a small portion, Kantrowitz said. In 2006, there were 15.2 million college students. A decade later, that number had increased 11 percent to 16.9 million, he said, citing figures from the National Center for Education Statistics. Kantrowitz added that another factor is that federal grants have slowed as tuition has gone up. States often cut tuition assistance at the first signs of a financial crisis. The average student loan debt was nearly $30,000 for students graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 2018, Kantrowitz said. That is up from nearly $21,000 in 2006. College debt ""second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt"" We found this part of Harris’ statement is accurate. In 2014, PolitiFact Virginia reported that ""student debt began to outpace credit card debt in the second quarter of 2010,"" citing data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At the end of 2018, the nation’s overall credit card debt was $870 billion and mortgage balances stood at $9.1 trillion, according to the data. Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris said ""College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt."" She actually understated how fast student loan debt is growing. The most recent Federal Reserve figures show it’s increased 201 percent since 2006. Harris was right about college debt topping $1.5 trillion, and being second only to mortgage debt. We rate her overall statement Mostly True.

No, Yosemite Sam was not banned from television for being 'too violent'

Some social media posts circulating the internet, however, say that Yosemite Sam has been ""banned"" from appearing on the airwaves for being too violent. One such post, shared on March 18, displays an image of Yosemite Sam in front of a confederate flag with his two guns drawn, and says: ""I was banned from television for being too violent.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no documented evidence, or any past or present media reports that say Yosemite has ever been banned or cut from the show for any reason. The only Looney Tunes character to be temporarily banned was Speedy Gonzales, a small Mexican mouse who was deemed an offensive stereotype and reportedly pulled off the air in late 1999. But fans of Speedy rallied to get the character back on TV. Animated shorts featuring the mouse returned in 2002. Ten episodes of ""Merrie Melodies"" (a Looney Tunes sister series also produced by Warner Bros.) and one Looney Tunes segment called ""Angel Puss,"" were all pulled from syndication in the 1960s over racist content. Angel Puss, which was released in 1944, depicted a young boy in blackface. These cartoons are sometimes referred to as the ""Censored Eleven"" and none include Yosemite Sam. Meanwhile, you can still see Looney Tunes reruns on television today. On Boomerang, a cable television network and streaming service owned by Warner Bros., you can stream the show and catch the show’s characters, including Yosemite, at 10 a.m. on weekdays.

Fact-checking climate change crusader Jay Inslee’s mission to make military greener
","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who’s made climate change the centerpiece of his 2020 Democratic presidential run, said he would use the U.S. military’s vast purchasing power to promote clean energy. Asked in an interview what the Inslee administration would do about global warming in the first 100 days, Inslee said he would make the Pentagon’s budget more eco-friendly, and argued that elements of that concept have already been shown to work. ""We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s,"" Inslee told Vox. ""So we can use the procurement power of the United States military to drive some of this clean energy."" Inslee was right about biofuels having powered a supersonic jet. We also found that aircraft similar to the 737 completed transatlantic flights on blended fuel, though we didn’t find instances where 737s had done so. Inslee is correct that the U.S. military has flown an F-18 on biofuel. Navy aviators made history in 2010 by flying an F-18 Super Hornet on a 50-50 blend of conventional jet fuel and biofuel—the first time this was attempted in a supersonic jet, according to the Washington Examiner. The 45-minute test flight took place on Earth Day at a Maryland naval base, the Navy’s media wing reported. The biofuel was derived from a plant called camelina, which is native to North America. Prior to the test flight, the Navy said, the Pentagon awarded a $2.7 million contract to a Montana-based renewable fuel company for 40,000 gallons of camelina-based fuel. The environmentally-friendly moves were part of then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus’s initiative— known as the Great Green Fleet—a $510 million, three-year program to explore cleaner energy options. Under the program, the Navy certified warships and aircraft to operate on biofuels. But according to Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, naval systems do not routinely use biofuels due to their high cost. Harrison seemed skeptical that the military would embrace a dramatic shift to the alternative energy source. ""It is possible that if the Navy started making regular, large-scale purchases of biofuels for its systems that it could help jump start this industry and bring down the price for other consumers,"" Harrison added. ""But that would be a significant investment on the part of the Navy for something that only tangentially benefits the military."" Mabus, for his part, told us he sees climate change and national security as inextricably linked. He argued that as one of the biggest energy consumers on the planet, the Defense Department’s role in combating climate change should not be overlooked. Bottom line: Inslee is right that F-18s have flown on biofuels. But what to make of his claim about 737s? Inslee didn’t specify who he claims flew a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic—and a Navy spokesman said that service branch had never flown this series aircraft on biofuels. We reached out to Inslee’s campaign, and they pointed us to a Boeing press release that described the company’s development of a fuel that blended petroleum fuel and ""bio-derived oils and waste animal fats."" The press release also mentions Boeing’s work with Virgin Atlantic on a 2008 bio-fueled test flight. But it doesn’t say anything about flying a 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. (We reached out to Boeing directly but didn’t hear back.) That said, we did find numerous examples of transatlantic flights powered by biofuels. Boeing posted a clip on YouTube in 2011 of a 747-8 Freighter completing what the plane maker described as ""the first-ever transatlantic biofuel flight with a commercial jetliner."" A Lufthansa 747 made the first biofuel-powered transatlantic commercial flight to the United States in 2012, and two years later Finnair used a cooking oil-based biofuel to fly an Airbus A330 from Helsinki to New York. In 2018, United Airlines celebrated the ""longest transatlantic biofuel flight to date"" when a 787 Dreamliner flew from San Francisco to Zurich. Inslee said, ""We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s."" The Navy made history in 2010 when it flew an F-18 supersonic jet on biofuels. We found numerous transatlantic flights that have been powered by biofuels, too. We weren’t able to find instances where Boeing 737s had done so, but those are similar to other aircraft we documented.   We rate this Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/mar/21/jay-inslee/fact-checking-climate-change-crusader-jay-inlees-m/
