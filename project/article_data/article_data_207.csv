More context needed for Medicaid claim
","The slugfest that is the Georgia governor’s race keeps coming back to the federal health insurance program for the poor. At issue: The refusal by Gov. Nathan Deal, the Republican seeking re-election, to expand the Medicaid health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act. Deal says the price is too steep. Expansion, he says, would cost the state $2.5 billion over the next decade. His Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jason Carter, talks up a different set of numbers and supports extending Medicaid coverage to about 650,000 low-income Georgians now without health insurance. ""There’s $30 billion in expansion funds that we’ve paid – it’s our money and Nathan Deal wants Washington to keep it,"" Carter said recently. That’s billions with a B. As Mama used to say, that’s a lot of chicken feed. And chicken feed is good grist for the Truth-O-Meter mill. First, let’s get this shocker in print: Deal and Carter agree on something! The numbers they both cite to bolster their positions come from a 2012 study released by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The study focused specifically on the ACA’s Medicaid expansion plan, which calls for the federal government to pay 100 percent of the costs for newly eligible enrollees in 2015 and 2016 and no less than 90 percent thereafter. Expansion would bring nearly $34 billion of new federal dollars to Georgia over a decade, according to the study. Georgia’s share of the expansion during that time would be $2.5 billion. So far, so good. Except Carter said that $30 billion is what Georgians have ""paid"" to the federal government. That’s a very different calculation than what the federal government would send here. Finding out how much we send to the feds, and how much of that might be part of Medicaid, involves a lot more billions and a bit more math. Luckily, which is not often said about the Internal Revenue Service, some federal data can tell us how much corporate and individual income taxes come from Georgia: $74.3 billion in fiscal 2013. That’s about 3 percent of the federal revenue total of $2.855 trillion. The easiest way to estimate how much Georgians are paying for Medicaid expansion would be to take 3 percent of that total, said William Custer, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University. The same Kaiser report Carter and Deal used estimates that expansion will cost about $800 billion in the next 10 years. So over a decade, Georgians are projected to pay about $24 billion to the federal government for that Medicaid expansion – but are missing out on $34 billion here. ""It’s not that we’re paying all this money and not getting anything for it,"" Custer said. ""We are paying for it, and we’re not getting money back. (Carter’s) basic point is right: dollar for dollar, Georgia would be a winner in Medicaid expansion."" In sum, even political opponents cite the same study on how Georgia will fare under the Medicaid expansion piece of the ACA. Based on that study, Carter would be right to say Georgia is missing out on $34 billion of federal money by not expanding the insurance program. Deal claims that by taking the money, the state would incur more costs down the road. Carter gets in his own way to suggest Georgia will pay that much in taxes for the program elsewhere. The missing context is that it’s not a dollar-for-dollar trade when it comes to taxes vs. services. Carter makes a good overall point -- Georgia is set to miss out on big bucks for Medicaid. But a lot of context is required to fully understand what is going on here. We rate Carter’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973EBE40>],/factchecks/2014/jun/24/jason-carter/more-context-needed-medicaid-claim/

Video of Barack Obama speech circulating on the Internet was edited to change his meaning
","A reader recently asked us to look at a YouTube video clip of President Barack Obama that puzzled them. The chain email that included the link to the video said, ""You may not believe this 20 second sound bite. I had to listen to it twice ... to be sure that I heard what I thought I had heard. This is the most amazing statement ever uttered by Obama, or by any American."" The brief video showed Obama giving a speech in which he said, ""And for the international order that we have worked for generations to build, ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign."" The YouTube video originated with a group from Germany that appears to dabble in conspiracy theories, including a focus on the ""new world order"" -- the notion of an emerging, worldwide, totalitarian government. Translated into English, the YouTube video is titled, ""Obama explains the new world order 2014 in short ^^ – montage."" It had received more than 88,000 views through June 20. It’s unclear whether the video was posted seriously or in jest by the German group; the emoticon ""^^"" sometimes communicates sarcasm. Still, that doesn’t play into our fact-check, because what we’re checking here is how the video circulated in English in the United States -- where there was no indication that it was intended as satire. We tracked down the speech Obama was giving. It was an address to European youth at the Palais des Beaux Arts in Brussels on March 26, 2014. But while the clip comes from a genuine White House video, it has been edited to make an entirely different point than the one Obama was making. Here’s the actual context of Obama’s comments: Leaders and dignitaries of the European Union; representatives of our NATO Alliance; distinguished guests: We meet here at a moment of testing for Europe and the United States, and for the international order that we have worked for generations to build. Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve inevitable conflicts between states.  And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle -- through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution -- that a particular set of ideals began to emerge: The belief that through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose. The belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed, and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding.  And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men -- and women -- are created equal. But those ideals have also been tested -- here in Europe and around the world.  Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power. This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign. Often, this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others, and that individual identity must be defined by ""us"" versus ""them,"" or that national greatness must flow not by what a people stand for, but by what they are against. In other words, the creator of the video slyly spliced together two separate passages of Obama’s speech during a cut-away shot -- in a way that totally changes the meaning. Obama wasn’t saying that ""ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs"" or that individuals should ""surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign."" Rather, he was saying that those two sentiments run counter to the ideals of free will and democracy. Our ruling The chain email claims that Obama said that ""ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs"" and that individuals should ""surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign."" Those are two separate thoughts from an actual speech, spliced together through video editing in a way that twists Obama’s argument beyond recognition. We rate it Pants on Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F79640>],/factchecks/2014/jun/23/chain-email/video-barack-obama-speech-circulating-internet-was/

Rick Scott signed a law to give politicians 'an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances,' Nelson says
","Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson passed up the chance to run for governor against Rick Scott this year, but that doesn’t mean he’s done attacking the Republican incumbent. Nelson went on the offensive against the governor, with a page on his website entitled ""The public has a right to know,"" asking for people to sign up to protest Scott’s alleged lack of transparency. The message also went out via email. ""Last year, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill giving Florida’s public officials and candidates an easy way to avoid financial disclosure of their assets,"" Nelson said in an email sent June 13, 2014. ""Since then, Gov. Scott has been the only elected official to take advantage of this."" Did Scott really sign a bill making it easier to hide assets from his financial disclosure statements? We’ll take a look at Florida law so you won’t be coming into this debate blind. Trusting disclosures While we didn’t hear back from Nelson’s office about clarifying this attack, it’s pretty obvious he’s referring to Senate Bill 2, a 2013 law unanimously passed by the Legislature that allowed state elected officials to establish a blind trust for their financial holdings and investments in order to prevent a conflict of interest. In essence, a blind trust is when someone turns over their portfolio to a third-party trustee, who then buys and sells stocks, bonds and other assets without the owner’s knowledge. Nelson is right that Scott signed SB 2 into law in May 2013. And yes, Scott is the only elected official in the state to use this law to put assets into a blind trust. The question is whether the law makes it easier to hide assets from the public. By definition, a blind trust makes it easier for a candidate to not disclose the investments that person owns. A blind trust allows Scott to declare a lump sum net worth without having to disclose the value of his vast portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, some of which are regulated by the state and whose value could be directly affected by Scott's policies. But under SB 2, politicians must first disclose the assets they put into the blind trust. Scott did this in 2011, before the law was in place. It’s only after those assets are in the trust that they are not available to the public -- or the official who put them there. Other officials have used a blind trust in the past. Alex Sink did it in December 2006 after she became the state’s chief financial officer, an issue that became a somewhat contentious element of her failed gubernatorial run against Scott in 2010, because she voted for a new bond sale process that included her former employer, Bank of America. Sink created a blind trust on her own, without an ethics law addressing it. Scott did the same thing after being elected as governor, disclosing all his investments in 2010, then forming his own blind trust in 2011 to avoid a conflict of interest, he said. For years, the state ethics commission advised the Legislature to pass a law allowing blind trusts to deal with official conflicts of interest. In 2013, both the House and Senate unanimously passed SB 2. The bill regulated blind trusts and set the powers and duties of appointed trustees, including prohibiting them from telling their clients, such as Scott, what assets are bought or sold. These rules had not been in place prior to the bill’s passage, leaving blind trusts unregulated by the state. Jan Jacobowitz, director of the Professional Responsibility & Ethics Program at the University of Miami, says the problem in Scott’s case is more who is managing the portfolio. In this case, the custodian of Scott’s $72 million portfolio is Alan Lee Bazaar, the chief executive of a New York investment advisory firm with ties to Scott’s business dealings. ""If you sort of have an insider managing your blind trust, it doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in the people,"" Jacobowitz said. While the state law provides some safeguards against conflicts of interest drawn from similar federal regulations, there were more than a dozen federal guidelines the state’s law didn’t incorporate (a point reported by the website the BrowardBulldog.org). These included making trust agreements public, allowing the ethics commission to remove trustees for misconduct and requiring periodic trust performance reports to the commission. Another problem with blind trusts is the while the owner may not manage the holdings, they still know what they own when they put those investments in the trust. ""If what you’re putting in has a conflict of interest, then there’s a problem. You still know what’s in it,"" Jacobowitz said. In May, former Democratic legislator and constitutional law expert Talbot (Sandy) D'Alemberte filed a lawsuit brought by Jim Apthorp, challenging the constitutionality of the law. Apthorp, a Democrat and former chief of staff to the late Gov. Reubin Askew, said the law violated state requirements for financial disclosure. As of June 20, the court is weighing that claim. On June 16, Scott disclosed all of his financials in order to run for governor. In addition to his 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns (he and wife Ann Scott filed for an extension on their 2013 return), the governor ended his blind trust and revealed all the investments in his candidacy filing. That move wasn’t required by the 2013 law, which only says he must disclose the value of the blind trust, not its contents. Scott's net worth rose from $83.8 million in 2012 to $132.7 million last year, an increase of more than half, according to his financial disclosures. When he first ran in 2010, his net worth was a reported $218.6 million. He bankrolled his own campaign and has kept a campaign promise not to draw a salary from the state. One of the notable things missing from Scott’s investments was any interest in French oil services company Schlumberger Ltd., which is involved in Everglades drilling. Scott had a $135,000 investment in 2011 when he formed the trust, but the stake was gone in his June 16 disclosure. The former holding has since drawn an ethics complaint. After filing his paperwork, Scott put the investments into a new blind trust. Our ruling Nelson said ""Scott signed into law a bill that gives Florida's public officials an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances."" In terms of historical context and content of the Senate Bill 2, that part is true. Blind trusts do let officials shield financial holdings from disclosure requirements, and Florida law now allows officials to use those trusts. The broader implication of Nelson’s statement is that Scott is being dishonest about what he owns, and that it affects his ability to govern without creating conflicts of interest. After Nelson made the statement, Scott ended the trust and disclosed all his holdings, but he was following a law both recommended by the state ethics commission and approved unanimously by the Legislature. That law requires any official to disclose the assets being put into the trust before being turned over to a manager. There is debate over the law’s rules regarding choosing that manager and whether assets in that portfolio may present a conflict of interest. What goes into the trust would be publicly disclosed, however, while how it is managed afterward would not. That’s not the same as hiding assets from voters. In this case, Scott ended the trust to disclose the portfolio’s contents, anyway. Nelson implied the blind trust law makes it easier to hide personal assets. They may be hidden, but only after they are listed and turned over to a trustee.

Al Jazeera America: Gogebic iron ore mine would be ""just up the hill"" from Lake Superior ice caves
","Controversy over the proposed Gogebic Taconite mine in far northern Wisconsin plays out in familiar fashion in ""Wisconsin’s Mining Standoff,"" a documentary airing on the Al Jazeera America cable network. Co-produced by Milwaukee-based 371 Productions and Al Jazeera for the network’s weekly Fault Lines program, the film calls the debate over the proposed mine ""a battle for the very soul of the state….pitting those who wish to extract natural resources against those who wish to preserve them."" The piece about the mine was broadcast for the first time June 14, 2014. Al Jazeera America, which launched in 2013, is available in 52 million homes. Fault Lines also airs internationally on the Al Jazeera English cable network, which is not available in the United States. (Al Jazeera doesn’t provide an online link to the segment.) The film is also being screened throughout Wisconsin by 371 Productions. The documentary opens with a panorama of hundreds of bundled-up folks tramping across frozen Lake Superior to view scenic ice caves. Those spectacular caves, in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore about 20 miles west of Bayfield, are normally only accessible by kayak or canoe. When the lake froze over the winter for the first time since 2009, the caves received considerable attention, and a record number of visitors. Standing on the frozen lake, Al Jazeera correspondent Josh Rushing refers to the importance of tourism to northern Wisconsin, discusses the size of the proposed mine and raises a question that’s an important theme in the 25 minute documentary. ""Will all of these tourists want to come here if there’s an iron mine just up the hill?"" he asks. The ""just up the hill"" impression is reinforced by the editing of the piece. In the opening minute, the film moves back and forth from the ice caves to the Penokee mountain range where the mine would be built.  It shows heavy equipment digging into the earth -- part of initial rock sampling now under way -- and huge trucks rumbling down a snow covered road, then switches back to the frozen lake and the ice caves. There’s one problem: The mine and the caves are more than an hour apart. Google maps says it’s about 54 miles from Cornucopia, the town near the caves, to Mellen, the community closest to the proposed mine site. It would take 70 minutes to make the trip, according to Google. It’s not like this was an out-of-town correspondent losing his bearings in the North Woods. The script was written by 371 founder Brad Lichtenstein, who is also listed in the credits as director, senior producer and a principal photographer. Milwaukee-based 371 proposed the topic to Fault Lines and did much of the work on the segment. The company produced the 2012 documentary ""As Goes Janesville,"" which included footage of Gov. Scott Walker telling a wealthy supporter he would use a ""divide and conquer"" strategy against unions. When we asked the 371 Productions about the ""just up the hill"" statement, we didn’t receive a response from the company. Instead, we heard from Al Jazeera in New York, which issued a statement that said the film would be edited due to our inquiry. ""While we consider Josh’s statement to be a figure of speech that helps viewers understand the area broadly as a tourist destination, we can also understand that some viewers might take his narration to imply an exact measurement of the distance between him and the mine site,"" the statement said. ""Because of the potential for confusion, we are removing this line of narration."" Impact on the lakeshore That aside, could the mine hurt the Apostle Islands lakeshore? The mine site is some 20 miles inland, but there is plenty of concern from neighbors and the nearby Bad River band of the Lake Superior Chippewa that the project could pollute the Bad River, which flows into Lake Superior. But the mouth of the Bad River is miles away from the caves and on the opposite side of the Bayfield peninsula. The state Department of Natural Resources is responsible for enforcing federal clean water rules. DNR hydrogeologist Larry Lynch, the agency’s top administrator overseeing the mine project, said it’s too early to study any impact that a mine could have on the Bad River watershed and Lake Superior, because the mining company has not provided a specific plan for the project. For instance, Lynch said, if Gogebic plans a waste water treatment facility, would water be discharged into the river? If so, would the trip downstream dilute that discharge before it reaches the lake? ""It would be a very involved process, obviously,"" Lynch said of the DNR water quality review. Gogebic Taconite spokesman Bob Seitz said the company had not studied the potential impact of the mine on tourism. He noted the site itself might draw visitors to what is a remote part of the state. ""I am confident an operating mine (or one under construction) would bring far more people to this area daily to use tourism related businesses than currently visit the immediate area,"" Seitz said in an email. ""Mines also draw tourists to view the project. I would anticipate some kind of overlook like mines in other places have to draw visitors."" Other statements  The Fault Lines piece included several other statements similar to ones we have reviewed. The documentary states that the project ""would start with a 4.5 mile pit and could eventually stretch 22 miles."" In another spot, he describes the mine as a ""half mile trench that could eventually stretch 22 miles through the wilderness."" That’s similar to a claim from writer and musician Dan Kaufman that the mine ""could be extended as long as 21 miles."" We rated that Half True. While that is the size of the ore deposit that Gogebic holds the rights to, the first phase calls for a four-mile site to be mined. Tentative plans call for it to be not a single trench, but two separate pits. Any additional mining would require another permitting process and would be decades away -- and only if the company decides it’s worth the effort. And it would not be a single pit, but a series of excavations, Lynch and the company have said. The program also mentions the state law written to make it easier for the company to develop the mine. The law allows the company to fill in streams and ponds providing it re-creates the bodies of water elsewhere, the program notes. Kaufman’s statement on that subject was Mostly True because he left out the important point that a remediation plan would have to be included. Our rating Al Jazeera’s Fault Lines program about the Gogebic mine states that the proposed mine site is ""just up the hill"" from the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore caves. That statement, and the way footage from the caves is interwoven with scenes from the mine site, leaves the unmistakable impression that the mine would be close to the caves. But it’s more than 50 miles from the caves to the mine site. And Al Jazeera officials pledged to edit out the inaccurate statement after we asked about it. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A293300>],/factchecks/2014/jun/23/al-jazeera-america/al-jazeera-america-documentary-says-gogebic-iron-o/

Ed Gillespie says Mark Warner's record is against the Keystone XL pipeline
","Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie says Democratic incumbent Mark Warner voices support for the Keystone XL pipeline but works against it. The crude oil pipeline would extend 1,179 miles from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines that run to Gulf Coast refineries. The privately-built line could carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day. Environmentalists say Keystone would contribute to global warming. Supporters say it would create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Because the pipeline crosses a U.S. border, it must be approved by the U.S. State Department. The department began its review in 2008 and, three years later, determined there would be no significant environmental damage and asked other federal agencies to weigh in. But this April, the department indefinitely delayed its approval until after a challenge to the pipelines route in Nebraska is settled by that state’s courts. In the Senate, pipeline supporters have tried several times during the past two years to pressure the Obama administration to approve the project. After an effort last month was bogged by partisan infighting, Gillespie blasted an email and news release saying of Warner, ""He likes to tell us he supports Keystone Pipeline, but his record is one of acting against it."" We wondered whether Warner, who for years has said he backs Keystone, really does have a record to the contrary. Paul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, said the statement was based on Keystone votes Warner cast in 2012 and this May. Let’s take a look: The 2012 vote Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., on March 8 tried to attach to a highway funding bill an amendment saying that the State Department’s environmental sign-off on the pipeline the previous year satisfied all federal permitting and authorizations needed to start Keystone. The measure, which required 60 votes to proceed, failed 56-42 with Warner voting against it. Warner said then that although he supported Keystone, he thought it should be used as leverage to gain support for a comprehensive energy bill that would include tax incentives for the production of alternative energy. He said, ""...I will not be voting for the Keystone amendment today because, by making this a straight up-or-down issue without taking advantage of the opportunity to put together the beginnings of an energy package, we’re missing a great opportunity."" The 2014 vote On May 12, a Senate deadlock on a bipartisan energy conservation bill appeared to end any chance the the chamber would consider the pipeline before this November’s elections. The legislation -- sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. and Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- would have provided tax incentives for fuel efficiency in commercial buildings, houses and appliances. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., favored the measure but was concerned that senators facing reelection this year would weigh down the bill with amendments for Keystone and other controversial energy policies. So Reid, who opposes the pipeline, made a promise: If the Senate approved the Shaheen-Portman bill without allowing any amendments, he would permit a vote on legislation mandating that the White House move past its environmental reviews of Keystone and order it approved. Republicans, however, offered a series of amendments to the bill that included Keystone and a provision that would prevent the White House from moving forward on new regulations for coal-fired plants. Their efforts were cut off by Reid. Warner joined most Democrats in voting to end debate and allow the unadulterated energy efficiency bill to come up for consideration. But that motion was opposed by Republicans and fell five votes short of the 60 the bill needed to proceed. GOP leaders said the best hope for advancing Keystone was to stitch it into a bill with other energy measures. Democrats dismissed that reasoning, saying President Barack Obama was bound to veto legislation that would have prevented new regulations on carbon emissions -- as Republicans wanted. Gillespie adopts the GOP line and says that Warner, in voting to cut off debate without amendments, voted against the pipeline. ""Reid's purpose in decoupling a Keystone vote from the energy efficiency bill was intended precisely to ensure that it failed,"" said Logan, the campaign’s spokesman. Logan’s comments point to an additional chapter in this story that Gillespie does not publicize: The decoupled Keystone bill that would have come up for vote had the Senate approved energy efficiency bill according to Reid’s demands. Warner was among 55 cosponsors of the bipartisan bill to advance the pipeline. Other Keystone activities  Warner’s campaign sent us list of actions and votes the senator has made in favor of the pipeline: Warner has taken heat from environmentalists for his Keystone actions. Blue Virginia, a pro-Democratic blog, in January 2013 listed Warner among 53 ""sell-outs to big oil"" in the Senate. Protesters have picketed him and his office in Harrisonburg and Richmond.  The League of Conservation Voters gave Mark Warner an 85 percent rating on its scorecard in 2013, a downgrade, partly due to his support of the non-binding Keystone resolution. Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club’s Virginia chapter, told us he considers Warner a solid pipeline supporter. ""He’s not only said he supports the Keystone Pipeline, he’s voted for it, much to our chagrin,"" Besa said. Our ruling Gillespie says Warner’s ""record is one of acting against"" the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2012, Warner did oppose a procedural step that would have allowed a Senate vote on expediting the project. He explained that he even though supported the pipeline, he thought it should be part of a broad energy policy. Even so, its reasonable to count this vote as an action against Keystone. But after that, Gillespie’s claim runs into problems. Each party blames the other for the Senate’s failure to pass pro-Keystone legislation this May. Gillespie’s campaign notes that Warner helped block a GOP effort to amend an energy efficiency bill with a go-ahead for Keystone and a provision that would prevented new carbon emission regulations. On the other hand, Warner co-sponsored a clean bill that would have expedited the pipeline. A review of the record shows Warner voted in favor of a Keystone resolution in 2013. He signed two letters to the president and one to the secretary of state asking them to expedite the project. Many environmentalists put Warner squarely in the Keystone crowd. So we rate Gillespie’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D55240>],/factchecks/2014/jun/23/ed-gillespie/ed-gillespie-says-mark-warners-record-against-keys/

Donna Brazile: No conspiracy here, IRS targeted liberals, too
","A new twist in the Republican case against the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of conservative groups reignited some old claims about the ongoing controversy on this week’s Sunday political shows. Last week, House Republicans grilled IRS Commissioner John Koskinen about emails belonging to former IRS executive Lois Lerner that the agency now says were destroyed when her computer hard drive crashed. Republicans were incensed and said IRS’ explanation didn’t pass the smell test. But during a debate June 22, 2014 on CNN’s State of the Union, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that the most recent Republican outrage is just a distraction. ""The only lie here is to lie that I think conservatives are telling and saying that somehow another this was a conspiracy against conservatives,"" Brazile said. ""(The IRS) also investigated liberal groups, groups that have progressive in their name, groups that had Israel in its name. So the IRS was basically looking at everybody because they were trying to figure out where all of this fake, phony, secretive money was flowing in the last election cycle."" Brazile is echoing comments Democrats have made for a year. But is she right and the IRS was ""basically looking at everybody""? This question was essentially answered last year by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, who investigated the IRS’s handling of tax exempt requests between 2010 and 2012. The controversy starts with an IRS office in Cincinnati, Ohio, that is in charge of reviewing applications for tax-exempt status. Their process includes determining whether the organization is involved in political activities and whether that should impact their tax-exempt status. For example, nonprofit organizations that identify as a 501(c)(4) can engage in ""limited political campaign intervention,"" as long as its not their primary function, meaning, in part, that they can advocate for issues but not for candidates. In March 2010, this IRS office began looking at the tax exempt status of tea party groups. Ten tea party cases were identified and sent to a Washington office for greater scrutiny. IRS officials told investigators that ""tea party"" was used in the office as a catch-all phrase for groups engaging in political activity, and indeed not all 10 groups had ""tea party"" in their names. In August 2010, a formal ""Be on the Lookout"" list was created instructing staff to flag applications of tea party groups. In June 2011, the list was expanded to include the words ""Patriot"" and ""9/12 project,"" a movement started by conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck, and applications with missions to ""make America a better place to live,"" statements that criticized how the country is being run, or groups focused on government spending, debt or taxes. The investigation ultimately found the Cincinnati office used inappropriate criteria to single out certain cases. Over the course of two years, 298 total cases were sent to D.C. for greater scrutiny. According to the investigation, 72 of those groups had the name ""tea party,"" 13 had ""Patriot"" and 11 had ""9/12."" The other 202 cases were listed as ""other."" In 160 of these cases, the application remained open between 206 and 1,138 days, while 108 were approved. Democrats said 202 is a lot of ""other."" And later it came out that the word ""progressive"" was also used to flag applications on another IRS ""Be on the Lookout"" list. Rep. Sandy Levin, D-Mich., the ranking member of the House Ways and Means committee asked Inspector General J. Russell George why he singled out all the mentions of conservative groups, but did not note in his investigation liberal groups were scrutinized as well. George replied that the investigation wasn’t only looking at which groups were flagged. Progressive groups were on a different lookout list that ""did not include instructions on how to refer cases that met the criteria."" However, the lookout list for tea party groups did, and also resulted in delayed processing and unnecessary questioning of those groups, such as inquiries into their donors. George also noted that while 16 groups with ""progressive"" in the name showed up among the 298 cases, that represented just 30 percent of all ""progressive"" applications. That is in stark contrast to groups with ""tea party,"" ""patriot,"" or ""9/12"" in their name, of which 100 percent saw their applications held up. Finally, George said his investigation found ""multiple sources of information corroborating the use of tea party and other related criteria ... we found no indication in any of these other materials that ‘progressives’ was a term used to refer cases for scrutiny for political campaign intervention."" So some progressive and liberal groups may have been flagged, and others may have ended up getting swept in the searches run by the Cincinnati office because their names had certain buzz words or phrases, but they didn’t get put through the ringer, at least on par with tea party groups. Our ruling Brazile said the IRS was ""looking at everybody"" including liberal groups and progressive groups. Yes, some progressive groups did have their tax-exempt status applications flagged as the IRS reviewed whether nonprofit groups were engaging in political activities. But it wasn’t to the same degree as tea party and other conservative groups, nor did it result in the same actions. The list targeting tea party groups resulted in delayed processing that in some cases lasted almost three years and inquiries into their donors. Further, the inspector general found tea party groups were systematically singled out as part of an office-wide effort, while progressive groups were not. Weighing all of this, we rate Brazile’s comments Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979C6580>],/factchecks/2014/jun/22/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-no-conspiracy-here-irs-targeted-libe/

Dick Cheney: Number of terrorists has doubled
","Former Vice President Dick Cheney continued to criticize President Barack Obama over foreign policy during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. While the focus is currently on Iraq and the growing prominence of ISIS, Cheney said Obama’s miscues are broader and potentially dangerous. One statistic that he said supported his point: The sharp rise in the number of terrorists operating worldwide. ""We’ve got a much bigger problem than just the current crisis in Iraq,"" Cheney said. ""The Rand Corporation was out in the last week with a report that showed that there’s been a 58 percent increase in the number of groups like al-Qaida, Salafi-jihadists, and it stretches from West Africa, all across North Africa, East Africa, through the Middle East, all the way around to Indonesia -- a doubling of the number of terrorists out there."" In other words, he said we’ve got ""a hell of a problem."" PunditFact wanted to look into Cheney’s point about the stark rise in the number of terrorists in groups like al-Qaida in recent years. His claim is nearly verbatim the findings of a report released June 2014 and prepared for the Secretary of Defense by the Rand Corporation, a nonpartisan think tank whose work is cited by Democrats and Republicans. The report focused on Salafi-jihadist groups, which are a specific category of militant Sunni Islamists marked by their emphasis on reclaiming a ""pure"" Islam and the belief that violent jihad is required as part of religious duty. The report focused on these groups because most deem the United States an enemy and are willing to kill civilians on a large scale. The findings in the report are based on publicly available documents, such as internal memos, statements and other writings obtained from al-Qaida and other leaders by counterterrorism groups and news organizations like the Associated Press. Members of al-Qaida are an example of Salafi-jihadists, but not all jihadists are considered as part of al-Qaida or as formal members of its affiliates. The group taking over cities in Iraq, ISIS, is no longer part of al-Qaida after leader Ayman al-Zawahiri dismissed them in January 2014. Other groups in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Caucuses may occasionally work with or are allied with al-Qaida but are not members, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, which gained worldwide infamy for kidnapping about 250 Nigerian schoolgirls. Still, others operate as lone wolves inspired by the movement, such as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who shot and killed 13 people in an attack at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, and the Tsaernev brothers who executed the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The report did not include other groups trying to build an Islamic state and presenting a threat to the United States and its interests, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Taliban and Hezbollah, whose religious views are sometimes contradictory to Salafi-jihadists. All that said, the number of Salafi-jihadist groups (al-Qaida, its affiliates, other violent Islamists) jumped 58 percent, as Cheney said, from 31 groups in 2010 to 49 in 2013. The growth primarily happened in North Africa and countries along the Mediterranean Sea, known as the Levant, which includes Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Palestine, Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel. Figuring out how many jihadist fighters that amounts to is tricky, as the groups don’t report their membership and their numbers can fluctuate. Still, the report says the population of fighters more than doubled between 2010 and 2013 looking at estimates both low (under 20,000 fighters to more than 40,000) and high (about 50,000 to more than 100,000). So, while the number of groups has increased 58 percent, the number of fighters in those groups has doubled, the report states. Here's a chart that shows the estimated increase: \ (Source: Rand Corp.) The biggest increase was in Syria amid the rebellion to the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Further, Libya is ""perhaps the most active Salafi-jihadist sanctuary in North Africa"" as a result of groups forming after the killing of its longtime leader, Muammar Qaddafi, wrote Seth Jones, the author of the report and director of Rand’s International Security and Defense Policy Center. Membership has flourished partially because of weak governments in the Middle East and Africa, which not surprisingly has led to more attacks in recent years. Most, though, have been directed locally and not toward the U.S., its embassies or allies. There were roughly 400 attacks carried by al-Qaida and its affiliates in 2010, which rose to more than 900 in 2013, according to Rand. The report classifies the groups among three threat levels to the United States. Those presenting a high threat, meaning they are working on plots that target the United States and its embassies and citizens  abroad, include core al-Qaida, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and ""inspired"" individuals we mentioned earlier. Groups with a ""medium"" threat, or plotting against overseas targets, are al-Shabaab (the Somali group behind the mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya) and Ansar al-Sharia Libya. The big question, of course, is what to do to address it. Jones’ report urged U.S. military leaders to be more aggressive in targeting Salafi-jihadist groups in Syria, home to more than half of the jihadists in the world. The problem is the Assad government is not an ally. He also warns that a complete exit from Afghanistan could backfire by creating ‘breathing space"" for al-Qaida and other groups to regroup and spread. ""The American departure from Afghanistan will most likely be a boost for insurgent and terrorist groups dedicated to overthrowing the Kabul government, establishing an extreme Islamic emirate, and allowing al Qaeda and other groups to establish a sanctuary,"" Jones wrote for the Wall Street Journal. ""As in Iraq, the withdrawal of U.S. troops does not make the terrorism problem go away."" Our ruling Cheney referenced a Rand Corp. report that showed ""a doubling of the number of terrorists out there."" The report he mentions does not look at all terrorism -- just a branch that has the United States and its interests in its crosshairs and is on the rise. We think it’s clear from his comment that he was referencing the report’s finding that members of Salafi-jihadist groups -- who engage in violent jihad activities -- have doubled. That’s true from 2010 to 2013 based on Rand’s low- and high-end estimates.  We rate his statement True. Update (10:45 a.m. June 24): We've updated this item to make more clear that Cheney was talking about the total number of terrorists, not the number of terrorist groups. Our rating remains True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F6FB80>],/factchecks/2014/jun/22/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-number-terrorists-has-doubled/

Perry airs unsupported claim about non-Mexicans apprehended at border hailing from terrorist states
","On the ""Fox & Friends"" program, Gov. Rick Perry bemoaned record-high apprehensions of individuals not from Mexico near the nation’s southern border. Perry then said: ""These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations."" After Perry spoke, we confirmed the U.S. Border Patrol is setting at least a 17-year record for apprehensions near the border of individuals not from Mexico, rating that part of Perry’s statement True. On June 18, 2014, Perry and other state leaders ordered a surge in state spending on border security in the wake of an uptick in unaccompanied minors, many from Central America, crossing the Rio Grande. Is Perry also right that all these apprehended immigrants not from Mexico hail from countries with substantial ties to terrorist regimes and operations? In 2011, we rated as Half True a softer statement by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that in the first 19 months of Barack Obama’s presidency, the U.S. detained people from nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism on the southwestern border. While nearly everyone detained near the border was a Mexican national, Cornyn showed that in the cited period, there were 153 apprehensions of Cubans, 17 of Iranians, seven of Sudanese and two of Syrians. That fact check noted, too, that while an ""apprehension"" is an arrest for being in the United States illegally,  the number of people actually detained will be smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once. When we sought backup for Perry’s 2014 statement, state officials offered no figures. After Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said by email Perry drew on information from the Texas Department of Public Safety, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger replied to us by email: ""On a regular basis, undocumented immigrants from countries with ties to or which sponsor terrorism are being apprehended by Border Patrol."" He later named Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan as such countries, adding that the department had no further response. Terrorist states, safe havens Next, we sought afresh to define a terrorist state, spotting online a U.S. State Department list of four nations ""determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism."" They are Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Another agency web page lists about a dozen countries, as of 2013, considered ""terrorist safe havens,"" which ""include ungoverned, under-governed, or ill-governed physical areas where terrorists are able to organize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, transit, and operate in relative security because of inadequate governance capacity, political will, or both."" These included Somalia, Mali, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Colombia and Venezuela. Countries of origin And how many of the individuals stopped after crossing the border are coming from those countries? We were unable to come up with up-to-date data. By telephone, Dennis Smith, a Del Rio spokesman for the Border Patrol, guided us to a chart in the agency’s ""2012 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics"" indicating dozens of countries of origin for more than 643,000  individuals apprehended in the 12 months through September 2012. We set aside the 448,697 individuals from Mexico, finding that about 7,800 of the apprehended individuals -- 4 percent of the non-Mexican detainees -- hailed either from the U.S.-designated terrorist states or 10 ""safe haven"" countries. Some specifics: Cuba, 4,041 detainees; Iran, 276 individuals; Sudan, 220 individuals; and Syria, 56 individuals. Border Patrol officials didn't offer more recent information. But when we reached out to Megan Mitchell, a Cornyn aide, she emailed us a chart she attributed to a House committee showing countries of origin for the Border Patrol’s 153,055 OTM apprehensions in the 12 months through September 2013. According to the chart, 577, or 0.4 percent of such apprehensions, involved people from the government’s identified terrorist states or safe havens with Colombia accounting for the biggest single share, 457. From Iran, the chart showed, there were 7 apprehensions; from Cuba, 4; from Syria, 2; and from Sudan, 1. Countries with most immigrants removed from U.S. Analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that seeks to reduce immigration, helped us see another way to probe this topic by turning to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency within Homeland Security responsible for deporting people not legally authorized to be in the United States. ICE published a report and chart in December 2013 showing no countries outside the Western Hemisphere ranked among the top 10 countries of origin for immigrants returned to home countries by the U.S. government in the 12 months that ran through September of that year. Alone among them, Colombia is one of the U.S.-designated terrorist havens. In the period, the agency said, ""Mexico continued to be the leading country of origin for those removed"" from the United States, ""followed by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador."" Removed Population by Citizenship* October 2012 through September 2013 Citizenship Total Mexico 241,493 Guatemala 47,769 Honduras 37,049 El Salvador 21,602 Dominican Republic 2,462 Ecuador 1,616 Brazil 1,500 Colombia 1,429 Nicaragua 1,383 Jamaica 1,119 Top 10 Total 357,422   *This counts individuals caught near border and beyond Source: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, December 2013 (accessed June 19, 2014) According to the report, the government removed 90,461 people from countries other than Mexico who had been caught by the Border Patrol after crossing the border--a 27 percent increase from the year before. Around the country, overall, ICE removed 368,644 individuals, the report said. Put another way, the top 10 countries--all but Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica located in Central and South America--accounted for 97 percent of the foreigners removed. By email, Vaughan said her search of an ICE database covering 2013 yielded ""a handful of cases of aliens who had been arrested by the Border Patrol who were citizens of countries linked to terrorism and had crossed the border illegally from Mexico recently.  There were 2 from Nigeria, 3 from Pakistan, 1 from Egypt, 1 from Morocco and 1 from Afghanistan,"" she wrote. ""All were between the ages of 26 and 50."" Generally, Vaughan said, ""some"" border crossers detained by the Border Patrol originated in terrorist states. By phone, she said the majority of OTM apprehensions have long involved people from Central America. Also to our inquiry, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor expert on immigration, questioned Perry’s claim, emailing us charts he made indicating that over the past decade, apprehensions of individuals from non-terrorist states have far outnumbered individuals from terrorist-linked nations. See Massey’s charts here. ""Apprehensions of nationals from potential terrorist nations are not increasing,"" Massey said. Our ruling Speaking of a flood of immigrants from countries other than Mexico being apprehended at the U.S-Mexico border, Perry said, ""These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations."" The latest available data show that less than 5 percent of ""other than Mexican"" apprehensions in the last two completed federal fiscal years involved people from U.S.-designated terrorist states or safe havens. Perry, in contrast, placed all such people being apprehended by U.S. border officials into that category, a conclusion neither the governor or the agency described as his source backed up with evidence.

Texas might grow by 15 million people in 25 years, but it won't be solely because people move there
","A May 2014 video ad opens with the narrator saying: ""One thousand people a day are moving to Texas, which means there will be 15 million more people over the next 25 years. And since people can’t bring their roads with them, that means we’ll have a lot of extra cars without additional driving space."" If only to mull the narrator’s drawl, we recommend you watch the ad from Texas Future, an entity that has surfaced in advance of November 2014 balloting on a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing lawmakers to tap the state’s rainy day fund for road projects. We wondered about the 1,000-a-day statement and the declared link to 15 million more residents within a quarter century. 1,000 additional Texans a day We’re ready to deem ""1,000 people a day move to Texas"" a golden oldie of flawed factoids, because it doesn’t acknowledge people routinely quit the state, too. The state demographer, Lloyd Potter, who we asked about the group’s claim, counseled by phone that more than 1,000 people a day may have moved to Texas from other states and countries from July 2012 through June 2013, but plenty of people also left, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Potter noted by email that net migration over the 12 months -- people moving in less people moving out -- totaled 177,715. ""Dividing that by 365, we estimate that there were on average 487 net migrants to Texas each day,"" Potter emailed. That’s not as high (or catchy) as what Texas Future said. But there’s a way to get to a factually stout rendition of the 1,000 factoid. Overall, Potter and Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman, previously cited the bureau’s Texas estimates to say the state gained an average of 1,061 residents a day over the 12 months -- taking into account net migration as well as births here outpacing deaths. We gathered a slightly longer view of the 1,000-a-day figure from Steve Murdock, a Rice University sociologist and former state demographer and past director of the census bureau. Murdock said by email that per bureau population estimates covering April 2010 through June 2013, Texas added nearly 1,100 people a day with more than half the increase due to births outnumbering deaths. Net migration into Texas from abroad and from other states, he said, accounted for a gain of 515 people a day; births exceeding deaths was responsible for 577 more people a day. Fifteen million additional Texans in 25 years Enough about the first part of this claim; do all the expected additional residents mean there will be 15 million additional residents 25 years from now, as the group says? After our first-pass interviews with Potter and Murdock, a Texas Future spokesman, David Polyansky, said by email the projection of 15 million additional Texans has appeared in state reports including a March 2011 report on transportation by an advisory panel to the Texas Department of Transportation. It refers to 15 million Texans ""projected to arrive over the next 25 years."" We nudged Potter about that. He confirmed such a projection, but cautioned it’s not expected to occur simply due to 1,000 new residents a day. Potter said the state’s projections based on population growth from 2000 to 2010 indicate a potential addition of 15 million residents in about 25 years by assuming that as more people settle in, an escalating number of babies will be born. ""Thus the growth in our population projections is more geometric (or compounding) in nature,"" Potter wrote. In contrast, Potter said, simply adding 1,000 residents a day to the population (as the group’s statement says) reflects ""arithmetic growth, which is substantially slower,"" meaning it would take nearly 39 years to gain 15 million additional residents by this factor alone, he said. Polyansky later agreed the average of 1,000 new Texans a day combines natural population growth as well as in-migration. The ad, he said, ""should be phrased differently,"" though it remains the case more people potentially puts more pressure on the highways. Our ruling Texas Future said: ""One thousand people a day are moving to Texas, which means there will be 15 million more people over the next 25 years."" More than 1,000 people a day move to Texas, but at the same time hundreds leave. Still, the population grows by more than 1,000 a day, though that's mostly due to births outpacing deaths rather than Californians and other out-of-staters parking their Teslas. Another wrinkle: The state demographer agrees the population could grow by 15 million within about 25 years. But contrary to the group’s message, reasons for the potential growth extend beyond the number of people that could flock here from elsewhere. On balance, we rate this claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:40 p.m., June 23, 2014: We revised our quotation of Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, to make it clear what he told us about the effects of net migration and there being more births than deaths in the state.

Mark Pocan says Wisconsin was the first state to ban employment discrimination against all gay and lesbian people
","When the White House announced that President Barack Obama would sign an order barring federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan hailed the move. But Pocan, a Democrat from Madison, thinks a federal law is needed -- one that covers all workers. ""Only 21 states have made it illegal to fire or harass someone based on sexual orientation, or to deny a raise or refuse to hire on that same basis,"" Pocan wrote in a June 16, 2014 press statement. He added: ""Wisconsin has been a leader on this issue, becoming the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1982."" In the wake of a decision  by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb declaring Wisconsin’s ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, we’ve seen that claim about the state’s pioneering role pop up a lot recently. We wondered whether a state that voted in 2006 to ban gay marriages was the first to outlaw job discrimination against gays and lesbians. A look at the history Wisconsin has a history of ""firsts"" on fair employment and worker protection laws dating to early in the 20th century. The state was first on injured worker’s compensation (1911), outlawing legal discrimination against women (1919), unemployment compensation (1932), and protections for handicapped persons (1965), according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. Many cities in the 1970s and early ‘80s, including Milwaukee, enacted local bans on workplace discrimination against gay people at the municipal level. In 1975, Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp, a Democrat, issued the first statewide executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It applied only to state employees. In Wisconsin, Rep. David Clarenbach, a young Democrat from Madison, had spent several years pushing what even gay-rights advocates called a too-radical bill to legalize same-sex marriage, legalize prostitution, lower the age of consent to 14 and legalize consensual sex among unmarried adults. It went nowhere. Then in 1981, Clarenbach introduced an anti-discrimination measure. Unlike the municipal laws and the Pennsylvania statute, it applied to the private sector as well as public workers statewide. Clarenbach framed it as fairness and human rights issue, as recounted in William B. Turner’s  ""The Gay Rights State: Wisconsin’s Pioneering Legislation to Prohibit Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation."" ""The point is not whether homosexuality is admirable, but whether discrimination is tolerable,"" Clarenbach said during the debate. The bill squeaked through the Assembly by four votes in 1981; Democrats dominated the majority, though it was Republican votes that helped put it over the top. Critics said it could lead to affirmative action advantages for lesbians and gay men. Republican Gov. Lee Dreyfus and others insisted on language banning such affirmative action, and the bill cleared the Senate in early 1982. Many mainstream religious denominations backed the overall bill, Dreyfus noted at the time. Fundamentalist Christian radio listeners mounted a campaign to pressure Dreyfus into a veto, but the governor signed what was termed Chapter 112 into law on Feb. 25, 1982. ""I have decided to sign this bill for one basic reason, to protect one's right to privacy,"" Dreyfus said in his signing statement.  ""As one who believes in the fundamental Republican principle that government should have a very restricted involvement in people's private and personal lives, I feel strongly about governmentally sanctioned inquiry into an individual's thoughts, beliefs and feelings."" He added: ""Discrimination on sexual preference, if allowed, clearly must allow inquiries into one's private life that go beyond reasonable inquiry and in fact invade one's privacy."" Republican Tommy Thompson, who later served as governor, was minority  leader in the state Assembly during the 1982 debate. Clarenbach later remarked that Thompson opposed the anti-discrimination bill but nonetheless kept it alive by declining to smother it in amendments, according to Turner. States followed suit The result was a law that banned discrimination against gays not only in employment but housing and public accommodations as well. Wisconsin was first, and it would be seven years before Massachusetts followed suit. Today, 21 states have such employment measures, according to the American Civil Liberties Union and other sources. Most were enacted from 1991 to 2002. Those states are clustered in three regions: West (Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico); the upper Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois); and East ( Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland). Hawaii is the other. Of the states on the list, Wisconsin is one of three that does not cover gender identity in its law. That leaves transgender people out of the law, something Pocan and Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin hope to remedy through the proposed Employer Non-Discrimination Act. Pocan, who is gay, won the congressional seat formerly held by Baldwin, who became the Senate’s first openly gay member in 2012. That bill would make discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender illegal in all 50 states. It passed the U.S. Senate in November 2013 on a 64-32 vote but has not cleared the Republican-controlled House. Our rating Pocan claimed Wisconsin was the ""first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation."" The history books say he is correct. While some municipalities did so earlier, and Pennsylvania did so for public workers only, Wisconsin’s 1982 law was statewide and  covered all employees.

U.S. Sen. Jack Reed says a proposal to restore emergency unemployment benefits was ""fully paid for.""
","When the recession hit, federal unemployment benefit coverage was temporarily expanded to as long as 73 weeks, depending on the state. When that expansion expired on Dec. 28, 2013, the maximum dropped back to 26 weeks. The U.S. Senate, controlled by Democrats, subsequently voted to restore emergency benefits for five months, through the end of May. That proposal languished in the Republican-controlled  House and was considered dead, especially now that it would no longer benefit those added to the unemployment rolls as of June 1. But Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), a strong advocate for restoring those extended benefits, said earlier this month that there's still a push to extend them, although not retroactively. One of Reed's arguments, made repeatedly on the floor of the Senate in speeches on April 10 and May 1, and during a May 1 news conference, was that the original proposal was ""fully paid for."" With the U.S. government in debt to the tune of $17.5 trillion -- that's $55,000 for every man, woman and child in the U.S. -- one could question whether anything in the current $3.5 trillion federal budget would be fully paid for, especially when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was projecting a shortfall of $492 billion for the current fiscal year. Question: So if the proposal was ""fully paid for,"" how would the government have covered the $9.9 billion cost of extending the benefits for five months? Answer: With extra tax revenue collected over the next 10 years. When we contacted Reed's office, spokesman Chip Unruh sent us an analysis from the CBO. Aaron Hernandez, a senior policy adviser for Reed, walked us through the complicated plan. Most of the immediate revenue -- $1.7 billion just this year -- would have come from giving companies the option to lower the amount of money they have to pay into their pension plans over the short term. Therefore, that would leave more money in profit for the feds to tax. In theory, by the 2017 fiscal year, more than enough would have been collected to cover the cost of Reed's legislation. However in subsequent years, those companies would have to pay extra into their pension plans to catch up, producing less taxable income and a loss of revenue for the federal government, beginning in 2020. To compensate for that, the legislation called for a one-year extension of customs fees that were set to expire nine years from now. The feds would have, in essence, extended that tax to 2024 and use the revenue to directly cover the long-term costs of fiddling with the pension payment system. Unruh, Reed's spokesman, said the senator ""is 100 percent correct in saying that it's fully paid for"" when all the revenue is taken into consideration under Washington's rules for balancing out changes to the budget. Reed, he said, made it clear in an April 2 floor speech that the payment would have been spread out over 10 years. But we note that in the two speeches and one news conference we saw, Reed repeatedly asserted that the bill ""is fully paid for,"" making no reference to how the cost would be covered or how long it would take. We asked some budget experts what they thought of the explanation from Reed's office. ""When people think about things being paid for, they think about making difficult choices,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, which monitors budget issues. But when that phrase is used in Washington, he said, ""it's not in the sense of, 'I've got to fix my roof so I'm not buying the flat screen TV.'"" Reed ""has the offsets, and according to the CBO it's paid for. But that's not the whole truth here. He's spending money today and promising to pay for it many years from now,"" he said. ""It's a gimmick."" Joshua Smith, a senior policy analyst with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that supported extending the benefits, put it in different terms. ""It's technically true, but it's only technically true as long as you understand how CBO does budget scoring,"" Smith said. ""They use a window that is 10 years long, so if it doesn't cost money over 10 years, it doesn't add to the deficit."" ""It's true in Washingtonese. Members of both parties have been doing exactly the same thing for a long time, saying things are fully paid for if they are paid for within the 10-year window,"" said Smith. ""The bill does attempt to cover its costs, unlike some things that are going through Congress now, such as unpaid-for corporate tax breaks."" Chris Edwards, economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, called the funding plan ""a classic example of phony Washington smoke and mirrors accounting,"" that is all too common by both parties in Washington. ""The biggest joke is the customs fees -- three and a half billion dollars, 10 years from now, in a single year,"" he noted. ""The lobby groups have 10 years to work to reverse that particular fee, and they probably will."" Leonard Lardaro, professor of economics at the University of Rhode Island, called the funding plan ""really murky."" The accounting assumes revenue that may not be there over the years, he said, calling the savings ""speculative."" Our ruling Jack Reed repeatedly said that the Senate proposal to restore expanded unemployment benefits ""is fully paid for."" He didn't say it would be paid for in the future. He made it sound like it HAD been paid for, presumably through immediate savings or new taxes. You can't say ""my house is paid for"" when you've just taken out a 10-year loan from the bank to pay off your mortgage. If the unemployment insurance extension had passed, Congress wouldn't have given up the flat screen TV to pay for roof repairs. It would have bought both, and done it with a cash advance on a credit card that is already maxed beyond the ability to pay. Reed's statement may be technically accurate in the world of Washington budgeting.

Scott Walker says probe into his campaign finances is ""resolved""
","A secret criminal investigation made national news with the disclosure that prosecutors had alleged Gov. Scott Walker was at the center of an effort to illegally coordinate fundraising among conservative groups to help his campaign and others. But the next day, the Republican governor and potential 2016 presidential candidate said the John Doe probe had been resolved and that two judges had said it was ""over."" Here is part of the June 20, 2014 interview of Walker by Steve Doocy, host of the network TV talk show ""Fox & Friends"": Doocy: ""So, over the last couple of years, there’s been some legal action out in Wisconsin. And some of the documents were unsealed yesterday. We’ve got to point out, you were never charged with anything. But at one point, they allege that you had a central role in a criminal fund-raising scheme. OK, tell us what you did."" Walker: ""Well, don’t just take my word for it. Look at the facts. The facts are pretty clear. ""You’ve had not one but two judges -- a state judge and a federal judge; a state judge (who is) a well-respected court of appeals judge, and a federal judge more recently -- have both looked at this argument. And in the past, not just recently -- remember this is not new news, it’s just newly released yesterday because documents were opened -- but no charges, case over. ""Both judges said they didn’t buy the argument. They didn’t think that anything was done that was illegal, and so they’ve gone forward and not only said, we don’t buy it, they actually shut the case down, both at the state and at the federal level. ""So, many in the national media and even some here in Wisconsin are looking at this (case) backwards. This is a case that’s been resolved, that not one but two judges have said is over. And we’re just learning about it because it became open in a document yesterday. But there is no argument there."" Is that it? Is Walker right that the Doe case has been ""resolved"" and two judges have said it is ""over""? Experts say no. After all, one of the key court rulings that has stalled the investigation is a ""preliminary injunction."" And that is on appeal. What’s the case about? Under Wisconsin law, a John Doe is ""intended as an independent, investigatory tool to ascertain whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom."" Unlike standard criminal investigations, law enforcement officials in a John Doe have special powers, including the power to compel the testimony of reluctant witnesses under oath and to issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to turn over documents. Another key difference is that the judge overseeing a Doe can -- and typically does -- order that the proceedings be done in secret, unlike the vast majority of court proceedings. Walker has been connected to two John Doe investigations. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, conducted a wide-ranging probe of aides and associates to Walker going back to Walker's time as Milwaukee County executive. That investigation, sometimes known as John Doe I, led to six convictions, ranging from misconduct in office for campaigning on county time to stealing from a veterans fund. Walker was not charged, and that investigation was shut down in March 2013. Before closing that probe, however, Chisholm launched a separate investigation in the summer of 2012 based on information learned in the first one. To get what has been termed John Doe II off the ground, Chisholm worked with district attorneys from four counties -- members of both parties -- and the state Government Accountability Board, which administers the state's elections and ethics laws. Francis Schmitz, a former assistant U.S. attorney and self-described Republican, was named special prosecutor in the case. Walker’s evidence Alleigh Marre, spokeswoman for Walker’s campaign, cited two court documents to back Walker’s claim. It’s not clear what she was referring to in the first document, a December 2013 court filing by Schmitz, and she didn’t respond to our request to elaborate. The second document was a court order that John Doe Judge Gregory Peterson issued on Jan. 10, 2014. It quashed subpoenas that had been issued to Walker’s campaign and several conservative groups. And it ordered the return of any property seized with those subpoenas or with search warrants served on two officials of the groups. But the order did not resolve the case. Indeed, in his order, Peterson made reference to the possibility of his ruling be appealed. And the order has been challenged and is awaiting a ruling from the state Court of Appeals. Other legal action Another key ruling was made in federal court, by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Randa. In February 2014, the conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth and one of its directors, Eric O'Keefe sued in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee in an attempt to stop the Doe investigation, saying it violated their rights to free speech, free association and equal protection under the law. Three months later, Randa issued a preliminary injunction halting the probe while he considered the lawsuit. He said it appeared prosecutors were violating the First Amendment rights of Club for Growth and O'Keefe. And he ordered prosecutors to return any material they had gathered in the investigation and destroy whatever copies of it they had made. But as the term ""preliminary injunction"" would indicate, that did not mean the case had been resolved or was over. Indeed, Randa’s ruling has been appealed and the parties are awaiting a decision from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. Experts weigh in We consulted five attorneys who have represented multiple clients in criminal John Doe investigations -- Madison defense attorneys Marcus Berghahn and Stephen Morgan (Morgan is a former state and federal prosecutor); Milwaukee defense attorneys Jeremy Levinson, who also handles campaign finance cases for Democrats, and Raymond Dall’Osto; and Marquette University Law School professor and former state prosecutor Daniel Blinka. Bottom line: The John Doe investigation case has been stopped for the time being, but it has not been resolved. The rulings by judges Peterson and Randa are not final and are being appealed. The appellate rulings could also be appealed. And if the Chicago appeals panel overrules Randa, the investigation can resume. ""Once the Court of Appeals decides the merits of the case and if no party appeals the Court of Appeals’ decision, then it may be possible to say that the cases are over -- unless the case is returned to the trial court or John Doe Judge for further litigation,"" said Berghahn. Said Blinka: ""The governor's remark overlooks the role of the appellate courts. The final resolution is up to the appellate courts, and only when the appellate process has run its course will we have a final resolution."" It’s notable that at times during his governorship, Walker has been in the position of supporting appeals when a lower-court ruling has gone against him. In 2012, when judges struck down parts of Walker’s Act 10 -- the law ending most collective bargaining for most public employees -- the state appealed, and higher courts so far have upheld the law. And on same-sex marriage, which Walker opposes, he didn’t concede that a ban on gay marriages was dead when a federal judge found Wisconsin’s ban unconstitutional. Indeed, he’s backing the state’s appeal of the judge’s ruling. Similarly, the status of the Doe case is being hammered out in the appeals process. Our rating Walker said the secret John Doe criminal investigation of his campaign has been ""resolved"" and two judges have said it is ""over."" His characterization is misleading at best. The investigation has been stopped, for now, under one judge’s ruling. But the second ruling, while a serious blow, did not end the probe, and in any event prosecutors have appealed the two rulings Walker mentioned. We rate Walker’s statement False.

"['Oregon', 'Guns', 'Monica Wehby']","
Will the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty infringe on our right to keep and bear arms?
","From universal background checks to limits on magazine capacities, gun-control proposals are among the surest ways to stir controversy. Some Second Amendment activists are convinced there is yet another threat to gun ownership that comes not from the U.S. government but from the United Nations. The claim: U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby, a Republican, is running against Oregon’s Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley. On her website, Wehby addresses gun ownership, singling out a U.N. proposal long been opposed by the National Rifle Association and many other pro-gun groups. She promises to oppose the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, her statement says, because it ""infringes upon our right to keep and bear arms."" If adopted, would it have that effect in the U.S.? We decided to check. The analysis: We emailed Wehby’s campaign and asked how this U.N. treaty would affect gun ownership in the United States. Michael Antonopoulos, the candidate’s new campaign manager, replied: ""Dr. Wehby is an unapologetic defender of second amendment rights and will always oppose any effort (to) infringe on them when she is in the Unites States Senate."" He added that nine Democratic senators share Wehby’s concerns about the treaty but provided no additional information on how the treaty itself would infringe on U.S. gun rights. We checked PolitiFact National’s database for some background on what the treaty is and what it does. The formally named Arms Trade Treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, was adopted by the U.N.’s General Assembly on April 2, 2013. The vote was 154 in favor, three opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it, with North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed. The treaty requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms, PolitiFact Virginia found. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. It has no enforcement power, but backers hope it will create common standards for international trade of weapons. To take effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. To date, it has been ratified by 36. So does it contain language that would somehow infringe on gun-ownership rights of U.S. citizens, as Wehby’s website claims? The pact’s preamble affirms ""the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system."" We emailed the U.S. State Department and asked for its position on the treaty. Press officer Drew Bailey sent us a synopsis, which included this point: ""Nothing in the Arms Trade Treaty is inconsistent with the rights of U.S. citizens, including those protected by the Second Amendment."" Some pro-gun advocates, however, remain unconvinced. The conservative Heritage Foundation, for instance, has called for hearings into the Arms Trade Treaty and its potential reach. The group also notes, correctly, that a Senate majority, including some Democrats, opposes ratifying the pact. The National Rifle Association issued a statement after Secretary of State John Kerry signed the treaty saying it ""threatens individual firearm ownership and an invasive registration scheme."" Despite all signs to the contrary, the NRA and other groups opposed to the treaty insist it will create a slippery slope leading to a national gun registry. However, previous PolitiFact checks don’t back that up. PolitiFact Georgia, in an Aug. 12, 2012 story, interviewed legal experts and concluded, ""...even in the unlikely event that the U.N. creates a treaty that provides for domestic registries and the U.S. Senate ratifies it, it would not 'almost certainly force' the U.S. to create one,"" as a Georgia congressman had alleged. The ruling: Oregon Republican U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby’s website, in addressing the Second Amendment, says she opposes an international arms treaty passed by the U.N., and signed by the United States, because it ""infringes on our right to keep and bear arms."" A Wehby spokesman did not elaborate on how or why any infringement could come about, but did restate the candidate’s support for the Second Amendment. He did not return phone calls or emails asking exactly how the treaty would infringe on the gun rights of U.S. citizens Previous fact-checks looking at this claim found it lacked merit. Language in the treaty itself specifically leaves gun-control and ownership decisions up to member nations. The claim is all flash and no powder. We rate it False.

No, Eric Schneiderman didn't sell child sex slaves to Clintons
","After New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman stepped down amid allegations that he abused women, a story without any evidence circulated on Facebook that he covered up a sex cult.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! Schneiderman resigned May 7 following a report by The New Yorker that four women accused him of physical assault. He denied the allegations. The NY Evening News story said, ""Schneiderman used his position as Attorney General to cover-up the crimes of NXIVM – a cult recently exposed as selling child sex slaves to the Clintons."" The criminal case about the sex cult NXIVM (pronounced Nex-e-um) is real, although the NY Evening News story makes up details. We previously rated a claim that defendant Allison Mack, an actress on the TV show Smallville, sold sex slaves to the Clintons as Pants on Fire. Mack and co-defendant Keith Raniere face real federal charges for sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. Both have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere. The victims were then exploited, including sexually. We searched news accounts for connections between Schneiderman’s office and the case. In March, Schneiderman’s office filed a court case asking a judge to order Brandon B. Porter, a medical doctor who conducted controversial research on behalf of NXIVM, to turn over records related to studies. The case also asked Clare F. Bronfman, heiress to Seagram and NXIVM operations director, to turn over records. But Schneiderman’s office suspended the state investigation after the March 25 arrest of Raniere on federal charges. A 2017 story by the Albany Times-Union said that law enforcement had fielded complaints about NXIVM for years and that Schneiderman’s office had begun to examine dealings. ""The new interest comes after multiple law enforcement agencies, including Schneiderman's office, had for years brushed aside the concerns from Raniere's critics and others about the murky inner workings of NXIVM, which one expert has characterized as an 'extreme cult,' "" the Times-Union wrote.

Did Heidi Heitkamp cast 'deciding' vote on rule for energy industry?
","North Dakota Senate hopeful Kevin Cramer called out incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp for targeting North Dakota’s energy industry. Cramer, a Republican in the U.S. House, told Hugh Hewitt during a radio interview that Heitkamp, a Democrat, ""cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota."" Cramer was referring to a vote to repeal a rule from former President Barack Obama’s Bureau of Land Management that places limits on the amount of methane gas that can be burned off or flared at drilling sites. (When oil is extracted, raw natural gas is also brought to the surface, so plants without the technology to harness the gas flare it.) We wondered whether Heitkamp had indeed cast the deciding vote for a rule targeting North Dakota’s oil industry. It’s hard to say there is ever such a thing as ""the deciding vote"" with close calls in Congress. And Cramer is overplaying the rule’s impact on North Dakota. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! The Methane and Waste Production Rule was put in place in Obama's tenure and had not yet been implemented when President Donald Trump took office. The vehicle for repeal was the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to overturn regulations by federal agencies with a simply majority within 60 legislative days of their issue dates.   Republicans held a 52-48 edge in the Senate, and needed only a majority to repeal the rule. But the motion was defeated 49-51 on May 10, 2017. Every independent and Democrat (including Heitkamp) opposed it, joined by three Republicans —Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, and John McCain of Arizona. Heitkamp's vote indeed was pivotal. She and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., were still publicly undecided on the morning of the vote. There’s no doubt that Heitkamp’s vote was crucial. But as we have concluded in fact-checks of similar attacks, the ""deciding vote"" label could just as easily be applied to other lawmakers who voted no — making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the narrowly passed Affordable Care Act, for example.) Heitkamp’s campaign argued there was a deciding vote, however, and it was McCain. ""One person surprised everybody,"" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told Roll Call of McCain’s vote against the CRA. ""I was very certain the votes were there because we wouldn’t bring it up if the votes weren’t there."" ""In talking to folks, they were kind of going back and forth, undecided and then lean yes,"" John Hoeven, North Dakota’s Republican senator, told Roll Call. ""And so we actually thought we had just enough. But as it turns out, we lost three, and we didn’t get any help from the Democrats."" Cramer said the rule was designed just for North Dakota. It was not. It targets flaring on all federal lands. The idea is that because the federal government receives royalties on federally owned fossil fuels, wasted methane equals lost government revenue. Republicans worried the rule was an unfair burden that would disincentivize producers. Tim Rasmussen, Cramer’s spokesman, clarified the senator was referring to the rule’s disproportionate effect on the state. ""I would say it's designed for North Dakota because North Dakota has, over the course of this energy renaissance, the highest rates of flared natural gas in the country, BLM mineral ownership in the state making it applicable (unlike, say Texas), and just simply a widely reported on and discussed topic in the state (just like the Waters of the U.S. and Clean Power Plan),"" Rasmussen said. The law indeed impacts North Dakota for these reasons. But Alexandra Teitz, one of the rule’s architects, said the rule’s flaring requirements were modeled after and designed to defer to rules in place in North Dakota, which unlike other states, was already addressing the issue. Both the existing North Dakota state regulations and the bureau's rule required operators to submit gas capture plans with their applications to drill, meet monthly gas capture targets, and allowed them to exclude some flaring from the gas capture targets. In addition, the rule included a key provision that allowed state requirements to substitute for the rule's requirements, if a state showed that their requirements would perform just as well in reducing waste. The bureau included this provision to avoid overlapping regulations in states that were already effectively addressing the issue. As the only state with detailed flaring requirements similar to the federal department, North Dakota would have been the ideal candidate for this provision. Other bureau requirements to reduce leaks and venting would likely have stayed in place, as North Dakota has few requirements targeting those sources of waste. Teitz said that the rule would have also helped clarify regulation of flaring on tribal lands, which has been subject to some confusion. Heitkamp did express concern with the legislation and suggested alongside Manchin in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke that it be reviewed. They wrote that the rule included some Indian lands that were not federal lands and had the potential to provide more royalties without declining oil production. Cramer said Heitkamp ""cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota."" There’s no question that Heitkamp’s vote on the repeal of the Methane and Waste Production Rule was crucial, but saying hers was the deciding vote goes too far. McCain was a last-minute holdout who bucked the majority of his party. As for its impact on North Dakota, oil is a big industry and flaring a big issue, but the rule doesn’t only target North Dakota. In fact, it mirrors already existing regulations with regards to flaring, while adding related provisions and strengthening oversight. It’s also possible that North Dakota’s own rules on flaring could supercede the federal regulations.

The bullets create cavities through the victim, wrecking a wider swath of tissue, organs and blood vessels. And a low-recoil weapon with a higher-capacity magazine means more of these deadlier bullets can be fired accurately and quickly without reloading."" Swalwell said that reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would still leave millions of assault weapons on the streets. ""Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons,"" he wrote.

Donate now to our Spring Campaign and go on the record as saying facts matter! In 2017, the last year for which complete data is available, defense spending stood at $590 billion. Net interest on the debt stood at $263 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress. So defense spending is currently more than twice as big as net interest. However, net interest is expected to grow faster than defense spending over the next decade. That’s according to CBO’s most recent Budget and Economic Outlook report, which projects a variety of budget categories 10 years into the future. (See Fig. 2.1 here.) Between 2018 and 2028, CBO projects, both defense and interest will rise, with interest overtaking defense spending in fiscal year 2023. In 2023, defense spending will be $679 billion and net interest will reach $702 billion. The gap will only grow from there. So CBO has it one year later than Manchin said. That said, things could change between now and then — and CBO’s assumptions are not the only way to make these projections. CBO’s projections assume that defense spending will return to tighter levels in 2020, after the current spending bill expires, said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. However, Congress has regularly raised the spending limits since they were first imposed in 2011. And if Congress acts as it has in the past, that would change the calculations. However, CBO does not specify the amounts under this alternative assumption, so that scenario is too speculative to consider. Manchin said, ""By 2022, just the interest payment on our debt will be greater than the defense of our country."" The closest official estimate we could find says that net interest will pass defense spending in 2023, or one year later than Manchin said. But using a different set of unofficial assumptions, it could be different.

How much money do welders, pipefitters make? Adam Putnam says it’s huge
","It’s no secret that Adam Putnam, Republican candidate for governor, is a fan of technical and vocational training. But what is a secret, according to Putnam, is how much money people make after getting the training. ""Nobody is telling our students that welders are coming out of their tech schools at $28 an hour,"" Putnam said at the Florida Family Policy Council forum in Orlando on May 5. ""They're not telling them that pipefitters are making six figures while their friends are getting a degree in European art history with $70,000 in student loan debt."" Putnam isn’t the first Florida politician to talk up technical training and throw shade at students majoring in philosophy or anthropology (looking at you, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott). Was Putnam correct about how much welders and pipefitters make after graduating from technical schools? The answer depends on the type of school a student attends and the chosen industry after graduation. The more training you get, the more money you can make. And getting to the $28 an hour and six-figures mark that Putnam references usually applies to people who get additional certifications. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective, factual reporting reporting on issues that matter.

Donate now to our Spring Campaign and go on the record as saying facts matter! Putnam said welders coming out of technical school make $28 an hour. Putnam spokeswoman Amanda Bevis pointed to several welder job postings in Florida that offer $17 to $30, or $27 to $35 an hour, depending on experience. Reaching the top end of the salary range, however, requires additional training and certifications. It isn’t the typical salary for someone paid right out of 12 to 15 months or the typical training at trade schools. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for welders, cutters, solderers and brazers is $40,240 — about $19 an hour. The top 10 percent of welders earn $63,170, which is roughly $30.37. Debbie Hoy, program adviser at Erwin Technical College in Hillsborough County, said prospective welders who complete their program can make anywhere between $12 an hour up to $20 an hour right away. And at Manatee Technical College, a person who completed welding school can expect to make $15 to $20 starting out, said Gary Martin, a welding instructor. Once in the field, he said, there is the potential to make $28 an hour after completing additional certifications. For example, a welder can complete an education certification or engineering certification. Jack Jarrell, the business manager of Iron Workers Local 397 Union in Tampa, said if a person completes four years of training with the union, they can make up to $32 an hour. (Benefits not included, the pay is around $24.50 an hour). Going the union route is different than the technical schooling Putnam referred to. Still, Jarrell emphasized that the pay rate really depends on the industry someone enters after training, as some industries can afford to pay people more. ""If you are building trailers in Perry, Fla., ($28/an hour) ain’t happening,"" Jarrell said. ""But if you are working for a Tropicana factory, yeah I could see that."" Are pipefitters making six-figures, as Putnam said? Pipefitters install, assemble and maintain pipes that carry various fluids, solids and/or gases. Welder and pipefitters are two separate careers, though some welders may be pipefitters and vice versa. Like welding, there are a wide range of career options for pipefitters and different avenues to become a professional. Careers include plumber, boilermaker and steamfitter. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters is $52,590, or $25.28 per hour. The top 10 percent of workers earned more than $91,810. While the top-earner estimate is just shy of the six-figure amount Putnam referenced, the industry professionals said they had anecdotal examples of a pipefitter making at least $100,000. Again, it depends on the industry, level of certification and the amount of ovettime a person works.  Martin said someone who completes the advanced program at Manatee Technical College, which is geared toward pipefitting, can expect to make $22 an hour starting out. But, it’s possible they can make up to $120,000 a year. Putnam said ""welders are coming out of their tech schools at $28 an hour"" and ""pipefitters are making six figures."" It’s unlikely someone just starting out as a welder or pipefitter will make as much as Putnam said. That said, people who work in the industry say it’s possible to make that much depending on the industry you choose and the amount of training you get. Putnam's figures are overstated for young workers in those fields.

Is 'illegal alien' a legal term in federal law?
","An exchange between a legislator and the leader of Texas’ state law enforcement agency made us wonder whether federal law uses ""illegal alien"" to describe any individual living in the U.S. without legal authorization. It doesn’t, we learned, though the term makes a few appearances. Many news organizations avoid the ""IA"" term. In 2013, the Associated Press dropped ""illegal immigrant"" from its stylebook. AP spokesman Paul Colford said then that ""illegal"" should be used to describe actions, not people, and the AP counseled journalists against using ""illegal alien"" except in direct quotations. We recognize, though, that ""illegal alien"" persists. The term showed up 80 times in our May 2018 Google search of the PolitiFact website with ""illegal aliens"" popping up 5,620 times. Let’s unpack what touched off this fact-check, then turn to ""illegal alien"" in American law. West Texas legislator questions director At an April 18, 2018, Texas House hearing, state Rep. Mary González, D-San Elizario, elicited agreement from Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, that the words that ""we choose to use"" are powerful. González then told McCraw she ""had concerns about the language that you use and the agency is using in talking about undocumented immigrants. If we’re talking about children, for example, unaccompanied minors, then using words like ‘illegal aliens,’ I have had a concern about that, right?"" she said. ""And so but then, in your testimony you used it again. And so I’m guessing, my question is, is the agency standard in typically referring to undocumented immigrants as IAs?"" McCraw answered: ""I always use ‘illegal aliens’ and I have when I was assigned to the Department of Justice, when I worked at the FBI, when I was assigned as the director of the foreign terrorism task force because it’s a term, it’s a legal term, it’s in statute, it’s a federal term--and it’s not intended to degrade anybody in any way, shape or form."" McCraw spent 21 years with the FBI before becoming director of Texas DPS, the state law-enforcement agency known for its state troopers and Texas Rangers. González replied that people ""in my community"" would find it ""very concerning to use this language."" McCraw answered that he’d consult DPS staff and ""re-evaluate the use of words that their director has been using to describe, I’ve been consistent about that. And it it’s insulting, if it truly is insulting, I don’t intend to insult anybody."" We later asked the DPS to elaborate on McCraw’s claim that ""illegal aliens"" appears in statute. We didn’t hear back. Checking for ‘illegal alien’ in federal law Given McCraw's singling out of federal statutes, we launched our post-testimony look by searching the portion of federal law titled ""Aliens and Nationality,"" and saw that the chapter titled ""Immigration and Nationality"" defines the word ""alien"" alone as ""any person not a citizen or national of the United States."" But in the same ""Definitions"" section, we spotted ""illegal"" just once--and not in the context suggested by the DPS director’s testimony. ""Illegal"" appears in a section stating that an ""alien"" lawfully given permanent residency shall not be regarded as seeking U.S. entry in connection with the country’s immigration laws unless the ""alien"" has, among possibilities, ""engaged in illegal activity after having departed"" the United States. Another portion of the law says the U.S. attorney general ""shall have the power and duty to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the illegal entry of aliens."" Our scrolling of the act also picked up a mention of ""illegal entrants"". Federal agency offers examples We separately heard back from Arwen FitzGerald of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. By email, FitzGerald pointed to four uses of ""illegal alien,"" two in federal law and the others in a congressional act. Section 1252(c) of the ""Aliens and Nationality"" laws is titled: ""Authorizing State and local law enforcement officials to arrest and detain certain illegal aliens."" The section authorizes state and local law enforcement officials ""to arrest and detain an individual who— (1) is an alien illegally present in the United States; and (2) has previously been convicted of a felony in the United States and deported or left the United States after such conviction."" Section 1365, titled ""Reimbursement of States for costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and certain Cuban nationals,"" applies to any alien convicted of a felony who’s in the country unlawfully and whose most recent entry ""was without inspection, or whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or whose unlawful status was known to the government."" FitzGerald also pointed out that a section of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 authorized the hiring of 25 new federal lawyers to ""prosecute persons who bring into the United States or harbor illegal aliens or violate other criminal statutes involving illegal aliens."" Also noted: A section of the act requiring an annual report detailing ""the number of illegal aliens"" sentenced or jailed for felonies in state and federal prisons. That act, we saw, relies on the established definition of ""alien"" spotted earlier. It doesn’t explicitly define ""illegal alien,"" though by our count, the term appears nine times including in a section titled ""Demonstration project for identification of illegal aliens in incarceration facility of Anaheim, California"" and a section titled ""Pilot programs on limiting issuance of driver’s licenses to illegal aliens."" Experts: Mentions don’t mean much By email, though, academic experts on immigration law told us such scattered mentions of ""illegal alien"" in legislation and law don’t mean much. Denise Gilman, who directs the University of Texas immigration law clinic, pointed out that all but one of the term’s mentions in the 1996 act appear in section titles, not intended statutory language. ""The title is a political marker in the legislation but is not the law itself,"" Gilman wrote.  ""For example, the section titled ‘PILOT PROGRAMS ON LIMITING ISSUANCE OF DRIVER'S LICENSES TO ILLEGAL ALIENS,’ goes on to use legal terms in the actual text,"" Gilman wrote, which refers only to ""aliens who are not lawfully present"" in the United States. Notably, Rick Su of the University of Buffalo School of Law told us, the ""IA"" term doesn’t appear in the vast Immigration and Nationality Act, the nation’s main immigration law. Su acknowledged that the term appears in the 1996 act’s section about the federal government reimbursing states for incarcerating certain immigrants. But that section, Su said, defines an ""illegal alien"" solely in the context of the section -- as ""any alien convicted of a felony who is in the United States unlawfully and -- (1) whose most recent entry into the United States was without inspection, or (2) whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and -- (A) whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or (B) whose unlawful status was known to the Government, before the date of the commission of the crime for which the alien is convicted."" In contrast, Su told us, ""illegal alien"" has been commonly used to refer to immigrants simply present in the U.S. without a valid visa or legal status, or whose legal status expired or is terminated. More prevalent terms in federal law, Su said, include ""inadmissible aliens"" or ""unauthorized aliens."" Su wrote that ""inadmissible aliens"" and ""deportable aliens"" are different individuals under the INA, and have specific criteria, he said, with ""inadmissible aliens"" probably ""closest to how the term ‘illegal aliens’ is commonly used (federal law treats those who enter without inspection to be construed as not having been ‘admitted’),"" Su wrote. All this said, Su said, other government documents--including memos, directives and reports--use ""illegal alien."" The Supreme Court also has used the term, Su said. He singled out the court’s rulings in De Canas v. Bica, a case decided in 1976 about California governing the hiring of ""illegal aliens."" Su also noted Arizona v. U.S. in which the court in 2012 upheld parts of Arizona’s 2010 immigration law. That opinion employs ""illegal alien"" twice in quoting others and twice in speculation about how Arizona might enforce its law. To our inquiry about McCraw’s claim, Jeff Baker of the Pepperdine School of Law summed up: ""The term ‘alien’ is common in the United States Code and in U.S. law, although the term ‘illegal alien’ is very rare in the statutes. In the Code, ‘alien’ typically means someone who is not a citizen, and, despite the current political uses and preferences (including my own), this is fairly common. I do not know when ‘alien’ entered the law with this usage,"" Baker wrote, but he noted that President John Adams ""signed the very controversial Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798."" Baker went on: ""That was not the ‘Illegal Alien and Sedition Acts,’ however."" Personally, Baker told us, he favors ""other language in our national discourse. ‘Alien’ may be a technical term of art, but ‘illegal alien’ is almost always pejorative in contemporary usage."" State laws Finally, we searched Texas laws and the state constitution on the Texas Legislature’s website and didn’t find ""illegal alien"" or ""illegal aliens"" though we saw multiple provisions specifying how laws apply to aliens. Our ruling McCraw told legislators the term ""illegal alien"" is ""a legal term, it’s in statute, it’s a federal term."" The term appears--yet scarcely--in federal law. Best we can tell, though, no law defines the term as referring to all individuals living in the U.S. without legal authorization. Where the term does appear, it’s undefined or part of an introductory title or limited to apply to certain individuals convicted of felonies. On balance, we rate McCraw’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Madeleine Albright compares Mussolini, Trump on use of 'drain the swamp'
","  One of Donald Trump’s more memorable campaign slogans was his promise to ""drain the swamp,"" a push to end corruption in Washington. Wow! I hear you Warren, Michigan. Streaming live - join us America. It is time to DRAIN THE SWAMP!Watch: https://t.co/pjXELwc5E1 That phrase showed up recently in an unexpected place: a book by Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton. The publication of Albright’s Fascism: A Warning during the Trump era is not coincidental. ""Why, this far into the twenty-first century, are we once again talking about fascism?"" Albright wrote. ""One reason, frankly, is Donald Trump. If we think of fascism as a wound from the past that had almost healed, Trump in the White House was like ripping off the bandage and picking at the scab."" Albright went on to describe the rise of Benito Mussolini, Italy’s fascist leader in the early 20th century. She wrote that Mussolini used the phrase ""drain the swamp"" when he made moves to overhaul the country’s unpopular government bureaucracy. ""He knew that citizens were fed up with a bureaucracy that seemed to grow bigger and less efficient each year, so he insisted on daily roll calls in ministry offices and berated employees for arriving late to work or taking long lunches. ""He initiated a campaign to 'drenare la palude' ('drain the swamp') by firing more than 35,000 civil servants,"" Albright wrote. A PolitiFact reader was struck by this linguistic link and wondered whether the Italian fascist leader had really been the source of Trump's famous phrase. So we asked U.S. and Italian historians about it. We found that Mussolini’s government made a big point of draining literal swamps, as public works projects, and he did conduct mass firings of civil servants. In addition, Mussolini touted the metaphor of purification as a defining principle of his political philosophy. ""We can understand fascism's social, agricultural, and racial policies through the concept of ‘reclamation’ — draining or cleansing something to regenerate or remake it,"" said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University and author of Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945. However, Mussolini does not seem to have used the Italian version of Trump’s ""drain the swamp"" term. Indeed, the phrase’s origin appears to be as American as apple pie.  Benito Mussolini salutes a crowd in Rome. (Wikimedia Commons) The swamps Mussolini sought to drain are known as the Pontine marshes. Located on the outskirts of Rome, the marshes were unhealthy and largely uninhabited for centuries due to malaria. Several years into his tenure as Italy’s leader, Mussolini made a big push to drain the marshes, building new towns with modernist architecture and settling the area. The government installed ""six pumps as huge and noisy as airplanes,"" as the New York Times put it, in an effort to ""pull millions of gallons of water — up to 9,500 gallons a second — out of the soggy ground, directing it into an elaborate system of cement-lined canals that ultimately dump it into the sea."" The region’s infrastructure was damaged during World War II, but it was repaired after the war and became a fertile area for growing fruits, vegetables and livestock. The town of Latina doesn’t shrink from its Mussolini heritage; in 2015, Newsweek reported that locals retain affection for the fascist leader and the buildings he constructed. ""Not every aspect of the Pontine marshes was a success, but for the most part the regime, and outsiders, viewed it as such,"" said Michael R. Ebner, a Syracuse University historian and author of The Politics of Everyday Life in Fascist Italy. A portion of the Pontine marshes near Rome. (Creative commons) So Mussolini literally drained the swamps. But he also liked the metaphor, and he sought to apply it to other areas of Italian life. ""The term the regime used for land reclamation was ‘bonifica,’"" Ebner said. ""In English, it might be translated as ‘reclamation,’ as in land reclamation, but was also used more generally by the regime for reclaiming the race or the state."" David I. Kertzer, a Brown University professor and author of The Pope and Mussolini, said Albright’s comment describes the purging of the bureaucracy accurately early in Mussolini’s tenure. ""Mussolini attacked the bloated public payroll and, in line with this, in the first months of his coming to power, he fired 36,000 workers for the state-owned railroad,"" Kertzer said. The subsequent land reclamation in the Pontine marshes ""gave the regime confidence that it could expand Italian territory and engage in projects of fascist social engineering,"" Ebner said. ""These goals were highly relevant to fascism going forward.""   Ultimately, Mussolini followed a philosophy of "" ‘bonifica umana,’ or human reclamation, which had to do with remaking the Italians eugenically and also racial policies to keep Italians pure,"" Ben-Ghiat said. At the same time, most of the experts we contacted agreed that Mussolini didn’t use the catchphrase drenare la palude, or ""drain the swamp,"" to refer to his metaphorical efforts. ""I don’t think this phrase was a big deal for Mussolini or his regime,"" said Richard Bosworth, a historian affiliated with Oxford University who has written two books about Mussolini and his era. The written record supports the historians’ recollections. Barry Popik, who has blogged extensively about etymology, scoured a variety of online databases commonly used by etymologists and found essentially no examples of the phrase drenare la palude during Mussolini’s time. The English phrase ""drain the swamp"" appeared at least as long ago as 1903, in an Oshkosh, Wis., newspaper. ""Socialists are not satisfied with killing a few of the mosquitoes which come from the capitalist swamp; they want to drain the swamp,"" the newspaper wrote, quoting a Social Democratic Party organizer. Two other prominent members of the socialist or social democratic movements used the term in similar contexts: Victor Berger in 1912 and Mary Harris (Mother) Jones in 1913. That said, the phrase remained rare until about 1970, Popik found, and it didn’t really catch on until President Ronald Reagan used it in 1983 to take a shot at the Washington bureaucracy. Popik suggests that, rather than referring to the Pontine marshes, ""drain the swamp"" probably came from a folksy aphorism that posits that ""when you’re up to your neck in alligators, it’s easy to forget that the initial objective was to drain the swamp."" Through her publisher, Albright's communications staff agreed with our finding that ""drain the swamp"" or its Italian-language equivalent was not a major slogan for Mussolini's government. They said her point was to draw attention to his actions of purging the bureaucracy. ""The reference in Dr. Albright’s book is not to a specific statement by Mussolini, but rather to the Italian dictator’s policy of purging the bureaucracy,"" Albright's office said in a statement. Albright said Mussolini ""initiated a campaign to 'drenare la palude' ('drain the swamp') by firing more than 35,000 civil servants."" She’s on target about Mussolini’s bureaucracy-busting efforts, as well as the importance of draining swamps — both literal and figurative — within his fascist philosophy. However, experts said Mussolini did not use the Italian version of Trump’s ""drain the swamp"" term, weakening Albright's rhetorical connection between the leaders.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin did back a Department of Peace, but Kevin Nicholson's attack needs some context
","While defending his criticism of military veterans who support Democrats, Kevin Nicholson also attacked Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin -- the Democrat whose job he wants. Nicholson was interviewed May 4, 2018 by Dan O’Donnell, who hosts a conservative talk show on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Nicholson, a first-time candidate and former Marine, said: Tammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence. That’s a fundamentally unserious answer to a serious question -- the question being, How do we keep the American people safe? She’s going to have to answer for that in this election. I’m going to make sure that she does. Nicholson made essentially the same claim about Baldwin and the Department of Peace in another Milwaukee radio interview two days earlier. Moreover, both Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir -- the two Republicans vying in the August 2018 primary to challenge Baldwin three months later -- are trying to portray Baldwin as extreme. So is an outside group -- although we rated Mostly False its claim that Baldwin ""supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops."" As we’ll see, Baldwin did back the Department of Peace legislation, which the Washington Post called the ""Hope Diamond of liberal ideas: pure, breathtaking and highly impractical in the real world."" But it’s important to note that Baldwin’s most recent cosponsorship was before she left the House for the Senate, and that as a senator she has backed certain national defense measures. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The legislation To back Nicholson’s claim, his campaign cited Baldwin’s cosponsorship, as a member of the U.S. House, of the 2007 version of the Department of Peace and Nonviolence Act. It was introduced by then-U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. (Baldwin for 14 years held the Madison-area House seat now held by Democrat Mark Pocan. She joined the Senate in 2013.) In 2009, Kucinich introduced a similar measure, the Department of Peace Act. Baldwin cosponsored it and she cosponsored the 2011 version. The 2012 Post article said that with the $10 billion-a-year Department of Peace: A secretary of peace would sit in the president’s Cabinet and on the National Security Council. The secretary would be given a special new role in the country’s military decisions: If a conflict was about to start, the secretaries of defense and state would have to consult the Peace secretary ""concerning nonviolent means of conflict resolution."" The Congress.gov summary of the bill said the department’s mission would be to: Hold peace as an organizing principle; endeavor to promote justice and democratic principles to expand human rights; and develop policies that promote national and international conflict prevention, nonviolent intervention, mediation, peaceful resolution of conflict, and structured mediation of conflict.

The bills were referred to committee, but no other actions were taken. In response to Nicholson’s claim, Baldwin’s campaign told us the peace secretary also would have been charged with developing policies to address domestic violence and reduce incarceration; and the campaign said that one of the nation’s founding fathers, Benjamin Rush, had promoted the idea of a peace secretary. More fact checks on the Senate candidates: Kevin Nicholson Tammy Baldwin Leah Vukmir And though she is far from being a hawk, Baldwin has been out front on certain defense measures: Pressing President Donald Trump in late 2017 to fund Wisconsin-made Littoral Combat Ships. Touting her vote for the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, saying it strengthens national security. Our rating Nicholson says Baldwin ""cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence."" Baldwin did cosponsor, as a member of the House before joining the Senate, the 2007, 2009 and 2011 versions of those bills, which did not become law.

Donald Trump’s misleading claim that Kanye West’s praise doubled his African-American support
","President Donald Trump, in the midst of a controversial bromance with Kanye West, told a crowd at the National Rifle Association convention that the rapper’s praise had doubled his support among African-Americans in a week. Social media pleasantries between the two men began when West professed his love for Trump in an April 25 tweet in which he referred to the 45th president as his ""brother."" ""We are both dragon energy,"" West wrote. ""He is my brother.""  You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother.

""Kanye West must have some power because you probably saw, I doubled my African-American poll numbers,"" Trump told the audience in Dallas. ""We went from 11 to 22 in one week. Thank you, Kanye, thank you."" We decided to take a closer look at the numbers. It turns out Trump garbled the results of a real survey that showed a much more nuanced picture. Trump appears to have been referencing a Reuters weekly poll that showed his approval rating among black men going from 11 percent for the week ending April 22 to 22 percent for the week ending April 29. So even if you take the Reuters poll at face value, Trump misstated the results. The poll showed Trump’s support doubled among African-American men only, not African-Americans in general. (The poll showed that his approval rating among black Americans overall went from 8.9 percent to 16.5 percent over the same period.) But there’s reason to be wary of concluding, based on this poll, that Trump is enjoying a favorable shift in public opinion among black men. First, the sample size is small. Generally speaking, the smaller a poll’s sample size, the more prone it is to error. And the two weekly polls in question looked only at small slices: The surveys were based, respectively, on feedback from 118 and 171 respondents. According to Reuters’ own polling editor, the sample sizes for this particular poll ""were too small to reliably suggest any shift in public opinion."" Chris Kahn, Reuters U.S. political polling editor, said the ""credibility interval"" (which is similar to the more familiar margin of error) was +/- 9 percentage points. So while Trump claimed his approval rating among black men for the week ending April 22 was 11 percent, realistically it could have anywhere from 2 percent to 20 percent. His approval rating the following week for this group was anywhere from 13 percent to 31 percent. In other words, according to Kahn, the polling ""leaves open the possibility that his approval also could have dropped in this time frame."" Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said news consumers should heed the Reuters polling editor’s cautionary notes. ""Most polls do not have a large sample of African Americans, and so we have to be very careful in interpreting the results of any single survey. The margin of error is high,"" Bowman said. ""I would also not rely on a single survey to suggest that something new was occurring."" We were unable to find other polls that measured Trump's African-American support on a weekly basis.  Another issue with the poll’s reliability concerns how it was conducted. Rather than calling randomly generated phone numbers, this poll allowed online respondents to opt-in to the survey. In polling terminology, this survey used ""a non-probability online sample."" As CNN’s director of polling Jennifer Agiesta explained, ""those who participated signed up to take the poll rather than being randomly selected,"" meaning ""there could be bias in the sample."" Charles Wheelan, a professor at Dartmouth who has written extensively about statistics and public policy, cautioned that online polls are highly vulnerable to ""selection bias,"" whereby the sample of respondents does not accurately reflect a population writ large. ""It’s very difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate cross-section using online tools because they are so biased by who is likely to be online and respond to a survey,"" Wheelan said. Trump said, ""I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week."" Even if you take the Reuters poll at face value, Trump misstated the results. The poll showed Trump’s support doubled among African-American men only, not African-Americans of both sexes. In terms of the poll’s accuracy, Reuters’ own polling chief said the sample size was too small to reliably indicate Trump is enjoying a favorable shift in public opinion among black men. The poll’s reliability is also questionable given online respondents opted-in to the survey, which is less reliable than using a randomly-generated sample. We rate this Mostly False.

Did Adam Putnam oppose putting troops on the border using the National Guard?
","In Florida’s Republican primary for governor, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis challenged Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam’s credibility on illegal immigration. DeSantis cast Putnam as not being conservative enough on immigration in a chat May 2 with radio host John Fredericks, a supporter of President Donald Trump. Trump said DeSantis, a frequent guest on Fox News, would make a ""GREAT"" governor back in December.   ""Well, we are very different in our approach to illegal immigration,"" DeSantis said of Putnam. ""When he was in the Congress, he supported the McCain amnesty, he even supported the gang of eight Schumer-Obama amnesty when he was ag commissioner. He didn’t even have to vote on it but he supported it. He opposed bringing troops, putting troops on our southern border using the National Guard."" Whether Putnam supported ""amnesty"" is a complicated question. We previously rated that attack as Half True, because he has supported some initiatives that would benefit undocumented immigrants (including the 2013 ""Gang of Eight"" legislation) and others that wouldn’t have. For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Putnam opposed ""putting troops on the southern border using the National Guard."" We learned that Putnam did take a similar vote in 2004, but experts said the underlying policy — putting troops on the border — was not a major policy consideration in the early 2000s. More importantly, though, the talking point doesn’t account for Putnam’s general support of Trump’s immigration policy. Putnam served in the U.S. House for 10 years before he started two terms as agriculture commissioner in 2011. DeSantis’s claim is rooted in Putnam’s 2004 vote against an amendment to the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act. The amendment authorized the defense secretary to assign members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps to assist the Department of Homeland Security with border patrol duties, in some circumstances. The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Virgil Goode, R-Va., did not say anything about the National Guard, as DeSantis said. The amendment ended up passing with a vote of 231-191. Putnam and 19 other Republican lawmakers voted against it (Putnam being the only Republican from Florida to vote no). News coverage of this amendment was miminal. Still, some lawmakers went on the record to say the amendment would have stretched military personnel too thin. ""Border security is and continues to be a top priority for me and for the Congress as a whole,"" then-Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said at the time. ""But the Goode amendment would militarize our border and stretch the resources of our Army."" In the early 2000s, deploying the military to help control the southern border was not discussed as a major immigration enforcement strategy by either party, said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. ""The idea has surfaced from time to time, but it has never been a key component of any administration's strategy,"" he said. We asked Putnam spokeswoman Amanda Bevis why Putnam voted against the amendment. Instead, she reiterated Putnam’s support for the White House’s policy on immigration, which as of April includes sending National Guard troops to the southern border. ""Adam Putnam supports President Trump’s actions to secure our borders, including activating troops for this critical purpose,"" she said. ""Without strong border security to prevent illegal aliens from unlawfully entering our country, the lives of American citizens are endangered."" This is the same quote Bevis gave Florida Politics earlier this year when reporters asked Putnam about his 2004 vote. We could not find any recent instances of Putnam speaking directly in support of sending the National Guard to the border. On his campaign website video about immigration, Putnam speaks broadly of supporting Trump’s policies. ""As governor we will work with President Trump to cut funding for sanctuary cities, we will support tighter border security and vetting for refugees from Muslim countries,"" he said in a video posted May 2017. We also found several votes Putnam took in favor of border security measures and funding enforcement. For example, he voted in favor of a border security bill in 2005 that would have required improving surveillance technology, training more agents, and upgrading border infrastructure. He was one of multiple cosponsors of the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and voted for the legislation. The law signed by President George W. Bush authorized about 700 miles of fencing between the border of the United States and Mexico. Putnam also voted for legislation in 2004 that appropriated $34.2 billion for Homeland Security, including funds to increase the number of border agents. DeSantis said Putnam ""opposed bringing troops, putting troops on our southern border using the National Guard."" Context is key. In 2004, Putnam did vote against an amendment that authorized the secretary of defense to assign members of the military under certain circumstances to assist the Department of Homeland Security in securing the border.  What the claim leaves out is Putnam’s overall support for Trump’s immigration policy. While Putnam has not commented on Trump’s specific plan to send National Guard to the border, he is generally enthusiastic about Trump’s approach to immigration. It’s also worth noting that as a member of Congress, Putnam took several votes in favor of border security measures and funding enforcement.

Radio show's headline falsely claims Philadelphia Starbucks settlement was for $2 million

The two men were sitting at a table waiting for a friend, but had not made purchases. When they refused to leave, a store manager called the police and they were eventually escorted out in handcuffs, according to Philly.com. The incident was caught on video, prompting national news and allegations of racism. The two men settled with the city for $1 each. Also, the city agreed to create a $200,000 fund to assist Philadelphia’s young entrepreneurs. A joint statement from Starbucks, Nelson and Robinson said they reached ""a confidential financial settlement as well as a commitment to continued listening and dialogue between the parties as a means toward developing specific actions and opportunities.""

Gubernatorial candidate Mitchell claims too much credit for firefighter legislation
","The longest paragraph in Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mahlon Mitchell’s online biography touts his role passing two niche laws affecting Wisconsin firefighters. The reference from his campaign website has also made it into at least one news account as the Madison firefighter seeks the state’s highest office. ""Recently, Mahlon was instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state,"" the biography says, going on to describe the laws on health insurance and infectious diseases. So Mitchell’s claim is not just that he was involved, but that he was ""instrumental"" in ""recent"" legislation. Is he right? ""Recently"" claim a stretch Mitchell, the president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union, is part of a large Democratic field seeking to unseat Gov. Scott Walker. He is making his second run for statewide office, having lost a 2012 bid for lieutenant governor to Rebecca Kleefisch. The laws he references created additional benefits for Wisconsin firefighters or their families in two specific scenarios. 2009 Wisconsin Act 284 established a presumption that firefighters, law enforcement officers and emergency responders who are killed or disabled by an infectious disease contracted the disease through their employment, giving them access to related benefits. 2009 Wisconsin Act 285 required municipalities to pay health insurance premiums for the surviving spouses and dependent children of firefighters who die in the line of duty if they were paying premiums for the firefighter. You’ll notice the year built into the titles of the laws isn’t exactly, well, recent. The laws both were drafted in 2009 and took effect in May 2010. Was Mitchell a key force behind laws? Mitchell’s ""instrumental"" claim is a bit subjective, but leaning on the dictionary definition we’ll take that to mean Mitchell is claiming a key role in getting the laws passed. A lot goes into making a bill into a law — cue Schoolhouse Rock — but it seems fair to say a key person would be centrally involved with proposing the law, writing the law or pushing for its passage, through things like lobbying or testifying on behalf of the bill. Mitchell was a member of the union’s board when the laws were passed, in charge of outreach and public relations, according to his campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Allen. She said Mitchell attended committee hearings and floor debates in support of the bill and arranged for other firefighters to do the same. And he was part of the group that organized the bill signing. But Mitchell did not testify on behalf of the bills — that was left to other union representatives. And he did not formally lobby for the bills, either, since he was not a registered lobbyist until February 2011. As to the how the laws came to be, drafting records for the health insurance bill show it was introduced by state Sen. David Hansen (D-Green Bay) after the widow of former Green Bay firefighter Arnie Wolff wrote to him about her family’s financial struggles. The bill was drafted by the Legislative Reference Bureau at Hansen’s request and modeled after similar legislation in Illinois. Drafting records for the infectious diseases bill don’t specify the origin of the idea (and Mitchell didn’t claim he proposed it), but show it was drafted by the reference bureau at the request of then-state Sen. Jim Sullivan (D-Wauwatosa) based on a bill in Virginia. The union president who preceded Mitchell, Mike Woodzicka, said the union worked with legislators on the language of the bills, so Mitchell and other board members would have been part of email exchanges on that topic. Jay Wadd, a spokesman for Hansen, said he assumes such a step would have been part of the process on their bill, though he doesn’t have specific records of it given the time that has passed. Our rating Mitchell claims he was recently ""instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state."" But it’s a stretch to say the action was recent, and that Mitchell’s role was instrumental. Mitchell’s union supported the bills, and he was involved with supporting them, but there’s no evidence the bills wouldn’t have become law without his involvement. We rate Mitchell’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097064CC0>],/factchecks/2018/may/07/mahlon-mitchell/gubernatorial-candidate-mitchell-claims-credit-fir/
"['Federal Budget', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Social Security', 'New York', 'Hakeem Jeffries']","
Did Trump's budget include a $2 trillion cut for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security?
","During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump said he wouldn’t try to cut Medicare or Medicaid. But his federal budget proposal broke that promise, according to Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York City. ""He can't talk about his own budget, where he threatened to cut $2 trillion from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,"" Jeffries said about Trump during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, released the president’s federal budget proposal in February. The plan was met with little fanfare because Congress had already passed a two-year spending deal a few days earlier, making the presidential blueprint largely irrelevant. Like any other budget proposal, Trump’s showed where he wanted to spend money and where he didn’t. Did he want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid by $2 trillion? Where’s $2 trillion from? Jeffries’ spokesperson did not get back to us with information supporting his claim. In a literal sense, Trump’s budget did propose about $2 trillion in savings from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years. The majority of those savings — about $1.4 trillion — would come from Medicaid, according to projections from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Part of that would be a rollback of the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, which allowed states to offer Medicaid coverage to a larger share of low-income people. Trump’s budget would cut federal funding for the expansion, forcing states to either drop it or foot the bill themselves. About $530 billion in savings would come from Medicare and $25 billion would come from Social Security. Collectively, that totals almost $2 trillion. What experts say Beyond the raw numbers, though, these figures are misleading, experts told us. ""Those numbers only count the ‘takes’ and not where the money is going,"" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-profit budget analysis group. About $1.2 trillion of the savings from Medicaid and Obamacare would be redirected to block grants for states, Goldwein said. The federal government currently matches state Medicaid costs without a cap. Trump’s budget would use a formula to give each state a fixed amount for Medicaid each year. If costs go above that amount, states would have to cut services or bear the cost. The president’s budget would also repeal federal subsidies for Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that replacing those subsidies with block grants would reduce the federal deficit by at least $133 billion over a decade. The net savings between all of Trump’s budget proposals affecting Medicaid and Obamacare was projected to be about $765 billion, experts said. ""It’s impossible to apportion how much of that is Medicaid because we don’t know how states will spend their new grant,"" Goldwein said. ""But I think it’s somewhat misleading to suggest Medicaid is being cut by $1.4 trillion when a large chunk of that money is really being reprioritized rather than eliminated."" The proposed Medicare savings would have meant little to no change for beneficiaries, according to Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Trump’s budget would have reduced reimbursement rates for services, lowering the overall cost. The lower rates would not have changed the care received by people on Medicare, he said. Rather, it would force providers to charge the government less for services. ""The Medicare cuts were for the most part reductions to payments to providers, and that latter category is something members of Congress from both parties have been working on for decades,"" Van de Water said. ""The reason the U.S. spends more on health care is that we end up paying much more to providers than other countries."" The same idea was included in Obamacare. The law included lower reimbursement rates for providers — something Republicans criticized as a cut at the time. But some of the projected savings will be spent elsewhere outside the program, Goldwein said. ""For example, Medicare currently pays medical residents in the United States – not just those who serve the elderly, but all residents,"" Goldwein said. ""The president’s budget would instead create a new program to pay those residents outside of Medicare."" The net cut from the program would be $236 billion, according to Trump’s budget proposal. As for Social Security, experts agreed that Trump’s budget would cut the program by about $25 billion, or less than one-fifth of 1 percent. The savings would come from several proposals, the largest of which would cut retroactive disability benefits from 12 to six months. Altogether, experts say the net cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security in Trump’s proposal are closer to $1 trillion when you include the budgetary savings from repealing Obamacare. The amount would be lower without the cuts to Obamacare. Our ruling Jeffries said Trump’s budget threatened to cut $2 trillion from Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. The only way to get to $2 trillion in cuts is by counting some numbers and not others. Expert said the net cut would be closer to $1 trillion.  We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FE500>],/factchecks/2018/may/04/hakeem-jeffries/did-trumps-budget-include-2-trillion-cut-medicare-/
