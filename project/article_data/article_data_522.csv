Union group's petition says talk show host John DePetro was accused of sexual assault in 2013
","WPRO-AM talk-radio host John DePetro has been shown to be factually challenged when he makes statements about others. His record with PolitiFact Rhode Island is two False rulings and two Pants on Fire rulings. So the irony didn't escape us when DePetro wrote to us on Jan. 2 to complain that a group was telling a lie about him. At issue is a petition on Change.org that seeks his removal. It had 6,659 ""signatures"" as of 2:15 p.m. on Jan. 2. (Supporters are asked to give their names and addresses and click on a ""Sign"" button, but only the names of commenters are shown on the site.) The petition comes from For Our Daughters RI, a union-backed group created after DePetro, a harsh critic of unions, called union protesters ""parasites,"" ""cockroaches,"" ""hags"" and ""whores."" The protesters had been picketing a fundraiser for Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, then an unannounced candidate for governor, accusing her of being a ""crook"" who ""cooked the books"" to build support for the overhaul of the state pension system. The petition says DePetro has made other hateful statements against women and ""earlier this year, he was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker."" The petition started circulating in November 2013. DePetro has taken issue with most of the allegations. We were interested in the sexual-assault claim because it was news to us. ""I have never been accused of 'sexual assault,' that is a complete lie,"" he said in his email. ""In July of 2012, I was accused of sexual harassment, but that is far different than 'sexual assault.'"" A sexual harassment civil suit was indeed filed against him in 2012, not 2013, as the petition says. We read the complaint. It does not mention sexual assault, a criminal charge that can put someone in prison. In the filing, a former coworker accused DePetro of allegedly making sexual advances to her, showing her images of women that he said he was attracted to, and ultimately asking her if she would engage in group sex with him. DePetro has denied the allegations. (WPRO officials were also named in the suit. DePetro's supervisor was accused of not properly acting against the alleged infractions. However, there is no record in Superior Court that, in the 15 months since the suit was filed, any of the defendants have been officially notified that they're being sued.) We called Maureen Martin, chairwoman of For Our Daughters RI, to ask about the sexual-assault allegation. Martin is also political activities director of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, a labor union. Martin confirmed that the allegation in the petition referred to the 2012 sexual harassment suit. She asked to get back to us. By that night, the petition had been altered. The year had been changed to 2012. As of 2 p.m. Friday, the total was 6,671. However, the allegation of sexual assault was not modified. In a statement emailed that evening, Martin said that in the harassment complaint, DePetro's accuser ""alleges that Mr. DePetro made multiple 'sexual advances' toward her. These advances were unwelcome and 'inappropriate,' the complaint contends."" ""The United States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women defines sexual assault, in part, as: 'any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient,'"" Martin said. ""We believe the alleged, unwelcome 'sexual advances' referenced in the aforementioned court filing fall under the classification of 'behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.'"" We checked the Justice Department's definition. The other half of the definition, which Martin did not quote, says: ""Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape."" Sexual harassment is not mentioned. Our ruling For Our Daughters RI, in its petition calling for the removal of talk-radio host John DePetro, said, ""Earlier this year, he was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker."" DePetro was accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed in 2012, not 2013. The suit, which has laid dormant according to court records, never alleges sexual assault. Both sexual harassment and sexual assault are serious allegations. But the former is a civil matter and the latter can send you to prison, and relegate an ex-convict to a life of a registered sex offender. We would expect a group devoted to protecting women to know the difference. Yet For Our Daughters RI is standing by its allegation, selectively quoting from a federal definition of sexual assault and neglecting the fact that the definition does not include sexual harassment. We rate its statement Pants on Fire! (With research by Providence Journal reporter Katie Mulvaney.

Some tax info from most Texans, some health info from subset using the marketplace
","Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, campaigning for re-election, tweeted a parody of President Barack Obama promoting his signature health-care law. Around midday Dec. 12, 2013, the official White House Twitter account posted a photo of Obama holding a sign urging Americans to get health coverage because ""nobody should go broke just because they get sick."" Social media denizens started creating versions that rewrote the sign’s text; Dewhurst’s had Obama saying, ""I want more of Texans’ private data."" Some perspective: Texas in 2012 had approximately 19.5 million insured residents and 5.2 million legal residents without insurance according to a March 18, 2013, report by the state Health and Human Services Commission. Does the Obamacare law demand private data on them that wasn't known to the government before? PolitiFact reporters have checked out several claims about how the Affordable Care Act’s online marketplaces will handle personal information. Many of the concerns addressed are about how government agencies will share information they already collect -- and how secure that information will be. As part of a May 2013 fact-check, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., reported that a federal ""data hub"" resulting from the 2010 law would pull information from government agencies, but not expand federal data collection. For example, the Social Security Administration is asked to verify a person's Social Security number, and the IRS confirms financial data to see if a person is eligible for a subsidy. PolitiFact in D.C. gave a False rating Sept. 19, 2013, to a claim by former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey that ""Obamacare will question your sex life,"" finding that nothing in the health care law required such questions. So what information does the government collect under the Obamacare law? If you apply to shop in the federal online insurance marketplace or the marketplace for your state, you’ll supply information on yourself and perhaps family members, some of which the government already has. Healthcare.gov offers a checklist for people preparing to fill out applications, whether online or printed: Social Security number, employer, income, current insurance policy numbers and information about your employer’s insurance plans (if any). 
 Such answers will help determine whether you’re eligible to buy insurance through the marketplaces and if you can get free- or reduced-cost coverage via tax credits, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. The standardized family application asks for information on you and everyone who lives with you, including whether you are pregnant and how many babies you’re expecting, whether you have a health condition that limits daily activities, whether you live in a nursing home and whether you were in foster care after age 18. Other questions concern employment, military service, sources of income, tax deductions taken and whether you are American Indian or Alaska Native. A Sept. 18, 2013, fact sheet from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said, ""Personal health information (PHI) will be requested only when it is needed to complete the application and make an eligibility determination for health coverage options."" Health privacy expert Deven McGraw told us by email that the applications do collect some information the government did not already have, but said it’s the same type of information gathered when people apply for public coverage such as Medicaid. ""They are questions that are specifically designed to match eligibility criteria. So none of it is extraneous,"" said McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for Internet freedom. And, she said, the data can’t be used for any purposes other than the marketplaces’ functions. More information about you could come, the fact sheet says, from ""common federal data sources including the Social Security Administration (SSA), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)."" Wait -- Homeland Security? According to the National Immigration Law Center’s website, applicants who are not U.S. citizens will have their status verified through a Homeland/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service database. Agencies already use the web service, called Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE), to determine immigrants’ eligibility for benefits including Medicaid, housing loans and unemployment. Via email, Social Security spokeswoman Kia Anderson told us her agency can, when CMS needs the information to determine eligibility, provide applicants’ ID numbers, citizenship data, death or disability indicators and Social Security income and coverage earned. So the application process puts together some information the government already had with some it didn’t have. People who aren’t applying to shop in the marketplaces but are subject to the Obamacare law’s mandate will also be sharing some new information with Uncle Sam. The mandate to have or get insurance applies, according to the immigration law center, to all U.S. citizens, naturalized citizens and legal immigrants. Via email, IRS spokeswoman Lea Crusberg said 2014 tax returns will ask whether you have health coverage that meets the new standards or an exemption, whether you got coverage through an Obamacare marketplace and whether you got a tax credit to help defray the cost. The law’s new tax payments and credits will also be on returns, of course. In 2015, Crusberg said, the IRS will start collecting coverage information from insurance providers. Employers who insure their own workers in-house will report which employees are enrolled and give enough information so the IRS can tell if those workers are due a tax credit. Self-insuring employers will also put the cost of the plan they’re providing on W-2 forms so workers can see it. Is the new data ""private"" information? Per the CMS fact sheet, Obamacare applicants could be asked to cough up some personal health information. But the fact sheet also says the marketplaces’ systems ""will not store this information"" -- which casts some doubt on whether the government is really ""collecting"" it, but serves as an indication that it’s considered sensitive. How about when the IRS asks where your insurance comes from, whether you got a tax credit for it and whether it meets the Obamacare law’s standards? Generally, the IRS regards what you put on your tax return as private. For example, tax preparers who disclose such information without your consent can face criminal charges. Final IRS regulations governing who can disclose what tax return information to HHS under the Obamacare law were issued Aug. 13, 2013. An FAQ posted by the IRS that day said that ""officers and employees of the IRS will disclose to HHS, the Marketplace, and state agencies only, upon written request and subject to strict privacy and security rules, certain return information ... for the purpose of determining eligibility for certain health care affordability programs."" Our ruling Dewhurst said Obama wants ""more of Texans’ private data."" The subset of Texans shopping for coverage through the online marketplace are providing additional private data for a reason: to ensure they’re qualified. Dewhurst's statement overlooks these aspects. Regardless, many more Texans will be asked to give the IRS information about their health coverage that was previously not requested. We rate Dewhurst’s statement as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"['New Hampshire', 'Health Care', 'Carol Shea-Porter']","
Carol Shea-Porter says people in NH can keep their health care policies, doctors and hospitals in 2014
","It’s been four years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, but the right and left are still exchanging jabs over the perceived benefits or harm of the health care law. And there’s plenty of misinformation to go around. This time, it was a radio ad released Dec. 10 by the National Republican Congressional Committee that called out Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H) for her support of law. The ad introduces an unnamed family whose insurance plan was canceled, and the sick husband can’t go to his doctors because their new plan doesn’t offer access to the same doctors and hospitals. Shea-Porter swiftly called the ad false in a statement to media. ""Washington Republicans should take down their misleading attack ads and stop frightening Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem, because they can indeed renew their policies and keep their current doctors and hospitals,"" she said. The statement went on to say that the congresswoman had already worked with Anthem representatives to extend the company’s renewal deadline for individual policyholders so they’d have access to same network in 2014.    Shea-Porter also repeated the comment about individuals having access to the same doctors and hospitals next year in a press release a few days later. We’ve checked several versions of the ""if you like your policy, you can keep it"" statement from a variety of sources. But we wondered whether individual policyholders in New Hampshire would have access to the same doctors and hospitals next year, especially in light of an Anthem announcement in September that individuals on the state’s new marketplace would have access to only 16 of the state’s 26 hospitals. A Brief Background President Obama promised many times when promoting his new health care law that policyholders who liked their insurance plans wouldn’t have to change. Old plans were supposed to be protected through a system called grandfathering, basically allowing plans to continue as long as they met certain requirements. Those rules were so strict, though, that very few plans could meet them. And so Obama’s promise came back to bite him when an estimated 4 million cancellation letters went out earlier this fall. For damage control, in November the White House announced that insurance providers and state insurance commissioners could extend current plans, even if they didn’t meet the minimum requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The situation in New Hampshire In the following weeks, New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner Roger Sevigny was one of several state commissioners who said the state would allow renewal of non-compliant plans. But for Granite Staters with individually purchased insurance plans, renewal was already an option. Under New Hampshire law, policyholders are allowed to renew an existing policy earlier than its anniversary date.   Anthem publicized this option in a release the day after Obama’s announcement, saying the company had sent notices to individual policyholders to remind them of this choice. ""We wanted to underscore that our previously announced early renewal option, which has proven to be very popular among our members, already gives individual policyholders who wish to keep their existing policy a way to do so,"" Lisa Guertin, president of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in New Hampshire, said in the release. Anthem is by far the predominant insurance company in New Hampshire. It’s the only company participating in the state’s marketplace in 2014 and holds about 30,000 individual policies in the state. Other companies hold around 1,000, according to the N.H. Insurance Department. The NRCC ad that Shea-Porter was responding to said that one-third of the state’s hospitals weren’t covered under the Affordable Care Act. That’s true in a sense -- Anthem’s individual plans for sale on the state’s new insurance marketplace offer a ""narrow network"" that excludes 10 of the state’s 26 hospitals. Yet a company spokesman confirmed that those who renewed their existing plans before the deadline would have access to the same network of providers, including those 10 hospitals, for 12 more months.   At the end of November, the insurance company extended its deadline for the early renewal option for a second time, giving policyholders until Dec. 16 to renew their canceled plans. That would have given them a policy year of Dec. 1, 2013, to Nov. 30, 2014. Our Ruling Shea-Porter said in December that in 2014 ""Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem… can indeed renew their policies and keep their doctors and hospitals."" New Hampshire policyholders were always able to extend their current policies 12 months, thanks to the state’s early renewal option. Anthem will not extend canceled policies after its Dec. 16 deadline, despite the White House allowing extensions until October 2014. That means that Shea-Porter’s statement was accurate when she said it, though it no longer applies today, since the renewal deadline has passed. But individual policyholders did have a chance to keep their same network of hospitals and doctors next year. Not everyone may have done so, which means some people may be forced to see other doctors at different hospitals. In New Hampshire, at least, people were given that opportunity.   We rate this statement True.  ",/factchecks/2014/jan/03/carol-shea-porter/carol-shea-porter-says-people-nh-can-keep-their-cu/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Michael Moore']","
Michael Moore: Obamacare sends over $100 billion annually to insurers
","Michael Moore, the rough-edged populist maker of films about guns, the erosion of the middle class and capitalism itself, kicked off 2014 with some harsh words for President Barack Obama. In a New York Times op-ed, Moore called Obama’s signature health care law ""awful."" ""The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go,"" Moore said. ""By 2017, we will be funneling over $100 billion annually to private insurance companies."" We have consistently found that, contrary to the claims from the president’s critics, the newly implemented law is not a government takeover of health care. Instead, it drops a layer of regulations and subsidies on top of the existing private sector system. While that generally supports Moore’s contention that the government is sending lots of dollars in the direction of private insurance companies, we wanted to dig further into the specifics. Moore’s staff directed us to a May 2013 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers who help Congress assess its choices. The money Moore has in mind represents the subsidies the federal government is offering to make health insurance more affordable for millions of people. Many individuals who purchase coverage through either the  federal or a state marketplace, at prices set by insurers, will be eligible to receive tax credits that lower their premium costs. There are a couple of ways the money can make it to the private insurers that offer the plans. The government might transfer the funds directly to the company or the customer might pay and then get a tax credit at the end of the year. Regardless, each month the private insurance companies get their money. The $100 billion number Moore cited in the New York Times is off, but just slightly, said Josh Fangmeier, a health policy analyst at the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation at the University of Michigan. A more accurate figure from that CBO report is $95 billion in 2017. The subsidies, which have the effect of lowering premiums, ""will increase demand for coverage, and insurance companies will likely benefit from this by gaining more customers,"" Fangmeier said. The CBO figures there will be 20 million people getting subsidies in 2017. That’s a fair bit of new business for private insurers but Scott Harrington, a professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said no one should confuse revenues with profits. Most of the new money will pass through the insurance companies’ hands. ""At least 80 percent of those dollars -- and probably more -- will go directly towards paying medical claims of enrollees,"" Harrington said. Still, Harrington noted that there will also be new customers who buy without subsidies because the law requires all citizens to have insurance. ""There is no doubt that the law will increase insurers’ revenues given that more people will be buying coverage,"" he said. At least a couple of the largest insurance companies speak of the Affordable Care Act as an opportunity, not a threat. This past October, Joseph Swedish, the chief executive officer of Wellpoint, gave this upbeat summary. ""Today we are raising our 2013 membership and earnings per share guidance, reflecting our strong performance, our continued preparation and the outlook for coming market changes under the Affordable Care Act,"" Swedish said. In a December press release, UnitedHealth Group touted government-sponsored programs as a significant source of growth. ""Approximately 25 million consumers are expected to purchase coverage through public exchanges (the online marketplaces) in the coming years. We are well positioned to meet both consumer and employer needs in the traditional, public exchange and private exchange marketplaces,"" the company said. Both of these insurers emphasized that nothing is guaranteed and warned that the Affordable Care Act could cut into profits. UnitedHealth Group cautioned specifically about  the next couple of years. But after that, their projections were positive. In one respect, the government takes back part of what it offers insurers. The overall plan raises billions in taxes and fees. In 2017, the government expects to collect about $11.4 billion from insurance companies. That could cut into profits but most analysts, including the CBO and America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, expect companies to pass those costs on to consumers. The health care law also phases out subsidies in place today that make the Medicare Advantage program more lucrative for insurers. At the end of the day, the extent to which insurance companies will profit is a matter of debate and uncertainty. Chris Conover, a health policy analyst at Duke University, does not believe the subsidies will add to the companies’ bottom line once you factor in the cost of care. ""It’s simply a pure pass-through operation on which insurers make zero profit,"" Conover said. But Fangmeier pointed to work by the Urban Institute, which projected that for different age groups, sometimes premiums would tend to be higher than health care claims and sometimes they would be lower. Fangmeier said the companies could ""at least break even."" How it turns out will depend on who buys coverage, how much health care they use, and how efficiently the insurance companies operate. A final note: Both Fangmeier and Conover emphasized that the federal government already heavily subsidizes the health insurance industry through the unique tax rules for employer-sponsored coverage. The employer can take the share it pays of the premiums as a deduction, while the worker gets the benefit tax-free. In 2017, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that will cost the government $171 billion, much more than the subsidies paid through the Affordable Care Act. That is not the only difference. ""Unlike the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which is a progressive subsidy, the employer insurance tax exemption is regressive,"" Fangmeier said. ""Meaning that the value of the subsidy to employees increases as their income level increases."" Our ruling Moore said that in 2017, Obamacare will funnel over $100 billion to insurance companies. The analysts we contacted told us $95 billion would be a more accurate figure, so Moore overshoots a bit. He characterized Obamacare as a pro-insurance industry program, which might lead some people to think that insurers would pocket all of the money. That clearly won’t happen because the companies will pay for care, and also because insurers might need to absorb a portion of about $11.4 billion in new taxes. What happens to the bottom line of insurance companies is somewhat uncertain. Some firms speak optimistically about turning a profit. Some analysts predict it will be a wash, with revenues and expenses cancelling each other out. All such assertions are based on predictions that could be on target or not. Here, we're focusing only on the specifics of Moore’s claim -- which is largely accurate. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/03/michael-moore/michael-moore-obamacare-sends-over-100-billion-ins/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Tom Graves']","
Graves compares Obamacare affordability to the belief in fake moon landings
","  The skepticism of some Americans knows no bounds. It extends, apparently, a quarter-million miles from Earth. A Georgia congressman and his staff recently saw a poll on the percentage of Americans who believe the historic 1969 moon landing was a fraud and compared it with another recent survey on the federal health care law known as Obamacare. ""More Americans believe the moon landing was fake than believe Obamacare is affordable,"" U.S. Rep. Tom Graves’ Twitter account said in a Dec. 19 posting. It reminded some of us on the PolitiFact Georgia team of some lyrics from the Chumbawamba tune ""Everything You Know Is Wrong."" I was there when they landed on the moon. In a studio in Kentucky in June. Maybe that band is on to something. Graves, a tea party favorite who represents the conservative-leaning northwest corner of the state, has been a vocal foe of the health care law. The Twitter posting was included in a photo of astronauts (allegedly?) trekking across the moon. Graves encouraged his Twitter followers to retweet his message, stating ""the fact that #Obamacare hurts families is no conspiracy theory!"" The conservative National Review published an article with the headline ""More People Believe Moon Landing Was a Hoax Than That Obamacare Will Lower Healthcare Costs."" PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether the House member was engaging in a conspiracy theory of his own by suggesting that a larger percentage of Americans believe the moon landing was staged than those who think Obamacare is affordable. Graves campaign spokesman Tim Baker quickly sent us two polls to support the congressman’s point. The first poll is by Public Policy Polling, a Raleigh, N.C.-based operation. It was conducted in March, asking nearly 1,250 Americans their opinions about various conspiracy theories through automated telephone interviews. The margin of error was 2.8 percent. The results were released the day after April Fools Day. The pollsters asked questions such as whether global warming is a hoax, whether Osama bin Laden is still alive, did the federal government allow the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to occur and whether Paul McCartney was killed in a car wreck in 1966 and secretly replaced to keep the Beatles together? On to the question that piqued our interest. ""Do you believe the moon landing was faked, or not?"" Seven percent of respondents answered they believed it was faked; 84 percent did not believe it was faked, while 9 percent were not sure. The respondents were registered voters, and some of their answers to various questions went along party lines. For example, three-fifths of Republicans believe global warming is a hoax while three-quarters of Democrats do not believe it is a hoax. On the moon landing question, independents and Democrats were more slightly inclined than Republicans to believe it was a hoax. Just 5 percent of the respondents, and this was uniform across party lines, believe the Paul McCartney conspiracy theory. Now that we’ve determined it was Sir Paul who sang on ""The Long and Winding Road,"" what about the health care poll? The Washington Post and ABC News joined forces in December to find out what Americans believe would be the impact of the health care law on their wallets. They specifically asked: ""Do you think your health care costs (are increasing) as a result of these changes to the health care system, (are decreasing), or are remaining about the same?"" Five percent said they expected their costs to decrease. Forty-seven percent said the costs would increase. Forty-four percent believe their costs will remain about the same. The remaining 4 percent had no opinion. About 1,000 people answered the question in a telephone poll, which was done between Dec. 12 and 15. The margin of error was 3.5 percent. So where does that leave us? Graves said this: ""More Americans believe the moon landing was fake than believe Obamacare is affordable."" One problem for Graves is the ABC News/Washington Post poll doesn’t actually use the word ""affordable."" There is a difference between saying you believe something will increase or decrease as opposed to whether a buyer considers something affordable. If you look solely at the percentage of respondents who say their health care costs will decrease and those in the PPP poll who say they believe the moon landing was faked, the congressman’s claim doesn’t seem out of this world. The numbers are close, though, and within the margin of error. The poll also clearly shows a lot of people think Obamacare will make health insurance more expensive, and a relatively few think that costs will come down. Graves has a point here. But it needs a lot of context to be properly understood.   We rate his statement Half True.  ",/factchecks/2014/jan/03/tom-graves/graves-compares-obamacare-affordability-belief-fak/

Bloggers say Obamacare coding system could usher in beheadings
","We’ve heard people give lots of reasons for opposing Obamacare. But until a reader sent us some Internet links recently, we hadn’t realized that one of the fears being spawned by Obamacare was that it could usher in legal beheadings across America. The reader pointed us to a variety of blog posts, such as one headlined, ""Obamacare Medical Codes Confirm: Execution by Beheading To Be Implemented in America."" As if this wasn’t scary enough, this post was accompanied by a photograph of a masked executioner swinging a curved sword downward, just inches from the neck of the condemned. What’s going on here? The idea appears to trace back to a Nov. 18, 2013, post by Lorri Anderson on the blog Freedom Outpost. Anderson’s piece was later reposted, excerpted or promoted uncritically on a range of other blogs. (It also received a thorough takedown by blogger David W. Thornton of the Atlanta Conservative Examiner.) Anderson cites a document known as ICD-9, which refers to the ninth update of the ""International Classification of Diseases."" ICD-9 is a lengthy list of medical conditions and causes of death published by the World Health Organization and used in the United States by medical professionals for billing purposes and by health statisticians who study causes of death. One of the categories in ICD-9 is this one: ""Legal execution: All executions performed at the behest of the judiciary or ruling authority (whether permanent or temporary) as: asphyxiation by gas, beheading, decapitation (by guillotine), capital punishment, electrocution, hanging, poisoning, shooting, other specified means."" Anderson wrote that the connection between the coding system, Obamacare and legal execution would ""make any American’s hair stand up on the back of their neck."" But if anything, subsequent posts on other websites destroyed any nuances she included. One even accompanied a blog post with a drawing of Uncle Sam with his head in a guillotine. The WHO’s coding system Here’s the reality about what the World Health Organization’s coding system does and doesn’t do. As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, the United States medical system currently uses ICD-9 and is in the process of transitioning to ICD-10. Doctors’ offices use the codes to fill out Medicare and Medicaid claims, among other things. Their billing and practice management software is based on them. Their employees are trained to use them. The transition to ICD-10 is somewhat controversial, though not because of beheading. The American Medical Association says that depending on the size of the medical practice, it’ll cost $83,290 to more than $2.7 million to switch. Doctors are dealing with so many other expensive regulatory changes, the association has begged since 2011 to delay or give up on the switch altogether. But the federal government is requiring American doctors, and any organization covered by the 1996 health care law known as HIPAA, to switch to ICD-10 by Oct. 1, 2014. That’s because because ICD-9 has outdated medical terms and not enough detail for accurate claims processing, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In fact, the rest of the world began switching to the new codes 20 years ago, and now most developed countries now use it. Why Obamacare isn’t implementing beheading So one can make a reasoned argument over details of how, or whether, the United States should transition to the new coding system. But the possibility of beheadings is just scare talk. Here are some of the problems: • A doctor can’t bill an insurer for a beheading. Obamacare -- a program that addresses health care for the living -- doesn’t have anything to do with beheading. The ""beheading"" category in the code is for the purposes of compiling death statistics, something the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention handles. The CDC uses the codes to make apples-to-apples comparisons with other countries. ""These coding rules improve the usefulness of mortality statistics by giving preference to certain categories, by consolidating conditions, and by systematically selecting a single cause of death from a reported sequence of conditions,"" the CDC says. • The ""beheading"" coding category long predates Obama. The coding for ""beheading"" has been standard in the U.S. since at least 1979, when the CDC adopted ICD-9 for the purposes of compiling death statistics. At that time, Obama was graduating high school. • There is no legal beheading in the United States today, and the president couldn’t change that even if he wanted to. The military uses only lethal injection, and the federal government essentially does as well. Lethal injections are also used in 35 states, with a dwindling number of states using electrocution, the gas chamber, hanging or a firing squad. Most of the methods other than lethal injection are secondary methods, either by choice or necessity. No state uses beheading. More importantly, as this summary makes clear, each state chooses its own method of execution, making the decision of what method to use beyond the reach for the federal government. The reason beheading is in the code at all is because it is a common method of execution in Saudi Arabia and some other countries, and is practiced by some militant and terrorist groups. So for an international coding system, beheading, for better or for worse, is needed. Our ruling Bloggers have recently offered posts headlined like this one: ""Obamacare Medical Codes Confirm: Execution by Beheading To Be Implemented in America."" But the coding system in question long predates Obama, and the ""beheading"" classification is only relevant for death statistics, not for insurance billing that would be under Obamacare’s purview. Finally, the beheading code is for statistical purposes, not for setting policy. Any change in legal execution methods would have to be approved by the states, not by the federal government.

Donna Brazile says the farm bill would reduce the deficit
","Political pundits had plenty of controversies to dish about during the final Sunday news shows of 2013. Over on CNN, talk turned to what State of the Union host Candy Crowley called the year’s ""unmoments,"" or initiatives left on the table because of congressional gridlock. Democratic pundit and roundtable guest Donna Brazile lamented how energy, immigration and agriculture policy reforms languished. ""For all these reasons, I mean, we couldn't get a farm bill out,"" Brazile said. ""Although it has a provision that would in many ways reduce the deficit. It would help farmers right away. Help the agriculture. Help people on food stamps. We didn't get the farm bill."" With omnipresent concern for the country’s financial constraints, we wanted to know: Would the 2013 versions of the farm bill (there were several floating around) reduce the deficit? Don’t let the name of the bill fool you: The legislation touches many corners of American agricultural policy, providing billions of dollars to some farmers in crop subsidies, not to mention its giant role in the country’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (better known as food stamps). Changes to the farm bill are renewed every five years, and it last passed in 2008 though some parts have been extended or reauthorized in the years since. Advocates, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, are hopeful it will pass in January. One consequence of inaction (which means reverting to rules set in 1949) is the price of milk could increase, farm advocates warn. The package proposed in 2013 comes with a big price tag, no matter whose bill you examine. The Senate passed a version in June that would spend $955 billion from 2014-23. The House passed its farm bill in two different pieces of legislation totaling $921 billion over a decade. There are vast differences among the bills, particularly with SNAP policy, but they do have one thing in common: Each would reduce the deficit, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It’s the job of CBO to estimate the cost of legislation so policymakers know the implications of their votes. For bills like the farm bill, CBO analysts use accepted economic forecasting methods to essentially make their best guess about how programs will affect the budget under existing law. The office projected the costs of each chamber’s farm bills since spring 2013, with new estimates coming later to account for amendments and other money-related changes tacked on during the lawmaking process. To give a big picture, the analysts make some assumptions about future policy. Their estimates for the farm bills, for example, assume that programs set to expire would be reauthorized without major changes in 2018 through 2023. Let’s start with CBO’s ""baseline."" The office assumed that if the programs in the farm bill continued in their current form over the next decade, it would cost $973 billion. In its May analysis, CBO found the Senate bill would reduce that total by $17.9 billion through 2023. In other words, it would have net-deficit reduction of almost $18 billion. The pair of House bills would go further, CBO found, reducing the deficit by a total of $51.9 billion. The House would cut about 10 times more in the food stamps program than the Senate ($4 billion versus $40 billion). We’re still waiting on final cost estimates from CBO because we’re still waiting on a final conference bill agreed to by representatives of both parties. Both bills rack up savings by cutting back on crop subsidy and conservation programs, including eliminating direct payments to farmers regardless of whether they are currently farming their land. That program costs about $5 billion a year and was conceived in 1996 as a temporary solution. The bill would spend some of the savings achieved from cutting those payments by investing into its crop insurance program and  allowing more farmers to get subsidies. As evidence for her claim, Brazile sent us her email correspondence with a Senate aide, who said the details are not firm, but the final version of the bill negotiated by representatives of the House and Senate will include about $20 billion in spending cuts from 2014-23. CBO projections for that bill are not yet available. Critics of the farm bill, like Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, find it silly when people brag about ""paltry"" cost savings that comes with legislation authorizing mammoth spending. The bill would save even more if it had just eliminated direct payments without expanding farm entitlement programs, Ellis said, such as one that would guarantee farmers 90 percent of their revenue in the event of a disaster. ""Technically, they’re right, there is the CBO score,"" Ellis said. ""It’s only in Washington where you can talk about spending $1 trillion and talk about how it’s saving you money."" Ellis pointed out that most of the savings anticipated by CBO come in 2018-23, which is after the farm bill being worked on now would expire. So about 70 percent of the anticipated savings in the Senate version, for instance, are based on the assumption that policy changes would continue in a future farm bill. His group has criticized CBO’s estimates for the costs of recent farm bills as much too rosy, with the final 10-year cost of recent farm bills coming in billions more than CBO projected. CBO addressed discrepancies like it in a Q&A.The office builds forecasts on current law, but lawmakers often change laws in ways that could significantly drive up the actual cost of legislation from what was projected, CBO says. Other times, legislation changes after CBO produced its projection. ""The differences between outcomes and projections can be misleading measures of the quality of the projections unless adjustments are made for changes in laws,"" the CBO said. Ferd Hoefner, National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition policy director, said it’s very hard to pin down the exact effect of the farm bill on the deficit because it depends in large part on the future prices of commodities. ""How can you guess what the price is going to be in 2020?"" he said. ""Will (the cuts) be as great as what the Congressional Budget Office predicts? Perhaps, but it’s hard to tell."" Our ruling Brazile said the farm bill ""has a provision that would in many ways reduce the deficit."" Her comment is based on estimates of the House and Senate bills by the Congressional Budget Office, which found both bills to be deficit-reducers in the long term. Over 10 years, the proposal would shrink the deficit by around $20 billion or so -- a paltry sum in the universe of federal spending. But yes, technically a deficit reducer. Brazile is right but her comments might lead someone to more sweeping conclusions. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/02/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-farm-bill-would-reduce-deficit/
"['Health Care', 'Taxes', 'PunditFact', 'Thom Hartmann']","
Hartmann: Not expanding Medicaid shortchanges state taxpayers
","Pundits extend well beyond the recognizable cable platforms of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. We recently found progressive pundit Thom Hartmann talking about the health care law on RT, an English-language cable network funded by the government of Russia. Hartmann, who hosts a show called The Big Picture, was discussing the decision of state lawmakers in 25 states not to expand Medicaid coverage as envisioned by the Affordable Care Act. He said the decision was motivated by politics (most of the states that opted out of the expansion are run by Republicans), and that it hurts state taxpayers. ""When Rick Perry says to the people of Texas that he’s not going to accept money from the federal government to pay for the expansion of Medicaid, what he’s really saying, to his own people, the people of Texas, ‘Naw, you can’t have your own tax dollars back’,"" Hartmann said. ""He’s saying, ‘No, you can't have your money back’ because sabotaging the president is more important than letting you have affordable health care. And what’s worse is, the people who live in states that aren’t accepting the Medicaid expansion will still have the pay the taxes to foot the bill for the expansion in other states."" We wanted to explore Hartmann’s argument that Republican state lawmakers have refused ""to give the people of their own states their own tax dollars back in the form of (expanded) Medicaid."" (If you’re interested in learning more about RT, formerly Russia Today, we suggest you start with this article from the Columbia Journalism Review.) Terms of Medicaid expansion Medicaid is a federal-state partnership to provide health care primarily to poorer Americans. The program is managed by states but funded through a combination of federal and state dollars. Who pays what varies, but generally the federal government contributes more than the states. While the health care law does not change the funding structure for people already enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid, it does offer states a deal in exchange for adding new people to the system. For new enrollees, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs for three years. (States would have to pay for some administrative costs.) After that, states would be asked to pay some costs, but never more than 10 percent. If every state expanded its Medicaid program, the federal government would spend about $800 billion  between 2013 and 2022, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. States would be on the hook for about $8 billion. Looking at the first three years Analysts are more confident about how the deal between the participating states and Washington will play out during the first three years than they are beyond that. So we’ll consider Hartmann’s claim in two pieces. We spoke to three experts who have looked closely at precisely the question of whether Medicaid expansion is a good move for the states. Their conclusions differ on the benefits overall, but during the first three years, they all agree. States come out ahead. Joe Antos, a health economist with the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think-tank that generally criticizes the Affordable Care Act, does not believe expansion is a good idea in the long run. But simply in terms of dollars in and dollars out, the first three years are different for the participating states. ""They get money they wouldn't have gotten otherwise,"" Antos said. ""Some from their own citizens, some from citizens in other states."" Sherry Glied, dean of the Graduate School of Public Service at New York University agreed. ""States that are not participating are sending their taxpayers' money to leave the state without getting anything back in return,"" Glied said. Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, an academic research center in Washington, amplified Glied’s point. The health care law is paid for by taxes and fees affecting wealthier households and players in the health care industry such as makers of medical devices and insurance companies. It also limits payments to doctors and hospitals. ""The pain of the Affordable Care Act is locked in,"" Dorn said. ""The only thing you can change is the gain. If you implement the expansion, you get the full benefit."" Our experts said Hartmann’s claim would look differently if every state agreed to expand its Medicaid program, because some states would be ""winners"" and others would be ""losers"" based on how many people signed up. But as things stand today, non-participating states are underwriting the cost of care in participating states. ""I suspect the people of Texas don’t know that their tax dollars are going to places like Vermont or New York,"" Dorn said. Beyond the first three years So experts agree that in the first three years, Hartmann is right: People in states that refuse to expand Medicaid will lose their share of tax dollars. But what about in year four and beyond? Most states that have turned down the federal government’s offer to expand Medicaid say they are worried about the out years when states must share some of the costs. By saying no, some states might save their taxpayers some money. That savings, however, is likely not enough in most cases to offset the contributions state taxpayers are sending to the federal government, two of our experts told us. Expanding Medicaid, for instance, will likely reduce other areas of state spending, particularly other health care programs the state operate. And in certain cases, the federal government plans on paying a larger share for the care of current Medicaid recipients. In Virginia, analysts concluded that Medicaid expansion by itself would cost the state but the economic boost from the influx of federal dollars would more than offset those costs. Antos, who does not favor expansion, said the final tally whether the Medicaid expansion is a net benefit or cost will vary from state to state. ""It depends on the number and incomes of taxpayers in the state, the number of people who become eligible with the expansion who actually sign up, and the cost of services they use,"" he said. Glied led a group that focused on Medicaid expansion in a study for the Commonwealth Fund, a Massachusetts foundation that funds health policy research. Their conclusions suggested states would do well to participate. ""The state economy as a whole is always better off with the expanded program because state tax payments are never close to the federal Medicaid payment,"" Glied said. Dorn worked on a report that looked at how 10 states assessed whether they should participate. ""In every state that did a detailed analysis, and there were six that did, they gained,"" Dorn said.""But does that necessarily mean that every state would? No. It’s a very state specific question."" Our ruling Hartmann said that by rejecting an expansion to Medicaid, Republican state lawmakers are not allowing their residents to get their own tax dollars back. That is most accurate for the first three years of the program when the federal government pays 100 percent of the cost of care for newly enrolled people. Beyond that point, the results could vary. While it is always true that wealthier taxpayers in all states pay into the program and that the only way to get some of that back is through participating in the expansion, that doesn’t mean that in every state, the total tax burden due to Medicaid wouldn’t rise over the long haul. There is a body of studies that point to gains for the states, but a range of outcomes is possible. Hartmann did not address the longer term uncertainties. PunditFact uses predictions about the future very cautiously. We put more weight on what is known in the short term than what is projected many years out. In this case, the first three years clearly support Hartmann’s claim and the period beyond that is subject to debate. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/31/thom-hartmann/hartmann-not-expanding-medicaid-shortchanges-state/
"['Georgia', 'County Government', 'Kimberly Nelson']","
Commission form statement is true
","An interesting discussion has begun in one of Georgia’s largest counties concerning what form of government is best to serve its 700,000 residents. DeKalb County interim CEO Lee May recently held a series of town hall meetings to talk about its current structure. May wants to end the county’s existing form of government, particularly the CEO position. He has said he’d explore the possibility of a full-time county commission or a full-time commission chair. Any such changes must be approved by the Georgia Legislature, which may review proposals in the upcoming session. May brought University of North Carolina School of Government associate professor Kimberly Nelson to the town hall meetings to explain the forms of government used across the country. One form of county government, she said, is as antiquated as the VCR. ""The commission form of government is definitely losing favor in the United States,"" Nelson said at a Dec. 3 forum held at Rehoboth Presbyterian Church in Tucker. PolitiFact Georgia was at the meeting. We wanted to figure out if what Nelson told the audience was correct. DeKalb’s seven commission seats technically are part-time jobs, although many commissioners argue they work full time. In addition to the publicly elected commissioners, DeKalb has a chief executive officer who is elected by the voters and is in charge of the county’s operations. While commissioners approve some contracts and the annual budget, the CEO wields great power. For example, the CEO can change purchasing policy without the approval of commissioners. Many say that is the most unique form of county government in Georgia. Most U.S. counties use one of three forms of government. The largest number of counties use the ""commission"" form, in which a board of commissioners -- or sometimes a lone commissioner -- runs the county’s day-to-day operations. The second is the ""administrator/manager"" form of government, by which commissioners hire someone to run the county’s operations, like Cobb County’s current structure. The third is the ""elected executive"" form where county residents vote for someone to lead and run the government, much like DeKalb’s current structure. Nelson handed out fliers that contained a breakdown of which forms of governments were used by the nation’s 3,000 or so counties in 1989 and in 2001. Government type 1989 2001 Commission 61.5% 55.4% Commissioner-administrator/manager 25.4% 31.6% Elected executive 13.1% 13.0%   ""The CEO form and the administrator form are both considered reforms from the traditional commission form of county government. So, in most states, any change is a change away from the commission form,"" Nelson told us via email. The breakdown was done by the National Association of Counties. Nelson told PolitiFact Georgia she had a more recent breakdown, but she hadn’t had a chance to finish scrubbing the data for any potential errors. The National Association of Counties released its latest such report in March 2009, based on data collected in 2008. Our state-by-state review of the report found that the commission form of government was used by about 42 percent of U.S. counties. Approximately 34 percent of counties use the administrator/manager form of government, while 21 percent have an elected executive form of government. The remaining 3 percent have miscellaneous forms of government. Our review of the 2009 report shows, as Nelson said, there is a decrease in the percentage of counties that currently use a traditional commission form of government. An elected executive form of government is also on the rise. In Georgia, about two-thirds of the state’s 159 counties use the administrator/manager form, according to the 2009 report. ""The transition has moved to more professional management and less traditional management,"" said Dave Willis, government relations manager of the Association County Commissioners of Georgia. More counties are moving toward hiring an administrator because of the array of duties associated with operating a county government, said National Association of Counties spokesman Jim Phillips. ""As things get more complicated and counties have more services to provide, they move to an administrator instead of an elected board,"" he said. Some other metro Atlanta counties are having as much trouble as DeKalb concerning which form of government is best. In Clayton, for example, commissioners decided in January to remove the county manager position, which gave Commission Chairman Jeff Turner more power. Turner hired a chief operating officer and a chief financial officer. By November, commissioners were talking about restoring the county manager position. In Fulton County, leaders there have discussed elevating the commission chair's authority while making it tougher to fire the county manager. State lawmakers may take up both proposals in next year's legislative session, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. To sum up, Nelson said at a DeKalb County town hall meeting on the current structure of county government that ""the commission form of government is definitely losing favor in the United States."" Anecdotal information and the most comprehensive report on counties support her point. Our rating: True.  ",/factchecks/2013/dec/31/kimberly-nelson/commission-form-statement-true/
"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Paul Broun']","
Broun's attack on Kingston earmarks too broad
","For years, pork was the preferred meat of Congress. Lawmakers pulled money from the federal budget for various projects in their congressional districts without having to compete in the open bidding system of the federal departments. Critics derisively called the process pork. The official term was ""earmarks."" Congress voted to abstain from pork in 2010, but one candidate is attempting to make it an issue in one of Georgia’s most interesting political races. ""(Jack Kingston) had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together,"" U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republican, said of his GOP colleague, who is from Savannah, in an interview. Broun and Kingston are part of a crowded field of Republicans vying for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination, with the primary scheduled for May 2014. The incumbent, Saxby Chambliss, has announced his plans to retire. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider column reported about Broun’s comments and mused, ""If you listen closely, you can hear Politifact hounds baying in the distance."" We’re baying. Broun has been a vocal critic of earmarks and, apparently, is hoping to live high on the hog by criticizing Kingston on the issue. Kingston said criticism of the practice prodded him to trim back his own requests, the AJC reported in July 2008. The AJC article reported Kingston’s concerns that other states would get more money for various projects if Georgia lawmakers demurred from seeking earmarks. Broun spokeswoman Christine Hardman said the congressman based his claim by examining several databases created by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group. The nonprofit has staffers who’ve worked for Democrats and Republicans. Broun, though, made a mistake in his interview with the Tea Party News Network. ""What Congressman Broun should have clarified was that at one point, Congressman Kingston had more earmarks than the entire Republican Georgia delegation combined,"" Hardman told us via email. PolitiFact Georgia was still curious about where Kingston stood in comparison to his GOP colleagues when it comes to earmarks. The Taxpayers for Common Sense website has databases for the federal fiscal years 2008 through 2010 that allow users to conduct searches to see how much money each member of Congress pulled in through earmarks. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. Our review of the databases shows Kingston had more solo earmarks than his Georgia Republican colleagues in fiscal years 2008 and 2010. In 2008, Kingston had 21 earmarks that totaled about $17 million. His GOP colleagues from Georgia had 19 earmarks that totaled approximately $13 million. In fiscal year 2010, we found 18 solo earmarks for Kingston that totaled $24.3 million. The Republicans from Georgia had 15 earmarks that totaled $7.6 million. In fiscal year 2008, the Democrats from the Georgia congressional delegation recorded 48 individual earmarks that totaled about $26.5 million. In 2010, Democratic lawmakers from Georgia collected 65 earmarks worth a total of $33.5 million. The totals from the Democrats alone were higher than Kingston’s total. PolitiFact Georgia also reviewed the earmarks database of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit organization that follows the money in Washington. The center is funded by foundation grants and individual donations and does not accept money from corporations, labor unions, or trade associations. The center’s totals were slightly different than what we found on the Taxpayers for Common Sense website. One commonality was that Kingston’s solo earmarks total did not exceed the entire Georgia delegation in 2008 or 2010. One difference we found was that Georgia’s GOP delegation had more solo earmarks and brought home more money in fiscal year 2008 than Kingston did. In 2010, we found Kingston had more earmarks and more money from those earmarks than the Republican delegation. So where does this all lead us? Broun meant to say Kingston had more earmarks at one point than the entire Georgia Republican delegation. Broun might have received a True if he had said that in the interview. It appears that Kingston had scored more earmarks than the entire Georgia GOP delegation to Congress in 2010 from our examination of two separate databases. Broun, however, misspoke in the interview, giving anyone who viewed it the wrong impression of Kingston’s record on earmarks. We rate his statement False.  ",/factchecks/2013/dec/30/paul-broun/brouns-attack-kingston-earmarks-too-broad/

Mayoral candidate Brett Smiley says Providence is 183rd safest of U.S. cities with more than 100,000 people
","When Democratic mayoral candidate Brett Smiley unveiled his plan for combating crime in Providence, he sought to drive home the need for new approaches to crime and policing. ""Of all cities in the United States with more than 100,000 people, Providence is the 183rd safest,"" he said. ""Last year, major cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Dallas all had lower crime rates than Providence. This is unacceptable, and it has to change."" Smiley’s campaign said they got the figures by combining statistics in the FBI’s most recent annual compilation of crime figures from across the country. Each year, the agency releases ""Crime in the United States,"" prepared by the agency’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program. It tracks a range of violent and non-violent crimes, tabulating how many of them occurred across the country. The figures can be analyzed in a number of ways, such as by individual crimes and by how many crimes occurred per thousand residents.   The figures are organized by state, and, within each state, by individual cities or towns with more than 100,000 residents. Every time the agency releases its national crime statistics, analysts and organizations across the country break down the state-by-state data and reassemble them into one large database. Often, the information is to sorted by number of crimes reported per 1,000 residents. Hence, the ""safest cities""  the United States list. Based on the 2012 FBI statistics, Providence comes in at 183rd among 279 cities with populations of 100,000 or more. In first place is Cary, N.C., while Chicago is last. So Smiley is right on the numbers. But on its website announcing the release of the Uniform Crime Reports, the FBI makes it very clear it wishes people wouldn’t compare the cities that way. ""Each year when ‘Crime in the United States’ is published, many entities — news media, tourism agencies, and other groups with an interest in crime in our nation — use reported figures to compile rankings of cities and counties,"" the agency says. Those rankings, it says, don’t consider other variables, such as economic and demographic factors, that affect crime rates. Such rankings ""lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with their residents,"" the FBI statement said. Emphasizing the point in boldface and italic print, the FBI websites closes with a caveat that ""the data user is, therefore, cautioned against comparing statistical data of individual reporting units from cities, counties, metropolitan areas, states, or colleges or universities solely on the basis of their population coverage or student enrollment."" In other words, exactly what Smiley did. In his defense, he is far from the alone. For instance, in Cary, N.C. officials were quick to credit law enforcement’s close relationship with the community for its putative title as 2012’s safest city in the United States. Naperville, Ill., has done the same thing over the years. Other municipalities in the top ten likewise had officials or organizations that touted their rankings. Our ruling Mayoral candidate Brett Smiley said, ""Of all cities in the United States with more than 100,000 people, Providence is the 183rd safest."" He accurately quoted the city’s ranking. But the FBI, the source of the raw data, warns that such rankings can produce out-of-context impressions.

Assemblyman David Rible says Gov. Chris Christie hasn't raised taxes
","Some gubernatorial sound bites never die – they just become fodder for other politicians, it seems, even if the facts behind them are a bit questionable. Take, for example, a comment that Assembly Conference Leader David Rible (R-Monmouth) said during a Nov. 30 panel discussion on NJTV’s ‘On The Record with Michael Aron’ program. Rible appeared with Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. (D-Burlington/Camden) and Sens. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) and Bob Singer (R-Ocean) to discuss Gov. Chris Christie’s attempt to unseat Sen. Tm Kean Jr. (R-Union) as minority leader, as well as other political topics. ""This governor has given us continual balanced budgets without raising taxes,"" Rible told Aron in response to the host’s question about the likelihood of Christie’s success in having the Legislature approve a tax cut. Christie first floated the idea two years ago, but Democrats, who control the Legislature, have nixed the idea because they said the state can’t afford it. Rible’s claim is neither new nor original. Christie himself has said it on multiple occasions. And like Christie, Rible’s left out a few important details that we’ll explain again. It is true that Christie has produced continual balanced budgets since taking office in January 2010. But that’s nothing special. State law requires every governor to do it, so it’s hardly a singular, significant achievement. And the claim about not raising taxes is questionable. While the rates for corporation, income and sales taxes – the three biggest sources of revenue in New Jersey -- have not increased under Christie, his slashing of funding for tax credit programs has had the same effect as tax increases, experts have said. The state’s Treasury Department has disagreed with that assessment, particularly in the case of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which Christie cut during his first year in office. New Jersey at one time sent checks to homeowners and certain low-income individuals with the goal for that money to be used toward tax bills. The checks – what Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn has said amounted to subsidies for very low-income people -- eventually became credits on their bills instead, and at lower amounts. Christie also cut two tax credit programs, the Homestead Benefit Program among them, giving recipients less than what they received previously. In some cases, some taxpayers are receiving less than half of what was once an average $1,000 rebate. State Treasury Department officials argued that these tax credit programs are payments from the state and so reductions in credits do not represent tax increases. Of the 2010 EITC cut, Quinn has noted that more than 76 percent of EITC recipients that year owed no New Jersey tax. But experts with The George Washington University, the University of Connecticut and the University of California Davis School of Law, have said funding cuts in tax credit programs are essentially tax increases because those recipients end up with less money to put toward their tax bills. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, has said it’d be wrong to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. ""They have elements of both and are strictly neither,"" Joseph Henchman, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of legal and state projects, has told us. Rible could not be reached for comment. Our ruling Rible said during a panel discussion, ""This governor has given us continual balanced budgets without raising taxes."" There’s varying degrees of accuracy here. The governor has given New Jersey balanced budgets, but the law requires it. And while Christie hasn’t hiked the rates for the three biggest revenue-generating taxes in the state, he has cut some programs that experts say are essentially the same as tax increases because people have less money as a result to offset tax bills. For these reasons, we rate Rible’s claim Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.",/factchecks/2013/dec/29/david-rible/assemblyman-david-rible-says-gov-chris-christie-ha/

Sheldon Whitehouse: most Republicans agree Earth is warming; tea party accounts for most denial
","During his weekly floor speeches on climate change, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has been promoting the idea that congressional Republicans who blocked climate change legislation are out of touch with Republicans throughout the United States. On Nov. 25, PolitiFact Rhode Island gave a Mostly True ruling on Whitehouse’s claim that, in a poll, ""53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'"" Whitehouse repeated his assertion about young Republicans in a slightly different way during his Dec. 17 speech on climate, his 53rd, focusing on the attitudes of the tea party faction of the Republican Party. He cited a poll that looked at all Republicans, not just those under age 35. ""Another national survey, this one by the Pew Research Center, found that most -- 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans -- actually agree, actually agree there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' with a plurality saying it is 'mostly because of humans,'"" Whitehouse said. ""But the tea partiers are different,"" he added. ""Seventy percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'No solid evidence' the earth is warming. And 41 percent of tea partiers assert that warming is 'Just not happening.'"" ""Unfortunately here in Congress,"" he said later in the speech, ""the dark, heavy hand of the polluters is helping the tea party drive the Republican Party off the cliff."" Was Whitehouse correctly characterizing the attitudes of Republicans in general and members of the tea party in particular? We went back to the Pew survey to look at those numbers. Pew conducted the poll of 1,504 adults from Oct. 9-13, 2013; 655 said they were Republicans or leaned Republican, and 304 of them identified with the tea party. Asked whether there is ""solid evidence the earth is warming,"" 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans said yes; just 25 percent of tea party supporters said yes. (The margin of error for tea party numbers is plus or minus 6.5 percentage points and 6.2 percentage points for non-tea party Republicans. So Whitehouse quoted the findings accurately, within the margin of error. Whitehouse was also correct when he said that 70 percent of tea party members responding said there is no solid evidence that Earth is warming, with 41 percent saying it's just not happening. In contrast, a mere 13 percent of other Republicans said it's ""just not happening."" Yet just because Republicans think there's good evidence that Earth is warming doesn't mean they think human activity is responsible. That's an important point to consider when looking at whether members of the GOP support trying to do something to reverse the trend. Among non-tea party Republicans who thought the planet is warming, nearly 40 percent said it was due to natural patterns. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said that ""61 percent of non-tea party Republicans actually agree . . . there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' . . . [but] 70 percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'no solid evidence' the earth is warming."" The senator was accurately quoting the results of the October Pew poll. But there's more to the story if you want to understand the ongoing opposition to climate change legislation by supporters of the GOP. While many non-tea party Republicans acknowledge that climate change is occurring, a majority (54 percent) still either deny climate change or think it is part of a natural cycle not caused by human activity. That's an important factor to consider, which Whitehouse omitted. For that reason, we rate his statement Mostly True.

Olens deserves some blame for immigration ruling, opponent says
","
Republican Georgia attorney general candidate Preston Smith said he knows who should share some blame for last week's decision by a federal judge to block key portions of Arizona's new immigration law: Sam Olens, the former chairman of Cobb County's Board of Commissioners.

So how did a politician from Georgia play a role in a highly controversial legal case in Arizona that has become a centerpiece in the battle over illegal immigration?

Here is Smith's logic: Olens helped get Bill Clinton elected president in 1992. Clinton, a Democrat, nominated Susan Bolton, the Arizona judge who made the ruling on July 28.

These are Smith's words from a July 28 news release: ""It should be no surprise that Judge Bolton is a Bill Clinton appointee; so in part, we have my opponent Sam Olens to thank for nonsense like this since he was on the team that got Clinton elected.""

That's ridiculous, says the Olens campaign.

""To mention Sam Olens' name in relation to Judge Bolton's ruling is comical at best,"" said Sheri Kell, a spokeswoman for Olens.

Olens and Smith are locked in the Aug. 10 runoff for the Republican Party's nomination for attorney general. For weeks, Smith has tried to convince Republican voters that Olens is no true conservative. During one debate, Smith said Olens was part of the Clinton campaign.

His evidence? A 1992 Marietta Daily Journal article that reported Olens was a member of a group called the Cobb Chapter of the Clinton for President Committee and treasurer of the Cobb Democratic Party.

Kell said Olens was erroneously listed as a member of the committee. Marietta Daily Journal editorial page editor Joe Kirby, who wrote the article in 1992, told PolitiFact Georgia that Olens never protested the article's accuracy.

A 1997 Atlanta Journal-Constitution article noted Olens was treasurer of Cobb's Democratic Party nearly seven years before that. Thomas Thrash, who was Cobb's Democratic Party chairman in 1992, asked Olens to be the party's treasurer, Kirby said. Thrash is now a federal judge in Atlanta.

Olens said he considered himself a political independent around that time and sometimes voted for Democrats. Olens says he ""matured"" and he found himself aligned with Republican Party's principles. Olens ran as a Republican for the Cobb County Commission in 1998 and later as chairman, Cobb election officials said. There's no record of him ever running as a Democrat.

Bolton's decision Wednesday delayed provisions requiring immigrants to carry their papers and banned illegal immigrants from soliciting employment in public places.

Whatever Olens did to assist the Clinton effort, it didn't seem to help much in Cobb. George H.W. Bush trounced Clinton by a 20-point margin in Cobb, Georgia Secretary of State records show. Clinton did carry Georgia, narrowly defeating Bush by a margin of less than 1 percent.

Clinton nominated Bolton as a U.S. district judge in Arizona in July 2000, his last full year in office, after being re-elected in 1996. Multiple media sources report Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona recommended to Clinton that he nominate Bolton. Kyl released a statement disagreeing with the court ruling.

Adam Clemons, a campaign spokesman for Smith, defended his candidate's claim in an e-mail to PolitiFact Georgia.

""It is a verifiable fact that Sam Olens worked to get Bill Clinton elected, which led to the appointment of activist judges, such as Judge Bolton and others, that strike down constitutionally sound, politically popular legislation like the Arizona law, based on their personal views,"" Clemons wrote.

Clinton won the presidency in 1992, but it doesn't look like any efforts in Cobb County helped. Clinton lost the county by a wide margin, so we think it's a major stretch to say ""we have Sam Olens to thank"" for Clinton getting elected. Keep in mind that presidential terms are four years, so Clinton had to be re-elected in 1996 in order to nominate Bolton in 2000. Clinton lost the state of Georgia in 1996 by 1.2 percentage points.

PolitiFact Georgia finds Smith's statement verges on the ridiculous. We don't see how he connected the dots to conclude Olens had a role, in part, in Bolton's appointment. Our conclusion: Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2010/aug/02/preston-smith/olens-deserves-some-blame-immigration-ruling-oppon/
"['Rhode Island', 'Elections', 'Catherine Taylor']","
Taylor says voters haven't been adequately informed about the master lever
","
There's a lot of confusion over the master lever in Rhode Island general elections, in part because nobody seems able to clearly explain how it works.

For the uninitiated, the master lever is actually a space on the ballot that, if filled in, automatically casts votes for all candidates of a particular party. (The phrase comes from the days of voting machines when there was actually a big lever voters could pull to make a straight-party-line vote.)

It's typically used by about 20 percent of voters and three times more often among Democrats than Republicans, which reflects the ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans in the state.

Reform groups don't like the lever because they want people to vote for each candidate, not a party. All of the candidates for governor support eliminating it, and Robert Healey, running as an independent for lieutenant governor, has filed a federal lawsuit challenging it.

In discussions of the master lever in recent weeks, we've heard some misleading statements, including from incumbent Secretary of State Ralph Mollis, about how the master lever works. Some could be interpreted to mean that if you use the master lever and then vote for a candidate of another party, all your master lever votes will be lost.

Holy disenfranchisement!

On WHJJ's Helen Glover Show, Republican Catherine Taylor, who is running for Mollis' job, offered one of the better explanations we've heard and argued that information about the quirks of the master lever should be listed on the ballot

But then Taylor said there's a reason people don't understand the issue: ""No one tells them. There's nothing in the voting instructions that we've been getting in the last several elections that lets you know.""

First, with some candidates giving the impression that the master lever robs you of some votes, here are the key points you need to know:

1.) If you just mark the master lever and then put your ballot in the scanner, all members of the party you choose get a vote.

2.) However, if there are nonpartisan races on the ballot, none of those candidates will receive your vote. You have to mark them separately.

3.) The same is true for any referendum questions.

4.) If you use the master lever, you can still vote for candidates outside the party. Thus, if you mark the master lever for Party A, you can still vote for members of Party B or Party C in individual races. The computer ignores your master lever selection in those races. Voting outside Party A does not negate all your master-lever votes, only the ones you want it to.

5.) There's an important exception. In some local races, voters are offered more than one choice. You may be asked to select, for example, three members for the School Committee, and there could be up to three people from each party to choose from.

In that case, if there are three candidates from Party A and you use the Party A master lever, all three will get your vote.

But if you chose just one candidate from Party B, none of the School Committee candidates from Party A will get your vote. After all, the computer has no way of knowing which two of the three Party A candidates you favor. Thus, you must indicate the two Party A candidates you want for that contest.

Your Party A votes are unaffected for other races, according to Chris Barnett, Secretary of State Mollis' communications director, who said the system is repeatedly tested just before each election to make sure the votes in such races are divvied up correctly.

How do we know this?

We checked with Mollis' office and Barnett to confirm how the machines are programmed. 

More to the point, we got copies of voter handbooks, mailed to all registered voters by the secretary of state's office, going back to the 1998 election, the first year the electronic scanners were put in place.

It turns out that the early instructions failed to emphasize all the quirks people needed to know if they used the master lever. But beginning in 2002, the handbook instructions became quite clear.

We asked Taylor's campaign about her claim. It responded by acknowledging that the handbooks are useful documents, but that information ""does not reach every voter . . . not every voter reads the handbook, and it is difficult to reach voters with no fixed address. They are not a reliable way of telling voters the critical point: that their votes may not count if they pull the master lever.""

The Taylor campaign went even further in a July 26 press release, which said that voters need to be warned that ""by choosing the master lever, they will not be able to cast a vote in many nonpartisan or multi-choice local races."" That's dead wrong.

In fact they can vote and their votes always count, with only one exception -- when a voter goes outside the party in contests where you can make more than one choice, they have to take extra care to mark the party members they want for that particular office.    

Taylor makes a good point when she says the master-lever issues should be addressed on each ballot or in polling places. But her contention that the issues have not been addressed in the voting instructions of the last several elections turns out to be dead wrong as well.

A candidate running for secretary of state should know that, so we give her a False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/02/catherine-taylor/taylor-says-voters-havent-been-adequately-informed/
"['Georgia', 'Crime', 'Kasim Reed']","
Mayor said Atlanta posted big crime drops when new APD Chief Turner was interim boss
","
George Turner won his post as Atlanta police chief after a whirlwind of accomplishment.

By the time Mayor Kasim Reed announced Turner's nomination July 9, the veteran city cop had spent seven months as the department's interim leader.

Under his command, officers were closing more cases, Reed said. Recruitment was up. Best of all, crime was down. Way down.

Overall, it dropped 14 percent from the same period last year, according to a July 9 press release from the mayor's office announcing Turner's selection. Property crime sank 12.3 percent.

And the reduction in violent crime was even more dramatic, according to the press release: 22.7 percent.

That's why Reed decided he needed to keep Turner as head of the Atlanta Police Department, the release said. 

""The results we are seeing suggest we are moving in the right direction and I want to build on the progress we have made,"" the release quoted Reed as saying.

The City Council approved Turner unanimously last Tuesday. 

A nearly 23 percent drop in violent crime? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a deeper look.

Reducing crime was one of Reed's central campaign promises. He tapped Turner to help him fulfill it.

Nationally, crime is at historic lows. Violent crime dropped across the country by 5.5 percent in 2009, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation figures. In Atlanta last year, it fell 14 percent. Police don't control broad crime-producing factors such as city demographics or the economy, but researchers have demonstrated that certain law enforcement strategies can cut crime.

The mayor's press release gives the impression that the crime calculations are based upon a monthly report compiled by Atlanta police with data that they send to the FBI. The FBI uses the numbers to issue the agency's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), which give yearly and semiannual snapshots of crime nationwide.

The press release cited the UCR figures from April, about two months before Reed nominated Turner as the Atlanta's new chief.

A PolitiFact Georgia analysis shows the mayor's crime numbers don't add up. The city's own figures don't match the press release.

One problem is that the press release understated the actual drop in overall crime and property crime, which were 16 percent and 17 percent, according to the UCR data.

The bigger problem is that the city overstated the drop in violent crime -- murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. It fell only 16 percent. That's about one-third less than the 22.7 percent the mayor took credit for.

Violent crimes tend to worry people the most, so PolitiFact Georgia decided to do more checking.

Police provided crime numbers to PolitiFact Georgia from their Command Operation Briefings to Revitalize Atlanta program. Commanders regularly use COBRA data to analyze crime trends.

These numbers are slightly different from UCR figures because the FBI asks agencies to calculate crime in a very specific way. But if crime drops dramatically by one measure, the second should show a similar decrease.

We reviewed the COBRA figures from Jan. 4, when Turner started as interim chief, through July 9, when Reed announced he wanted him to be the permanent head. 

They show overall and property crime were down by roughly the same amount as the release stated: 13 percent and 14 percent.

But the news the COBRA figures held for violent crime was even worse than what the UCR indicated. That category dropped 11 percent. That's less than half what the mayor's office said.

So why the major difference?

The mayor's press release used a different set of figures: ""rolling monthly averages,"" a spokeswoman said. It's a way of organizing data to smooth out unusual crime spikes or drops that can obscure an overall trend.

For instance, to get December 2009's rolling monthly average, you'd average the UCR crime totals from January 2009 through December 2009. The mayor's office determined violent crime dropped 22.7 percent by comparing averages from April 2009 and April 2010.

The problem is that April 2010 rolling monthly averages incorporate crime dynamics that were in play as far back as May 2009, well before Turner was interim chief. A spokeswoman for the mayor's office acknowledges they didn't use the proper figures and said they will in the future cite COBRA and UCR data when they discuss crime trends in public.

The mayor's office also noted another problem: The 22.7 number was wrong. It should be a 16 percent decrease. After PolitiFact Georgia questioned City Hall about the numbers, they realized they entered the data incorrectly.

Still, city spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs Dade said that this is a good-size decline.

""We think those numbers really do represent a significant decrease in crime since January 2010,"" Dade said.

Where does this leave us?

The nearly 23 percent drop in violent crime was among Reed's key arguments for making Turner the city's new police chief. It appeared repeatedly in news accounts as evidence of his qualifications.

If you zero in on the precise dates between Turner's appointment as interim chief and the announcement of his selection, violent crime dropped only 11 percent.

Furthermore, the city acknowledged that the ""rolling monthly average"" method cited was not the most appropriate one to use when officials talk to the public about crime. 

Despite the city's mathematical errors, the fact remains that crime is down.

But this doesn't erase the fact that the city got the violent crime statistic wrong. And it used the wrong type of data to begin with.

We rate Reed's statement Barely True.

Michael Sullivan says NASA administrator said main mission is Muslim outreach
","
Texas activist Michael Sullivan spiced a July 19 Twitter post on the 41st anniversary of Apollo 11 entering lunar orbit by adding: ""NASA dir says main mission is Muslim outreach."" 
America's space agency shifts its gaze from the final frontier to Mecca; who knew? 
Sullivan, president and ceo of Empower Texans, which describes itself as a pro free-market group, replied to our inquiry with several Web links including one to a July 6 post on FoxNews.com stating NASA Administrator and former astronaut Charles Bolden stressed reaching out to the Muslim world in a June interview. 
The post says: ""Bolden created a firestorm after telling Al Jazeera last month that President (Barack) Obama told him before he took the job that he wanted him to do three things: inspire children to learn math and science, expand international relationships and ‘perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science ... and math and engineering.’"" 
The post continues: ""Officials from the White House and NASA on Tuesday stood by Bolden's statement that part of his mission is to improve relations with Muslim countries -- though NASA backed off the claim that such international diplomacy is Bolden's ‘foremost’ responsibility."" 
Again, FoxNews: ""Bob Jacobs, NASA's assistant administrator for public affairs, …said that Bolden was speaking of priorities when it came to ‘outreach’ and not about NASA's primary missions of ‘science, aeronautics and space exploration.’ He said the ‘core mission’ is exploration and that it was unfortunate Bolden's comments are now being viewed through a ‘partisan prism.’"" 
About a week later, The Washington Post quoted White House spokesman Robert Gibbs saying Bolden wasn't expected to reach out to the Muslim world. ""That was not his task,"" a July 12 blog on the newpaper's site quotes Gibbs saying, ""and that's not the task of NASA."" Gibbs also is quoted saying White House officials had since spoken to Bolden and NASA about his comments. 
Also shared by Sullivan: A July 15 blog post by InformationWeek, a business technology site, stating that in June, Bolden visited Qatar and Egypt, ""saying that the countries would collaborate with the United States in the future on science and technology programs, noting global education initiatives sponsored by NASA, and saying that NASA was looking to Egyptian scientists to help analyze astrophysics data. This is all part of a larger Obama administration effort, announced last June in Cairo by the president himself, to change U.S. relations with the Muslim world through outreach and cooperation,"" the post states. 
We launched our own review, first confirming that Bolden made his statement about Obama’s expectations, according to Al Jazeera’s video post of the interview, which aired June 30. 
Asked why he's in the Middle East, Bolden replies that he was there around the anniversary of President Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo vowing a new beginning in U.S. relations with the Muslim world. Bolden next lists the ""three things"" he says Obama charged him to do, including, ""perhaps foremost,"" engaging much more with dominantly Muslim nations and getting ""more people who can contribute to the things that we do,"" citing as past examples Russian and Japanese contributions to the International Space Station. 
""There is much to be gained by drawing in the contributions that are possible from the Muslim nations,"" he says. 
But the interview covers more ground. The four-time visitor to outer space defends his decision to focus NASA on international exploration of deep space plus his desire to use robots to deflect incoming asteroids away from Earth. Bolden said if an asteroid made of metal struck Earth, it could cause another Ice Age: ""Instead of the extinction of the dinosaurs, it would be the extinction of human man."" (Talk about a missed tweet.) 
Next, we contacted NASA. Spokesman Michael Cabbage said in an e-mail: ""NASA’s core mission remains one of space exploration, science and aeronautics. Administrator Bolden regrets that a statement he made during a recent interview mischaracterized that core mission. The success of NASA’s efforts is increasingly enhanced by mutual cooperation with dozens of other countries around the world that are also committed to these efforts."" 
Does Sullivan's Twitter post make a successful landing?

Bolden said the president encouraged him to ""find a way to reach out to the Muslim world"" -- a goal he described as ""perhaps foremost."" But it was mentioned in the same context as other goals -- inspiring kids, expanding international relationships -- suggesting Bolden was speaking not about NASA's obvious scientific purpose, but other activities. The focus on space is clear in the video of the Al Jazeera interview.

Sullivan's tweet says Bolden said NASA’s ""main mission is Muslim outreach."" That's akin to saying the agency is deserting outer space to concentrate on residents of the Nile Delta, which would be unbelievable. That said, Bolden acknowledged to PolitiFact that he mischaracterized the agency's main mission in the remark about Obama charging him to do three things. That is, he said something close to what Sullivan said he said — and wishes he hadn't.

Lynch say Cicilline accepts hundreds of thousands in donations from lobbyists, PACs and insiders
","
With the September primary just six weeks away, the campaign attack machines are heating up, especially in the 1st Congressional District  race to replace Patrick Kennedy.
 
Of the four Democratic candidates, Providence Mayor David Cicilline has built by far the biggest war chest, which has -- not surprisingly -- made him the biggest target. Every day, it seems, one of Cicilline's opponents is firing a shot at him.

Following a showdown at the first Democratic debate, one of the challengers in the race, former party chairman Bill Lynch, released a statement accusing Cicilline of ""hypocrisy"" regarding the way political campaigns are funded.

The gist of his attack: while Cicilline stressed during the debate that ""we will not fix Washington and what's broken in Washington until we break the connection between money and politics ...,"" he was accepting campaign contributions that did just the opposite. In fact, the second-quarter campaign finance reports were released just a few days after the appearance.

""Mayor Cicilline wants the voters to believe he's concerned about the way campaigns are funded, yet he continues to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbyist, corporate PAC and insider money to fund his campaign,"" Lynch said in his statement.

From the outset, we knew this would be a challenging claim to check, yet also a useful one for readers. 
The Lynch campaign -- though vocal in their attacks -- went silent when we asked them for a list of these lobbyists, corporate PACs and insiders. Their rationale: it is not appropriate to discuss individual Cicilline donors.

But Lynch is making a serious accusation against an opponent. The burden of proof is on him. And a refusal to back up a claim doesn't buy you a pass on PolitiFact.

So we elected to look at Cicilline's first- and second-quarter 2010 federal campaign finance filings, those filed since he declared his congressional candidacy in February. Since Lynch used the phrase ""continues to accept, hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" it seemed appropriate to examine the most current reports.

Because Lynch would not define what he meant by ""insider money,"" we decided to focus on donations from lobbyists and corporate PACs.

Cicilline received $1.16 million in the first and second quarters from more than 750 donors, more than half of whom gave $1,000 or more. That included donations he was able to transfer from his mayoral campaigns. Of that, roughly $44,000 came from Rhode Island and federal lobbyists.

How did we arrive at that number?

First, we took the contribution lists and cross-referenced them with the secretary of state's list of 2010 registered Rhode Island lobbyists.

That tally came to about $41,500, including donations we could definitively attribute to registered lobbyists and people we could identify as the lobbyists' immediate family. We acknowledge that there may be others, but we only included the ones we could confirm.

Next we contacted the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. The group compiles lists of contributions made by a variety of groups including Washington lobbyists. According to their data, Cicilline received $2,400 in donations from federal lobbyists during the first quarter. The center has not yet completed its second-quarter calculations.

Together the donations by state and federal lobbyists totaled around $44,000, or just under 4 percent of his total contributions.

Lynch also said that Cicilline received contributions from ""corporate PACs."" Our review showed that of the almost $35,000 Cicilline accepted from Political Action Committees this year, only about $6,000 or so came from so-called ""corporate PACs,"" which we defined as a political committee directly associated with a corporate entity, such as a law firm. We did not include those affiliated with ideological causes such as the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, which also gave to Cicilline.

Add the lobbyist and corporate PAC contributions and you get just under $50,000. That's roughly 4.3 percent of the $1.16 million he accepted this year. It's hardly the ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" that Lynch talks about.

But remember, that tally doesn't include the third group that Lynch rails against, the ""insider[s]."" Cicilline's first- and second-quarter filings clearly show he is accepting money from many well-known Rhode Island political and business leaders. These are, after all, the types of people who generally donate to candidates.

The more recent filing also shows he received contributions from donors as varied as ""Family Guy"" creator -- and RISD graduate -- Seth MacFarlane, Patriots owner Bob Kraft and Boston event planner, Bryan Rafanelli, a Warwick native who has been mentioned lately in news reports as reportedly overseeing former first daughter Chelsea Clinton's nuptials.

Does Cicilline, who stressed the need to ""break the connection between money and politics,"" accept money from lobbyists, PACs and insiders? Yes. But Lynch's unwillingness to define what he means by ""insider,"" makes it impossible to do an exact calculation. And based on the limited information we have now, his insistence that Cicilline continues to receive ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" can't be verified.

Now let's take a look at Lynch's first- and second-quarter federal filings. They reveal that of the almost $186,000 he accepted in contributions from about 160 donors (he also loaned himself $100,000), approximately $7,500 of it came from lobbyists, with all but $1,000 from Rhode Island lobbyists.

It does not appear that he took any money from so-called ""corporate PACS,"" though he did receive several union contributions. Add it all up and the sum of donations Lynch accepted from lobbyists equals about 4 percent of the total contributions he received.

Cicilline's pockets may be far deeper than Lynch's, but the percentage of donations each of them received from these groups is roughly the same: 4 percent.

(And by the way, it's clear that Lynch took money from well-known business and political leaders, the so-called ""insider money,"" that he criticizes Cicilline for accepting).

In the end, Lynch made serious accusations and refused to back them up.  

If he provides us with more information, we'll revisit this item, but for now it gets a Barely True.

Gordon Quan, Harris County candidate, says 70 percent of males over 50 have a form of heart disease
","
Gordon Quan, the Democratic nominee for Harris County judge, sent an e-mail blast last month noting he’d recently undergone cardiac bypass surgery.

""Like many, I had no signs of heart disease,"" his June 30 e-mail continues. ""Fortunately, my wife had insisted that I have a complete examination in March which detected growing blockage in my arteries. It is estimated by some cardiologists that 70 percent of all males over 50 have some form of heart disease. Unfortunately, we have lost many too soon due to untreated heart disease."" 
Seven in 10 men older than 50 have heart disease? We—OK, I—urgently desired back-up.

Quan told us he saw the statistic while looking through information posted online by the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, which says it performs scientific research on the effects of diet and lifestyle choices on health and disease. The California-based institute was founded by Dean Ornish, a physician who has long studied the effects of lifestyle changes on health.

We didn't find a similar statement on the institute's site and didn't hear back from its online contact.

Separately, we reached the Houston-based Texas Heart Institute, whose spokesman forwarded the American Heart Association's 2010 update of national heart disease and stroke statistics. It has a chart indicating nearly 40 percent of men and women aged 40 to 59 have some kind of cardiovascular disease, while 74 percent of men and 73 percent of women aged 60 to 79 fit into that un-wellness field. All told, the update says, 81.1 million Americans (or one in three residents) have one or more types of cardiovascular disease, 38.1 million of them being 60 or older.

But what about -- ahem -- men between 50 and 60? Frank Michel, the institute’s director of public affairs, agreed the chart didn’t speak directly to them. ""The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in one form or another is somewhere in between 40 percent and 70 percent for males aged 50 and over and it rises above 70 percent by the time they reach age 60,"" Michel said in an e-mail. 
In Austin, we sought perspective from Glen Huschka, director of communications for the South Central Affiliate of the American Heart Association.

Huschka initially noted that cardiovascular disease refers to a ""broad range of conditions including coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke and high blood pressure,"" which he said seems to fit with Quan's statement.

Huschka said in an e-mail that if the candidate had said men over 50 are ""at risk of developing"" heart disease, that would be a slam dunk. Huschka’s point: More than 71 percent of men over age 20 are considered overweight or obese, a major risk factor.

Huschka floated our question to Melanie Turner, associate science and medicine adviser with the American Heart Association’s Dallas-based National Center. She shared information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey taken by the National Center for Health Statistics from 2003 through 2006. According to the survey, the prevalence of heart disease among U.S. men 50 and older was about 19 percent — if one limits the definition of coronary heart disease to people with heart attacks, angina and heart failure. Under a broader definition that includes stroke and hypertension, 61 percent of males 50 and older were diagnosed as having heart-related difficulties.

Huschka told us in an e-mail that such estimates wouldn't include men with undiagnosed heart disease, meaning the prevalence of heart disease among males 50 and older is probably higher.

That sounds believable.

All told, however, the statistics don't confirm Quan's statement that 70 percent of men over 50 have a form of heart disease, though we found numbers that were close. We rate his statement Half True.

But that's not what we noticed.

What caught our eye were the images that filled the screen when a narrator uttered this line, ""Jeff Greene can buy anything, except the truth.""

The images included a picture of Greene from one of his ads, a picture of him on a yacht and a picture of two houses. One is labeled ""Mansion."" The other is ""Mansion 2.""

Greene is worth a small fortune -- a required federal disclosure lists his assets as ranging in value between $827 million and $2.8 billion. So we're not surprised the man would own two large homes.

But we wanted to see if the Meek campaign had done its homework and produced real pictures of the homes. Or if the pictures were generic images of palacial digs.

A bit of Internet searching reveals the answer.

We first checked the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser to see about property Greene owns in his hometown. According to records, Greene dropped $24 million on a waterfront home in December 2009. We're not going to list the address here, but using the address, we were able to find the original for-sale listing.

The nine bedroom, nine bathroom home was listed through The Corcoran Group. From the listing: 
Mizner's Coconut Hill - 234' Direct Oceanfront - Beautifully sited on 3.8 +/- acres, this unique compound boasts a long winding entry and limitless ocean vistas. Offering total privacy and approximately 12,000 square feet of well scaled living spaces, its original finishes remain: limestone, pecky cypress, stone/hardwood floors, french Palladian doors and more. Gracious outdoor terraces & an elegant oversized swimming pool complete this spectacular property that awaits a restoration and potential expansion. 
The listing included this photo gallery. Sure enough, the home is indeed what's called ""Mansion"" in Meek's campaign ad.

As for ""Mansion 2,"" the property isn't in Florida at all, but rather California. It's a 25-acre estate in Beverly Hills he calls Palazzo di Amore.

And it's Greene's.

He used to live there but now is renting out the 43,000-square-foot home for $25,000 a month. (The home is still on the market, according to a Realtor's website, if you're interested). The Wall Street Journal profiled the property last October. 
Mr. Greene ... bought the unfinished property out of receivership for $35 million in 2006 and has spent nearly three years and $15 million finishing it. The 43,000 square foot main house has 11 bedrooms, 14 baths and a 6,000 square foot ballroom. Six acres of vineyards produce 400 cases of wine annually. 
The Journal article includes what appears to be the same image that is in Meek's ad.

For the record, Realtors define a mansion as a home bigger than 8,000 square feet -- meaning both Greene properties qualify.

And if you were wondering, the picture of Greene on the yacht is legit, too. It's ripped from a Forbes profile. The Forbes caption reads, ""Los Angeles real estate mogul Jeff Greene aboard his 145-foot yacht, Summerwind, docket at the Sag Harbor wharf of New York's tony Hamptons."" That's the same yacht that tore up a coral reef in Belize, by the way.

In Kendrick Meek's second TV ad, he uses pictures of two homes and labels them ""Mansion"" and ""Mansion 2"" to help illustrate rival Jeff Greene's personal fortune. We wanted to know if those images were real or simply placeholders. Turns out, what you see is what you get. We rate Meek's claim True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/30/kendrick-meek/what-you-see-what-you-get-meek-has-photos-jeff-gre/

Jeff Kottkamp says three Broward County Commissioners arrested by FBI
","
Arrests of public officials in South Florida have been common headlines in recent years. We've been witness to all sorts of drama including a school board member sticking cold hard cash in a doggie bag and later made famous by a photo of her running away from the cameras, a county commissioner receiving money in a golf bag and later crying at the courthouse, and an ex-city commissioner who once resolved a spat at Winn-Dixie with a gun and was later defiant at his sentencing in a corruption probe.

All three of those officials hailed from Broward County -- a place where perhaps the most common question among observers and critics of politicians is, ""Whose next?""

Republican Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, who is running for attorney general, wants such government corruption stopped. But does Kottkamp have his facts right on which government officials had the handcuffs slapped on them for which crimes? 
On the morning of July 30, we looked at Kottkamp's campaign website and found his position paper on ""Stopping Government Corruption"" in which he vows to crack down on officials who violate the public's trust.

Kottkamp wrote: ""Only a few months ago the FBI arrested three Broward County Commissioners for accepting millions of dollars in trade for illegal favors. This rash of public corruption lead the Governor to petition the Florida Supreme Court to empanel a grand jury to investigate corruption in South Florida. I support this effort as a necessary first step to restore public confidence in government."" 
For this claim, we will evaluate that first sentence in three parts: Were three Broward County Commisisoners arrested by the FBI? Did the three accept millions of dollars? And were the arrests a few months ago? 
We started with the Broward County Commission. So far, the feds have arrested only one Broward County Commissioner -- Josephus Eggelletion on Sept. 23, 2009 -- in a scheme in which he participated in laundering about $900,000 and profited about $23,000. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. In March, a tearful Eggelletion was sentenced to 30 months in prison. 
In July, the Broward State Attorney's Office announced the arrest of Broward County Commissioner Diana Wasserman-Rubin for seven counts of unlawful compensation, but the FBI was not involved. Prosecutors have accused her of repeatedly voting on grants that benefitted her husband who received $45,000 in bonuses. She has denied wrongdoing and has not had her first court hearing. 
But Eggelletion wasn't the only Broward notable to land in prison this year. On the same day that federal prosecutors announced their case against Eggelletion, they unveiled charges against School Board Member Beverly Gallagher (the doggie bag/dashing away from the press politician) and former Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman who was later defiant at his sentencing. Here is the press release that summarizes the separate charges in the Broward cases. Gallagher pleaded guilty to bribery for accepting about $9,000 from undercover agents posing as consultants trying to get school district business. In June she was sentenced to 37 months in prison. Salesman was convicted of bribery and extortion at trial for taking $3,340 from undercover agents who were trying to get business from the city of Miramar. Salesman was sentenced in July to 51 months in prison. 
So there clearly weren't three Broward County commissioners busted by the FBI -- only one Broward county commissioner was arrested by the feds. Or another way of looking at it: two politicians in Broward and a former politician in Broward were convicted after federal corruption probes -- none of which involved the convicts pocketing anywhere close to millions. 
But there were three Palm Beach County commissioners -- the county immediately to the north of Broward -- who were convicted in federal corruption probes between 2007 and 2009: Tony Masilotti, Warren Newell and Mary McCarty. There were also a list of other public officials in Broward -- including two on the Deerfield City Commission and a Davie town manager -- who have been charged with corruption in recent years. 
We spoke with Kottkamp campaign manager Jill Gran and spokesman David Bishop at about 10:40 a.m. July 30, 2010, and told them we thought the claim was wrong. 
""We didn't write it, by the way,"" Gran said. It was written by a researcher in conjunction with Kottkamp, she said.

Bishop said they would look into it and if it was wrong they would correct it. Bishop sent us an e-mail less than two hours later saying they had made a mistake. 
""Our error was calling them Broward County commissioners when we should have said Broward County elected officials and then distinguish between county commissioner, school board member and former Miramar City commissioner. That has now been corrected on the website. It’s clear from the FBI news release that large sums of money were being transferred for illegal activity. That is why the issue paper says million[s] of dollars. 
We spoke with Bishop to ask him to clarify the ""millions"" part of the original claim. He pointed to the press release from the U.S. Attorney's office announcing the arrests, which stated about Eggelletion and his co-defendants (two businessmen and an attorney) ""in a series of wire transfers, the defendants laundered approximately $900,000 from an account in Miami through the Bahamian account into an account controlled by the FBI in St. Croix. As well, the UCAs [undercover agents] discussed an additional $200,000 and $500,000 transfer with Eggelletion and [Ronald] Owens, respectively, but none of these additional funds was actually transferred."" 
Bishop said: ""Eggelletion may have only gotten $23,000 out of this but acted in conjunction with co-conspirators in attempting to defraud $900,000 and discussed $200,000 and $500,000. I can see where that can be confusing so we changed that as well."" 
When the Kottkamp campaign changed the sentence on the website July 30, here is how they wrote it: ""In September 2009, the FBI arrested a Broward County Commissioner, Broward County School Board Member and former Miramar City Commissioner on corruption charges."" Note the campaign took out the ""millions'' remark. The way they have it written now is accurate. 
""We acknowledge the mistake,'' Bishop said. ""It was brought to our attention, and we fixed it as quickly as we could."" 
In South Florida we've had quite a few public officials get arrested in recent years so we can understand how the average person could mix some of them up. (We think it would be fun and handy if someone would create trading cards to help the public keep their corrupt politicians straight.) But there has been extensive news coverage, press releases and court records on these cases making it easy for a high-profile candidate to get the facts right when summarizing in a sentence. 
So did Kottkamp get anything right here? 
Well there was one Broward County commissioner arrested by the FBI, but he did not accept millions -- though he was involved in laundering about $900,000. But Kottkamp did at least get one element of his sentence right: the timing of the arrests. Bishop said that the page was initially posted in February 2010 -- that was a few months after the September arrests of Eggelletion, Gallagher and Salesman. 
In total, Kottkamp's claim -- up on his website for about six months -- was wrong. Only time will tell if any other members of the Broward County Commission get arrested. Kottkamp's staff gets kudos for fixing it promptly, but it was wrong since February. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2010/jul/30/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-says-three-broward-county-commissioners-a/

E-mail says Obama had to have been traveling on another country's passport to get into Pakistan
","
In an effort to prove that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president, birthers have come up with some very creative arguments. A curious reader forwarded a chain e-mail that made an interesting claim.

""Pakistan was on the U.S. State Department's 'no travel' list in 1981,"" read the e-mail. Therefore, ""when Obama went to Pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a British passport or an Indonesian passport.""

The most effective chain e-mails, like the best lies, are built on an incorrect but seemingly plausible ""fact"" that they follow to what seems like a sound conclusion. In this case, the ""fact"" on which the entire argument rests is that Pakistan was on a ""no travel"" list in 1981. If that were true, Obama would either have had to use a different passport or enter the country illegally and request his passport not be stamped, as some Americans have done over the years to travel to Cuba.

Obama has said he traveled to Pakistan in 1981. He was on summer vacation from college, and, after visiting his mother in Indonesia, he traveled to Pakistan with a college friend. However, according to the U.S. Department of State, the department in charge of issuing travel bans, Pakistan had a green light for adventurous U.S. citzens.

""According to our Pakistan experts,"" said Ivna Giauque, a public affairs officer at the State Department, ""there was no travel ban to Pakistan in 1981."" 
Without the original premise that Pakistan had a travel ban, the rest of the argument deteriorates. The author of the e-mail may have been confusing a travel warning or travel advisory with a travel ban. The University of Illinois at Chicago Library has an archive of State Department documents, including one from Aug. 17, 1981, issuing a travel advisory for Pakistan. It is the oldest travel advisory document in the archive related to Pakistan. 
Even if Obama traveled after the advisory was issued instead of earlier in the summer, the State Department confirmed it wasn't illegal. Our good friends at Snopes and Factcheck.org found a travel article about visiting Pakistan published in the New York Times in June 1981, and it mentions nothing about such travel being illegal. An August 1981 letter to the editor in the New York Times by the U.S. Consul General in Lahore, Pakistan, encouraged people to come visit. We also found an ad in the New York Times from March which listed Karachi and Lahore as two destinations in their travel package.

In 1981, travel to Pakistan was not illegal or prohibited. Somebody was just looking for an excuse to promote the birther conspiracy, so we rate it Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jul/30/chain-email/e-mail-says-obama-had-have-been-traveling-another-/

E-mail claims Obama's college transcripts reveal Indonesian citizenship
","
One of our readers tipped us off to a chain e-mail that contains a purported Associated Press article claiming that, among other things, smoking-gun evidence has been found that proves Barack Obama really is not eligible to be president. 
""The group 'Americans for Freedom of Information' has released copies of President Obama's college transcripts from Occidental College,"" read the alleged AP article. ""Released today, the transcript school [sic] indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship.""

We wondered if Occidental really had given out Obama's transcripts, and if it proved that he was a foreign imposter.

First of all, as you may have expected, it's not really an AP article. Jack Stokes, a spokesperson for AP was unequivocal when he said, ""It is not an AP story."" 
A search of Google and Lexis-Nexis turned up no evidence of a group named Americans for Freedom of Information as of April 1, 2009. April 1 was the date of the purported AP story which materialized in 2009. A satirical WordPress blog was set up after the fact, as well as a far more serious AmericansforFreedomofInformation.com.Our friends at FactCheck.org found that the latter website was registered on May 11, 2009--after the date of the fake AP story. Website owner Debra Smith, says on her own personal website that she had nothing to do with chain e-mail.

Nevertheless, it could still be true. Barack Obama did attend Occidental college for two years before transferring to Columbia University. He writes about the experience in his book Dreams From My Father, and three rare photos have surfaced that show the young Obama while atttending Occidental.

The falsehood starts with the claim that Obama's transcript was released. That's not true, according to Jim Tranquada, director of communications at Occidental College. No court has ordered Occidental to release the transcript.

Barack Obama's records at Occidental remain sealed under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Rights Act, which applies to all students. Unless Obama gives Occidental permission to release his record, it is illegal for them to do so, and Obama has not given Occidental permission, according to Tranquada.

When Obama  entered Occidental, he was known as Barry Obama. Around the time he left, he preferred Barack. Soetoro was the last name of Obama's stepfather, with whom he lived in Indonesia before moving in with his grandparents in the United States. 
""All the alumni and students that I have spoken to knew him as Barry or Barack Obama,"" said Tranquada. And he registered under the name Obama, not Soetoro, according to the college.

Although the e-mail lied about the release of transcripts and the name, conspiracy theorists could argue that Obama won't release his records because he is hiding the fact that he is an Indonesian citizen and actually did receive a Fulbright. 
As for the Fulbright claim, Fulbright scholarships are almost never awarded to undergraduate students. They are almost exclusively awarded to students pursuing advanced degrees, according to James Lawrence, a public affairs officer for the Fulbright program. The American Indonesian Exchange Foundation now handles Fulbright awards for Indonesian citizens, and only those with an undergraduate degree and applying for a master's or doctoral degree are eligible. However, AMINEF was established in 1992, and it is unclear who handled Indonesian Fulbrights before that, or if Indonesian Fulbrights even existed in 1981. An attempt to contact the organization in Indonesia was unsuccessful.  

This chain e-mail is wrong about AP, the transcripts and the name, and we found no evidence of a Fulbright, so we're giving it a Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jul/30/chain-email/e-mail-claims-obamas-college-transcripts-reveal-in/

E-mail claims Supreme Court agreed to rule on Obama's citizenship
","
Despite overwhelming evidence that Barack Obama is a natural born citizen of the United States and eligible to be  president, there are still plenty of people out there who believe that President Obama is a fraud. One of our loyal readers forwarded us a chain e-mail with several claims that we just couldn't pass up. 
In the chain e-mail is an article titled ""Very Quietly Obama's Citizenship Case Reaches the Supreme Court."" You would think this would have been big enough news that we would have heard about it, but this ""article"" has a dateline of April 1 (hint, April Fool's Day) and is also credited to the the Associated Press. 
In the article, the headline is further expanded upon, ""Under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama's legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey.""
 
You heard about this, right? 
For a plethora of reasons, we didn't expect that this was a legitimate AP article, but we decided to check with them anyway. It is not, according to Jack Stokes, an AP spokesperson. 
Still, maybe, somehow, this forged article contains some factual information?
 
Leo Donofrio, a lawyer from New Jersey, did sue New Jersey Secretary of State Nina Wells in an attempt to block the election of Barack Obama. Donofrio claimed that since Obama's father was a British citizen, Obama was granted dual citizenship at birth and therefore was not eligible to be elected President. 
The case was submitted to the Supreme Court, but the court did not agree to hear it. The first tidbit that tipped us off was that the e-mail said Justice Scalia announced that the court agreed to hear arguments. That's not how it works. In order for the Supreme Court to hear a case, at least four justices have to be in favor of hearing it. At that point they issue a ""writ of certiorari,'' colloquially reffered to as ""cert."" However, an individual justice doesn't make such an announcement. Such information typically comes from the court's public information office.
 
Donofrio's case first went to Justice Souter, who denied the request. At that point it got bounced to Clarence Thomas, who submitted the case to committee. Just because Thomas sent the case to committee does not necessarily mean he supported hearing it, only that he thought it was worth it for the court to consider hearing the case. 
The court denied ""cert"" for Donofrio's case and that was the end of it. Still we wondered if the case had any legitimacy. 
This is an extremely misleading chain e-mail. First, it is not an Associated Press article, despite posing as one. Second, an individual justice would not speak for the court when agreeing to hear a case. Third, the case was, in fact, denied cert by the court. It's a ridiculous and misleading claim, so we give it a Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jul/30/chain-email/e-mail-claims-supreme-court-agreed-rule-obamas-cit/

Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland touts two-year-old advanced energy top ranking
","
Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland is on a mission to prove that a traditionally blue-collar, manufacturing state can make the transition to become a leader in the futuristic green energy industry. And he is touting his leadership for bringing the state recognition.

""In renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects, Ohio now ranks first among the 50 states,"" Strickland said during a July 6 speech at the Ohio Democratic Party headquarters in Columbus.

The governor said he was convinced when he took office more than three years ago that the right energy policies, coupled with Ohio’s manufacturing history and infrastructure, could be the foundation to build the state into an energy leader. And he rattled off a list of green energy accolades for the state, including this No. 1 ranking in renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects.

But is it true?

Ohio got the ranking in July 2008 for bringing in more new facility projects than any other state between 2005 and 2007. Strickland took office in January 2007.

The ranking was contained in The Conway New Plant Report and reported in the July 2008 issue of SITE Selection magazine, an economic development trade publication. The Ohio Business Development Coalition touted the ranking in a news release in August 2008.

But the report and rankings have not been updated since 2008 and there are no plans to do so, said Adam Bruns, SITE Selection’s managing editor.  The magazine has moved on to analyzing, reviewing and ranking cities and states on other advanced energy-related projects, he says.

In some respects, that means Ohio could argue that it’s still No. 1 and Strickland would be correct.

But we think it’s a significant omission by the governor to not mention that the ranking is two years old, particularly when he is touting it as an example of successful policy. In fact, some of the accomplishments for which the state was recognized by SITE’s report actually occurred before Strickland took office.

So we rate Strickland’s statement Half True.

Warren Buffett was talking about derivatives generally, not Jeff Greene's ""scheme""
","
Congressman Kendrick Meek launched his first TV attack ad against opponent Jeff Greene in the Florida Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate.

The ad, called ""He's the Man,"" attacks Greene's background as a billionaire who made money as the economy soured.

""Meet the real Jeff Greene: Ran for Congress as a California Republican. Moved to Florida two years ago. Became a billionaire on Wall Street betting middle-class families would lose their homes. Helped fuel the economic meltdown. Warren Buffett called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' ""

The ad then shows footage of Greene saying, ""They'll attack me for my friends and my past when I was single. Some of it's true, but none of it matters.""

""Betting on suffering does matter,"" the narrator responds.

We fact-checked the statement about Greene running for Congress as a Republican in a separate report, and labeled it True. And last month, we fact-checked a claim from Meek that Greene was responsible for hurting the economy. We looked at Meek's statement that Greene ""is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now."" We rated that Barely True.

Our reporting then showed that Greene did make big money on credit default swaps, a type of derivative that paid off when mortgage-backed securities failed. But we also found that Meek was pumping up Greene's role in a complicated economic situation where many different financial players did things that ended up hurting the economy. (Read our full report.)

Here, we wanted to check the claim about Warren Buffett, that he ""called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' "" Buffett runs Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company renowned for its savvy investment strategies, and he's No. 2 on the 2009 Forbes list of wealthiest Americans. Some folks call Buffett ""the Oracle of Omaha."" We were suspicious that Greene (who's only No. 317 on the Forbes list) would have made it onto Buffett's radar.

We should note here that journalists love Buffett's phrase ""financial weapons of mass destruction."" We found it repeated again and again in stories about the role derivatives played in the financial collapse of 2008.

It turns out Buffett coined the phrase to describe derivatives back in 2003, when he published his annual letter to investors discussing his thoughts on the previous year's business. Buffett warned that it was difficult to truly evaluate the risks involved in derivatives.

""Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices or currency values,"" Buffett wrote.

""The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen),"" he continued. ""At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years in the future, were put on the books. Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins to be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem -- at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.""

Buffett warned that derivatives could become unforeseen catastrophes for some companies. ""Imagine, then, that a company is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their requirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous demand for cash collateral on the company. The need to meet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more downgrades. It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown,"" he wrote.

It turns out this is exactly what happened at some of the biggest financial firms in the country in 2008 -- five years after Buffett's warning. 
Buffett was discussing derivatives in the context of Berkshire Hathaway's investment in a company called General Re Securities. Buffett said he attempted to sell without success. At the time he wrote the letter, he was trying to shut down the business, but was having problems resolving the many derivatives contracts General Re had on its books. 
""We try to be alert to any sort of megacatastrophe risk, and that posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside,"" Buffet wrote. ""In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.""

Buffett doesn't mention Greene at all in his 2003 letter.

And in fact, our previous reporting on Greene's financial activities indicate he did most of his trading in 2006 and later, three years after Buffett's letter.

Still, there's no doubt Greene was heavily involved in buying credit default swaps, which are a type of derivative. And Buffett was exceptionally critical of derivatives. The problem with Meek's ad is that it gives the impression that Buffett criticized Greene personally, which he didn't do. By saying Buffett called Greene's scheme a bad idea, Meek personalizes a comment that had nothing to do with Greene. Because of that, we rate Meek's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/jul/30/kendrick-meek/warren-buffett-was-talking-about-derivatives-gener/

Ohio the first state for a professional baseball team
","
OK, so it probably won’t make or break the governor’s race in 2010, but a recent speech from Democratic lieutenant governor candidate Yvette McGee Brown touched on an oft-repeated piece of baseball lore to establish the importance of Ohio’s cities.

While speaking on urban issues June 22, McGee Brown reeled off a list of accomplishments born in Ohio, including the widely-repeated claim that ""the first professional baseball team"" was formed in an Ohio city. But is baseball’s professional lineage so clearly rooted in the Buckeyes State? It was time to take a 7th inning stretch from serious politics and see if this claim was a hit or an error.

In a timeline for his acclaimed documentary on baseball, filmmaker Ken Burns asserts that the first professional baseball team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869, which finished its tour of the National Association of Base Ball Players matches with a sparkling 70-0 record.

An open and shut case? Not so fast.

A history of the Red Stockings compiled by the Society for Cincinnati Sports Research suggests that the club’s secretary John Joyce knew that ""all the top Eastern clubs were paying their star players"" but not admitting it when he set out in 1869 to pursue a team of the best players at every position. Clearly, there were professional baseball players prior to the Red Stockings season of 1869.

Gabriel Schecter, a researcher at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, said the key is that the Red Stockings were the first all-professional team where the players were openly paid — payroll records tally $9,400 for 10 players.

""That’s the distinction that has to be made,"" Schecter said. ""Prior to the Red Stockings, there were players here or there who were paid or who were given jobs, but it wasn’t a full team being paid above board.""

For example, a powerhouse team from Washington that toured in the late 1860s prior to the Red Stockings turning pro was stocked with players on the federal payroll.

""All or most of the players had those jobs that basically subsidized them so they could play ball,"" he said. ""The question is how much work those federal employees actually were doing,"" he said.

A timeless question no doubt, but it probably doesn’t equate to professional in the sense we use it today. Still, was it possible that an entire team of players was being paid under the table prior to the Red Stockings?

""I can’t say that I’m 100 percent sure,"" Schecter said. ""I think that’s very unlikely because it would have been uncovered by now.""

Because it appears that no other team fielded a lineup of fully-professional players prior to the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869, we rule this claim to be True. If only all the calls made on the diamond were so clear-cut.

Barnes campaign says former Democratic governor not invited to Obama's Atlanta visit
","
UPDATE: When we originally published this item, we relied on a source who did not want to be named, which was not consistent with PolitiFact's policies. A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee has since gone on the record. We are re-publishing the item to reflect on-the-record confirmation that Barnes was, in fact, invited to the Obama event.

President Barack Obama comes to Atlanta on Monday for a pair of events -- a Democratic fund-raiser and a speech to the Disabled American Veterans convention.

But the state's best-known Democrat at the moment, former Gov. Roy Barnes, will not attend. The state's Democratic standard-bearer will instead take his gubernatorial campaign to South Georgia, about as far away from Atlanta as a politician can get on the day a Democratic president comes to visit.

When Tim Bryant, who hosts a daily talk show for WGAU (1340 AM) in Athens and also reports for WSB Radio in Atlanta, asked Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter about Barnes' high-profile absence from the Obama events, Carpenter had an explanation. Bryant -- during a WSB news report -- repeated what Carpenter told him.

""Nobody’s invited us,"" Bryant said, quoting what a Barnes campaign spokesman told him during an interview. Bryant confirmed to PolitiFact Georgia the spokesman was Carpenter.

But why would Democrats not invite Barnes to one of their highest-profile Georgia events of the year?

What follows is a story about the state of state politics in Georgia. It's a saga about the difficulty of being a Democrat running for statewide office in Georgia, a state where Republicans rule. 
Listed as the contact on the fund-raiser invitation is Kristin Oblander, who raised money for Barnes from 1998 to 2002, according to her Web site. On that site Oblander is listed as president of the Oblander Group LLC, a ""prominent Democratic fundraising firm specializing in Democratic campaign fundraising."" PolitiFact attempted to get in touch with Oblander, but she did not return our calls. Her office referred us to the Washington press office for the Democratic National Committee, which is helping host the Obama fund-raiser.

""Gov. Barnes was invited to the fundraiser, but unfortunately he had a prior commitment and could not attend,"" said Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Joanne Peters.

Invitations had not been sent out for the other part of Obama's Atlanta visit, the president's speech to the veterans convention. This is an official White House event, while the fund-raiser is hosted by the Democratic National Committee. Democratic candidates are usually invited to fund-raisers, but not necessarily to events like the president's speech before the veterans group.

So what's going on here?

Barnes has been a loyal Democrat for years, giving generously to a long list of candidates and Democratic organizations. Federal Election Commission records show he gave the DNC $10,000 in 2009 and $15,000 in 2004. He initially backed former U.S. Sen. John Edwards for president in 2008 but threw his support and checkbook behind Obama when Edwards bailed out of the race. Federal election records show Barnes gave $2,300 to ""Obama for America"" on Aug. 30, 2008, and on Sept. 23, 2008, gave $2,500 to the ""Obama Victory Fund."" The former governor even gave Obama money six years ago, before the former senator rocketed onto the nation stage -- FEC records shows Barnes gave $1,000 to ""Obama for Illinois Inc."" on June 2, 2004. Barnes is certainly the kind of guy the Democrats like to have at their fund-raisers.

But political scientists say the Obama visit is a political minefield for the former governor, who lost to Republican underdog Sonny Perdue in 2002. If you are a no-show for Obama's visit, it might not play well with the president's supporters. But if you go, you might alienate conservatives and give your Republican opponent ammo for the November election.

""I'm sure he [Barnes] wishes Barack Obama would not come to Atlanta right now,"" said Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor.

Obama lost Georgia to John McCain in 2008 even though a historically large number of African Americans turned out to vote for the president. Nationally, Obama's popularity has declined since the election, and perhaps even more so in a conservative state like Georgia, Bullock said.

""To get elected, Barnes not only has to get Democratic votes, but he has to attract independents, and polls show independents have been moving away from Obama,"" Bullock said.

Translation: The last thing the Barnes campaign needs right now is a photo of the former governor at an Obama fund-raiser.

""Barnes knows he will be attacked [by Republicans] as a liberal, and he will deny that,"" Bullock said. ""But if there is a photo showing him in a man-hug with Barack Obama, that would be taken by a lot of Georgia voters as affirming the charge that Barnes is a liberal.

""It's a great shorthand for the Republicans to get that message across."" 
PolitiFact Georgia also contacted Carpenter, who responded with an e-mail.

""We were not invited to the President’s official event,"" Carpenter wrote. ""By the time I learned of the president’s visit, I had to make a difficult decision on how to best utilize Governor Barnes’ time and travel. With less than 100 days until the election, I decided to keep his commitments in middle and south Georgia.""

When PolitiFact Georgia asked what he meant by ""official event"" Carpenter e-mailed the same response.

Carpenter said he was talking about the veterans event when asked whether Barnes had been invited to Obama's Atlanta appearance, rather than the fund-raiser. But we believe that most people, hearing the remarks on the radio or seeing them in the e-mail he sent us, would believe he was referring to both of the president's appearances.

Which brings us back to the central question of this quest. Was Barnes invited to any Obama event while the president is in town? The people doing the inviting said Barnes was indeed invited to the Obama fund-raiser. It would be bizarre if Barnes were not on the invitation list since he has been a contributor to both Obama and the DNC.

Rep. Jeb Hensarling says nearly half of U.S. debt is owned by foreigners
","
Speaking July 8 in Terrell, east of Dallas, U.S. Rep Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas, focused on the federal debt, according to a July 12 recap in The Terrell Tribune. ""Today,"" Hensarling said, ""almost half of our debt is owned by foreigners. There is an old saying that whoever owns your debt may one day own you.""

We wondered if Hensarling got the level of foreign ownership right. 
Some perspective: The level of foreign ownership of the debt started inching up decades ago. According to a Forbes magazine article published in March, until the early 1970s foreigners owned less than 5 percent of the national debt. This started to change, columnist/economist Bruce Bartlett wrote, ""after the big run-up in oil prices.""

Bartlett continued: ""As oil exporters suddenly acquired vast financial resources they found it convenient to park them in Treasury securities, which provided liquidity and safety. By 1975 the foreign share of the national debt rose to 17 percent, where it stayed through the 1990s, when China began buying large amounts of Treasury bills . . . At the end of last year, foreigners owned close to half of the publicly held national debt.""

Hensarling’s office pointed us to a U.S. Treasury website stating that by June, more than 30 other countries -- China topped the list -- owned nearly $4 trillion in U.S. debt, which the government defines as all federal debt held by individuals, corporations, state or local governments, foreign governments, and other entities outside the U.S. government, less federal financing bank securities.

According to another Treasury site, the federal government’s total debt as of June 1 was nearly $8.6 trillion—making the share owned by foreigners about 46 percent. 
We encountered a wrinkle, though. That $8.6 trillion in debt didn’t count nearly $4.5 trillion in ""intragovernmental holdings,"" which would have brought the total U.S. debt to $13 trillion -- lowering the percentage of foreign-held debt to 30 percent. The government defines intragovernmental holdings as Government Account Series securities held by government trust funds, revolving funds, and special funds; and federal financing bank securities, including money owed to Social Security. 
Debt is debt, regardless of who's owed, no? So we wondered if it makes sense to consider the entire federal debt, as we just did, before calculating how much has been snapped up by foreigners.

Hensarling spokesman George Rasley conceded Hensarling didn’t take into account all the government’s debt before making his statement.

Rasley pointed out, though, that it’s not the Texan’s idea to separate intragovernmental holdings from publicly held debt; that’s the government’s approach. Rasley speculated in an e-mail: ""I assume that it is (separated that way) because the government differentiates between debt we SELL to investors,"" debt purchased by members of the public as well as foreign nations, "" and debt the government owes itself between accounts . . .which are owed by one arm of the federal government to another arm of the federal government.""

Sandy Leeds, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas, frequently delves into federal spending issues. Leeds echoed Rasley, telling us government officials, such as Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke almost always ignore intragovernmental debt in their references  to U.S. public held debt.

""There are two reasonable ways to approach this,"" Leeds said. ""One, we've got $8.6 trillion of debt and we also have no money for Social Security other than what we take in each year. Or you could say we have got $13 trillion of debt"" including intragovernmental debt such as money owed to Social Security. Leeds said: ""I really couldn't argue that one is right and one is wrong."" 
""There is certainly nothing misleading,"" Leeds said, about Hensarling's statement.

Leeds added in an e-mail: ""Dividing the foreign debt by the publicly held debt is fair. One way of thinking about this is to think of all of the debt that we had to go to the outside markets to finance. Foreigners financed 50 percent.""

Kilmartin claims $1 spent on afterschool programs saves more than $5 in crime costs
","
During a speech seeking the endorsement of the state Democratic Party in his race for attorney general, lawyer and former police officer Rep. Peter Kilmartin promised to work hard to prevent crime as well as prosecute it.

""It's about the attorney general, when I'm attorney general, advocating and increasing afterschool programming for children,"" he said. ""For every dollar we can invest and parlay from private charitable foundations and the federal government, we can save over $5, almost $6, in crime costs down the line.""

Sounds like a good investment. But claims based on the so-called multiplier effect always make us suspicious. While they often have the ring of authority, they are sometimes based on a pile of assumptions. We wondered where Kilmartin got his numbers.

His spokesman, Brett Broesder, quickly produced a copy of ""A Report to the Legislature: Rhode Island Afterschool and Summer Learning Program Act"" released in May by the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

The report, which argues for financing afterschool and summer programs for at-risk children and youth, says in two places: ""For every one dollar invested in expanded learning opportunities, there is a savings of up to $5.29 in decreased criminal justice costs.""

The RIDE report said the savings come in ""criminal justice costs,"" which we took to mean the costs incurred by the police, courts and corrections departments. ""Crime costs,"" the term used by Kilmartin, would also include the broader costs to the victims and their families, both tangible and intangible.

When we looked into the RIDE number, our suspicions were confirmed.

The RIDE report says its information came from a 2001 analysis from the Washington State Institute for Public Policy, a 174-page examination that tries to assess how much various social programs cost and how much they would save the state of Washington over the long term.

It's clear from Page 15 that the $5.29 figure comes with some significant caveats, none of which were mentioned by RIDE in its pitch for more money:

* The Washington analysis is based on just two studies of mentoring programs conducted outside the criminal justice system, one run by Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. The Big Brothers study never documented a drop in the crime rate as a result of mentoring; instead it asked participants for the number of times they hit someone. From that, the Washington researchers estimated that the two mentoring programs reduced the crime rate among participants by 4 percent.

* The Washington analysis estimated that there was no direct benefit to the taxpayers from the mentoring programs when they looked at how much would be saved in decreased criminal justice costs. ""Overall, taxpayers just break-even for this investment,"" the authors concluded.

In other words, even though the RIDE report used the qualifying statement ""up to $5.29,"" which technically covers every dollar estimate down to zero, it strikes us that RIDE misstated the findings. Twice.

So where does the $5.29 figure come from?

The Washington authors factored in their estimates of the costs of compensating victims of a crime, including the cost of lost quality of life. (Sample costs that they used: $8,734 for robbery victims and $3,137,793 for murder victims.)

The authors then plugged in several other numbers -- including the $1,054 cost of mentoring one person and their estimate of the cost of the crimes that mentoring prevented -- to arrive at $5.29.

Fortunately for Kilmartin, his mischaracterization of RIDE's conclusion (saying a $1 investment reduces ""crime costs"" instead of ""decreasing criminal justice costs"") makes his characterization of the Washington analysis more accurate than RIDE's.

Steve Aos, director of the Washington State Institute for Public Policy, said citing the 2001 analysis in 2010 -- instead of a later update -- would be like investing in the stock market today using investment advice given in 2001.
 
The most recent analysis, from 2004, estimates that society saves $3.28 for every dollar spent, not $5.29. If a mentoring program uses paid workers instead of volunteers, according to Aos, ""the program breaks even.""

We contacted RIDE spokesman Elliot Krieger to ask why the department cited an outdated study and failed to alert the legislature to some significant caveats. The department responded that ""we are not persuaded"" that the 2004 study refutes or negates the 2001 analysis.

""There are obviously many studies examining the value of afterschool programs, using many different methodologies, assumptions, and definitions. Experts in the field are free to debate the validity of the various methodologies. RIDE cited several studies in the report on afterschool and summer-learning programs. All were cited accurately and properly footnoted to enable readers to check the sources."" 

Well, the one cited source we checked -- because it impressed Kilmartin -- turned out to be a study that RIDE misrepresented.

Kilmartin was quoting a report he thought he could trust. So we'll give him a Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/30/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-claims-1-spent-afterschool-programs-save/
