Boehner, defending GOP record, says House has always passed a budget resolution
","On the June 13, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, got into a back-and-forth over how diligent lawmakers have been in passing a budget in recent years.Hoyer said that ""the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06,"" while Boehner claimed ""the House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era.""With dueling claims like these, we had no choice but to step in and play referee. In this item, we'll look at what Boehner said; in a separate item, we'll look at Hoyer's comment.First, a little background. The budget process used by Congress today was set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Both the Senate and the House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation and other fiscal policy items. This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it.The budget process is distinct from the series of appropriations, or spending, bills that actually allocate money for specific purposes. Unlike the appropriations bills, the budget resolution doesn't carry the force of law. In fact, unlike a law, the budget resolution is not signed by the president after it passes both chambers. If a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can still use parliamentary procedures to proceed to appropriations bills, but the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.That's why the expected failure of the Democratic House majority to pass a budget for fiscal year 2011 has become a talking point for Republicans.According to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the House has indeed passed a budget every year since the Congressional Budget Act first took effect for fiscal year 1976. So if the House does not pass a budget for fiscal year 2011, it will be the first time since the current rules went into force.However, we should also note that the House has not always been joined by the Senate in passing a budget -- a factor that explains the difference between what Boehner and Hoyer said. Since 1983 -- the first year the House and Senate stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and began passing one per year -- the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, then under Democratic control, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind, and on three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007) the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. Because Congress always works on the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, the Republican Congressional majority failed to pass a finished budget in three years: 1998, 2004 and 2006. So Boehner is correct that the House has always passed a budget resolution, even though on three occasions, it later failed to work out differences with the Senate and pass a final, identical version, and once the Senate, under Democratic control, had no budget resolution. We'll note that caveat, but we don't think his failure to mention that point undermines the accuracy of his statement. So we rate Boehner's statement True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/14/john-boehner/boehner-says-house-has-always-passed-budget-resolu/

Bill McCollum claims he recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid fraud
","Attorney General Bill McCollum, who is running as a Republican gubernatorial candidate, recently launched his first statewide TV campaign ad with a helping hand from former Gov. Jeb Bush.During the 30-second commercial, Bush speaks about McCollum's accomplishments: ""Tough times require proven leadership.""Bill McCollum is a principled conservative with a record of doing what is right for Florida.""Bill’s recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid fraud.""He’s leading the charge to stop President Obama’s health care takeover.""And, he has a plan to create 500,000 new jobs, reform government and cut wasteful spending.""Support my friend Bill McCollum, the kind of solid leader Florida needs."" We decided to focus on this claim: ""Bill's recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid fraud."" Increasingly Medicaid accounts for a huge chunk of the state budget, with Florida spending roughly $19 billion for the program that serves 2.7 million people, or 14 percent of Florida's population. And fraud is a big problem. Annually, some $3.2 billion in Medicaid fraud is bilked from the state and federal governments. To check whether McCollum has made a dent in curbing that fraud, we asked McCollum campaign spokesman Kristy Campbell for documentation. She gave us a March 9 press release from the Attorney General's office. ""I am proud of the record-breaking recoveries my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has made over the last three years, including $198 million last year,"" McCollum says in the release.Next, the Attorney General's office provided us with a list of recoveries from the Medicaid Control Unit for 2009. The list of 153 cases includes settlements that reach into the millions, like $32 million to be paid by pharmeceutical giant Eli Lilly, and smaller sums like $50,000 to be paid by Hialeah physician Ausberto B. Hidalgo. Adding up the itemized list, the sum is actually $203 million. So Bush is almost on the money.We should note that the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has been around since way before McCollum became attorney general. The unit started under the auditor general's office, but in July 1994 it was moved under the Attorney General's Office as a way to police the state's burgeoning Medicaid program. And McCollum has come under attack from state officials in both the Republican and Democratic parties for not doing enough.As for Bush's claim that McCollum ""recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid Fraud,"" we rate it True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/14/jeb-bush/bill-mccollum-claims-he-recovered-nearly-200-milli/

The GOP says Bill White has a history of trying to restrict military voters
","
Celebrating Memorial Day weekend in fine campaign fashion, Gov. Rick Perry released a statement from Bosnian war hero Scott O'Grady, who called on Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White to apologize for undermining military voting rights. O'Grady, a U.S. Air Force captain, gained fame in 1995 after he was shot down in Bosnia and survived for six days before being saved by Marines. 
""As Memorial Day weekend begins, Bill White should apologize to all veterans and military men and women for supporting limited voting rights for our military,"" O'Grady said in a press release posted May 28 on Perry's campaign website. 
The same charge surfaced in 2003, when White was running for mayor of Houston. This time around, it didn't take long for other Republicans to echo O'Grady, including the Republican Party of Texas. ""Former Texas Democratic Party chairman and current Democratic nominee for governor, Bill White, has a long history of trying to limit or even disenfranchise military voters,"" the GOP said in a June 4 e-mail. ""His history goes back to at least 1997, when the Democrats tried to overturn elections in South Texas when their candidate lost — and they tried to get military votes thrown out so they could get the outcome that they wanted. It was a purely political attack on military voting rights."" 
Let's roll back a decade. On Nov. 5, 1996, Republican D'Wayne Jernigan beat Democrat Oscar Gonzalez, Jr. by 267 votes to become the Val Verde County sheriff. Republican Murry Kachel bested Frank Coronado by 113 votes for a commissioner's seat in the South Texas county, which was 70 percent Hispanic, according to the 1990 U.S. Census (according to the 2000 U.S. Census, 78 percent of residents were of Hispanic or Latino origin). 
Almost all of the 800 absentee ballots were cast by mail by military members and their families — most of them Anglo — who had been stationed at Laughlin Air Force Base, near Del Rio, but no longer lived in the county. They swung the election for the GOP. 
Before the election, Jernigan and Kachel had solicited the votes of members of the military, according to a June 15, 1997, article in the San Antonio Express-News. 
On Dec. 4, 1996, Gonzalez and Coronado contested the election results, arguing that they lost because of ballots cast by voters who weren't connected to the community. On Dec. 19, county resident Jovita Casarez filed a federal lawsuit with the help of Texas Rural Legal Aid, on the grounds that the absentee ballots improperly diluted the Hispanic vote, violating the Voting Rights Act. 
The nonprofit group had found that 203 absentee voters in the 1996 election had last resided in the county more than 10 years before. One absentee voter had last voted there in 1986 and also owned a home in Florida. Another military voter indicated in his questionnaire that he and his spouse lived in Bexar County and had only spent their honeymoon in the county 26 years earlier. 
Two of the voters — Carol and Kenneth Belongia of Colorado Springs, Colo. — listed their former Laughlin address as their residence for voting purposes, and maintained Texas driver's licenses and vehicle registrations, according to a February 1997 report by The Associated Press. ""We are legally allowed to do this,"" Carol Belongia said. ""It's kind of tough being in the military... One of the few benefits is we can maintain our state residency like that, to give us a sense of permanence."" 
A federal district judge issued an order blocking Jernigan and Kachel from taking office, pending the Democratic candidates' challenge in state court. 
The crux of both cases? Whether those service members who cast votes in local elections via Federal Post Card Application ballots satisfied state and federal residency requirements. The federal form lets members of the military and citizens temporarily living abroad to request absentee ballots and to register to vote in local, state and federal elections in one fell swoop. 
Both suits cited a state law permitting out-of-state voters to cast ballots from elsewhere only if they consider the Texas locale their permanent home or intend to make it so. The federal judge wrote that the issue was not whether U.S. military personnel can vote but where they can legally vote in local elections. 
The suits spurred accusations that the plaintiffs were attacking military members' and their families' right to vote. Then it got even more contentious. 
In early 1997, allegations surfaced that Kachel, the county commissioner-elect, was a high-ranking member of the Ku Klux Klan while serving in the military in Germany in the 1980s. The charges traced to a 1981 article in a West German magazine that included a detailed description of Kachel and his living quarters, identifying him as a ""European Klan boss."" 
Kachel first denied the charge, then admitted it was true and withdrew his candidacy. 
Cue White, who was then chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. 
At a March rally, White said ""the Democratic Party of Texas and all Texans support the lawful rights of military voters,"" according to a March 7, 1997, article in the San Antonio Express-News. ""The issue that has been raised here in Val Verde County is not whether people are pro-military or anti-military. It is the rights of local voters to have their say in the process about who represents them,"" he said. 
According to the news report, White said the Democratic Party didn't take issue with absentee ballots cast by folks with direct ties to the community or who planned on returning there to retire. ""The issue is those people who were born, raised and educated (elsewhere), and have all their ties to other communities, and have not been here for years, and have no vested interest in what happens in local government,"" he said. 
In a March 12, 1997, commentary published in the Express-News, White wrote: ""The Texas Democratic Party strongly supports the rights of military personnel to participate in the elections of Texas."" His column suggested that military personnel who voted for Kachel did so without knowing about his KKK background. White said Kachel's admission of such activities ""demonstrates that military voters supported a candidate that they knew little or nothing about, in an election so far from home that they could not possibly have been informed about local concerns."" 
White also suggests that the members of the military were solicited to vote in the Texas county to defeat Democratic candidates, and he wrote that military voters have a financial incentive to declare Texas as their residence because the state doesn't levy an income tax. 
Why did White wade into the election scuffle? ""Because there was a former KKK member who won an election in a largely Hispanic district where (there was) an unusual spike in voting that indicated that there could be some fraud involved,"" he told us. ""But never, ever in the statement I made at the time and in the editorial following that letter to the editor did I think we should restrict the rights of the military to vote."" 
On June 19, 1997, a state district judge ruled that the Democratic candidates failed to make a case in challenging the mail-in ballots, and the federal judge subsequently lifted his injunction blocking Jernigan from taking office. Jernigan was sworn in, nearly eight months after the election. 
End of story? Not quite. 
In April 1997, the Texas House voted to approve an amendment by Rep. Hugo Berlanga, D-Corpus Christi, intended to prevent military personnel from voting in local elections unless they had local addresses in the county where they were voting. The amendment did a few things, but at issue here was that made it so that military personnel could only use the federal postcard application to request absentee ballots for federal elections. If they wanted to vote in state or local elections, they needed to register with that county and provide the address of the legal residence in the area they intended to return to. 
Berlanga insisted the legislation didn't limit military voting rights, but rather protected the rights of all Texas voters. Critics argued that it did exactly that by restricting the scope of the federal postcard application. The amendment later died in the Senate. 
White defended the amendment, according to a May 4 news article in the Abilene Reporter-News. ""It really just simplifies voting for military personnel,"" he said. ""All a member of the military has to do to maintain his or her voting registration in Texas is contact the Secretary of State to register and continue to vote in their home county."" 
Currently? A person is permitted to vote in the ""last real home you had in the U.S. and is referred to by election officials as your voting residence address,"" according to the Texas Secretary of State. You don't have to own or live in the property, but it should be your last U.S. address — not including places where you live temporarily. 
Where does that leave the GOP's charge that White tried to limit or disenfranchise military voters? 
In 1997, White supported two lawsuits that sought to throw out hundreds of absentee ballots cast by military members in a South Texas election on grounds that the voters didn't meet residency requirements, and that their votes violated the Voting Rights Act. 
At the same time, White also favored a legislative proposal that could have made it harder for military personnel to vote in state and local elections in Texas. Why? For each state or local election back home, the affected voter would have to demonstrate they had a local address in the Texas community, register to vote there, and then request the appropriate absentee ballot. 
Did White's positions — which he hasn't backed off — equate to limiting the right of military personnel to vote? Well, he'd certainly make it harder for those personnel wanting to vote in state and local elections with the same ease some exploited to cast ballots in the Val Verde County election of 1996. 
However, the 1997 lawsuits and a moment of legislative action in the wake of one election does not a long history make. The Republicans' statement leaves the impression White has been working steadily to restrict military voting rights for decades.

McConnell says that Kerry-Lieberman climate bill 'essentially written by BP'
","The ongoing oil spill caused by a damaged BP well in the Gulf of Mexico is bringing attention to the relationship between the oil conglomerate and politicians. On June 9, 2010, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., used a floor speech to link BP and a climate-change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.

""The problem for Democrats is that debating the Democrat cap-and-trade bill might not fit neatly into the White House messaging plan, since it’s been widely reported that a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP. This is clearly an inconvenient fact: an administration that seems to spend most of its time coming up with new ways to show how angry it is with BP is pushing a proposal that BP helped write.""

McConnell touched on a lot of points in this excerpt, but the one that most interested us was whether ""a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP.""

When we asked McConnell's office for evidence to support this charge, a spokesman provided us with links to several news reports. These stories -- published over the past few months in the Washington Post, in the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill, and in the energy-and-environment trade publication Greenwire -- offer ample evidence that BP was involved in the long-running negotiations over the bill, and that the company spoke favorably about the measure as it was being drafted.

The articles indicated that BP, along with Shell, ConocoPhillips and the Edison Electric Institute, would ultimately endorse the measure. In fact, one article specifically noted that BP CEO Tony Hayward -- not yet the internationally known face of the disaster -- gave a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in March in which he ""indicated he was encouraged"" by the Kerry-Lieberman effort.

Aides to Kerry and Lieberman do not dispute that BP was involved in the negotiations, along with many other parties.

""The senators met with more than 60 of their colleagues and all involved stakeholders, including environmentalists, religious leaders and the business community,"" said Whitney Smith, a spokeswoman for Kerry.

""The senators worked with a diverse set of colleagues and stakeholders to develop their discussion draft,"" added Lieberman spokesman Marshall Wittmann. ""They met with the CEOs of Shell, BP and Conoco because their industry will be regulated under the bill and it was important to ensure that the bill's approach to transportation emissions would reduce oil dependence. They also met with members of the business and environmental community in an effort to ensure that the bill met all of their goals: to grow the economy, create jobs and clean our air.""

But it's one thing for a company's representatives to meet with Congressional aides, make the company's case and suggest that they may endorse a bill. It's another to actually write legislation. On this point, Kerry and Lieberman's offices are clear: ""Senators, not any industry, wrote this proposal, and any suggestion to the contrary is false and politically motivated,"" said Smith, the spokeswoman for Kerry.

Let's delve into the evidence.

On March 24, Houston Chronicle energy blogger Tom Fowler reprinted a ""discussion draft"" by BP that advocated several policy positions related to hydraulic fracking. That's a technique that allows energy companies to unlock natural gas by injecting chemicals into underground reservoirs. Critics have suggested that the procedure risks tainting adjoining water supplies, and they have urged lawmakers to establish tight controls on the process.

As reprinted in Fowler's blog, the ""discussion draft"" argued that ""governments and industry have critical roles toward continuing to assure the public that hydraulic fracturing operations are effectively managed and regulated and that human health and the environment are protected."" Among other things, the draft sought to maintain ""the confidentiality of trade secret information.""

However, this language was not included in the draft bill that Kerry and Lieberman released a month later. Quite the opposite: The bill draft said that ""a hydraulic fracturing service company shall disclose all chemical constituents used in a hydraulic fracturing operation to the public on the Internet in order to provide adequate information for the public and state and local authorities"" -- a much more stringent standard than that sought by BP.

It's also worth noting that the BP ""discussion draft"" was not even intended to be actual language in the bill. Rather, it was intended as language for a ""Sense of the Senate"" resolution, which, unlike the law itself, is not binding.

BP also sought a federal pre-emption for automobile tailpipe emissions, said Jeremy Symons, senior vice president at the National Wildlife Federation. That means that BP wanted the federal government to set a universal standard for emissions, rather than having states set their own levels, which could allow some states -- especially California -- to set stricter limits. Such a policy has been a longstanding item on the industry's agenda for climate change regulation.

In this case, too, the Kerry-Lieberman draft bill specifically maintained the right of states to set emissions limits, leaving BP's idea on the cutting-room floor.

And BP and other players in the industry proposed increasing gasoline taxes at the pump rather than curbing vehicular emissions through a direct cap, said John Coqueyt, a legislative specialist with the Sierra Club, an environmental group. After making progress initially, this idea was abandoned in the Kerry-Lieberman draft, Coqueyt said.

""On the one hand, BP did have substantial input into the Kerry bill,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety. BP, other oil companies, the Edison Electric Institute and other industry groups ""submitted much language and many ideas. Some are probably recognizable in the current bill. ... But I don't think it is accurate to say that BP essentially wrote a major part of the bill.""

We agree. There's no question that BP, by taking a cooperative stance with Kerry and Lieberman rather than an adversarial one, had the opportunity to float its ideas during the legislative drafting process. And by dangling the possibility that the company might back the bill -- which would provide the senators with politically valuable support on a complicated and contentious bill -- BP and other energy companies wielded some leverage in the drafting process. In fact, many on the left -- not just conservatives like McConnell-- are disappointed that Kerry and other Democratic supporters of climate change legislation worked with oil companies, including BP, while crafting the bill. But saying that the senators listened to BP's case is not the same as saying that ""a major part"" of the bill ""was essentially written by BP.""

In fact, looking at three BP-pushed initiatives that have come to light shows that none were included in the current draft of the bill, which suggests that the senators and their aides were hardly captive to BP. It may be revealing that one day after the statement we're checking, McConnell had toned down his description of BP's role. In a floor speech on June 10, 2010, McConnell said, ""Some favor the Kerry-Lieberman cap-and-trade bill, a significant portion of which, by the way, has been pushed by the oil company BP."" If he'd simply said ""pushed"" the day before, he would have been pretty close to being accurate. But McConnell went much further when he said that BP had ""essentially written"" a ""major part"" of the bill. We rule that claim by McConnell False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/14/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-says-kerry-lieberman-climate-bill-essent/

This measure tends to undercount students who don't finish school, said Chris Swanson, vice president for research and development with Editorial Projects in Education, the nonprofit group that publishes the education news and policy magazine Education Week. Instead, experts tend to rely on another measure: the graduation rate. This is the percentage of students who receive their diplomas on time. Graduation rates are more widely available and consistent, he said.Making a fair comparison between states is even more difficult. Few groups publish graduation rates that are comparable between states. Swanson's group does. So does the National Center for Education Statistics, which collects and publishes data for the U.S. Department of Education. Oxendine's statement avoids both of these pitfalls. Although he used the word ""dropout,"" Oxendine's claim is actually based upon graduation rates, according to his campaign manager. His data come from the National Center for Education Statistics. For the past 13 years, average secondary-school graduation rates have been lower in Georgia than Alabama.

State Rep. says Georgia sets ""gold standard"" for food safety
","
Note to readers: An update was posted to this item on June 29, 2010. Also, a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared July 7, 2010. See the note and letter at the end of this story.  
When we read a recent news release issued by state Rep. Kevin Levitas (D-DeKalb County), we thought back to a small town named Blakely. His announcement said that Gov. Sonny Perdue’s signing of the Sanitary Activity for Food-Processing Enterprises Act celebrated the strength of the state’s food-safety system:

""Georgia has a well-deserved reputation for setting the gold standard for food safety, and the SAFE Act continues our state’s long tradition of protecting the consuming public,"" Levitas said in the release. ""An overwhelming majority of food processors in Georgia keep quality and safety as their primary concerns. The SAFE Act is intended to keep out the bad actors and punish the few who put profit over human life and safety.""

Georgia-produced peanut butter took a huge hit a few years back. The South Georgia town of Blakely was the home to a Peanut Corporation of America plant that helped spawn one of the biggest outbreaks of food-borne illness in the nation’s history. The salmonella outbreak in late 2008 sickened about 700 and was linked to nine deaths nationwide. Georgia Agriculture Department plant inspection reports showed grease and dirt buildup on equipment, unmarked chemical containers and gaps in doors large enough for rodents to scuttle through. One worker testified before Congress that she spotted roaches and rodents inside.

Blakely came to symbolize Georgia’s lax culture of food-safety regulation. In 2007, salmonella from ConAgra Foods in Sylvester, the maker of Peter Pan peanut butter, made more than 600 people ill. That same year, botulism was found in canned chili from a plant in Augusta. It was the first outbreak of botulism from commercially canned foods in nearly four decades.

Can a state that produced a tainted peanut butter that killed nine people set the ""gold standard"" for food safety?

It’s hard to establish what a ""gold standard"" might be in the food safety arena. No ranking of state programs exists because it’s difficult to come up with a good way of scoring them. When we asked experts to name states with good systems, they cited Oregon, Minnesota and New York. Not Georgia.

We asked Levitas for evidence backing his claim. He said that since the outbreak, the state Legislature has strengthened food-safety laws in two crucial ways: It created a requirement that food processors alert the state within 24 hours when tainted food is discovered, and it made it a felony for food processors to knowingly release  contaminated products to the public.

The reporting requirement is the result of 2009’s Senate Bill 80, which was passed in response to the peanut butter scare. Food processing safety experts we talked with had not heard of another state with a similar rule, so Georgia is unique in this regard.

The problem is that the reporting rule applies to only a portion of food processors. A loophole allows food processors who submit a special ""written food safety plan"" to avoid being subject to the 24-hour reporting standard, according to the text of the bill, media coverage and interviews with experts. So while this requirement may be unusual, its impact is limited.

This year’s House Bill 883 made the knowing release of tainted products to the public a felony in Georgia. Experts said this state law is unusual but the act is already a crime under federal law.

Levitas said it was necessary to make releasing tainted food a crime on the state level to help local prosecutors. It’s easier to prosecute a bad food producer in court when there is a death of a consumer if it was the result of a state crime, he said.

There are other ways to measure the strength of Georgia’s food-safety system. Some states are better than others at figuring out the cause of an outbreak. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog group, Georgia had 283 tainted food outbreaks between 1998 and 2007. Ninety-nine were solved, said David Plunkett, a staff attorney for the group.

""We’d say Georgia is fair to middling,"" Plunkett said.

Another sign of a good food safety program is adherence to the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program, which was created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state food-safety regulators, said Joe Corby, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials and a respected food-safety expert. These standards, which Corby said are difficult to meet, establish requirements for inspector training, inspection, self-auditing and other procedures. Georgia is among 25 states implementing the program, according to the organization.

That’s good, but not great.

While Georgia legislators have passed new and sometimes unique food-safety regulations since the peanut butter scare, this state is far short of setting a gold standard. Georgia has a history of major food-safety lapses that have killed and debilitated consumers, and the laws passed in response are limited. We rate Levitas’ statement False. 

Update: A June 13 item on Rep. Kevin Levitas' statement that Georgia sets ""the gold standard"" on food safety contained a factual error. PolitiFact Georgia said that a new food safety law has a loophole that exempts some processors from having to report tainted food to the state within 24 hours. That's not the case. The loophole allows some processors to submit a special ""written food safety plan"" in lieu of following testing procedures set by the state but does not exempt those processors from the 24-hour rule.  
Our original ruling of ""false"" is unchanged. Had Rep. Levitas said the food safety laws in Georgia have gotten stronger, he would have been right, but the ""gold standard"" is clearly hyperbole.

Newspaper's verbal nitpicking misses the point, misleads public

As the AJC has now expressly acknowledged in its correction, the recently enacted SAFE Act has strengthened Georgia's food safety regulations. The act is a giant step by the Legislature toward achieving the ""gold standard"" that I proudly described. 
The AJC now portrays my effusive praise as ""hyperbole."" There is a vast difference between enthusiasm and falsity, as my statement was labeled. Divergences in characterizations do not reflect disparities in the truth. 
The AJC's focus on semantics, rather than on substantive benefits to Georgia consumers, does a disservice to its readers. Your paper demonstrated the same hyper-literalism when it scoffed at Roy Barnes's enthusiastic support for education by demeaning his allegoric suggestion that he would scrape gold from the Capitol dome, if need be, to improve education. In both cases, the AJC's verbal nitpicking missed the point entirely and misled the public. 
The important point was and is that the SAFE Act will move Georgia forward substantially in food-safety protection for Georgia consumers. 
Unfortunately, the AJC's ceding only about 200 words for my response to its 800-plus word attack devoted to my characterization precludes an adequate reply and prevents readers from having a fair forum in which to make up their own minds.

To close out the show's roundtable segment on June 6, 2010, This Week host Jake Tapper brought up Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game on June 2, 2010, which fell apart when umpire Jim Joyce blew a call at first base. Joyce later acknowledged that he should have called the runner out, which would have cemented the perfect game, and baseball fans argued passionately over whether Commissioner Bud Selig should have overruled Joyce's call retroactively. (Selig decided to let the call, and the not-quite-perfect game, stand.)

Will -- a bestselling author on baseball and one of the game's most prominent fans -- took Tapper's bait as if it were a hanging curve ball. Will argued that Joyce's incorrect call should stand, arguing, among other things, that the sterling sportsmanship displayed by Galarraga, Joyce and the other players after the mistake amounted to a far richer gift to the game and its fans than recording another perfect game.

As evidence of how the sport can overcome bad calls, Will cited the final pitch of New York Yankees pitcher Don Larsen's legendary 1956 perfect game during the World Series -- the only one ever thrown in more than a century of World Series games. Will characterized umpire Babe Pinelli's call of a third strike on Brooklyn Dodgers pinch hitter Dale Mitchell as clearly incorrect, even suggesting that Pinelli rushed the game to a conclusion in order to preserve the perfect game. Yet Will concluded that baseball has survived quite nicely despite Pinelli's error.

""In the most important perfect game ever pitched -- 1956, Don Larsen in the World Series -- the 27th out was made by Dale Mitchell,"" Will said. ""A wonderful batter's eye he had. He struck out 119 times in 4,000 Major League at-bats. The umpire (Pinelli) -- it was his last game, by the way -- called strike three on Dale Mitchell. It was a foot and half probably high and outside. He was so eager to get the game over.""

A foot and a half outside the strike zone seemed to us like a pretty badly blown call. We thought it would be worth checking to see if Will was correct in how he described Pinelli's call. Will would have been 15 at the time of the 1956 World Series, and we wondered if he had a seat behind the batter's box that day, or maybe watched the pitch on one of those primitive black-and-white televisions of the era. Had he reviewed a video of the game? We sought comment from the noted columnist, some explanation of how he would know so precisely the way the ball strayed from the strike zone, but he and his staff did not provide a comment.   

Let's note that Will is correct about Mitchell's career statistics -- he struck out only 119 times in 3,984 at bats -- but did not mention that Mitchell was at the end of his career, with some baseball experts saying he'd lost a step. Mitchell's plate appearance against Larsen was the second-to-last of his career, and he batted just .204 (11-for-54) during the 1956 regular season and went hitless in four at-bats in the World Series. ""This was not Dale Mitchell in his prime,"" said Gabriel Schechter, a research associate at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. ""I think it would be fair to say that his reflexes had slowed down, making it tougher for him to react to borderline pitches.""

We should also note that Will was not quite correct about this game being Pinelli's last. The perfect game was indeed Pinelli's last game behind home plate, but he finished out the rest of the World Series as a field umpire.

Now for the big question: Was Larsen's final pitch really ""a foot and a half"" high and outside?

First, we'll relate the case for Will.

Lew Paper -- a Washington attorney who wrote the book ""Perfect: Don Larsen's Miraculous World Series Game and the Men Who Made It Happen"" -- told PolitiFact that ""every Yankee on the field who could see the last pitch to Mitchell, other than Larsen and (catcher Yogi) Berra, said that it was clearly outside the strike zone.""

In his book, Paper relates that Hall of Fame outfielder Mickey Mantle later said that he had ""a clear view from center field, and if I was under oath, I'd have to say that the pitch looked like it was outside."" From third base, Andy Carey thought the pitch was ""high,"" while Yankees shortstop Gil McDougald said, ""It wasn't even close. It was high.""

Because these comments are consistent, and because they go against their teammate Larsen's interest, they carry some weight. In addition, Duke Snider, the Dodgers Hall of Fame outfielder, told Paper that in a conversation he had with Babe Pinelli years after the perfect game, the umpire said he'd wanted to go out with a perfect game and that any pitch close to the strike zone would be called a strike. If Snider reported Pinelli's quote accurately, then it's certainly possible to believe that the umpire may have bent the strike zone in this unusual situation.

But none of this proves that Pinelli's call was as flagrantly out of the strike zone as Will suggests

Indeed, most experts we interviewed agreed that the pitch was borderline. While most said it was likely outside the strike zone, we didn't find much support for the idea that Larsen's pitch was a foot and a half outside of it. Most said Pinelli's was a defensible judgment call -- which, if true, would reduce its value as a point of comparison for the Galarraga incident.

Referring to the widely seen video clip of the final pitch, Steven Goldman, a contributing editor with Baseball Prospectus, describes the ball as ""tailing away"" from Mitchell -- enough that Berra had to ""lean pretty far outside"" to catch it. He said that Will's description was ""broadly accurate"" but also ""a bit hyperbolic."" We watched that video over and over, and couldn't quite discern a ball on the screen. It was like watching mimes pretend to play baseball, but we're not the experts.   

""If it was not a strike, it was very close,"" said Doak Ewing, president of Rare Sportsfilms, which sells a DVD of the perfect game. ""It wasn't a foot and a half out of the strike zone.""

The strongest defense of Pinelli's decision to call strike three came from Schechter of the Hall of Fame.

""My view is that the pitch seemed a little high by today's standards, but not necessarily by 1956 standards, because the strike zone was technically larger back then,"" Schechter said. ""It also might've been outside, but lots of pitches that look outside aren't. I think the operative baseball maxim is that 'it was too close to take,' especially in a situation like that where a pitcher might get the benefit of the doubt."" (For baseball novices, ""taking"" a pitch means not swinging because the batter expects the umpire to call it a ball.) Schechter agreed with Goldman and Ewing that ""the pitch might have been out of the strike zone as we know it today, but not by a foot and a half."" He added that anyone looking at the pitch today from the filmed version has to be careful about how they judge it. ""The camera angle we see is from above and to the first-base side, making it tougher to judge where the ball really was.""

We asked Alan M. Nathan -- an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) who has written widely about the physics of baseball -- what he thought of the camera angle and its value in judging Pinelli's call.

""Like many others, I have seen that video many times,"" Nathan said. ""The camera angle on the Larsen video is far from being ideal."" Because the view is off-center, he said, it's subject to what physicists call parallax -- a difference in the apparent position of an object when viewed along two different lines of sight. ""There is a lot of parallax, making it difficult to know with any accuracy about whether the pitch was really outside.""

Nathan added that, judging by the film, ""the pitch looks outside. I can't easily tell that it is high, and I don't see how the others can tell that it is high. But I agree that it was too close a pitch to take with two strikes. Note that Mitchell himself started to swing at the pitch, but appeared to hold up in time.""

Larry Gerlach, the founder and former chairman of the umpires committee of the Society for American Baseball Research, agrees. ""Perfect game, last inning, two outs, two strikes: the batter damn well swing at anything close,"" said Gerlach, a history professor at the University of Utah. ""That is a cardinal tenet of umpiring — and batting. Pinelli made a great call, and Mitchell, by leaving the bat on his shoulder, did not do his job. You simply do not 'take' a pitch in that situation.""

So let's recap. There's ample evidence -- including the players' eyewitness testimony -- that the pitch was not a down-the-middle, obvious strike. In all likelihood, it was somewhat out of the strike zone. But we found wide agreement among our experts that Will is exaggerating when he says that Larsen's pitch was a foot and a half outside the strike zone. And if it wasn't a flagrantly bad call like Joyce's earlier this month, then the example's value for Will is reduced. As umpire, we rate Will's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/12/george-will/george-will-says-final-pitch-don-larsen-1956-was-f/

Bill McCollum and Barack Obama see eye-to-eye on stem cell research, Rick Scott claims
","In a Republican primary, it's often hard to find major policy issues where the candidates disagree.That's why Rick Scott, the former health care CEO running for governor, is trying to make the most of a perceived policy difference with Attorney General Bill McCollum.In new direct mail pieces, Scott is claiming that McCollum supports embryonic stem cell research. Scott, meanwhile, says he would work to ban any embryonic stem cell research in Florida.""Career politician Bill McCollum -- Testing stem cells. Testing our values,"" the mailer reads. ""Bill McCollum supports embryonic stem cell research. Bill McCollum holds the same position on this issue as Barack Obama, who recently lifted a ban on funding for embryonic stem cell research.""McCollum disputed Scott's mailer, calling it false (and Scott ""ruthless"") in an interview with the Associated Press on June 7, 2010.""That's just absolutely not true. I don't know where he got that from,"" McCollum said.Sounds like a case for PolitiFact Florida.For this fact-check, we're going to detail to McCollum's public position on embryonic stem cell research, and then President Obama's. Then we'll see if they're the same, as Scott claims.McCollum's positionEmbryonic stem cells are harvested from embryos that are four or five days old. In almost every case, the stem cells are extracted from left-over embryos created by women attempting to get pregnant through invitro fertilization. Scientists say embryonic stem cells hold great potential, and can be used to test new drugs and have unique regenerative capabilities that could unlock treatments for heart disease, diabetes and other diseases. The embryos are destroyed in the process.To best understand McCollum's position on embryonic stem cell research, we need to start back in 1996 when McCollum was a congressman from Central Florida.That year, Congress attached an amendment to an appropriations bill that limited or banned federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. The Dickey Amendment -- named for Arkansas Republican Jay Dickey --- said that the federal government could not fund the creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes or fund research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death.The appropriations bill -- and the amendment -- passed 371-42. McCollum voted for the measure.The Dickey Amendment hardly ended the discussion, however, nor ultimately clarifies McCollum's position. The NIH produced a legal opinion that essentially created a loophole in the proviso. The federal government could not use tax dollars to create embryonic stem cells, the NIH said, but it could fund research on privately-created stem cell lines.Former President Bill Clinton's administration began crafting policies to fund embryonic stem cell research, but control of the White House changed before the new policies were implemented.Enter President George W. Bush.In August 2001, Bush essentially restated U.S. policy with an executive order.Bush gave a nationally televised speech, outlining his position -- that the federal government could and should fund research on the 60 or so embryonic stem cell lines already in existence, but that it would not fund research on new or future embryonic stem cell lines.Now, jump to the elections of 2004.Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry promised if elected to open new embryonic stem cell lines to federal funding. Bush maintained his opposition.The dichotomy between Kerry and Bush trickled down the Florida Republican Senate primary that year between McCollum and Mel Martinez.Martinez supported Bush's restrictions and pressed McCollum to stake out a position. Throughout 2004, newspapers generically said McCollum favored increased embryonic stem cell research, but provided little context.In July 2004, McCollum said: ''I think appropriate funding for embryonic stem cell research is a pro-life position. It conforms completely with my faith and my belief in the unborn and my belief of when life begins. And I'm one with my conscience and with my Lord.''Then, in an August 2004 debate, Martinez fired a second bullet on the stem cell issue.According to the Miami Herald accounting of the debate, Martinez said:""What you should do is define yourself. Do you support President Bush on stem-cell research or do you not?"" Martinez said. ""Or will you continue to side with John Kerry on this very important issue, and one, frankly, that's becoming a dividing issue in the presidential contest?""McCollum interrupted, the Herald reported.""Mr. Martinez, you know that I do not believe in stem-cell research that takes a life.""McCollum then pointed out that other conservatives support the research, and the Herald reported that McCollum has said that test-tube-fertilized embryos that are to be discarded at fertility clinics are not technically human life. He said they should be used for scientific experiments to cure diseases. McCollum lost the primary, and his position on embryonic stem cell research was not questioned again. Until now.Spokeswoman Kristy Campbell explained his current thinking.""The general has been consistent on this issue,"" Campbell said. ""He's never supported creating embryonic stem cells simply for research. But if the only options were to destroy the stem cells, or use them for research, he's preferred they go to research.""To recap: McCollum voted for the Dickey Amendment, which blocks federal funding of at least some embryonic stem cell research, but he has consistently advocated for stem cell research beyond that of President Bush. In particular, he has said if the options for embryonic stem cells are destruction or research, he chooses research.Obama's positionObama clearly detailed his position on embryonic stem cell research during the 2008 presidential campaign.""I believe that the restrictions that President Bush has placed on funding of human embryonic stem cell research have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations,"" Obama said in response to a question from the website ScienceDebate.org. ""As president, I will lift the current administration’s ban on federal funding of research on embryonic stem cell lines created after Aug. 9, 2001, through executive order, and I will ensure that all research on stem cells is conducted ethically and with rigorous oversight,"" Obama wrote.""I recognize that some people object to government support of research that requires cells to be harvested from human embryos. However, hundreds of thousands of embryos stored in the U.S. in invitro fertilization clinics will not be used for reproductive purposes, and will eventually be destroyed. I believe that it is ethical to use these extra embryos for research that could save lives when they are freely donated for that express purpose.""Practically, Obama's position was not altogether different that Republican nominee John McCain. McCain said he supported federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, but opposed the ""intentional creation of human embryos for research purposes.""In March 2009, Obama reversed U.S. policy and lifted Bush's ban on embryonic stem cell funding.Obama's reversal, however, is still somewhat limited by the Dickey Amendment.To recap: Obama supports increased funding for embryonic stem cell research, and reversed Bush's 2001 executive order. He says it is ethical to use extra embryos from invitro fertilization clinics that would otherwise be destroyed.Comparing the twoEmbryonic stem cell research is not a strictly partisan issue.The Republican-controlled Congress in 2005 passed a bill that would ease Bush's stem cell research restrictions, but it was vetoed by Bush. Among those supporting the measure were Republican senators Trent Lott, Orrin Hatch, Bill Frist and Kay Bailey Hutchison, and House Republicans Ginny Brown-Waite, Bill Young and Connie Mack.Bush also vetoed a similar measure in 2007 that passed with some GOP support.The key in this fact check, however, is to see if McCollum and Obama have the ""same"" position.On embryonic stem cell research, it appears McCollum and Obama are awfully close.Obama supports using embryonic stem cells that otherwise would be destroyed for research. McCollum does, too.The only real question is regarding funding. McCollum did vote for the Dickey Amendment, which sought to prevent federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. But in 2004, he talked about ""appropriate funding"" for embryonic stem cell research.Obama, meanwhile, has supported increased federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, saying embryonic stem cells ""may have the potential to help us understand, and possibly cure, some of our most devastating diseases and conditions."" There's enough of a question when it comes to funding in our minds to add a slight asterisk to Scott's mailer.

"['National', 'Census', 'Pundits', 'Glenn Beck']","
Glenn Beck takes a shot at the census
","On his Fox News Network program on June 7, 2010, host Glenn Beck took a few shots at the 2010 U.S. Census. It began as a knock on reports about job gains this quarter, which Beck rightly noted was mostly due to a surge of temporary, taxpayer-funded census jobs. ""Does anybody think spending $14.5 billion on temp census workers is good for the country in the long run?"" Beck asked. ""What would our grandparents say?"" Beck then took issue with the cost of the 2010 Census. ""The 2000 Census cost $4.5 billion,"" Beck said. ""The 2010 Census is set to cost up to $14.5 billion."" That'd be more than a 200 percent increase, and so we decided to check it out. Beck was accurate about the cost of the 2010 census. But that's not a one-year expense. It's the accumulation of 10 years worth of census work. At the U.S. Census, they talk about the ""life cycle"" cost of their decennial census counts, because each is the product of years and years of work. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's budget estimates presented to Congress in February, 2010 -- after factoring in appropriations from 2002 through 2009 plus the president's budget request for 2010 -- the estimated life cycle cost of the 2010 Census program is $14.8 billion. That includes census funds in the economic stimulus package passed in 2009. But Beck is off on the cost of the 2000 Census. Adjusted for inflation (the only fair way to compare costs over time), the life cycle cost of the 2000 census was $8.2 billion. Still, that's a pretty hefty jump -- about 80 percent. Some context, however, is in order. For starters, there were simply more homes to count in 2010 than in 2000. In 2000, there were 117.5 million housing units; and in 2010 there were an estimated 133.8 million. That's a nearly 14 percent increase. But there's more to the story than just adjusting for inflation and growth in the population that needs to be accounted for. The budget report notes that the cost of conducting a census has historically gone up over time. Even adjusted for inflation, the cost per housing unit went from $14 in 1970; to $29 in 1980; to $40 in 1990; and to $70 in 2000. The estimated cost per household in 2010 was $111. ""Several factors that are independent of programmatic methodology contribute to this phenomenon,"" the report states. ""For example, a desire for accurate coverage of a growing and increasingly diverse population adds complexity to each census. Also, experience reveals that people have become more resistant to answering surveys and providing information to the government. Adding to these difficulties is increased immigration and its diversity of languages and cultures, which creates challenges in maintaining a wholly inclusive census."" The report notes that the average percentage increase in unit cost for the three previous census cycles was 71.5 percent. But the percentage increase for the 2010 Census was 58.5 percent. Officials with the U.S. Census Bureau make one other point about the increased cost of the 2010 Census. It incorporated two major shifts in responsibility. Starting in 2005 (which again is all part of the 2010 Census ""life cycle"") the Census Bureau began conducting an annual American Community Survey, in which it collects detailed household information that used to only be collected once every decade from those who got the census' long form. And the Census Bureau began a multi-year effort that includes the use of global positioning system (GPS) technology to modernize and enhance the capabilities of the nation's road map. In other words, the mission of the 2010 Census was different than it was in decades past. And while we're fact-checking the change in the cost of the census from 2000 to 2010, Census Bureau spokeswoman Shelly Lowe couldn't let Beck's comment about ""spending $14.5 billion on temp census workers"" go unchallenged. In fact, she said, the cost of the temporary workforce was slightly more than $2 billion. Beck's overall point that the cost of the 2010 Census went up considerably from 2000 to 2010 is accurate. But adjusted for inflation, it didn't go up as dramatically as he said. Using Beck's numbers, the change was more than 200 percent. But when you balance the cost to account for inflation and the fact that there were more homes to count, the increased cost was just under 60 percent. The Census Bureau also works differently than it did in past decades. For one, it now does an annual American Community Survey. Those kinds of details are important for an apples-to-apples comparison. And so we rate Beck's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/11/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-takes-shot-census/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Message Machine 2010', 'State Budget', 'Jerry Brown']","
Jerry Brown says California's not exactly the Golden state when it comes to credit ratings
","Compared to the drama in the California gubernatorial Republican primary, Jerry Brown's campaign for governor can seem a little low-key. Still, Brown is the Democratic challenger, so PolitiFact decided to check out his website.

In his welcome video, the former governor and current attorney general of California outlined the problems he sees plaguing the state.

""It's no secret that Sacramento isn't working today. The partisanship is poisonous. Political posturing has replaced leadership. And the budget: It's always late, it's always in the red, and it's always wrong. Today the political breakdown in Sacramento is threatening jobs, our schools, and the state's credit rating, which is the worst in the country. Our state is in serious trouble, and the next governor must have the preparation, and the knowledge, and the know-how to get California working again.""

We were curious about his claim about credit ratings. Are they really the lowest of all the states?

Just as individuals borrow money to buy a car or a house, states like California borrow money to fund their budget and projects. One way that they do this is by issuing General Obligation bonds. And just as a bank tries to determine the likelihood that an individual will pay back a loan, plus interest, on time, credit rating agencies try to determine if states will pay back the money they borrow, plus interest, on time.

""The rating on a bond answers a very simple question with an often complicated answer: how likely is this issuer (California) to not make good on its debt,"" said Satya Thallam, associate director of economic education at the George Mason University's Mercatus Center. In the spectrum of bonds, G.O. bonds tend to be the lowest risk because they are not tied to any specific revenue stream, but are backed by the ""full faith and credit"" of the issuer, he said. That means California promises to use all tools at its disposal, including tax increases, to pay the loan on time.

The three biggest U.S. credit rating agencies -- Standard and Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch -- have all given California's G.O. bonds the lowest ratings of any state.

• Standard and Poor's: Gave California an A- rating with a negative outlook Their rating starts at AAA, then AA, A, then BBB and so forth down to D.

• Fitch: Recently gave California an A- with a stable outlook.

• Moody's: At the time Brown made the claim, California was alone in the cellar of Moody's ratings among states. But the agency recently downgraded Illinois to the same level. Moody's uses a slightly different rating system. Its highest rating is Aaa, then Aa1, Aa2, Aa3, A1, A2, A3, Baa1 and so forth down to C. California and Illinois are rated A1.

But none of these ratings are quite as bad as they sound.

Gabriel Petek, the primary author of S&P's report on the California GO Bond rating, said that the ""A-"" rating is still strong in the ""grand scheme of the rating universe. But relatively speaking, the risks seems incrementally greater to us"" compared to other states.

Still, why are California's bonds riskier than those of other states?

Two of the biggest problems are institutional constraints and partisan politicking. In California, the legislature requires a two-thirds majority to pass a budget and to raise taxes. That makes passing a budget, let alone a balanced one, very difficult, because the minority party, which has more than one-third of the votes, has a great deal of leverage. Furthermore, the state constitution requires that the legislature spend at least 40 percent of the budget on education, which further decreases legislative flexibility.

As a result, it is not uncommon for the budget to be passed late, leaving the state short of cash. In 2009, California started issuing IOUs to ""non priority payees"" such as tax refund recipients, in order to be able to continue reimbursing for G.O. bonds. Petek said that those IOUs were good and bad: ""The ability of the controller to issue IOUs when cash is or is expected to become unacceptably low both protects the state's credit quality, and at the same time illustrates that the state's budget and cash problems have reached a fairly serious point.""

California is also feeling the bite of the recession more than many other states because it derives 50 percent of its revenue from income taxes, much of it from capital gains taxes. So when the stock market took a sharp dip, so did California's revenue.

Brown was right about California having the lowest credit rating. Illinois' recent descent to California's level in Moody's ratings happened after Brown's post, so we are not counting that in our assessment.  So we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/11/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-californias-not-golden-state-when/
"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Nathan Deal']","
Nathan Deal says he's a leader on immigration
","During his campaign for governor, Nathan Deal has repeatedly cited his work on immigration issues as a U.S. congressman as evidence he has leadership skills. He brought it up in May during a gubernatorial debate in Gwinnett County. Fox Business TV host Neil Cavuto said Deal ""led the fight against illegal immigration in the House"" during an April 29 interview. And when fellow Republican Karen Handel challenged him to prove he was a leader on the issue during his 17-year tenure, he reiterated the point in a news release. “While Karen Handel was busy preparing her resume to run for Secretary of State or Governor, Nathan Deal was leading in Congress to protect our borders.""The release outlined five of his accomplishments as proof. We will analyze these points one at a time. Deal ""led the fight"" to require citizenship verification for recipients of Medicaid services under the health care overhaul signed into law this year. He led the fight, but he didn't win it. Deal was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce in July 2009 when he offered an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 that would have required citizenship verification for people applying for and renewing their Medicaid benefits. The proposal was narrowly defeated, 29-28. Deal was ""lead sponsor"" of legislation to prevent automatic citizenship for babies born in the United States to illegal immigrants. Yes he was, again and again. We found four instances in which Deal sponsored bills that would end this path to U.S. citizenship: the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009; the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2007; the Citizenship Reform Act of 2005; and the Citizenship Reform Act of 2003.Even before Deal began sponsoring these birthright bills, he supported similar congressional efforts. He was a regular co-sponsor of such resolutions starting when he took office in 1993. He did so for 10 years before he began to sponsor the bills himself. None of the bills passed. Deal ""authored and passed"" a law that requires that the citizenship of Medicaid applicants be verified. Deal and the late U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood of Augusta share credit for this successful measure, which attracted widespread media coverage in 2005 and 2006. They introduced this provision as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, a massive budget bill that trimmed funding for entitlement programs. It required that Medicaid recipients show proof of citizenship when they apply for benefits or renew them. Deal was a ""longtime leader"" in the U.S. House of Representatives' Immigration Reform Caucus. The Immigration Reform Caucus is a group of more than 90 U.S. congressmen, almost all Republicans, that advocates for placing more restrictions on illegal immigrants and immigration, as well as taking a more aggressive approach to enforcing existing laws. Deal was a member of the caucus and was mentioned in a March 2007 Roll Call article as leading its team on birthright citizenship, a cause he has supported since 1993. We have found articles mentioning his membership in the group dating to 2001. The group was founded in May 1999. Deal worked ""hand-in-hand"" with Norwood on the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act, which proposed to allow local law enforcement to assist federal authorities in enforcing immigration laws. This bill ""became the origin"" of the  287(g) program of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which delegates some immigration law enforcement power to certain state and local law enforcement agencies.    Yes. And no. Deal did work closely with Norwood on the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act, according to Greg Louer, who served as Norwood's policy director, and James R. Edwards Jr., a fellow for the conservative Center for Immigration Studies who consulted Norwood on the bill while he was with the conservative think tank the Hudson Institute. They fought for it for years. It was introduced four times, starting in 2003. While the bill never passed, it became influential, Louer said. Portions of its language appeared in as many as 20 similar bills. Deal's campaign argues CLEAR ""became the origin"" of the 287(g) program, and that it in turn opened the door for the March arrest of Kennesaw State student Jessica Colotl. Colotl entered the country illegally when she was 10 and was taken into custody and cited with immigration violations after she was unable to produce identification during a March traffic stop. Her case has since become a flash point for immigration policy debate. But CLEAR did not originate the 287(g) program. It was named after a section in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 -- seven years before the first CLEAR bill was even introduced. State and local law enforcement agencies began participation in 2002, one year before Norwood submitted the first CLEAR bill to Congress. Yet while CLEAR never made it into law, its popularity among conservative lawmakers did pressure ICE to beef up the 287(g) program, Louer and Edwards said. The program received additional funding. More law enforcement agencies signed up to take on immigration enforcement roles. Plus one of the legislation's major goals -- to improve information sharing on immigration violations between the federal government and local law enforcement -- was adopted administratively by ICE during the later years of the Bush administration.So was Deal a leader on immigration reform while he was in Congress? He certainly was consistent. His approach on illegal immigration stretches back to his first year in Congress. He was also persistent. He was willing to press issues such as birthright citizenship repeatedly. Deal is also recognized by a nationally known immigration watchdog group as taking a lead on the issue.""He certainly was one of the leaders,"" said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.And while his success changing actual U.S. immigration law is limited and his campaign's portrayal of the CLEAR bill's influence over the 287(g) program is incorrect, Deal did play a notable behind-the-scenes role beefing up immigration enforcement. We rate this claim to be Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/11/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-hes-leader-immigration/

","Rick Scott’s opponents for governor are telling reporters to essentially brush off a June 2010 poll that shows the former Columbia/HCA hospital CEO beating both Attorney General Bill McCollum in the Republican primary and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink in a hypothetical November match-up. Focus on the fraud, they say. The fraud. The fraud. “Rick Scott has spent $15 million in half as many weeks to fund his public image repair squad’s pricey and misleading paid media campaign,” McCollum spokesman Kristy Campbell said June 10, 2010. “It’s no surprise he has skyrocketed in the polls since Floridians are just beginning to learn about his questionable past. His lead will evaporate when Floridians learn Rick Scott oversaw the most massive Medicare fraud scheme in American history.” Democrats added their own e-mail titled “Fraud is not a mistake,” and a 2-minute, 40-second web video called “Slick Rick.” “Rick Scott may think that his millions of dollars will allow him to avoid answering hard questions about his record as CEO of Columbia/HCA ... but with your help we will make sure he is held accountable,” said the Florida Democratic Party’s Eric Jotkoff. The fraud. The fraud. PolitiFact Florida had to bite. Here we’ll focus on whether Scott’s old company, Columbia/HCA, committed fraud, and also explain Scott’s role with the company, his part in a federal investigation and the outcomes of the federal probe. To borrow a line from Scott’s television ads — Let’s get to work. Columbia/HCA history Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company by purchasing more hospitals. A hospital network created efficiencies. Efficiencies created profits. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. When Scott resigned as CEO in 1997, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott’s campaign says. The company employed more than 285,000 people. Now about Scott’s departure in 1997. That year, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. In time it became apparent that the investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA bilked Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public and before the depth of the investigation became clear. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. At issue, Scott says, is that he wanted to fight the federal government accusations. The corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle. And settle, Columbia/HCA did. In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced what it called the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history when Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement, which all apply to when Scott was CEO: The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total fine:  $1.7 billion. Plea deals, fraud As part of the 2000 settlement, Columbia/HCA agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. A corporate felony comes with financial penalties but not jail time, since a corporation can’t be sent to prison. Among the 14 felonies, Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Also, four Florida-based Columbia/HCA executives were indicted. Two were convicted of defrauding Medicare in 1999 and were sentenced to prison, only to have those convictions overturned on appeal. A third executive was acquitted and a jury failed to reach a verdict on the fourth. Was Scott close to going to prison for his part in the case? It appears not at all. The former CEO was never indicted and was never questioned in the case, he says. He may have been a target of the investigation — an ABC News report from 1997 says he was — but that never translated into charges. Sorting it out Let’s boil this down. Was Scott running Columbia/HCA when it found itself at the center of a massive federal investigation? Yes. Did the company pay a record $1.7 billion in government penalties and fines? Yes, Columbia/HCA paid. And as we checked in this item, did his former company commit fraud? Yes, it pleaded guilty to fraud charges as part of a settlement. Of course, the million-dollar question is how much of the blame ultimately falls on Scott? And that’s an answer we can’t provide. Scott was in charge so he bears some responsibility and has said so. But there has yet to come to light any detail of how much he knew, and when he knew it. Though that won’t keep us from looking. McCollum's campaign, in a statement, said Rick Scott's former company Columbia/HCA committed fraud. We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/10/bill-mccollum/rick-scott-leading-polls-opponents-pull-out-fraud-/

2011 W-2 tax forms and HR 3590: No, you won't have to pay taxes for health insurance
","A new chain e-mail makes the claim that most people, even retirees, will see big tax increases next year thanks to President Barack Obama's new health care law, because it will start taxing health insurance as regular income. ""You really need to read this,"" it begins. ""Starting in 2011 (next year folks) your W2 tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company. It does not matter if that's a private concern or governmental body of some sort. If you're retired? So what; your gross will go up by the amount of insurance you get. You will be required to pay taxes on a large sum of money that you have never seen. ""Take your tax form you just finished and see what $15,000 or $20,000 additional gross does to your tax debt. That's what you'll pay next year. For many it also puts you into a new higher bracket so it's even worse. This is how the government is going to buy insurance for 15% that don't have insurance and it's only part of the tax increases.""The chain e-mail is correct that employers will be required to start listing the cost of insurance. The requirement starts for the tax year 2011, so employees will see it on the W-2s they receive in 2012.But that amount will not be taxed. Current law excludes health insurance from taxable income, and there's nothing in the health care law that changes that. Several experts on health care benefits and the workplace confirmed that. ""It will not affect your taxable income under the new law,"" said Dallas Salisbury of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in an e-mail interview. Since the health care law actually continues the tax exemption on employer-sponsored insurance, why include a requirement that employers report the value of health insurance on the W-2? There are several reasons.The new health insurance law will eventually penalize people who are not insured with a tax penalty. The W-2 reporting requirement will help the Internal Revenue Service verify that people have coverage, both for themselves and their dependents.There's also a tax on the so-called ""Cadillac"" or ""gold-plated"" health insurance policies, which are policies that cost significantly more than the national average. The W-2 reporting will allow the IRS to more easily collect the tax. We should also emphasize that the Cadillac tax doesn't go into effect until 2018, and it will apply to health insurance plans that cost more than $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, with some exceptions for people in high-risk categories. Most people will not be affected by the tax; analysts expect it to hit fewer than 20 percent of all policies.The chain e-mail we looked at goes the extra mile to promote its deceptive claim that everyone will be taxed next year, however. ""Joan Pryde is the senior tax editor for the Kiplinger letters. Go to Kiplingers and read about 13 tax changes that could affect you. Number 3 is what I just told you about,"" the chain e-mail states. ""Why am I sending you this? The same reason I hope you forward this to every single person in your address book. People have the right to know the truth because an election is coming in November.""We looked up the Kiplinger letter and couldn't help noticing that the article states the following: ""A requirement that businesses include the value of the health care benefits they provide to employees on W-2s, beginning with W-2s for 2011. The amount reported is not considered taxable income.""Got that? ""Not considered taxable income.""So the e-mail's own evidence refutes its premise.The e-mail is correct that employers will have to let employees know how much their health insurance costs the employer. But the e-mail's main point -- and the fact that we're checking here -- is that you will be taxed on your health insurance. That is not only wrong, but refuted by its own reference. Assuming the e-mail's author read that Kiplinger entry, we can only conclude that this is a deliberate attempt to upset and mislead voters. This sort of fear mongering rates a Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jun/10/chain-email/w-2-tax-forms-hr-3590-health-insurance-pay-taxes/

Mike Pence accurately cites ICE arrest, deportation data for 2017
","Vice President Mike Pence countered Democratic attacks of an immigration agency by highlighting the agency’s enforcement success. Some Democrats have called for restructuring or abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, claiming it tears apart families and that it has lost its ability to effectively do its job under President Donald Trump. During a trip to Missouri to tout the Trump administration’s tax cuts, Pence chose to highlight ICE’s arrest and deportations in 2017 as signs of its effectiveness. ""Last year alone, I’m proud to report to you that ICE agents removed more than 226,000 illegal immigrants from our country,"" Pence said. ""In fact, they arrested more than 127,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or facing charges of breaking our nation's laws, including ICE removed nearly 5,000 gang members from our streets."" Readers asked us to verify Pence’s data. We found that he accurately cited ICE numbers. But data also showed that the most common charges and convictions were for traffic offenses, immigration, and ""dangerous drugs."" Pence’s wording could leave the wrong impression that those criminal convictions were for more serious offenses. At least 226,119 people were deported by ICE in fiscal year 2017, according to the agency. (Fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, so it included nearly four months of the Obama administration.) ICE deported more people the year before, at 240,255. But ICE said the proportion of removals due to ICE arrests was greater in 2017 than in 2016. ICE’s overall removal numbers account for people who were arrested by ICE inside of the country and people apprehended at the border and turned over to ICE for removal. Pence’s number of people arrested by ICE checks out with the agency’s data — of 143,470 administrative arrests, nearly 128,000 had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. Administrative arrests are arrests of people who were either present in the country illegally or had somehow violated the terms of their entry/status, an ICE spokeswoman said. Here’s a breakdown of those arrests: • Criminal convictions: 105,736 • Pending criminal charges: 22,256 • No known criminal charges or convictions: 15,478 A criminal conviction or charge for breaking an American law covers a broad category. The majority stemmed from non-violent offenses. The most common convictions and charges were for immigration, drugs, and traffic offenses, including DUI. Among other offenses ICE listed were homicide, ""public peace,"" ""general crimes,""and ""liquor."" Pence also said nearly 5,000 gang members had been removed. ICE in fiscal year 2017 deported 5,396 gang members. ICE began tracking gang removals in fiscal year 2014, but does not track removals by specific gang affiliation.

Governor hopeful Kelda Roys' claim that abortion is a crime in Wisconsin has some truth but misleads
","If someone gets caught robbing a store in Wisconsin, that person could go to jail. After all, robbery is a crime in Wisconsin. What about abortion? With the first television ad in her campaign for governor, released July 19, 2018, Democrat Kelda Roys contends that ""abortion is still a crime in Wisconsin."" Since the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade recognized a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion in 1973, abortion has been legal in the United States. That includes Wisconsin, where more than 5,000 of the procedures are performed every year. So, it’s highly misleading to call abortion a crime in Wisconsin. And yet, Roys has a point. The ad Roys, an attorney and former executive director of the abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin, narrates her 30-second ad. The ad opens with video clips of President Donald Trump announcing his nomination of federal appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court and then Trump signing a document. While those are shown, Roys says: ""Just when you think it can’t get any worse, it does.""   Then Roys is shown writing on a pad of paper and she says: ""In Wisconsin, abortion is still a crime."" More images of Roys appear as she says: ""And I can’t believe that I’m having to fight the same fights that my grandmother fought."" The ad could leave the impression that a woman getting an abortion is committing a crime. Federal law vs. state law When we posed Roys’ claim to former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Janine Geske, a professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, she confirmed, in light of Roe vs. Wade, what seems obvious: ""It’s not a crime in Wisconsin. Abortion is legal."" When Roy was asked to back up her claim, she cited Wisconsin law — which has made performing an abortion a crime since 1849. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The nonpartisan state Legislative Reference Bureau has noted Roe vs. Wade ""rendered unenforceable the criminal penalities"" in the state law. But it is still on the books. Current state law on ""crimes against life and bodily security"" includes a section on abortion. It states: ""Any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child is guilty"" of a felony. Some exceptions are provided to save the life of a mother. ""If it's in the criminal code, it's a crime,"" Roys told us. So, does it matter that Wisconsin’s statute criminalizing abortion is still in place? The crux of Roys’ claim As the opening of her TV ad suggests, what Roys is getting at is what may happen if Roe vs. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court.   That’s a prospect that many fear with Kavanaugh’s nomination — even if, as PolitiFact Florida found, his position on Roe is not clear. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. If Roe were overturned, regulating abortion would revert to the states. Experts with the pro-abortion rights Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin and with the anti-abortion Wisconsin Right to Life agreed that the Wisconsin law still being on the books is important. Indeed, abortion-rights advocates have fought, as recently as 2017, to get the statute removed, while abortion foes have succeeded in keeping it in place. If Roe were ever overturned, the Wisconsin statute would again be in effect  — although there are questions about whether it would be used immediately. There likely would be litigation over that, said University of Wisconsin Law School professor of law and bioethics Alta Charo. Wisconsin is one of seven states that would revert to pre-Roe state law if Roe were overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports women’s access to abortion. Our rating Roys says: ""In Wisconsin, abortion is still a crime."" Abortion has been legal throughout the country, including in Wisconsin, since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Roe vs. Wade case in 1973. It is the law of the land, so to flatly declare that abortion is a crime in Wisconsin is misleading. But current Wisconsin statutes still include a provision  — made unenforceable by Roe — that generally makes performing an abortion a felony. And that’s important, should Roe ever be overturned. In sum, Roys’ claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/25/kelda-helen-roys/governor-hopeful-kelda-roys-claim-abortion-crime-w/

Democratic challenger misleads in claim on Rep. Tom McClintock’s record
","Jessica Morse, the Democratic challenger in California’s 4th Congressional district race, describes incumbent Republican Rep. Tom McClintock as ""a career politician"" whose done next-to-nothing in Congress. Morse, 36, is a former State Department employee and first-time candidate. McClintock, 62, is seeking a fifth term representing the largely rural district east of Sacramento. Before his time in Congress, he spent 22 years as a state lawmaker. Morse made another claim about McClintock that caught our attention on Twitter: ""I believe McClintock is beatable. Word is getting out that, like Trump, he is shamelessly dishonest and utterly ineffective; he has authored three laws since he’s been in office; two renamed post offices."" I’m standing up to McClintock’s abysmal leadership, join me! We decided to fact-check the portion about McClintock authoring just three laws. Was Morse right? Our research Asked about the claim, Morse’s campaign said it ""was simply quoting Eric Johnson, the author of the article linked in the tweet."" Johnson is the editor of the Sacramento News & Review. Morse’s tweet links to his July 19 column in the publication, titled Defeat Trump’s local ally.  Morse does use quotation marks in her tweet. But she doesn’t explicitly attribute it to Johnson. The impression left is that the words are hers or, at the very least, that she stands by the claim. Her tweet gives it a stamp of approval and perpetuates questionable information. In the past, PolitiFact has called out politicians, including President Trump, for quoting and retweeting inaccurate information on Twitter. In November 2015, for example, Trump tweeted an image packed with racially loaded and incorrect murder statistics. PolitiFact rated it Pants On Fire. We’ll take the same approach in our examination of Morse. Number of bills Starting with the number of bills McClintock has authored that became law, Morse’s statement is off. Websites Govtrack.us and Congress.gov show McClintock has authored four bills that were signed into law. Morse is right that two of McClintock’s bills were to rename post offices. But does the number of bills passed truly measure a politician’s effectiveness? Not necessarily, said Jack Pitney, professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College. ""Bill authorship is only one dimension of effectiveness,"" Pitney wrote in an email. ""A lawmaker can have a huge impact without being prime sponsor of a major bill.   ""A great deal of legislating takes place in the amending process,"" he added.  ""The amending may take place in committee, or on the floor, as part of an informal negotiation. A member of the House may not pass a measure as a freestanding bill but then be able to attach it as a part of a larger bill."" Claims about members of Congress passing a small number of bills, some to rename post offices, aren’t new. In 2016, we rated Half True now Sen. Kamala Harris’ claim during a debate in the race for U.S. Senate that Rep. Lorretta Sanchez had ""passed one bill in her 20 years in Congress, and that was to rename a post office."" We found that was technically correct. But it ignored the fact that relatively few stand-alone bills introduced by members of Congress are passed on their own. Many are added as amendments to larger bills. Longtime Democratic House members Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, at that time, had sponsored a combined 10 stand-alone bills that became law during their careers. Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego, agreed the number of laws passed isn’t the only measurement of effectiveness. Still, it’s ""a reasonable way to go"" when examining a politician, he said. For some conservative lawmakers, passing laws isn’t necessarily the goal, Kousser added. ""Tom McClintock is not a guy who believes you need a law for everything,"" Kousser said. ""He doesn’t necessarily view a law as an accomplishment."" Our ruling  Democratic challenger Jessica Morse claimed on Twitter that GOP Rep. Tom McClintock ""has authored three laws since he’s been in office; two renamed post offices."" Websites Govtrack.us and Congress.gov show McClintock has authored four bills that were signed into law. Two were to rename post offices. Morse’s claim is wrong on the number signed into law. But her tweet is also misleading because members of Congress rarely author stand-alone bills. Most are added as amendments to larger bills. Additionally, the number of bills authored is not necessarily the best measurement of a politician’s effectiveness. There are many other ways they can shape legislation.

Kaine correct that Stewart skipped board meeting to campaign for Roy Moore
","During a recent campaign debate, Sen. Tim Kaine took aim at Republican Corey Stewart’s support for former Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost an Alabama special election after facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. ""In December of 2017, the Prince William board of supervisors had a meeting ... you skipped that meeting to go campaign in Alabama for Roy Moore to be a U.S. senator,"" Kaine said at the July 21 debate, noting that the meeting covered topics such as zoning and the opioid crisis. Several minutes later, after Stewart dodged Kaine’s original question, Kaine added: ""You haven't disavowed Roy Moore's name yet."" Stewart, the at-large chair of Prince William County’s board of supervisors, has battled frequent criticism for his history with the far right. He has since renounced some activists with whom he previously associated, but he has not been shy about supporting estranged figures in his party, so we decided to see whether Kaine’s claim checked out. On Dec. 12, 2017, the Prince William County board of supervisors met to consider, among other things, an increase in spending on the county’s substance-abuse treatment programs. Stewart was not present at that meeting. He was on the campaign trail in Alabama with Moore, carrying out a plan he announced two days earlier in a news release, according to local reports. Stewart also detailed his visit to Alabama in a Facebook live video. He said he planned to fly to Atlanta, and drive a rental car to Montgomery in order to show support for Moore, who he said was a fellow ""anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate."" ""If you’re wondering, why am I going down to Alabama, why is it important, and that is because we’re all in this together, folks, we’re all in this together,"" Stewart said. ""It is the establishment Republicans who are together colluding with Democrats, with liberals, and they’re trying to take out every single anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate."" ""I’m going down there to support him,"" Stewart added. ""Next year, when the establishment comes after me … I’m hoping, of course, that I will get his help as well."" Stewart later tweeted a photo taken at the Moore rally in Alabama. ""With @UofAlabama students at the @MooreSenate rally! #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp,"" he wrote.

""I am not going to cut and run from a good man like Judge Roy Moore,"" he said in a Facebook live video. Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, pointed to multiple occasions when Stewart defended Moore or explained his belief that Moore should have been presumed innocent until proven guilty because the accusations were decades-old. In a post-debate interview with PBS NewsHour anchor Judy Woodruff, who moderated the debate, Stewart refused to condemn Moore. ""I do believe (Moore) when he said he didn’t do that,"" Stewart said. ""I thought that he was treated unfairly,"" Stewart added. ""I don’t think it’s right that 40 years after something supposedly happened, somebody comes out and says that you do something, and then, instead of them having to prove that you did it, it was left upon him to try to prove that he didn’t do it."" Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch acknowledged Stewart’s continued support for Moore in an email. ""Corey never claimed to have disavowed Moore,"" he wrote. ""To claim so would be false."" Kaine said Stewart skipped a Prince William County board of supervisors meeting to campaign for Moore. Stewart missed a Dec. 12, 2017, meeting at which the board of supervisors voted on a proposal to boost funding for programs meant to cope with the opioid crisis. Instead, he attended a rally for Moore in Alabama because he said it was important to support an ""anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate.""

Did Joe Manchin say yes to repealing Obamacare, as opponent's ad says?
","The U.S. Senate race in West Virginia got a little hotter with the release of an ad by Republican Patrick Morrisey, who’s challenging incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin. The ad’s narration features the words ""lied"" or ""lying"" no fewer than four times. In the ad released July 17, the narrator said, ""Liberal lying Joe’s got to go. Told Trump yes to tax cuts. He lied. Yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied. Now Manchin says he’s pro-life but seems to only want a pro-abortion Supreme Court justice. Does Manchin back abortion on demand up to the day of birth? Liberal lying Joe’s got to go."" WATCH: @JoeManchinWV lied to the people of West Virginia and to @POTUS about how he would vote on issues that matter most to West Virginians. It’s time for liberal lying Joe to go. #wvpol #WNSen pic.twitter.com/kBMDzhk0QU The narration includes a lot of claims, but in this article we’ll fact check one of them — that Manchin was ""yes to repealing Obamacare."" At best, the ad oversimplifies Manchin’s record on Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. The law, signed by President Barack Obama, overhauled the nation’s health care insurance markets and provided other consumer protections. Manchin has been open about not liking certain parts of the law, and has said that he’d like to repeal those portions. But we were unable to find an example in which he supported a repeal of the entire law. Here are some of the instances of Manchin’s comments in 2010, when he was the state’s governor running in a tight special election for Senate. His Republican challenger, businessman John Raese, was accusing him of being a rubber stamp for Obama. • On Sept. 18, 2010, the Gazette-Mail reported, ""The governor recently told the Gazette-Mail that he backed only certain provisions (of the Affordable Care Act) — for instance, those that allow people with pre-existing conditions to get health care, or let young adults stay on their parents' health plans. ‘I wouldn't have voted for the final version of that thing with the way that it came out,’"" he said. • On Sept. 27, 2010, Real Clear Politics wrote that Manchin, previously a strong supporter of the law, now ""favored ‘repealing the things that are bad in that bill.’ He ticked off a list of reforms in the law that he supports and asserted there is broad agreement in both parties for many of them. ‘Can't you keep that as a good base?’ he said, adding, ‘It's a great bill.’ He emphasized that he's not calling for wholesale repeal and just wants to roll back parts of it… ."" • On Oct. 8, 2010, MSNBC’s Hardball host Chris Matthews asked Manchin, ""Do you like the health care bill that Obama got through? Do you like it?"" Manchin responded, ""No, not the way it passed."" • On Oct. 11, 2010, Manchin said on Fox And Friends that he’s ""always been in favor of health reform"" but the law was ""far too reaching … . It needs to have a lot of it repealed."" • On Oct. 24, 2010, Manchin was pressed on his stance by host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Wallace asked, ""You're saying now that if you'd known what was really in the bill, although last March you said you'd have voted for it, you now say you would have voted against it?"" Manchin responded, ""Correct. Now, knowing the existence as far as how reaching it had been, as far as an onerous, I would have."" He added, however, ""There's a lot of good parts to it. Why won't we fix what's wrong with it and make it better?"" • Perhaps most notably, on Oct. 12, 2010, the Charleston Daily Mail quoted remarks by Manchin that had been reported previously in the Wheeling Intelligencer: ""They can absolutely be sure I will vote to repeal the whole thing unless we can find common ground and common sense."" That's the closest example we could find of an affirmative vote to repeal, but we couldn't find it corroborated. The Daily Mail article added, ""The Daily Mail has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to talk directly to Manchin about his position on health care over the past couple of weeks."" It’s clear that Manchin, facing a tough election, was walking a tightrope on the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Presented with the hypothetical question of whether he would have voted for the bill if he’d been in Congress at the time, Manchin said — some of the time — that he would not have. But that’s not the same as saying ""yes to repealing Obamacare,"" as the ad asserts. In fact, his message in these comments was that he had some problems with the law, but he wanted to repeal the problematic portions, not the whole bill. Morrisey’s campaign also pointed us to an article in the Register-Herald of Beckley, W.Va., on Feb 20, 2014. It’s about a local town hall appearance by Manchin. Here’s the relevant portion: Both parties agree on many aspects of the ACA, such as pre-existing conditions not being excluded from coverage and no lifetime caps, but there are still many kinks that need to be fixed, Manchin said. ""I will vote tomorrow to repeal (the ACA), but I want to fix the problems in it."" He said the ACA is essentially a product and the government needs to find a way to ""sell it"" and make their customers want to buy it. The phrasing of the quote is odd, because there was no Obamacare repeal vote held the next day or the succeeding few days, according to Senate records. Indeed, Manchin’s camp quickly sought to clarify the comments at the time. After the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, reported the contents of the Register-Herald’s article, Manchin’s office provided a rebuttal that was added to the article: In an email to The Hill, Manchin said that despite his comments, he does not support repealing the law. ""I have never supported repealing the Affordable Care Act because I came to Washington to find solutions to our country’s problems,"" he said. ... Still, Manchin said the law has ""many flaws,"" and that those parts that can’t be fixed and should be eliminated. ""We should be working together to identify which parts of the law are broken and need to be fixed,"" he continued. ""We may learn that some parts of the law can’t be repaired, and we should eliminate those parts entirely. …"" It’s incomplete to cite Manchin’s words as reported in the local newspaper, since Manchin immediately sought to clarify what was reported. Since his election to the Senate, Manchin has voted consistently against repealing the Affordable Care Act wholesale. In eight Senate repeal votes tracked by healthreformvotes.org, a website affiliated with the liberal-leaning group healthinsurance.org, Manchin spurned GOP-led repeal efforts and voted for the ""pro-consumer"" side on all eight occasions. Those eight votes included one in 2011, two in 2015, and five in 2017. Recently, Manchin’s message on the Affordable Care Act has been consistent: He strongly approves of many things in the bill, and wants to fix the bill’s shortcomings rather than repealing it wholesale. Here’s a sampling of comments since early 2017, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans sought to repeal the law: • In March 2017, he told reporters on Capitol Hill that in West Virginia, ""I got an older population, I got a poorer population, and I got an opiate issue we need to clean up. And now, talk about insult to injury. You’ve got to have a moral compass inside of you."" • Manchin said in May 2017 that ""if they can get rid of the word 'repeal,' Democrats can sit down,"" according to the Washington Examiner. • In July 2017, Manchin told WTOV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio, ""I'm not voting to repeal any of the votes (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.) wants on repealing (Obamacare). I don't think you can throw the baby out with the bathwater thinking that you're going to save the baby when the baby might've needed a diaper change."" • He also told the Intelligencer and the News-Register in Wheeling, W.Va., ""I don’t think we should be repealing,"" Manchin said, adding, ""Come on guys, let’s sit down and fix it."" Morrisey’s ad said that Manchin said ""yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied."" During his tough initial Senate race in 2010, Manchin did rhetorically put some distance between himself and the law, which was passed before he was a senator. However, to the extent that he supported repeals, he was talking about repealing portions of the law he saw as problematic — not the whole law, much of which he said he supported. Indeed, Manchin has consistently voted against and criticized wholesale repeal efforts, saying that he favored reforming portions of the law instead. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/24/patrick-morrisey/did-joe-manchin-say-yes-repealing-obamacare-oppone/

Bruce Ohr, Peter Strzok and the Steele dossier, explained
","Did a contentious congressional hearing with FBI agent Peter Strzok yield new information? Or was it just political theater? On NBC’s Meet of the Press, conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt said the hearing revealed, for the first time, how U.S. law enforcement obtained a controversial document related to the investigation of Trump campaign ties to Russia. But the show’s moderator Chuck Todd seemed skeptical. Here’s the meat of their discussion (Hewitt and Todd interrupted each other several times): Hewitt: ""We learned that Nellie Ohr gave the Fusion GPS dossier to Bruce Ohr. That's how it got to the Department of Justice — at the end of the testimony, at the very end of the day, it came up in question."" Todd: ""It came up in Jim Jordan's head."" Hewitt: ""In Jim Jordan's head. And it was not contradicted by Peter Strzok. Look, I read this like a lawyer."" Todd: ""He was told what he couldn't say by the FBI, Hugh."" Hewitt: ""I believe it showed that. We will find out in the end how it all came together. But it's one investigation. I ask everyone just to wait on everything until the end."" Todd: ""All right. We'll leave it there. That's all for today. Whew. Thanks for watching."" There’s a lot to unpack. Here, we’re interested in Hewitt’s claim that Nellie Ohr, an analyst who worked at the research firm Fusion GPS, passed derogatory information on Donald Trump to her husband, a senior official at the Justice Department. So, did the Strzok hearing reveal that Nellie Ohr was a go-between for Fusion GPS and U.S. law enforcement agencies? No. The claim Hewitt floated on Meet the Press was first pitched by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, at the July 12 Strzok hearing. The charge centers on two virtual unknowns in the world of American politics: Nellie Ohr, a 55-year-old Russia expert and former government official, and her husband Bruce Ohr. During the 2016 election, Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm co-founded by former journalist Glenn Simpson. Fusion GPS was initially hired by the conservative publication Washington Free Beacon, though it’s better known for its later connection to then-candidate Hillary Clinton. After the Republican primary, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign. The firm contracted with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, whose memos detailing explosive, though not fully verified, claims about Trump are known collectively as the Steele dossier. During Nellie Ohr’s time at Fusion GPS, her husband Bruce Ohr worked as a high-ranking official at the Justice Department. He is a longtime friend of Christopher Steele, according to a profile in the New Yorker. The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment, and attempts to reach Hewitt, Fusion GPS, Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr were unsuccessful. We emailed Hewitt at two separate email addresses and tweeted at him as well.  The Steele dossier eventually reached the Justice Department and FBI. These agencies relied on the dossier contents, to some degree, to obtain a wiretap on a former Trump campaign adviser. Jordan’s theory is about how the dossier found its way to law enforcement agencies. Some House Republicans allege Nellie and Bruce Ohr acted as a go-between for Fusion GPS and the agencies. Jordan leveled this charge during the Strzok hearing, claiming Nellie Ohr provided a backchannel. ""This is amazing,"" he said. ""So Nellie Ohr works for Fusion, works for Glenn Simpson, and she's giving documents to Bruce Ohr, who’s giving them to the FBI."" The next day, Jordan’s House Republican colleague stretched the allegation even further. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky suggested that Nellie Ohr’s supposed handoff of the dossier to Bruce Ohr demonstrated collusion between the Clinton campaign and the FBI. Why does this matter? Jordan and Massie seem to be arguing that a connection to the Clinton campaign would undermine the report’s credibility and show the investigation to be politically tainted. But there’s no evidence Nellie Ohr was responsible for routing the Steele dossier to the Justice Department. Even Jordan’s office seemed to acknowledge as much. His spokesman, Ian Fury, characterized the congressman’s assertion as ""a working theory that (Jordan) was trying to establish"" during the Strzok hearing. We reviewed Strzok’s congressional testimony and did not see that he confirmed Jordan’s theory. In fact, Strzok’s ability to respond Jordan’s questions appeared to be tightly circumscribed by FBI lawyers. He frequently declined to fully answer questions, citing guidance from FBI legal counsel. Strzok also indicated that he was unable to provide certain information to lawmakers because the investigation is still ongoing. The Strzok hearing did reveal that Bruce Ohr gave the Steele dossier to the FBI. ""Mr. Ohr provided information to the FBI that included material that is what everybody is calling the dossier, reporting from Mr. Steele,"" Strzork told lawmakers. So does that mean Ohr got the dossier from his wife? Not necessarily. Bruce Ohr and Steele were in contact in 2016. So Ohr could have gotten the Steele dossier directly from its author, rather than his wife. Republicans themselves have documented that connection. Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee said in a February memo that Steele maintained contact with Bruce Ohr during the election. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has also said Bruce Ohr served to ""funnel information from Steele to the FBI,"" even after Steele was terminated as a source around late October 2016. (The FBI terminated Steele for what it considered improper disclosures to the media; Bruce Ohr was later demoted at the Justice Department for failing to disclose meetings with Steele and Fusion’s Simpson, according to multiple reports.) In the weeks after the election, Bruce Ohr met with Simpson, after Christopher Steele urged the Fusion founder to do so. ""Chris suggested I give some information to Bruce, give him the background to all this,"" Simpson told the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017. ""And we eventually met at a coffee shop, and I told him the story."" It’s possible Bruce Ohr got the Steele dossier from Simpson, rather than his wife acting as a go-between. It’s also important to note that Bruce Ohr was not the FBI’s only source for the dossier. Steele himself met with FBI officials beginning in the summer of 2016, according to reports. The FBI would eventually receive multiple versions of the Steele dossier from multiple sources, according to an email Strzok sent colleagues in January 2017, obtained by The Hill. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., confirmed he gave a version of the dossier to then-FBI director James Comey in late 2016. David Corn, of Mother Jones, has said publicly that he gave the Steele memos to the FBI a week or two after the election in the course of his reporting. As a closing point, it should be noted that the Steele dossier did not trigger the FBI’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. That probe opened in July 2016 based on information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos. Hewitt said FBI agent Peter Strzok’s hearing confirmed Republican Congressman Jim Jordan’s theory about how the Justice Department got the Steele dossier. Specifically, Hewitt said Nellie Ohr, an analyst who worked at the research firm Fusion GPS, passed derogatory information on Donald Trump to her husband, a senior official at the Justice Department. But the hearing did not establish or confirm that Nellie Ohr was a go-between for Fusion GPS and U.S. law enforcement agencies. There are also several other ways law enforcement agencies obtained the Steele dossier that do not appear to involve Nellie or Bruce Ohr. Hewitt is not accurate in claiming that the hearing confirmed this theory. We rate his statement False. ",/factchecks/2018/jul/24/hugh-hewitt/hugh-hewitt-floats-unproven-theory-about-steele-do/

In Ohio, Mike DeWine misleads in video that says Richard Cordray wants to raise taxes
","Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine says his Democratic opponent for governor Richard Cordray supports a tax hike. ""Richard Cordray wants to raise your taxes by reversing President Trump's tax reform,"" says an online video on the DeWine campaign website Can’t Trust Cordray. ""Cordray wants to revoke your middle class $2,000 tax cut."" Here’s what DeWine is on point about: Cordray adamantly opposed the federal tax bill signed by President Donald Trump in December. Initially, that bill cuts taxes for all income groups. Here’s what DeWine omits: That tax bill did not cut everyone’s taxes, particularly in future years. And Cordray, who as governor would have no power to raise federal taxes, hasn’t said he wants to raise taxes. The video states that Cordray wants to reverse Trump’s tax reform, but the first thing to know is that if he won the race, a governor can’t control federal tax policy. And the video doesn’t tell the full story about that $2,000 tax cut. The tax bill doesn’t cut everyone’s taxes, especially for people in future years. At its start the tax bill does come close to providing tax relief for all income groups, and for most members within each group. The median household of a family of four gets about a $2,000 tax cut on average. That said, the benefits of the tax bill would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers. Over time these broad-based tax cuts dissipate. By 2027, every income group below $75,000 sees a tax increase. Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027. That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average. The DeWine campaign cited several statements by Cordray in which he criticized the federal tax bill as a benefit to the rich. In a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in December, Cordray said that the legislation helped corporations. ""There’s slabs for them, there’s crumbs for people like the middle-class people in our society,"" he said. ""I think it is wrong."" In a Dec. 20 tweet, Cordray called the bill a ""shortsighted abomination."" In February, Cordray tweeted that the tax bill brings ""more trickle-down economics that doesn’t trickle down."" Cordray has echoed a talking point by Democrats that cherrypicks the impact of the tax bill. The tax bill gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent by 2027 due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. We didn’t find any statements by Cordray weighing in on any specific proposal to replace the tax bill. We asked Cordray’s spokeswoman what he wants to see happen with federal tax policy and if he wants to raise or lower taxes for any particular group. ""Rich wants to see a federal tax plan in place that doesn’t hurt middle class families,"" his campaign spokeswoman Lacey Rose said. If Congress later changes the federal tax law, it could raise taxes on some people -- but it could also lower taxes on others. And even if such a bill were to gain traction, as a governor Cordray would have no say. DeWine’s video focuses on federal taxes, but we will briefly note Cordray’s position on state taxes because that is something in the power of a governor. We found that Cordray has been critical of state tax cuts and has called for certain tax incentives for businesses, but has been vague on the details. The clearest example we found in which he opposed tax increases was a May article by the Dayton Daily News which paraphrased Cordray saying he didn’t see a need for tax increases. Cordray said he wanted to prioritize state spending, including less for failing charter schools and more for local government to deal with the opioid crisis. He has criticized state tax cuts because that has trickled down to local governments facing choices about whether to raise their own taxes. At a gathering of union leaders and local government workers in April, Cordray slammed Republicans’ ""mania"" for cutting taxes. He vowed that as governor, ""if the legislature continues down its current path of tax and budget cuts, there will be vetoes."" DeWine said that ""Richard Cordray wants to raise your taxes by reversing President Trump's tax reform."" While Cordray has repeatedly bashed the federal tax bill, DeWine ignores that the bill didn’t cut everyone’s taxes, particularly in future years, and that repealing the bill, which could include a replacement, could end up cutting taxes for some families. While Cordray has made it clear that he criticizes the bill for helping the rich, he hasn’t laid out any specific suggestion for changing the federal tax law. Perhaps more importantly, if Cordray wins the governorship, he would not have a vote on federal tax policy.

Did Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban same-sex couples from adopting?
","A story drawing eyeballs on social media said Republicans approved a measure that, if implemented, would allow child welfare providers to deny same-sex couples seeking to adopt. ""Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting,"" said a July 12, 2018, headline from LGBTQ Nation, an online magazine. The headline choice leaves out important details that could give readers the wrong impression. The amendment would not establish a nationwide ban making it impossible for same-sex couples to adopt. Instead, it would allow individual child welfare providers to create their own adoption criteria — a change that would increase the potential for discrimination against gays and lesbians but would not constitute an outright ban nationwide. And the reference to ""Republicans"" refers to one House committee. The proposal is not yet law.  Here's what happened. The U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee voted on a measure related to adoption by same-sex couples July 11 during a markup of a funding bill for the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., introduced an amendment prohibiting the federal government, or any state or local entity receiving federal funds, from taking action against child welfare providers that refuse to provide services to certain customers due to ""sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions."" If installed, the Aderholt amendment would enable child welfare providers to discriminate when recruiting adoptive parents, promoting and facilitating adoptions, and supporting adoptive families. In a public statement, Aderholt made specific reference to child welfare providers that turn down same-sex families hoping to adopt. ""Several states and localities across the country are not allowing religious organizations, such as Catholic Charities and Bethany Christian Services, to operate child welfare agencies,"" Aderholt said. ""The reason for this is simply because these organizations, based on religious conviction, choose not to place children with same-sex couples."" He added: ""The amendment I introduced seeks to prevent these governments from discriminating against child welfare providers on the basis that the provider declines to provide a service that conflicts with its sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions."" Aderholt’s amendment also includes language requiring HHS to withhold 15 percent of federal funds allocated for child welfare services from states and localities that do take action against providers that refuse services on the basis of religious beliefs. The amendment was approved by a vote of 29 to 23, with all 22 Democrats and one Republican voting to strike it. Several Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have voiced disapproval for the amendment, calling it a ""license to discriminate."" Bil Browning, managing editor at LGBTQ Nation, said the amendment is part of a larger trend. ""This year alone, Kansas, Georgia and Oklahoma have passed legislation that would allow adoption agencies to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples,"" Browning said. ""In Kansas and Oklahoma, the Republican governors signed the legislation into law."" Still, the full funding bill will have to pass both the House and Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump before the amendment will enter into effect. Other headlines about what happened were more accurate. CNN wrote, for instance, ""Adoption agencies could refuse same-sex couples under measure OK'd by House panel."" A headline said, ""Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting."" The amendment is not an absolute ban on same-sex adoption, despite the headline's implication for casual readers. Republicans in a House committee approved an amendment that would make it illegal nationwide for states and localities to punish child welfare providers that refuse to place children with same-sex couples because of religious beliefs or moral convictions. But it has not yet been taken up by either chamber of Congress. Theoretically, the amendment would allow child welfare providers to implement official or de facto bans on same-sex adoption without fear of retribution. At the same time, states and localities could also choose to continue taking action against discriminating child welfare providers in spite of a 15 percent cut to their federal funding. LGBTQ Nation’s claim that the amendment would make it ""legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting"" is therefore slightly misleading, because the full effect of the amendment would depend on the responses of individual states and localities, as well as the number of agencies that elect to discriminate in their provision of services.  We rate this statement Half True.

Donald Trump falsely blames trade deals for lower soybean prices
","Midwestern farmers are among those taking the brunt of President Donald Trump’s strategy to win trade concessions from China. After Trump hit China with about $34 billion in tariffs, China responded in equal measure. Among its targets – soybeans. Prices quickly fell by about 20 percent. Trump went to Twitter to argue that the fight is worth it. ""Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years,"" he wrote July 20. ""The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!"" Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN! It’s clear that what is so far a mini-trade war has hurt prices. Have trade deals done the same? Trump focused on soybeans, so we took a look. Soybean prices have fallen since 2012, but the main driver has been weather. A drought that year cut production. Lower supply led to higher prices. Good weather followed, which boosted yields and pushed prices down. Trump tied falling prices to ""terrible"" trade deals, but that’s misleading. China is far and away the largest importer of American soybeans, buying about $12.3 billion worth last year, triple the amount in 2005. This has happened in the absence of a U.S.-China trade deal. Trump looked back to ""five years before the election."" We asked the White House to clarify and didn’t hear back. 2012 was the highwater mark for soybean prices. They topped out at $17.70 a bushel in early September 2012. At the end of 2017, the price was $9.55. Corrected for inflation, prices dropped over 50 percent. Here’s how the futures market for soybeans has performed since 2000. Several forces drove soybean markets, but the leading one has been weather. A drought in 2012 pushed down yields, which in turn, drove up prices. Since then, the reverse happened. ""In the past five years, we have had very good weather, "" said Aaron Smith, agricultural economist at University of California-Davis. ""Yields have been higher and that means prices go down."" Between cooperative weather and new growing techniques, the yield per acre went up about 25 percent since 2012, Smith said. Smith noted that before 2012, soybean prices rose thanks to the ripple effects of the growing use of ethanol. Corn is a major raw material for ethanol, and with rising demand, farmers shifted more acres from soybeans to corn. That kept soybean production in check and with fewer bushels of soybeans than there would have been, prices headed up. But to understand soybeans sales, Smith said you need to look to Asia, and primarily China. ""The demand from China has tripled in the past ten years or so,"" Smith said. The USDA statistics paint a clear picture. While the sales numbers bounce around a bit, China’s appetite for soybeans has been strong for the past 15 years. And that has been good for American farmers. Andrew Muhammad, a trade economist at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, said trade deals could not have been a factor here. ""China is our number one soybean export market, and we have no trade deal with China,"" Muhammad said. In the 1990s, Congress granted China Most Favored Nation status. That boosted trade between the United States and China, but Most Favored Nation sets broad rules, in contrast to micro-level details that get hammered out in formal trade treaties, such as the one with Colombia, one of the most recent agreements. The United States does have a trade agreement with Mexico. Mexico is not as big of a buyer as China, but sales have gone up since 2000 and largely held steady since 2012. The North American Free Trade Agreement might present issues in other areas of trade, but soybeans isn’t one of them. Trump said soybean prices have fallen since 2012 and a big factor was bad trade deals.   Trump’s link between trade deals and falling prices is misplaced. Experts who know agriculture say it comes down to supply and demand. On the supply side, weather is the single most important factor, followed closely by more productive growing techniques. On the demands side, look to China. American farmers have benefited from current trade rules. Their largest buyer is China, where sales to China have tripled since 2005. The United States has no trade deal with China. It does have a trade deal with Mexico, where sales gradually increased and plateaued in recent years. Trump is correct that soybean prices have fallen, but his point about trade deals ignores the real drivers.

Does GOP U.S. Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson support or oppose Mitch McConnell as majority leader?
","Kevin Nicholson, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, frequently casts himself as an outsider who wouldn’t be part of the political class in Washington, D.C. That stance has helped the first-time candidate draw endorsements from national conservative organizations. Now, you can’t get much more insider than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican who, despite his long tenure, so many Republicans seem to not to like. So, a key question for voters in the Aug. 14, 2018 GOP primary in Wisconsin is: Where does Nicholson stand on keeping McConnell as the majority leader? As it turns out, the answer is: For, against and somewhere in between. To address the question, we turn to our Flip-O-Meter, which rates a person’s consistency on an issue. Nicholson’s positions Early in the campaign, Nicholson was okay with McConnell. He told Politico in September 2017: ""I have no issues voting for Mitch McConnell."" But by October 2017, Nicholson favored replacing him. A Nicholson campaign spokesman told the Associated Press the original Nicholson comment had come before the Senate failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, saying: ""Kevin has made it clear he’s prepared to support new leadership because of the Senate’s failure to pass a conservative agenda."" The same comment about supporting new leadership was reported by the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison. A similar report appeared the same month in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The  newspaper stated that Nicholson opposes McConnell, with the campaign spokesman reiterating: ""Kevin has made it clear he’s prepared to support new leadership because of the Senate’s failure to pass a conservative agenda."" Also that month, there were two key endorsements of Nicholson, both of which cited McConnell. The pro-Donald Trump Great America PAC, with ties to former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, endorsed Nicholson. People close to Bannon said Nicholson, when meeting with Bannon, made it clear he would oppose McConnell as Senate majority leader, the Journal Sentinel reported. See all of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. FreedomWorks for America, a super PAC affiliated with a group that helped start the tea party movement, also endorsed Nicholson, saying Nicholson ""has indicated that he would oppose Mitch McConnell’s failed leadership."" Nicholson’s shift was noted in November 2017 in a  Politico article that carried the headline, ""Republicans flee from McConnell in 2018 primaries."" The article pointed out that Nicholson ""originally said he would support McConnell, but has since won Bannon's endorsement and now supports ‘new leadership’ for Senate Republicans."" But Nicholson would shift again. Some eight months later, on July 16, 2018, Nicholson moved to somewhere between support and opposition. This was the exchange when Nicholson was interviewed by major Trump supporter and former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who was filling in for conservative Milwaukee radio talk show host Mark Belling: Clarke: Will you vote -- when the new leadership is chosen in the next Congress  — will you support Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader? Nicholson: I mean, that's a hypothetical; it's hard to predict, right? Like, at the end of the day, I know that who's ever in leadership -- and I'm saying this, like, transparently and honestly as I can -- if they're putting forth good ideas, I'm going to be right there with them, kicking down doors to make it happen. At the end of the day, though, if what they’re doing is foisting upon us all 2,000-plus-page omnibus bills that land on the desks of U.S. senators 48 hours before they have to be passed, with no ability to be amended, I’m going to be the first guy pushing back. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Asked about the varying statements, Nicholson campaign spokeswoman Ronica Cleary sent us an email that didn’t address Nicholson’s position on McConnell, saying in part: ""Kevin has been consistent in saying that institutions should always be open to changing leaders when they aren’t functioning properly, and he believes that the entire Senate should be subject to term limits -- including leadership. This is why he’s limited himself to two terms. Ultimately, as he said on the radio this week, he is not going to answer hypotheticals."" Our rating Nicholson has gone from supporting McConnell as majority leader, to saying he wanted new leadership to now somewhere in between, saying the question is a hypothetical. Had we rated Nicholson’s first shift, he might have earned a Full Flop. But at this point, for being somewhere between support and opposition on McConnell, that’s a partial change in position. We give Nicholson a Half Flip.",/factchecks/2018/jul/24/kevin-nicholson/does-gop-us-senate-candidate-kevin-nicholson-suppo/

Kirstjen Nielsen falsely says there are billboards in Central America on illegal immigration
","Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the Trump administration is frustrated by a lack of congressional action on ""loopholes"" incentivizing illegal immigration. Not making things any better are billboards in Central America that she claimed give tips on how to migrate illegally to the United States. ""There are billboards in Central America in the Northern Triangle countries advertising how to grab a kid to get into the United States illegally. Because that loophole is so big. Billboards,"" Nielsen said during a July 19 interview with NBC’s Peter Alexander at the Aspen Security Forum. Poverty and gang violence are top reasons why many people flee Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador (a region called the ""Northern Triangle"") and seek asylum in the United States. Do billboards really suggest taking a kid to ease admission? PolitiFact was unable to find any evidence of the billboards Nielsen described. We repeatedly asked Nielsen's agency for billboard photos or any other evidence that would support her claim. We did not hear back. Several experts who study immigration and have traveled to Central America told us they have never heard of or seen such billboards. There were U.S.-sponsored billboards in Central America during the Obama years, but their goal was to deter illegal immigration, not encourage it. A quick point of clarification: Immigrants don’t need to ""grab a kid to get into the United States illegally."" Many come in without a child, and traveling with a child does not guarantee entry into the United States — legal or illegal, nor a path to citizenship. Also, the law allows parents and children to apply for asylum in the United States, even if they entered the country illegally. Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, said she returned this month from Guatemala after three weeks traveling around the highlands, the coastal lowlands, Guatemala City and the center of the country for fieldwork specifically on the causes and dynamics of outward migration to the United States. She said she was on the lookout for any migration-related signs. ""I did not see a single billboard related to migration, and definitely not promoting migration,"" Leutert said. ""The only thing I saw/heard while on the country's highways was an announcement on the bus radio warning would-be migrants of the dangers of traveling to the United States and how smugglers might abandon them in the desert."" There does seem to be an understanding in Guatemala that if you come to the United States as a single adult and seek asylum, you will be detained for the entirety of your case; and if you come with a child your detention may be temporary and you may be released with an ankle monitor, Leutert said. ""However, this was 100 percent not due to any potential billboard, as this is not how people get their information related to U.S. migration policy,"" Leutert said. Central Americans learn about U.S. policy — and trust the information — from their social networks; for instance, when they hear that a cousin who went alone seeking asylum is still detained but a family who went together are fighting their case outside detention with ankle monitors, Leutert said. Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor of government at George Mason University whose expertise includes Mexico-U.S. relations, immigration and border security, agreed that other methods are more effective: ""If you get in a taxi in Guatemala City and ask the driver if they know a smuggler, most of them know."" In countries like Guatemala or Honduras, the presidents are in line with U.S. policy and have been big supporters of the U.S. administration, said Correa-Cabrera, whose most recent trip to Guatemala was in late 2016. ""I’m sure if some billboards would be placed, they would disappear quickly."" ""I’ve traveled extensively in Central America and have never seen these billboards,"" said Eric L. Olson, deputy director of the Wilson Center’s Latin American Program and senior advisor to the Center’s Mexico Institute. ""This is not to say they do not exist, just that I’ve never seen any and find it’s highly unlikely that there would be such billboards, that is, if what is meant by billboards is large signs along a highway or thoroughfare."" Handbills in a poor community sounds more plausible, Olson noted. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute told PolitiFact it consulted with several of its researchers who did fieldwork in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador between February and May this year, and they were not aware of any such billboards in those countries. Immigration experts pointed out past U.S. government-sponsored billboards in Central America. Their goal: prevent illegal immigration, not promote it. As the United States had an influx of Central American unaccompanied minors arriving illegally, the Obama administration led public information campaigns to dissuade citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras from coming to the United States.  Campaigns in 2013 and 2014 focused on the dangers of the journey, while the 2015 campaign intended to increase awareness about the implementation and eligibility requirements for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — point being that new arrivals would not benefit from the deportation reprieve program available to young immigrants already in the United States. The campaigns included ads on radio, TV stations, billboards, bus stops, and buses, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported. The closest and most recent billboard we found about messaging to immigrants was raised by Amnesty International in April at the San Ysidro port of entry on the U.S.-Mexico border. Amnesty International said its billboard sought to remind U.S. and Mexican authorities of their obligations to facilitate asylum claims and invited asylum seekers to tell Amnesty International if they were turned away by officers. The billboard was raised around the time some people in a caravan sought entry into the United States. That billboard did not advertise how to get into the United States illegally with a child. Also, it was placed in Mexico, not within the Northern Triangle countries (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador). Nielsen said, ""There are billboards in Central America in the Northern Triangle countries advertising how to grab a kid to get into the United States illegally."" DHS did not provide any material to corroborate Nielsen’s claim. We did not find any evidence, and experts who research immigration and have traveled to Central America (including one who did fieldwork in Guatemala this month) said they’ve never seen or heard about the billboards Nielsen described. The Obama administration raised billboards to discourage illegal immigration. Amnesty International had a billboard in Mexico (not the Northern Triangle countries) to remind authorities about immigrants’ asylum rights and to tell immigrants to report to the organization if they were turned away. Those two examples aren’t in line with Nielsen’s description. The burden of proof rests with the speaker. In the absence of evidence to support Nielsen’s claim, we rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/23/kirstjen-nielsen/dhs-kirstjen-nielsen-falsely-says-there-are-billbo/

Record low unemployment in the Philly area? Pence is right, with some needed context
","Vice President Mike Pence is in Philadelphia on Monday to speak about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and attend a fundraiser for U.S. Senate candidate Lou Barletta. Protesters are expected to greet him, as they did during an earlier visit this year. Ahead of his trip, Pence published an opinion piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer that declared the Trump administration’s policies are benefitting Pennsylvania: ""Our agenda is delivering real results – and we’re just getting started."" Among the ""real results"" touted by Pence? That ""the unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded."" As jobs will likely be a major talking point during the midterm elections in Pennsylvania, we decided to check that statement. Most experts agree that presidents have little control over the economy. In his piece, Pence uses the unemployment rate for the Philadelphia area to bolster his argument that the Trump administration’s policies are benefiting the city. But presidential actions do not necessarily have much of an impact on job numbers, which are often driven by broader factors, such as international economic conditions and technological change. Experts also debate whether the unemployment rate is a meaningful indicator of the economy’s well-being. That probably rings true for the 48 percent of city residents living below the poverty line or for those who have stopped looking for work. But for the purposes of this fact-check, we stuck with the numbers. ""Based on data from the Philadelphia Metropolitan Division, the unemployment rate (4.7%) in May 2018 was the lowest ever recorded,"" the vice president’s spokesperson, Alyssa Farah, said via email when asked about the source of the claim. Unemployment data comes from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division is a subset of the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD metropolitan statistical area and includes both Philadelphia and Delaware counties. BLS releases both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted Local Area Unemployment Statistics. The Pa. Department of Labor & Industry uses seasonally adjusted data, as it allows for month-to-month comparisons and accounts for trends like layoffs after the holiday season, analyst Jeff Newman told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. For the Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in May, according to BLS. That number is preliminary and will be finalized within a month, Newman said. That 4.7 percent rate is the lowest number on record since January 1990. That’s as far back as BLS went when it reconstructed unemployment data based on MSA and metro division delineation changes that happened after the last census. Pence’s claim would not be true using non-seasonally adjusted unemployment data. The unadjusted unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in May, according to BLS, and was lower in April 2000 (4.3 percent). Ahead of his visit to Philadelphia, Vice President Mike Pence claimed in an opinion piece that the unemployment rate for the city’s metro area is the lowest on record. That is true only if one looks at seasonally adjusted unemployment data for the Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division (which includes Delaware County) since 1990, which is important context. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/jul/23/mike-pence/record-low-unemployment-philly-area-pence-right-so/

Donald Trump falsely says new Carter Page documents show Steele dossier launched Russia probe
","President Donald Trump claimed newly released documents underlying the FBI’s surveillance of a former campaign adviser show the controversial Steele dossier was responsible for triggering the investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. On July 21, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Justice Department released the warrant application used to obtain a wiretap on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page starting in October 2016, a month after he parted ways with Trump’s team. Intelligence officials feared Page was a potential Russian agent, or the target of Moscow's recruiting efforts. On Twitter, Trump claimed the surveillance application proves the Steele dossier launched the Russia probe. ""So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!"" Trump tweeted July 23.  So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt! Put simply, Trump is wrong about the triggering event. The Steele dossier did not launch the FBI’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The dossier was used, to some extent, to persuade a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court to authorize surveillance of Page. But it was the actions of another Trump campaign adviser — George Papadopoulos — that actually started the investigation. The federal government started looking into Russian election involvement in July 2016 based on information from Papadopoulos. This was confirmed by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee. ""The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok,"" the House Intelligence Committee’s GOP members wrote in a Feb. 2 memo. House Intelligence Committee Republicans confirmed in an April report it was Papadopoulos who set the FBI investigation in motion. So, what was the ""Papadopoulos information""? According to the New York Times, Papadopoulos told a high-ranking Australian diplomat at an upscale London bar in May 2016 that Moscow had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. Australian officials relayed this information to their American counterparts. Trump also confused the timeline of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s involvement. The Papadopoulos discussion of Clinton dirt that triggered the investigation took place in May 2016. Yet an entire year would pass before Mueller entered the picture. The Justice Department did not appoint Mueller to take over the FBI investigation until May 2017, roughly a week after Trump fired FBI director James Comey. Trump said the Steele dossier ""was responsible for starting"" Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Steele dossier did not trigger Mueller’s investigation. It was information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that set the probe in motion. Also, Mueller did not take up the investigation until roughly a year after the triggering event. We rate this False.

Gubernatorial candidate Kelda Roys falsely attacks Scott Walker for loss in manufacturing jobs
","Democratic gubernatorial candidates have been taking shots at Republican Gov. Scott Walker since the race began. Kelda Roys, a former state representative from Madison and one of eight Democratic contenders, has been sharp with criticism as it relates to jobs and the economy. At a May 15, 2018 meet-and-greet in downtown Madison, she told those in attendance: ""Just last year alone, we lost 4,000 manufacturing jobs."" That echoed a claim from a series of tweets on April 18, 2018. In one tweet, Roys wrote: ""Households in Wisconsin have paid over $500 for one of Walker’s corporate tax giveaways. Much of the giveaway went to just a handful of the richest Wisconsinites and it didn’t stop our state from losing almost 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017."" Manufacturing jobs are critical to Wisconsin’s economy. According to the most recent annual data from December 2017, the state ranks 9th in the nation in total manufacturing jobs -- and those jobs are responsible for 16 percent of total employment in the state. So, did Wisconsin really lose 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017? Campaign admits error  When we contacted the Roys campaign to ask for backup to the claim, communications director Brian Evans basically said, ""Oops."" ""The tweet should have said 2016 instead of 2017, and we fully admit that this was an error on our part,"" Evans said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics and its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Wisconsin lost 3,726 manufacturing jobs between December 2015 and December 2016. So, if Roys had actually focused on 2016 instead of 2017 her claim would be on target. Even then, that gives a narrow picture of what has happened with manufacturing jobs under Walker. Other years From December 2016 to December 2017, the most recent full year available, Wisconsin gained 8,032 manufacturing jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. This was a 1.7 percent increase in manufacturing jobs, bringing the statewide total to 469,453. In 2017, Wisconsin ranked 7th among states with the highest percentage of growth in manufacturing jobs. While we have the charts out, how has Walker done since taking office? In December 2010, the month before Walker took office, there were 434,723 manufacturing jobs. In December 2017, the most recent full-year available, there were 469,453. That’s a 34,730 -- or 8 percent -- increase. Our rating On Twitter and on the campaign trail, Roys has said Wisconsin lost nearly 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017. Roys has her years mixed up -- and her campaign admits it. While Roys would have been right for 2016, growth in 2017 was roughly double the loss in 2016. Compared to the start of Walker’s term, there has been an 8 percent increase in manufacturing employment. We rate her claim False. ",/factchecks/2018/jul/23/kelda-helen-roys/gubernatorial-candidate-kelda-roys-falsely-attacks/

Texas Republicans say poll shows Ted Cruz leading Beto O'Rourke by just 2 percentage points
","A recent Republican pitch opened: ""The Democrats are unhinged."" We can't fact-check that opinion. But the July 2018 email blast soliciting donations to the Republican Party of Texas also quoted the party’s Stephen Wong saying that a new poll shows the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee, U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, running very close behind Republican Sen. Ted Cruz -- the Houston lawyer who won the seat in 2012 by nearly 16 percentage points. Wong wrote: ""You’ve probably seen how"" ecstatic ""the far-left has been the last 24 hours. First there was a poll showing Francis ‘Beto’ O’Rourke within 2pts(!) of Senator Cruz."" Then, Wong said, O’Rourke reported raising more money than Cruz in the year’s second quarter. From April through June 2018, O’Rourke’s campaign again outraised Cruz’s effort. And did a recent poll show O’Rourke closely trailing Cruz? Party notes poll touted by liberal blogger To our inquiry, Kyle Whatley, the party’s executive director, pointed out a July 10, 2018, post on the Politicus website quoting Markos Moulitsas, founder of the liberal Daily Kos blog, saying in a tweet that data collected by Civiqs, a division of the Moulitsas-founded Kos Media, shows that O’Rourke ""now trails Ted Cruz by only 2"" percentage points, ""48-46."" When Civiqs launched an online ""dashboard"" in March 2018, spotlighting its polls such as one gauging President Donald Trump’s job approval, Moulitsas wrote: ""Daily Kos is a partisan outfit. Civiqs has its own mission, and that is to represent the state of public opinion accurately."" In July 2018, Moulitsas showcased the Texas poll’s Cruz-O’Rourke results in another tweet:  SOURCE: Tweet by Markos Moulitsas, July 9, 2018 The illustration says registered voters responded to this question: ""If the election for U.S. senator from Texas were held today, and the choices were Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke who would you vote for?"" In reply, 48 percent said Cruz, 46 percent replied O’Rourke and the remaining 6 percent split between supporting someone else or being unsure, the illustration says. According to the illustration, the result was based on 12,379 responses gathered from Feb. 16, 2017-July 4, 2018--or more than 17 months. Poll confirmed by firm To our inquiry, the director of Civiqs, Drew Linzer, told us the poll showing O’Rourke just behind Cruz, available to Civiqs subscribers, was accurately portrayed by Moulitsas. By email, Linzer further said the poll, not commissioned or sponsored by a client, relied on responses since February 2017 from respondents engaged over the web as volunteers for Civiqs survey panels who self-identified as Texas residents and registered voters. Civiqs says in the methodology section of its website that it maintains a growing ""nationally representative opt-in online survey panel, or list of Americans who have agreed to take polls at civiqs.com. Panelists reside in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and match the contours of the United States along key geographic, demographic and ideological lines,"" Civiqs says. We asked Linzer, a former political scientist at Emory University, to talk about relying on responses collected over more than 17 months. ""The lengthy timeframe,"" Linzer replied, ""enables Civiqs to perform long-term daily tracking in a sustainable, methodologically rigorous manner."" Civiqs, he said, applies ""specialized trendline fitting statistical models"" to ensure the results match current public opinion. Linzer said by phone that for the Texas poll, Civiqs emailed 40 to 50 respondents a day, asking each one about their Texas residence and registered voter status and stance on the Senate candidates, with those results over time feeding the trend line. As of July 4, 2018, the latest date shown on the trend line posted by Moulitsas, ""the most recent day’s worth of data has the greatest impact on the result,"" Linzer said, though responses from previous days mattered a lot too, he said. Linzer said responses gathered in 2017 also contributed to the result, but only ""infinitesimally so."" ""It’s complicated. It is a little different from what a traditional pollster does"" in reaching one set of respondents over a few consecutive days, Linzer said. Broadly, Linzer said, ""I want to report what our data indicates, where public opinion is today. I also want to calculate where public opinion has been on every day leading up to today. In order to do that, I take all the data we’ve collected and put it into our statistical model,"" generating trend lines. Cruz pollster raises flags We also reached out to the Senate campaigns about the poll claim. O’Rourke’s camp didn’t offer a comment. But Chris Wilson, who conducts polls for Cruz’s campaign, drew on a Moulitsas-tweeted illustration breaking out the demographics of the results to suggest by phone that Republican respondents to the poll outnumbered Democrats by insufficient percentage points. Linzer separately told us the results imply that 31 percent of respondents identified as Democrats, 36 percent as Republicans and 33 percent as independents. Wilson said that considering Republicans’ prevalence in statewide races since 1994, any poll projecting fall results should query more Republicans--perhaps making the sample 40 percent Republican, 30 percent Democratic and 20 percent independent. Linzer said that the poll reflected the partisan mix of Texas registered voters. Wilson also questioned the idea that 3 percent of respondents remained undecided some four months before Election Day. ""There’s no race in America right now that only has 3 percent undecided,"" Wilson said. A Texas pollster's analysis We also asked Jeff Smith of Austin, a longtime Democratic pollster, to review the poll. Smith commented by email that the trend lines attributed to the poll ""make sense; they may be on top of a trend. They have a good track record."" Smith offered a disclaimer, though, about depending on panels of people opting in to participate online. ""Just as traditional telephone polling excluded those without phones, online surveys exclude those who don’t opt in,"" Smith wrote. ""I would expect that group (the opt-in’s) to be somewhat more attuned to politics than the electorate at large. Second (again, as with traditional polling), the target demographic profile incorporates assumptions about turnout. If they use the all registered voters profile, for example, they are assuming that Hispanics will turn out in the same proportions as others. ""That said,"" Smith closed, ""I don’t see any reason not to use them as a credible polling source."" Close match-up? Other Texas polls haven’t suggested a 2-point margin in the race though a couple taken since April 2018 came close. Daron Shaw, a University of Texas government professor and pollster, responded to us by email that the Civiqs poll aside, ""one could claim that the margin of error surrounding some of the public polls is consistent with the spirit (if not the precise number) of the email"" blast from the Texas GOP. Texas polls summarized on the Real Clear Politics website as of mid-July 2018 showed Cruz leading by three to 11 percentage points. The most recent three polls, all taken since June 2018, showed Cruz ahead by five, nine and 10 percentage points.  SOURCE: Web post, ""Texas Senate - Cruz vs. O'Rourke,"" Real Clear Politics, undated (accessed July 16, 2018) Shaw led us to notice that the April 2018 Quinnipiac survey showing Cruz ahead by 3 percentage points had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. ""So the result is really as follows: if we did 100 polls, 95 of them would show Cruz between 43 and 51, and O’Rourke between 40 and 48. The margin thus varies between Cruz +11 and O’Rourke +5,"" Shaw wrote. Similarly, Shaw said, the margin of error in the latest UT/Texas Tribune poll, taken in June 2018, can be read as placing Cruz up between 2 and 8 points. Still, Shaw wrote, six public polls taken since spring 2018 show Cruz prevailing by as many as 11 points. ""The chances of this happening if O’Rourke is actually winning is statistically infinitesimal,"" Shaw said. Another note: After the April 2018 Quinnipiac results came out, Joshua Blank and Jim Henson of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin suggested that historically, spring polls showing closer-than-expected races haven’t played out in November balloting. The pair compiled statewide polling results from April through July for Texas elections going back to 2010 for president, senator and governor. The two concluded that Cruz’s lead in April 2018 wasn’t as stout as one might expert given that Republicans in the past races were leading polls at comparable points by 9 percentage points on average. Still, they wrote, ""there's little evidence from the eventual election results that Cruz's lead isn't likely to grow."" ""The obvious caveat,"" Blank and Henson said, ""is that historical data is good for predicting outcomes where the present can be reasonably said to resemble the past."" Our ruling The Republican Party of Texas said a recent poll showed O’Rourke within 2 percentage points of Cruz. Through July 4, 2018, Civiqs says, its polling of Texas registered voters placed Cruz with 48 percent support and O’Rourke with 46 percent. It’s worth clarifying, though, that the results were rooted in respondents who opted in to be surveyed online by a company whose owners include a liberal political blogger.

We found no credible evidence to back up the headline. Your News Wire largely drew from a story by The True Pundit about Page’s closed-door House hearings on July 13 and July 16. The True Pundit said the information came from ""federal sources"" and ""well-placed FBI sources."" The True Pundit said that Page alleged that the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ""assets"" had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 ""missing"" emails. In 2016, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that the Russian government directed the recent theft of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. Despite that, Trump has questioned whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election. In 2016, Trump said it could have been China who hacked emails of Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Or someone ""sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds."" Page, a former FBI lawyer, has drawn attention from lawmakers because she and former FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged anti-Trump text messages while having an affair. Both worked on the FBI's Russia investigation and for a brief time on Special Counsel Robert’s Mueller’s investigation. Strozak testified publicly for 10 hours on July 12. We don’t have access to Page’s testimony because it occurred in a closed-door session. News reports said Page didn’t answer reporters’ questions before or after her testimony and lawmakers revealed little. However, of the information that has emerged about her testimony and reported by the mainstream media, none of it indicated she blamed the Chinese. Conservative news outlets included Breitbart and The Daily Caller said that lawmakers indicated Page contradicted Strzok about their texts and focused on the issue of political bias at the FBI, but those articles didn’t indicate that she blamed China, either. The Washington Post reported that Republican lawyers said that Page provided new information that further convinced them that political bias marred the investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails and the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia.
