George Lavender says an English company supplies Texas public-school assessment exams
","
During a legislative session marked by backlash against state-mandated testing, Rep. George Lavender offered an amendment to drop some Texas exams for an Iowa alternative. 
""I think we need to get at least an American company doing our tests instead of an English company,"" the Texarkana Republican said April 29, 2013, during debate on a House bill to cut and shorten some tests given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness. 
The bill won House approval, but without Lavender’s amendment to substitute the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills for certain STAAR exams, which was tabled. 
Does an English company provide Texas’ tests? 
Since September 1981, according to histories of Texas testing on the education agency’s website, the state’s primary contractor for statewide assessment programs has been the same: the company known today as NCS Pearson, Inc. 
By phone, Lavender told us, ""I know they have a lot of employees in Texas and I know they have a lot of employees worldwide, but the fact is that they’re a British company, and I would much prefer a U.S.-based company to be doing our testing."" The Texas program isn’t functioning as intended, he said, and there are other tests that ""have been proven to work across the country."" 
Susan Aspey, vice president of public affairs for New York-based Pearson North America, told us by phone, ""Pearson PLC is the parent company. It is based in the U.K. Pearson’s North American education businesses are based here in North America. Pearson’s testing businesses are based in Minnesota. In the state of Texas, Pearson employs 1,800 people."" 
Specifically, NCS Pearson is incorporated in Minnesota, she said. Corporate websites and profiles from Bloomberg Businessweek show the company is headquartered in Bloomington, Minn., and was founded in 1962 as National Computer Systems to score psychology diagnostic tests; the name changed to NCS Pearson in 2000 when it was bought by U.K. company Pearson PLC. 
Pearson PLC today is a global education services company headquartered at 80 Strand in London that also owns book publisher Penguin and the Financial Times news organization. It listed 42,980 employees in its 2012 annual report, including 18,552 in ""North American education"" and 16,751 in ""international education."" Aspey said, ""Pearson employs three times as many people in the U.S. as it does in the U.K."" 
Under NCS Pearson’s 2010-2015 contract with Texas’ schools agency, the company will be paid $468 million for STAAR and Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) tests and services. Two of the largest subcontracted amounts were listed as going to online learning company Desire2Learn, based in Canada, and Chicago-based communications firm RR Donnelley. 
And who writes the STAAR tests? Three subcontractors plus Texas educators, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email. Items for the test are drafted, she said, by the San Antonio-based K-12 Education Division of a global, private organization, the Princeton, N.J.-headquartered nonprofit Educational Testing Service, and two companies named Lone Star and Tri-Lin Integrated Services. Then they’re edited by the agency and committees of Texas educators, Ratcliffe said. 
Our ruling 
Lavender said the state’s mandatory tests come from an English company. 
Pearson, the parent company of Texas’ testing contractor, is English. Then again, NCS Pearson is incorporated in Minnesota and was American-owned until 2000. Also, test items are generated by subcontractors including the San Antonio division of a global organization headquartered in New Jersey.

"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says Democrats using Obama and Baldwin campaign offices to plan against him
","
With his next election approaching, Gov. Scott Walker is working to build his campaign war chest. 
In a March 27, 2013 fund-raising letter to supporters, Walker said the 2014 campaign will be even more difficult than his 2010 race or the 2012 recall election, declaring of Democrats:  ""We’re bracing for perhaps their biggest effort in 2014."" 
He said state Democrats are looking to capitalize on the November 2012 victories by President Obama and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and added this head-scratcher: 
""Obama for President and Baldwin for Senate have kept their campaign offices up and running in Fox Valley, Eau Claire and La Crosse with their staffs preparing for the next battle."" 
But Obama has run in his last election and Baldwin is a just few months into a six-year term. 
Are their campaign offices really still fired up and now focused on Walker? 
As evidence, Walker campaign spokeswoman Nicole Tieman offered links to three news stories ""about the ongoing presence of OFA and Wisconsin Democrats in Wisconsin."" 
Tieman highlighted an article from Politicothat said: ""OFA now has paid state coordinators in place in Georgia, Ohio, Missouri, Maryland, Colorado, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan, Iowa, California, Texas and Arizona."" 
But that story was from April 24, 2013 -- nearly a month after Walker’s letter went out. 
And the group Tieman referred to is not Organizing for America, the president’s campaign operation. It is a newly-formed formed non-profit called Organizing for Action, an outgrowth of the campaign organization. 
As for the offices and employees the governor mentioned, we searched the web and got on the phone to see if we could find some lonely campaign workers. 
We started with the president’s campaign. 
We found a list from last fall of about 60 Obama campaign offices around Wisconsin, including the ""Milwaukee Region HQ"" listed at 744 N. 4th St., an office building in downtown Milwaukee.  When we visited that one, just down the street from us, there was no sign of an Obama office on the building directory. A lobby guard said that during the campaign people occasionally stopped in and asked about the office, but there was not one there. 
We called each of the 59 Obama offices that had a phone number listed -- including those in the areas named by Walker: the Fox Valley, Eau Claire and La Crosse. Virtually all of the numbers have been disconnected and not one was for the Obama campaign. 
The Obama campaign’s successor group, Organizing for Action, doesn’t yet have a presence in Wisconsin, said the new state coordinator Justin Koehler. 
""I’m moving out there tomorrow, actually,"" he said in an April 30, 2013 telephone interview. ""We do not yet have an office for Organizing for Action. It’s me."" 
The New York Times said Obama operators have converted their massive campaign operation into a lobbying effort, and hope to raise $50 million. 
""The goal is to harness those resources in support of Mr. Obama’s second-term policy priorities, including efforts to curb gun violence and climate change and overhaul immigration procedures,"" the Times said in a Feb. 22, 2013 story about the group. ""Those efforts began Friday, when thousands of Obama supporters were deployed through more than 80 Congressional districts around the country to rally outside lawmakers’ offices, hold vigils and bombard Congress with e-mails and phone calls urging members to support stricter background checks for gun buyers."" 
The tax exempt group will also maintain the connection between the president and his most ardent supporters. 
So what about the Baldwin campaign? 
We found a frequently updated Baldwin campaign web page. But didn’t locate an office in any of the three cities mentioned, though there is one in Madison. 
And after we began our reporting, Tieman of the Walker campaign sent a followup email noting Baldwin’s Madison campaign office was seeking a summer intern. But that posting was made after Walker’s letter went out and is not in the areas cited. 
We asked the state Democratic Party if they knew of any offices for Obama or Baldwin. 
""Obama for President and Senator Baldwin have closed their field offices,"" said Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, via email. 
""But Scott Walker is correct that Democrats are preparing for the next battle -- county Democratic party offices remain open and staffed all over the state, and the state party has organizers working in La Crosse, Eau Claire and the Fox Valley as part of our 72 County Strategy."" 
To be sure, it is not unusual for campaign offices and web sites to remain open between elections -- Walker himself has done it. And political staffers routinely move from job to job between campaigns, political parties, office staffs and interest groups during the ""off season.""   
So, there would be little surprise if, say, a Baldwin staffer in Green Bay was now working for the state Dems -- perhaps even out of the same office space. 
But even that is not what Walker claimed. 
Our rating 
In a fund-raising letter, Walker told supporters that he needs to build his campaign war chest because Baldwin and Obama have kept their campaign offices open in three Wisconsin locations, and have staff ""preparing for the next battle."" 
There is no evidence of Obama or Baldwin offices. We found only a single employee of the successor to Obama’s campaign group, who didn’t start working until long after the statement was made. The Baldwin campaign has a single office in Madison -- not in the areas Walker mentioned in his claim. 
And the limited evidence the Walker campaign provided to in support of the claim all came after the statement was made.

"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Johnny Isakson']","
Isakson close to the mark on ports claim
","
The deepening of the Georgia ports is one of the few issues in this state that has the support of the state’s top elected officials regardless of party affiliation. 
Shortly before President Barack Obama unveiled his proposed budget, U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., made his case for why more federal funding is necessary for the project. 
""There is nothing bigger right now for the entire state,"" Isakson said in a meeting with the Albany Herald’s editorial board, referring to the project. ""The port provides more than 297,000 jobs directly to the state of Georgia."" 
Isakson’s comments were picked up by several news sites across Georgia. We were curious if Isakson’s numbers were accurate and if there was any context missing. 
In 2015, a project to expand the Panama Canal is scheduled to be completed, allowing larger cargo ships to sail to America’s Eastern Seaboard. Political and business leaders in Georgia believe the deepening of the Savannah River will allow some of those larger ships to dock at its ports, thereby creating more jobs and boosting the Peach State’s economy. 
As an example of the significance of this issue, Georgia’s most prominent Republican and Democrat, Gov. Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, have worked together extensively to encourage Obama administration officials to provide more money for the ports. 
A week after Isakson’s comments, the White House released the president’s proposed budget. To the dismay of many Georgians involved in the Savannah project, the budget set aside $1.28 million to deepen the Savannah River, a drop in the bucket for the $652 million project. Georgia taxpayers already have put up $231 million, and the state will need to come up with at least $30 million under the federal-state formula to deepen the river. 
Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson forwarded us a report that referred to ports -- plural -- to back up his claim. The report was released in April 2010 and prepared by Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth. The report says there were 295,422 full- and part-time jobs in Georgia supported by the ports during the state of Georgia’s fiscal year 2009, which began July 1, 2008, and ended June 30, 2009. 
We had two specific issues. The first was that Isakson did not mention other ports in his comments. While the overwhelming bulk of the jobs are attributable to the Savannah port, a number of the jobs came from the Port of Brunswick and other private ports scattered along the Georgia coastline, according to Humphreys’ report. Culbertson agreed that the report included other ports. 
Humphreys said the senator may have generalized by referring solely to the Savannah port, since it is Georgia’s largest port. 
""It’s quite understandable,"" Humphreys said. 
The Savannah port generates an estimated $447 million in annual federal, state and local taxes, according to Humphreys’ most recent research. The Brunswick port, which is about an hour drive from Savannah, brings in about $23 million a year in tax revenue. 
Our other issue concerned whether all of these jobs could be directly attributed to the ports, as Isakson seems to have implied in his remarks to the newspaper’s editorial board. 
There is a more recent report on the ports, released in April 2012, as opposed to the report Isakson cited from 2010. In the newest report, Humphreys estimated there were about 352,000 full-time and part-time jobs resulting from the ports. Humphreys said 154,000 jobs could be attributed to companies that use the ports, and the remaining 198,000 jobs were indirectly a result from the ports. 
Humphreys said it’s valid for Isakson to include all of these jobs. 
Those indirect jobs, Humphreys said, range from companies that work with businesses at the port, to the diners that feed port workers. Humphreys also used the word ""port-dependent jobs"" to describe ""indirect jobs."" 
""It’s semantics,"" Humphreys said of the difference between ""port-dependent jobs"" and ""indirect jobs."" 
These jobs are across the state, the economist said. Although Chatham County is home to the Savannah port, Humphreys’ study concludes Fulton County is the recipient of more jobs from the ports. 
Humphreys didn’t quibble much with the senator’s argument. 
""Unfortunately, his numbers are a little out of date,"" Humphreys said. ""In my opinion, he’s basically telling the truth."" 
To sum up, Isakson said the Savannah port provides about 297,000 direct jobs to Georgia’s economy. The senator would have been more accurate if he said ""port industry"" or simply said ""ports."" Isakson underestimated the jobs impact in his argument. His estimate was based on a 2010 report, although the most recent report estimated the total at 352,000 jobs. 
Isakson’s remarks were not precise, but they are largely on target. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/06/johnny-isakson/isakson-ports-claim-target/
"['State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Ken Cuccinelli']","
Cuccinelli says Virginia legislature has never failed to pass a budget
","
Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli recently cited ""a real world example"" of how Virginia’s General Assembly functions better than Congress. 
State lawmakers always pass a budget while the U.S. Senate, until recently, went four years without approving a spending plan, he said during an April 18 speech at the Shad Planking in Waverly. 
""We have never gone a year in Virginia -- ever -- without passing a budget -- ever,"" Cuccinelli, the GOP nominee for governor, said. ""Whatever we all may have disagreed on or agreed on, we passed that budget."" 
We’ve never gone a year in Virginia without passing a budget -- ever? 
Virginia’s record may be good, but it’s not perfect. 
The Old Dominion works on a two-year budget cycle. During even years, a biennial spending plan is adopted. During odd years, the plan is adjusted to address changing needs and to conform to the ebb or flow of revenues because state law requires a balanced budget. 
In 2000, the General Assembly passed a two-year plan that complied with then-Gov. Jim Gilmore’s signature campaign pledge to phase out the personal property tax on cars. That year, 45 percent of the levy was eliminated. 
But in 2001, the nation was entering recession and the General Assembly split over Gilmore’s insistence that they proceed with the next step of phase out, which would have eliminated 70 percent of the car tax. The House approved the plan; the Senate refused, arguing that the state could not afford the step -- estimated to cost close to $400 million. 
The General Assembly adjourned late that February without a budget agreement. It held a special session in May and again did not come to accord. The impasse marked ""the first time, the legislature couldn’t agree on a budget,"" according to a May 13, 2001 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 
The stalemate played into Gilmore’s hands. Under state law, he was allowed to cut spending to keep the two-year budget plan balanced, but he could not appropriate money for new programs. Gilmore, a Republican, sliced $421 million in spending and kept his car tax cut on schedule. 
Later that year, Democrat Mark Warner was elected governor with a stump speech that criticized the political climate in Richmond for being no better than Washington’s. And in 2002, the General Assembly capped car tax relief at $950 million a year, which was the cost of the 70 percent Gilmore phased out. 
Now, let’s return to Cuccinelli at the Shad Planking. After the speech, Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist Jeff Schapiro reminded him of the 2001 stalemate. ""That was before I was in the (Virginia) senate,"" said Cuccinelli, who was elected to the General Assembly later that year. 
Cuccinelli’s campaign declined our invitation for additional comments. 
Our ruling 
""We have never gone a year in Virginia -- ever -- without passing a budget -- ever,"" Cuccinelli said. 
Never, that is, except in 2001.

Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern ties right-to-work states with unemployment
","
When a couple of Statehouse Republicans prepared to introduce bills to make Ohio a ""right to work"" state last week, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern lost no time going on the attack. 
Hours after Reps. Ron Maag and Kristina Roegner sent letters to House colleagues seeking co-sponsorship for what they called ""Workplace Freedom"" legislation, Redfern sent out a fundraising email saying such laws were ""controversial, confusing, and wrong for workers and the middle class."" 
""Six out of 10 of the highest unemployment rates are also in so-called right to work states,"" he wrote. 
PolitiFact Ohio thought we'd check. 
According to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, 24 states have passed some form of right-to-work law. (The exact provisions can vary; generally they ban public and private employers from forcing workers to join or pay dues to unions or other employee organizations.) They are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. 
For unemployment data, we went to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation's official source for unemployment statistics. Its most recent numbers are the preliminary figures for March 2013. 
The states with the highest unemployment rates, from the bottom up, were Nevada, Illinois, Mississippi, California, North Carolina, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Indiana, Michigan and (tied) South Carolina and Georgia. 
Six of the 10 are right-to-work states -- or, including the tie, 7 of the 11. 
But there is a question about causation vs. correlation -- whether right-to-work status produces lower or higher unemployment. 
Two of the right-to-work states are relatively recent. Indiana (where similar legislation was passed in 1957 and repealed in 1965) in February 2012 became the first state to adopt right-to-work status since Oklahoma a decade earlier. Michigan followed in December 2012. 
Of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates, eight were right-to-work states. Of those, as we noted in an earlier check, seven states -- North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Utah, Wyoming and Oklahoma -- are from the Great Plains and the Mountain West, which in general were less hard-hit during the recession. 
So Redfern's statement about 6 of the 10 states with the highest unemployment rates is technically accurate. But it is misleading because it implies a cause-and-effect relationship that is bogus.

Sanfelippo says bill puts Milwaukee County Board spending in line with other major counties
","
The former member of the Milwaukee County Board pushing state legislation to force his ex-colleagues into part-time status frequently compares the board’s $6.5 million budget -- unfavorably -- to those in four other Wisconsin counties. 
""You may hear supervisors tell you they need all that money because Milwaukee County is a special case as the largest county in the state,"" said state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo (R-West Allis) when he appeared April 10, 2013 before an Assembly committee. ""Size alone ought not be the sole factor justifying the expense of a government unit."" 
Sanfelippo laid out his math: 
""Consider, for example, that while the county board in Milwaukee has 38 staff members and spends $6.5 million annually on itself to serve 947,000 residents, county boards in Dane, Waukesha, Racine and Kenosha counties operate with just 10 total staff members and spend a combined $2.8 million on themselves."" 
His final pitch: ""To most reasonable observers, there is something amiss that demands repair. (The state bill) ends the board’s uninhibited spending by capping their budget and bringing it in line with other county boards around the state."" 
The budget numbers on those four counties are easy to find, but we have not seen an analysis of his claim that the bill would bring Milwaukee County ""in line with other county boards around the state."" 
With the issue headed for a vote in May, this is a good time to check this. 
The claim we are looking at is about more than the numbers. It asserts the county is currently out of line and the bill would change that. 
When asked for backup, Sanfelippo said he was measuring the current per-capita spending of the Milwaukee board against that of boards in the next two most-populous counties (Dane and Waukesha) and two relatively urban counties nearby (Racine and Kenosha). 
We ran those numbers and found Milwaukee County’s board has more than double the per-capita price tag of Waukesha, more than triple that of Dane and Racine and more than four times that of Kenosha. The state bill would reduce Milwaukee County’s board budget by about 67 percent, putting its per-capita price tag between Waukesha and the other three counties cited by Sanfelippo. 
So Sanfelippo’s sample of four yields numbers that support his claim -- at least as far as they go. 
But his claim focused on counties ""around the state."" He used population as his standard, so what about other large counties? 
Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago Counties all have higher populations than Kenosha, the smallest on Sanfelippo’s list. If the bill became law, Outagamie’s per-capita board spending would be about 50 percent higher than Milwaukee County’s, we found. Brown and Winnebago would be very near Milwaukee County’s number. 
Washington County -- 10th-largest behind neighboring Milwaukee -- would be about 20 percent higher than Milwaukee, as would Marathon County. Rock County, by contrast, would still be spending at less than half Milwaukee County’s number per capita. 
It’s worth noting, too, that Waukesha County from Sanfelippo’s list would be spending about 30 percent more per capita than Milwaukee County on its county board. 
  
The bottom line 
By 2016, when all of the budget limits would finally kick in, Milwaukee County would fall roughly in the middle, and almost exactly at the average of the next 10 highest counties. 
In fact, Milwaukee County’s per-capita figure would almost exactly equal the average of the next 10 counties by population. That’s if spending holds steady in those counties until 2016. 
By a different measure -- County Board spending as a share of total county spending -- the story is a bit different. 
Milwaukee County is the highest by that measure compared to the next 10 most-populous counties, but Waukesha County is a very close second. Under the bill, Milwaukee County would fall near the bottom of the pack compared to the 10 next-populous counties. 
That’s ""in line"" and then some. 
All these comparisons are rough, in part because we don’t know what the comparison counties will be spending on their boards come 2016. 
Even Sanfelippo concedes that finding an appropriate comparison to Milwaukee County is very difficult. 
And we heard another concern from Craig S. Maher, a former University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh professor who served on a panel studying Milwaukee County finances. Maher told us that while Milwaukee County’s board spending was higher, the differences among counties are ""on the margins."" 
Some numbers back that up. 
For example, Milwaukee County’s current board expenditures represent only about 0.49 percent of the county’s total spending. In Waukesha County -- which is untouched by the state bill -- the figure is very close to that, 0.43, as we noted above. Other big counties range from 0.1 to 0.31. 
""This isn’t a fiscal debate,"" Maher said. ""It’s a power debate."" 
Maher, now at Northern Illinois University, was referring to the bill’s underlying goal of restoring or increasing the power of the county executive at the expense of the county board in Milwaukee County. 
Our rating 
Sanfelippo said his bill checks the spending habits of the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors by ""bringing it in line with other county boards around the state."" 
Milwaukee County’s board spending is significantly higher than most other large counties now, and it would fall to middle of the pack or lower under the bill depending on the measure. 
His comparison ultimately may shed limited light, but Sanfelippo’s claim is on target, with the cautions we noted.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says spending in proposed FY14 budget still below Jon Corzine's, Barbara Buono's FY08 budget
","
If New Jersey is going to see any fiscal progress, the state has to reduce spending, according to Gov. Chris Christie. 
And those steps have already yielded significant results, he claimed recently. 
""We’re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008,"" Christie said during his monthly ""Ask the Governor"" program that aired April 22 on NJ101.5 FM. 
Christie’s claim is a variation on one he made in January, also during that month’s ""Ask the Governor"" program, when he tied the 2008 budget to Democratic predecessor Jon Corzine. Now he’s also tying it to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie in November’s gubernatorial election. 
As we determined in a February fact-check, state spending is down since 2008, but Christie ignores that spending has still increased with each new state budget since he took office on Jan. 19, 2010. 
Let’s review the numbers. 
It’s worth noting that Christie first made the comparison of his administration spending less than Corzine’s between the fiscal 2008 and 2013 budgets, so we’ll look at those two years first. The spending difference was $1.5 billion. 
For fiscal year 2008, spending was $33.6 billion, according to Treasury department reports. 
Christie’s budget for fiscal year 2013 contained $32.1 billion in spending. 
So Christie is correct that spending on his watch is below what Corzine spent, but the governor’s spending isn’t so innocent, either. 
Christie’s first budget for fiscal year 2011 was $28.4 billion. For fiscal year 2012, the governor approved a $29.6 billion budget. 
Christie’s fiscal year 2013 budget was $32.1 billion and his proposed fiscal year 2014 budget is $32.9 billion. So, Christie’s budgets are lower than Corzine’s, but they’re still growing every year. We should note that the fiscal year 2014 blueprint is still subject to hearings and possible cuts. Christie has until July 1 to sign it. 
In PolitiFact New Jersey’s February fact-check, Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn said the increased spending since fiscal year 2011 was due in part to Christie’s policies boosting the state’s economy, leading to higher tax revenues. At that time Quinn noted that two of the major areas of higher spending had been in education and pension contributions. 
There’s also another reason why Christie’s budgets have spent less than the ones crafted on Corzine’s watch: Corzine used more money for property tax relief than Christie. Also, Christie imposed a 2-percent cap on spending that didn’t exist when Corzine ran the state. 
Additionally, although Christie ties Buono in to the fiscal year 2008 budget, she did not chair the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in 2007, the year that Corzine’s spending plan was created. Buono chaired that panel in 2008 and 2009, when the fiscal years 2009 and 2010 budgets were created. 
Said David Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, in an e-mail: ""The Governor would rather rewrite history than own up to cutting property tax relief, slashing education aid and reducing the Earned Income Tax Credit."" 
Our ruling 
In responding to a caller during New Jersey 101.5’s ""Ask the Governor"" program last month, Christie claimed, ""We’re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008."" 
Christie is correct that the proposed fiscal year 2014 budget of $32.9 billion is less than the level of state spending under Corzine in fiscal year 2008, at $33.6 billion. But Christie’s claim leaves out some details. 
First, state spending has increased every year that Christie has been governor. Second, he ties the higher-spending budgets in part to Buono, but she did not chair the Senate budget panel that crafted the fiscal year 2008 budget. 
Overall, Christie’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That makes it Mostly True.

Gun rights advocate says proposed Rhode Island laws will outlaw virtually every firearm and make it nearly impossible to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon
","
The Newtown, Conn., school shooting sparked new waves of proposals to restrict gun ownership and use, including a package of bills in the Rhode Island General Assembly supported by Governor Chafee, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, legislative leaders and many police chiefs. 
That, in turn, has sparked opposition from gun rights advocates. One of them, Ed Doyle, administrator of the Rhode Island chapter of Gun Rights Across America, issued a news release and posted a notice on Facebook announcing ""an emergency call to stand up for your rights"" at a May 1 House hearing on the Rhode Island gun legislation. 
""The wording in these bills will outlaw practically every firearm, make you pay $100 per firearm, put you into a police database, make a CCL [permit to carry a concealed weapon] nearly impossible to get, and eliminate the 2nd Amendment as we know it!!!"" the advertisement warned. 
Several hundred supporters and opponents of the legislation showed up for the hearing, which lasted seven hours. No votes have been scheduled on the bills. 
We’ll look at the elements of Doyle’s claim one at a time, leaving the Second Amendment part until last. 
$100 PER FIREARM: This is true. House Bill 5573 would require everyone who carries or possesses a firearm to register it at a cost of $100 per firearm. 
POLICE DATABASE: This is also true. Under the same bill, registration would be done by the licensing authority of each city or town. That would probably be the police department because the bill says registration information ""shall not be disclosed to any individual or entity … [except] to law enforcement organizations and personnel when that information is sought for legitimate law enforcement purposes."" 
MAKE CONCEALED WEAPON PERMITS  ""NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE"" TO GET: Under existing law, owners can get such permits from the local licensing authority -- usually the police chief -- or the attorney general's office. The law says local authorities ""shall"" grant the license. 
One bill in the legislative package, S 0865, proposes taking cities and towns out of that loop and giving the authority exclusively to the attorney general's office. 
The catch here, according to Doyle, is that the proposed law says the attorney general ""may"" issue a permit but doesn’t require the attorney general to do so. 
Doyle said an anti-gun attorney general could halt the flow of permits. 
Gun advocates worry about this because when U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, was attorney general, some gun owners complained that the office was denying too many requests. In 1999, for example, 77 percent of the 216 renewal requests were approved and 23 percent denied. 
Even today, there are complaints that applicants are routinely denied and get their permits only on appeal. 
Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Kilmartin, the current attorney general, said that in 2011, 85 percent of the 370 new applications were approved. In 2012, the approval rate was 75 percent for the 275 new applications. Between Jan. 1 and April 23 of this year, 65 of the 115 new applications have been approved, 26 are pending and 24 have been denied. 
She reported that only 2 percent of renewal requests were denied in 2011 and 2012. 
Kempe said the office did not have any data readily available on how many people have been granted a permit after appealing an initial denial. 
The bottom line: the proposed law would not inherently make the permits ""nearly impossible to get."" It puts the authority in the hands of an office that is currently granting the vast majority of permits it receives. An attorney general with a tougher stance on guns might approve fewer, but, on the other hand, a pro-gun attorney general might authorize every request. 
We rate this part Doyle's statement False.   
OUTLAW ""PRACTICALLY EVERY FIREARM"": House Bill 5990 and a companion Senate bill, 0859, would make it illegal for anyone to purchase, possess, sell or manufacture a semiautomatic assault weapon after July 1. (Legislators have promised that existing owners would be grandfathered.) 
Most firearms today are semiautomatics, which means that they eject a spent round and feed the next one into the chamber whenever the trigger is pulled. With a semiautomatic, you have to pull and release the trigger for each shot. (A fully automatic weapon continues to fire as long as the trigger is pulled.) 
What makes a firearm an assault weapon? The legislation defines an assault rifle, for example, as a weapon that can accept detachable magazines and has at least two other characteristics, such as a folding stock or a pistol grip. 
When we contacted Doyle, he said the lengthy description makes just about everything an assault weapon. 
Two gun control groups disputed Doyle’s statement. 
Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, in Washington, D.C., said the language of the Rhode Island bill ""essentially mirrors the expired federal assault weapons ban which is widely acknowledged as having major loopholes that allowed the continued sale of assault weapons [including the Bushmaster used at Newtown]. The bill wouldn’t even ban all assault weapons, much less any sporting firearms."" 
And Laura Cutilletta, senior staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco, said in an e-mail that the Rhode Island proposal's language is ""considerably weaker than the current California assault weapon ban"" because it requires at least two features to make a firearm an assault weapon. In California, only one can be enough. 
""And even under the much stronger California assault weapon ban, over 800,000 guns were sold in California last year!"" she said. 
Finally, Doyle took us gun shopping online. We started browsing the rifle and shotgun section of Walmart.com. Of the first 32 rifles on the list, the proposed law would affect no more than seven. When we searched for shotguns, the first page of results had 29 actual shotguns; no more than three would be illegal under the proposed law. 
(We didn't do a count of handguns or pistols because most of the items that came up in the search were pellet guns. Our favorite: the Undead Apocalypse Crosman Airsoft Pistol with Compensator, which comes in Zombie Green.) 
When at least 80 percent of the weapons seen in a spot-check could still be purchased, it seems ridiculous to say the wording of the proposed legislation would outlaw practically every firearm. That's worthy of a Pants On Fire. 
Our ruling 
Firearms rights supporter Ed Doyle said the wording of the gun control measures being debated at the State House ""will outlaw practically every firearm, make you pay $100 per firearm, put you into a police database, [and make a permit to carry a concealed weapon] nearly impossible to get."" 
The database and registration fee claims are correct. 
None of the proposed bills would inherently make it ""nearly impossible"" to get a concealed weapon permit. 
And we found that the definition of ""assault weapons"" in the legislation would not ""outlaw practically every firearm."" Consumers would have plenty of rifles, shotguns and pistols to choose from. 
Finally, none of the Rhode Island bills would eliminate any part of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite Doyle’s triple-exclamation point assertion. 
Because of the mix of fact and fiction in his statement, we rate it Mostly False.

"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Metro']","
Did Metro flip-flop on whether it could use bond money for restoration?
","
The voters of Washington, Multnomah and Clackamas counties will decide May 21, 2013, whether to approve a 5-year operating levy for Metro, the regional government that oversees growth and also runs the Oregon Zoo. Measure 26-152 would raise approximately $10 million a year from an increase in property taxes, half of which would go toward restoration of natural areas.  
Metro officials say the measure is necessary because general obligation bond measures approved by voters in 1995 and in 2006 allowed the government to purchase land, but didn’t provide money to restore and maintain the new land.  
""Twice in two decades, Metro voters approved measures to acquire thousands of acres of natural areas throughout the tri-county region,"" reads the Voters’ Pamphlet summary of this spring’s Measure 26-152. ""Past measures could not include money for maintenance and restoration.""  
Which got PolitiFact Oregon thinking. We remembered how the 2006 measure was pitched to voters. The language of Measure 26-80, also in the Voters’ Pamphlet, was clear: ""This measure directs Metro to buy and restore natural areas for the protection of water quality and preservation of fish and wildlife habitat ...""  
Metro officials wrote both statements in the Voters’ Pamphlet. Voters overwhelmingly approved the $227 million bond measure in 2006, probably thinking that the money would go toward both purchase and actual restoration, because that’s what supporters said they’d do.  
Did Metro use the promise of restoration to sell the 2006 measure? Why is it now saying that the 2006 money couldn’t be used for restoration? Has Metro flip-flopped on what the 2006 bond could and could not do?  
We shot off an email to Metro spokesman Jim Middaugh and started digging. For people who don’t follow the scintillating world of public finance, just know that government can sell general obligation bonds -- and take on debt -- to pay for capital projects and improvements. Governments do it all the time.  
Governments do not, however, tend to incur long-term debt for operational expenses, such as routine maintenance or payroll. That’s poor fiscal policy, and that is the distinction Metro is making with the different measures.  
So the first question for us is: Can money from bonds be used for restoration, despite what Metro now says? This description of general obligation debt -- found on the state Treasury website -- indicates that the answer is yes.  
""Under ORS 287A.050 - 287A.145 general obligation debt can be incurred for capital construction and improvements having an expected useful life of more than one year. This does not include maintenance and repair (the need for which could be reasonably anticipated), supplies, and equipment that are not intrinsic to a structure.""  
PolitiFact Oregon can see how restoration of purchased property could count as an improvement lasting for more than year. And certainly, Metro officials saw it that way because they sold it that way.  
Still, Metro draws a distinction between restoration spending then and restoration spending now. Middaugh said that despite the state description, the agency has its own guidelines on how to spend bonded money.  
For example, Metro used bonded money for the initial ""stabilization"" part of restoration, defined as ""one-time activities performed during the first two to five years after"" land purchase. Mowing grass, killing weeds and removing trash is OK so long as the activities take place during this phase -- but afterward, those actions are considered maintenance.  
Why wasn’t this distinction called out in public materials? The description was too wonky, he said, so they went with the more conversational ""restoration"" and ""protection.""  
Half of the money from this operating levy would go toward operations and education, and the other half to continued restoration of natural areas. Out of curiosity, we asked if Metro had planned all along to come back to voters for more money. The answer was yes, and the proof is on page 9 of the resolution authorizing the 2006 measure, stating that Metro would only have enough money to manage new lands for a limited time. 
All we can say to these disclosures is that we wish Metro had been utterly transparent and upfront -- both about long-term funding plans and definitions -- with voters from the beginning. 
PolitiFact Oregon loves nature and we love good governance. We don’t want public bodies borrowing money recklessly, and we trust our elected officials to make that distinction.  
But here we have a government that sold an earlier measure as a way to buy and restore natural areas and that now says officials couldn’t use that money for restoration. Yet there is no legal prohibition on using bond proceeds for restoration. In fact, Metro has spent nearly $5 million to do so, even if staffers call it something else.  
The bottom line is that both statements come from the Voters' Pamphlet and both were written by Metro officials. And both statements can’t be right.  
Metro wants more money to further nurture its new natural areas. Metro wants money for boat ramps and better playgrounds that should improve use of visitor areas. We don’t fault the wishes. But we do fault Metro for saying one thing, then another, about whether restoration was part of the plan in 2006 and why more money is needed in 2013.  
This is a reversal of position by Oregon’s tri-county regional government. We rule this a Full Flop. ",/factchecks/2013/may/04/metro/did-metro-flip-flop-whether-it-could-use-bond-mone/
"['Rhode Island', 'Guns', 'David Cicilline']","
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says gun dealers whose licenses are revoked for misconduct can sell their inventories free from background checks
","
As the nation debates proposed new gun restrictions after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre, one issue is whether current law adequately regulates firearms dealers. 
During a recent appearance on WJAR-TV's ""10 News Conference,"" U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke on the issue. Cicilline this year sponsored a bill, which has more than 60 co-sponsors, that would close what supporters refer to as the ""fire sale loophole."" The bill is still pending in a Congressional committee and it is unclear when, or if, it will be taken up. 
""If you are a federally-licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you've engaged in misconduct or because you've sold guns to people who shouldn't have them (if) your license is revoked, your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection,"" Cicilline said.  ""You then can sell it free from any background checks. So we reward bad behavior."" 
When we contacted Cicilline’s office to check his claim, spokesman Richard Luchette referred us to the federal firearms law.  We found Section 923 of Title 18, Chapter 44, which includes some of the regulations on federally-licensed firearms dealers. 
But the law doesn’t specifically address what gun dealers who lose their federal licenses can do with the firearms in their inventory. That absence, according to Cicilline and other gun-control supporters, is a serious loophole, allowing dealers to transfer their inventory into a personal collection and then sell those firearms -- without requiring buyers to submit to a background check. 
Luchette also sent us links to a couple of examples provided by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, headed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. (Cicilline was among 15 mayors who in 2006 -- he was Providence mayor at the time -- attended the first summit, hosted by Bloomberg, that helped to launch the group.) 
One example the group cited dated to 2006 and involved a Maryland gun dealer who had lost his license for multiple violations in which firearms in his sales inventory were unaccounted for. 
After the dealer filed a federal lawsuit against the director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco,  the U.S. Department of Justice issued a legal opinion that said ""‘when a dealer loses his license he can dispose of his inventory by selling those firearms without being deemed to have engaged in the business in violation of"" a federal law. 
The gun dealer would violate the law only ""if he chooses to purchase and resell firearms,"" the opinion stated 
The Maryland dealer was found to be within his rights to transfer some 700 guns into his personal inventory and continue to sell them, despite having a record of previous violations in which guns in his inventory were unaccounted for, so long as he did not buy any additional weapons, according to an article in the Baltimore Sun. 
The other example cited by the mayors’ organization was an Ohio firearm dealer allowed to sell what had been remaining in his inventory after his federal license had been revoked. 
Seeking an independent point of view, we contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco, the federal agency that handles federal licensing of firearms dealers. 
An ATF spokeswoman, Debora Seifert, said that once someone is no longer a federally licensed firearms dealer, either voluntarily or because his license is revoked for some misconduct, then ""they are citizens, so they have the ability to convert the firearms from their [sales inventory] into their own personal inventory."" 
Therefore, she said, dealers who are no longer federally licensed do not come under the ATF’s purview. Because they are no longer subject to the federal jurisdiction of ATF, they can conceivably sell those firearms. Those sale are free from federal requirements for background checks of buyers. 
Siefert said some states may have their own laws that curtail firearms sales under those circumstances. Rhode Island is one of those states. 
Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin, said that ""Rhode Island is not a ‘loophole’ state."" The state’s law ""requires a background check and waiting period before any firearm is transferred to any purchaser so it doesn’t matter if the seller has [a federal firearms license] or not,"" she said by e-mail. 
Our ruling 
Cicilline said that ""if you are a federally-licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you've engaged in misconduct or because you've sold guns to people who shouldn't have them (if) your license is revoked, your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection …You then can sell it free from any background checks. So we reward bad behavior."" 
An ATF spokeswoman confirmed that is true. And examples of ex-dealers selling their inventories have occurred and been documented. 
We rate the claim True.

League says opponents of bond package say approval would double Austin district's ""debt load""
","
A Voters Guide prepared by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area says opponents of an $892 million bond issue for the Austin school district say that ""the Austin ISD’s debt load doubles with these new bonds."" 
The four-part bond package appears on the district’s May 11 ballot. Early voting began in late April. 
League volunteer Nan Clayton, a former member of Austin’s school board, told us by phone that the debt warning reflects what league members heard in the community, though she said she couldn’t recall precisely who aired the claim. 
We identified a basic methodology that supports the doubling statement, though district officials said a doubling might not occur--or, if it does, the threshold would be crossed no sooner than 2018. 
Bond opponent Roger Falk of Austin, a member of the Travis County Taxpayers Union, pointed us to figures posted online by the Texas Bond Review Board indicating that as of Aug. 31, 2012, the district owed $750.6 million in outstanding principal with plans to pay $372 million in related interest. 
If voters OK the sought bonds, Falk said, the district’s outstanding principal would more than double. 
School district officials said it’s not that simple. 
By email, spokesman Antonio Lujan said the district believes its debt load will not double. 
""Yes, it would be the case if the district issued debt all at once for the $892.2 million"" before voters, Lujan wrote, attributing his reply to unidentified financial advisers. ""However, the estimate does not take into account the amount of debt that is retired annually by the district each year. The district uses a layering approach that allows the district to manage its debt load based on its cash-flow needs. For the purposes of estimating the tax impact, the district assumed an aggressive schedule for bond issuance of 5 years with a maximum projected outstanding debt load of $1.5 billion in 2018."" 
Lujan added that the bonds, if authorized, might end up being issued over seven to eight years, which also would affect the district’s outstanding debt load. By email, he noted that another $242 million in bonds authorized by voters in 2004 and 2008 also would be issued in the time window. 
Leo Lopez, the district’s executive director of finance, elaborated, saying by phone that the district’s approach to financing projects--a mix of short-term commercial paper and occasional bond sales--keeps its debt lower than if it sold bonds alone. The use of short-term loans saves money, he said, with the current interest rate on such paper 0.18 percent. Also, he said, the district makes regular repayments; for instance, the plan is to repay $46.6 million in principal and $30.2 million in interest in August 2013. 
The pace of the proposed bonds being issued would be driven by factors including the speed of construction projects, Lopez said. ""We’re not going to go and issue bonds when we don’t need the money,"" he said. 
Lopez didn’t quibble, however, when we said it still looks like the prospective district debt of $1.5 billion in 2018 would amount to double the district’s outstanding principal, as of Aug. 31, 2012, of about $750 million. 
A financial analyst for the bond review board, Rob Latsha, said by phone that it’s reasonable to make that comparison, though he cautioned that he hadn’t personally confirmed the district’s aired $1.5 billion figure. 
Latsha said it’s helpful to keep in mind that a district definitely owes its outstanding principal, while anticipated interest amounts can change depending on how the body pays it off. 
Latsha also said it makes sense that the district would build its outstanding principal over several years. It would take the Austin district ""a while to digest this new issuance,"" he said. 
Indeed, Latsha said, the district currently plans to have its outstanding principal knocked down to $444 million as of Aug. 31, 2018, though that assumes no debt is issued in the meantime and the district sticking to its current repayment schedule, he said. 
Lopez, the district official, summed up by email: ""In general we agree with the statement that the debt load would not double, but if it did, that would not occur until 2018, However, it is fair to say that there are a lot of events that have to transpire in order for the 5-year issuance schedule to occur, and there are lot of assumptions about construction spending, property value growth, and facilities needs built into the ‘peak debt’ year of 2018. Austin ISD may never see $1.5 billion in outstanding principal all at once, due to construction delays, defeasance (early payoff) of existing bonds, shifts in enrollment, etc."" 
Our ruling 
According to the league, opponents of the district’s bond package say voter approval would double the district’s debt load. 
The district’s outstanding principal could total $1.5 billion by 2018, compared with $750 million as of the end of August 2012, though the district says it might take up to three years more. Then again, the district says, the doubling might not even occur depending on construction schedules and repayment/financing terms to be determined as time passes. 
Doubling isn’t a certainty. We rate the claim as Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/03/league-women-voters-austin-area/league-says-opponents-bond-package-say-approval-wo/

Guide says proponents of bond package say Austin school district's debt tax rate is second-lowest among Central Texas districts
","
A guide to upcoming Austin-area elections says advocates of a bond package benefiting the Austin school district maintain the district hasn’t overly burdened taxpayers.

According to the Voters Guide prepared by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area, proponents of the $892 million bond package say: ""The bond tax rate for Austin ISD is presently the second lowest among the Central Texas area districts.""

The guide was published April 28, 2013, a day before early voting commenced in advance of the May 11 election featuring the four-part bond package.

By phone, league volunteer Nan Clayton, a former member of Austin’s school board, told us she believes the claim originated from a chart published next to an Austin American-Statesman news article, though she conceded she might have misread published information about the total tax rates of about 10 area districts.

A slide included in a Feb. 25, 2013, Austin district presentation on budget issues indicates that this year, the Austin district has the second-lowest overall tax, of $1.242 per $100 in assessed property, rate of 10 Austin-area districts. This rate reflects the rate levied to pay for maintenance and operations plus a smaller share (sometimes called ""interest and sinking"") rate levied by districts to pay the interest and principal on district-issued bonds, usually for construction of facilities and other capital needs. We took this smaller portion to be the ""bond tax rate"" declared in the Voters Guide.

This year, the slide shows, Travis County’s Eanes district has a lower overall tax rate, $1.2125 per $100 in assessed property value, than Austin. The slide shows districts with higher rates as Round Rock, Lake Travis, Hays, Bastrop, Leander, Manor, Del Valle and Pflugerville.

But the Austin district has the lowest debt tax rate of these districts, at 16.3 cents per $100 in assessed property, with the Eanes district second at 17.25 cents per $100 valuation, according to the slide.

Then again, the claim in the guide speaks to the lowest rates ""among the Central Texas districts."" So we launched our own review of area debt tax rates on the rates in about 30 districts across Travis County and neighboring Hays, Bastrop and Williamson counties. Upshot: The Austin district’s debt rate is lower than those in most of the districts. However, seven districts--those in Wimberley, Johnson City and the burgs of Florence, Bartlett, McDade, Granger and Coupland, a district with instruction through 8th grade that has a zero debt rate--have lower rates than Austin.

Appraised of our findings, Austin district spokesman Antonio Lujan initially said by email that the districts with lower rates ""are not considered Central Texas,"" while, conversely, the Austin district’s slide was limited to Central Texas districts. Historically, Lujan later added, ""we have not been compared to the smaller districts you mentioned, even though ‘geographically speaking’ they may be in the central area of the state.""

Our ruling

Bond proponents say the Austin school district has the second-lowest bond tax rate ""among the Central Texas area school districts."" 
Austin’s debt or bond rate is lower than the rates in most of about 30 Austin-area districts. 
But seven districts have lower rates--and while we'd agree these small, mostly rural districts should rarely rate direct comparison to the larger Austin district, they are indisputably in Central Texas. (President Johnson would guffaw at the notion that Johnson City is anywhere else.)

"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Broward Democratic Executive Committee']","
Was Broward County one of three counties 'pivotal' for Obama?
","
Broward County Democrats like to think they are special. And they have some proof to back that up: Broward has more registered Democratic voters than any other county in Florida. Broward is home to Democratic National Committee chair U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And President Barack Obama campaigned in Hollywood the final weekend before Election Day in 2012. 
We’ll be hearing more about the importance of Broward Democrats as the statewide party aims to take out Republican Gov. Rick Scott next year. In 2010, Broward’s abysmal 41 percent turnout was one factor in Scott’s defeat of Democrat Alex Sink. 
But exactly how important are those Broward Democrats? 
The Broward Democratic Executive Committee sent an email to the media April 11 celebrating that his party had achieved a new milestone: more than 600,000 registered voters. The email then continued: ""A recent news article indicated that three counties in the nation were pivotal to an Obama victory. Broward was the only location in Florida."" 
Broward Supervisor of Elections records showed that the Dems surpassed 600,000 registered voters in April; however, due to the regular list maintenance, which includes placing some voters in an inactive status, the number later dropped down to about 589,000. (Republicans have about 256,000, and independents have about 300,000.) 
But the part that caught our eye was the claim about Broward’s national significance. Was Broward one of three counties in the nation pivotal to Obama’s 2012 victory? 
Article about Broward and Obama’s 2012 win 
We found the article in the National Journal: ""Without his huge margins generated from minority and young voters in just three counties—Broward County, Fla., Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and Philadelphia County, Pa.—Obama would have actually lost those three states and, with them, the Electoral College."" (Broward Democratic chairman Mitch Ceasar confirmed that was the article in question.) 
We contacted the Journal editor who wrote the article, David Wasserman, to ask about Broward’s role in Obama’s victory compared to other Florida counties. He said he meant that Broward was representative of several counties where Obama did well, but not more important than any other. 
""I'm not arguing Broward over Miami-Dade. I could have pointed to either, as both counties (as well as Palm Beach and Orange) gave Obama a margin greater than his statewide margin,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. ""In fact, I'd argue Obama's efforts to woo non-Cuban Hispanics and younger Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade were probably more impressive than his efforts in Broward, where he didn't improve as much versus his 2008 showing."" 
Broward and Miami-Dade results 
In 2012, Obama beat Republican nomineed Mitt Romney 67 percent to 32 percent in Broward, where voters delivered about 508,000 votes to Obama, or about 12 percent of his Florida share. Obama narrowly won Florida by less than 1 percent, with about 74,000 more votes than Mitt Romney. So one way to look at the data is that Broward more than supplied enough votes to create that edge for Obama. 
But we could make the same statement about Miami-Dade. 
The day after the election, the Tampa Bay Times wrote: ""In a race won by razor-thin margins, nowhere mattered more than Miami-Dade, where Obama managed to increase his eye-popping 140,000-vote victory margin in 2008 to an unprecedented 204,000-vote margin this year. Miami-Dade by itself essentially delivered Florida to Obama."" (By the time the votes were counted Obama’s margin was around 208,000.) 
There was no surprising headline out of Broward from the election -- the county voted for Obama by about the same margin as 2008, and the county’s overall turnout was about 67 percent in 2012, placing it the lowest among the state’s largest counties. Only a handful of Florida’s counties had lower turnout. 
The big surprise to many was that Obama received more of the Cuban vote -- thought of as a loyal base for Republicans in Miami-Dade for decades -- than he did in 2008. (Read the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog about the conflicting analysis of the actual numbers.) Obama went after that vote and opened an office in Little Havana, the heart of Miami-Dade’s Cuban community. 
We asked a few election experts if they considered Broward’s vote one of three ""pivotal"" counties for Obama’s victory. None of them declared Broward pivotal to Obama’s victory, but some wrestled with the idea that an individual county could be declared pivotal or questioned what that meant. 
""In a state where the margin of victory was only .088, it is difficult to point to a single county as THE pivotal county,"" University of South Florida professor Susan MacManus said. ""The biggest change in the margin for Obama was in Miami-Dade, not Broward. But the margin was highest in Broward."" 
George Mason University professor Michael McDonald told PolitiFact in an email: ""I’d say that no county is ‘pivotal’ since candidate vote shares across counties within a state tend to move together. If Broward had a few percentage points less vote for Obama, so, too, would other counties. And the campaigns know this, which is why they do not concentrate their resources only in a few counties. The Obama campaign has been widely reported to have targeted voters in Republican areas, finding that some of these voters were more persuadable than those living in Democratic areas."" 
Obama won enough votes in the electoral college without Florida, so the state -- and Broward -- weren’t pivotal, University of Central Florida professor Aubrey Jewett told PolitiFact in an email. 
""Not sure I would say Broward was the only pivotal county to winning Florida, but certainly one of the important ones,"" Jewett wrote in an email. ""Obama's Florida victory seems to fit the old adage that for a Democrat to win Florida they need to run up big margins in the three big Democratic-leaning southeast Florida counties, run even across Central Florida and minimize their losses in North Florida."" 
University of South Florida Professor Steven Tauber said that he viewed the term ""pivotal"" as speculative and vague: 
""Within Florida, there is no doubt that Broward is important, but it is reliably Democratic. Therefore, the key issue for Broward will be turnout and margin of a Democratic victory. I think that Hillsborough is much more important because it is the quintessential swing county. The fact that Hillsborough went for Obama should be more of an issue than the results in Broward."" (Hillsborough County includes the city of Tampa.) 
We told Ceasar that the author of the National Journal article said he could have cited a different Florida County. Ceasar said that Broward’s margin in terms of sheer number of votes for Obama was larger than Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. That’s true -- Broward’s margin was about 264,000 compared to 208,000 in Miami-Dade and 102,000 in Palm Beach. 
""You win on sheer numbers,"" he said. 
He said that all the South Florida counties were important for Obama, however, ""if you are going to pick one county, obviously I have to say my county, based on the sheer numbers, was most significant."" 
Our ruling 
The Broward County Democratic Party said in a press release that Broward County was ""pivotal to an Obama victory"" in 2012, citing a news article. 
It’s mathematically possible to point to Obama’s margin in Broward and say that the votes were more than his margin over Romney. 
But Broward wasn’t really that special. There was never a question that Obama was going to win Broward, and voter-turnout there wasn't particularly high. Miami-Dade, for example, also delivered a big margin for Obama. 
The author of the news article said he could have just as easily chosen Miami-Dade rather than Broward County for the statement. Election experts we interviewed did not identify Broward as pivotal to Obama’s victory, and a few noted that Obama took more a more surprising win in swing-voting Hillsborough County.

In a June 2 tweet, she appeared to take credit for the growth she claims occurred since her tenure as governor began. ""I'm thrilled about @Ford's $2 billion investment to create 3,200 good-paying auto jobs — add this to the nearly 25,000 auto jobs we've created!"" Whitmer tweeted the day the automaker announced plans to add jobs supported by the state’s economic development fund. Republicans hoping to unseat Whitmer have pushed back against the claim. Publicly available employment data does not show that Michigan has gained 25,000 additional jobs in the auto industry since January 2019 when Whitmer entered office. Whitmer spokesperson Bobby Leddy wrote in an email that the jobs figure from the governor is ""a conservative estimate"" of the jobs auto manufacturers and suppliers have announced since 2019 as part of auto manufacturing expansions supported by the state. Leddy and Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) spokesperson Otie McKinley provided a list of dozens of companies that have collectively promised to create more than 25,000 jobs in Michigan’s auto industry in exchange for hundreds of millions in tax relief and government grants. Many of those jobs have already been created and currently employ people, Leddy wrote. But the number of auto jobs Whitmer touts also includes thousands that do not currently exist. Those promised by GM, for instance, will require breaking ground on a new plant, Leddy wrote. ""Governor Whitmer is proud of her record of job creation, particularly in the auto industry, as we move to cement Michigan’s legacy of manufacturing,"" Leddy said in a statement. It is unclear how far along the companies are in their promise to create the jobs they’ve committed to add to the state’s economy. MEDC ""does not have a real-time account as to the exact number of jobs that have been created by each individual company,"" McKinley wrote in an email. Each company must submit reports of the new jobs it creates based on a previously agreed upon reporting schedule, he said.  Jobs are created and destroyed all the time in the auto industry as companies hire or lay off workers and open or close plants. That’s why many look to net employment numbers in an industry over time to determine whether a state has created more jobs than it’s lost, said Brad Hershbein, a senior economist and the deputy director of research at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. ""So how many more jobs do we have now than we did before?"" Hershbein said. Using that measure, Whitmer’s claim that Michigan has added more than 25,000 new auto jobs isn’t borne out by employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of auto jobs in Michigan as of May 2022 — the most recently available data — was slightly lower than it was in January 2019 when Whitmer took office. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data in the transportation equipment manufacturing industry is the best way to analyze auto job growth in the state during that time period, according to Wayne Rourke, the associate director of Michigan’s Bureau of Labor Market Information and Strategic Initiatives. It’s a broad category that encompasses manufacturing outside the auto industry, including aerospace, railroad and ship manufacturing. But the vast majority — about 90% — of the transportation equipment manufacturing industry jobs are within the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts manufacturing sectors. The bigger transportation equipment manufacturing category allows for easy comparisons of job numbers between two different time periods since Michigan’s labor market information bureau publishes adjusted data that accounts for fluctuation in the job numbers resulting from typical seasonal variation in an industry. When Whitmer entered office in 2019, there were 187,890 jobs in transportation equipment manufacturing, according to seasonally adjusted data published by the bureau. In May 2022, there were 184,500 jobs in the sector, a decline of 3,390 jobs. Comparing each month’s employment data in the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts manufacturing sectors across years shows that employment in the auto industry took a huge hit during the COVID-19 pandemic but has essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels. Hershbein said it was ""a little bit misleading"" to refer to jobs expected in the future as those that the state has already added or created. ""Claims about what could happen in the future should always be taken with a fair amount of salt, and this is long true in the economic development world where we give incentives to businesses to create jobs and they don’t always end up doing that,"" Hershbein said. ""It’s nice that the jobs are announced. It’s certainly better than not having jobs announced. But in terms of people’s standards and well-being, we have to see those jobs actually materialize."" Hershbein also said that the general climate of economic uncertainty casts a bit of a cloud over state deals with auto manufacturers. ""There’s still a possibility that the economy could go into a recession,"" he said. ""If that were to happen would they still go forward with their plans? Would they scale it down? Would they postpone them? A lot could still happen."" MEDC requires companies to fulfill their job creation commitments to receive state support, McKinley wrote in an email. Funding isn’t provided to companies that don’t create the jobs they’ve promised, he said. ""I have a high level of confidence that any job promised by a company signing one of these contracts will fulfill their obligations,"" said Mike Johnston, the vice president of government affairs for the Michigan Manufacturers Association. He acknowledged that Whitmer’s claim is not borne out in the most recently available Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data, but said that it provides an accurate picture of where the state’s auto industry is heading. ""If anybody looking at the economy doesn’t look at the future of the economy, they’re looking too short-sighted,"" he said. ""Any snapshot on the economy has to come in the context of where the economy is going and Michigan — in particular the manufacturing sector — is looking very positive."" Bernard Swiecki, the director of research at the independent Center for Automotive Research, said that he wouldn’t call Whitmer’s statement misleading. ""It’s positively oriented, but it’s not out of whack with standard industry practice. When states and communities announce these things, they do focus on the new creation,"" he said. ""It’s not like it’s a made up number,"" he said. But when someone sees it, they might think Whitmer is referring to a net gain in jobs since she entered office. ""And that’s not what it really is. So basically, it’s a number that needs context."" Whitmer claimed that since she entered office, ""Michigan has added more than 25,000 auto jobs."" Her number refers to jobs automakers and suppliers have created, but it also includes jobs they have committed to add in exchange for state support that don’t currently exist. Current employment data does not show that Michigan has gained 25,000 jobs since January 2019, when Whitmer took office. Whitmer is referring to jobs promised through state deals over the last few years. But the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Thousands of those jobs haven’t been created yet, and employment data shows those added haven’t made up for job losses in Michigan’s auto industry.

It's CCTV footage from a 2018 fire that engulfed a mall in the Russian city of Kemerovo, more than 2,200 miles away from Moscow. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the fighting has largely stayed within the Ukrainian border. Russia accused Ukrainian forces of entering Russia in April for the first time during the conflict after an oil depot near the Ukraine-Russia border was attacked. However, Ukraine’s government did not claim responsibility for the attack. The video also claimed a facility operated by the Russian Defense Ministry in the city of Tver was attacked by Ukrainian forces in June, killing 27 people. Although there have been no reported attacks against the facility, one of its buildings did experience a fatal fire in April that killed six people and injured 27 others. The preliminary investigation into the fire found that old wiring at the facility played a part in the fatal blaze. A Facebook video shared images claiming to be from a missile strike on Moscow, implying Ukraine launched the attack against the Russian capital. There appears to be no basis to the claim as there has been no reporting or corroborating evidence that missiles were launched at the city.

Fact-checking the false claim that Plan B causes abortions
","Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, a slew of claims about reproductive health and what constitutes as an abortion have flooded the internet. Even topics that seemed like settled science — such as emergency birth control — have been thrown into the mix. Take this Instagram video, for example, shared by the anti-abortion college group Students for Life. In it, a woman holds up a box of Plan B pills, a type of emergency birth control, and claims that while the box states the medication will not harm an existing pregnancy, the fine print says otherwise. She reads from the box, which says that the product works mainly by preventing ovulation, the fertilization of a released egg or the attachment of a fertilized egg to the uterus.  ""Fertilized egg — Google that word because it’s an embryo,"" the woman says. ""Plan B is an abortifacient. Pass it on.""\ Students for Life captioned the video: ""Plan B can cause an abortion. It’s right there on the box."" But this isn’t accurate. Plan B and other emergency contraceptives do not cause abortions, medical experts say. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Plan B, which is also known as the morning-after pill, is a form of emergency contraception that contains levonorgestrel, a form of the progestin hormone. The medication can help prevent pregnancy if it is taken within five days after sexual intercourse. According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, medical abortion is used to terminate an existing pregnancy, whereas emergency contraception is effective before a pregnancy is established.  ""Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse and is ineffective after implantation,"" the organization says. ""Studies of high-dose oral contraceptives indicate that hormonal emergency contraception confers no risk to an established pregnancy or harm to a developing embryo."" It can take up to one week to become pregnant after sex. The process involves these steps:  The release of an egg from the ovaries (ovulation) The penetration of an egg by a sperm (fertilization) The embedding of a fertilized egg, or zygote, in the uterus (implantation) Reproductive health experts told PolitiFact that Plan B does not disrupt an established pregnancy. ""That's absolutely the fine print, because emergency contraception can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg,"" Kate Connors, a spokesperson at the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said about the Instagram video. ""It also does not interfere with a pregnancy because, medically speaking, pregnancy begins with the implantation of a fertilized egg."" Although it’s possible for emergency contraception to prevent implantation, the ACOG says that review of the evidence suggests this is unlikely. A representative for Foundation Consumer Healthcare, the company that owns Plan B, told us the medication has 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel, ""the same active ingredient used in many regular oral contraceptives for over 30 years — just at a single, higher dose,"" and works by temporarily delaying ovulation. Scientific data shows that Plan B does not prevent or interfere with implantation of a fertilized egg, will not impact a woman’s fertility and is not able to induce an abortion, the company said.  ""There is often confusion between emergency contraception (such as Plan B) and abortion medication regimens (which include mifepristone, sometimes referred to as ‘the abortion pill’),"" Foundation Consumer Healthcare told us in an emailed statement. ""Abortion medications work differently from levonorgestrel (Plan B) and are used after a pregnancy has been established and are only available by prescription while under the care of a doctor."" According to ACOG, pregnancy is defined as a ""physiologic state of a woman that follows implantation of a blastocyst(s)."" The organization defines an abortifacient as a ""substance intended to cause termination of a pregnancy so that it does not result in live birth."" ""So, even if Plan B did work by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg (which the evidence indicates is not the case), this is not considered an abortion because a pregnancy has not yet been established,"" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Once a pregnancy is established after implantation, it is very clear that Plan B has no effect."" A video on Instragram claims that Plan B can cause an abortion. This is not the case. Plan B is a form of emergency contraception that can help prevent pregnancy before it is established. It does not cause abortion.

Lauren Boebert wrong on Founding Fathers’ intent, experts say
","Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert raised eyebrows when she gave an impassioned address to worshippers at a Colorado church on June 26. While encouraging churchgoers to get more involved in their local governments to help shape policy, Boebert, who easily won her primary election on Tuesday, said she’s ""tired of this separation of church and state junk."" ""The reason we had so many overreaching regulations in our nation is because the church complied. The church is supposed to direct the government. The government is not supposed to direct the church,"" Boebert said. ""That is not how our Founding Fathers intended it, and I’m tired of this separation of church and state junk. That’s not in the Constitution. It was in a stinking letter, and it means nothing like what they say it does."" Boebert is accurate that the words ""separation of church and state"" do not appear in the Constitution, but her statement glosses over what the Constitution does say about religion. Historians and legal scholars said her assertion that the nation’s founders intended for the church to direct the government is categorically wrong.  You can hear Boebert’s entire remarks here: The relevant part of the First Amendment reads: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…""  This is known as the ""establishment clause."" It was included because European settlers came from a number of religious backgrounds, and the Constitution’s framers wanted to ensure that the country had no nationally established church like the Church of England, legal scholars Marci Hamilton and Michael McConnell wrote for the National Constitution Center, a nonpartisan project that brings together scholars from multiple perspectives to publish articles on the U.S. Constitution. The words ""separation of church and state"" come from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802. In it, Jefferson wrote that the First Amendment had essentially built ""a wall of separation"" between church and state. The passage read: ""Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State."" Asked for more information about the congresswoman’s statement, Boebert’s spokesperson, Benjamin Stout, told PolitiFact that ""Christian principles have informed and guided lawmakers in America since its founding. The Congresswoman believes that that should continue."" ""The Congresswoman does not believe in a theocracy, or an established religion set by the state,"" Stout added. ""That’s exactly what the establishment clause protects against.""   The limits of the establishment clause have been debated for centuries, experts said. ""I do not think that the metaphor used in (Jefferson’s) letter accurately conveys the meaning of the establishment clause,"" said Nicole Stelle Garnett, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. ""But the original understanding of the establishment clause — other than the fact it prohibited a national church — is contested."" Jefferson’s metaphor of a separation of church and state is one that courts and others have cited and ""is one of the principles of religious liberty deeply entrenched in our constitutional order,"" said Nathan Chapman, a professor at the University of Georgia Law School and co-author of ""Agreeing to Disagree: How the Establishment Clause Promotes Religious Pluralism and Protects Freedom of Conscience."" ""People of good faith have disagreed about its application in specific cases, but it remains a distinctive feature of American constitutionalism,"" Chapman added. Where experts generally agree is that Boebert was wrong to say it was the intent of the nation’s founders that ""the church should direct the government."" The Constitution is clear on that. ""It is definitely not accurate to say that according to the Constitution ‘the church is supposed to direct the government,’ or even that such a thing would be permitted,"" said Nelson Tebbe, a professor at Cornell Law School. ""We don’t know everything about what the establishment clause of the First Amendment disallows today, but we do know that it would not allow an official church, such as the Church of England. Nor would it be constitutional today to allow a church official or institution, as such, to have the authority to ‘direct the government.’"" Tebbe pointed to the Supreme Court’s 1994 ruling in Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet. In that case, the New York state created a separate school district specifically for a community of Hasidic Jews, which would have given the group power to direct public funding. The community’s students attended private, religious schools but needed state funding to provide services for children with disabilities. The state’s attempt to solve the problem crossed ""the line from permissible accommodation to impermissible establishment,"" the court said. Chapman called Boebert’s comments about the church directing the government a ""statement of political theology."" ""Many Americans at the founding were Christians and very few, if any, believed"" in the vision Boebert referenced, Chapman said. ""The English model was of the king as the head of church and state. Americans uniformly rejected that. Some thought there should be more mutual influence, some less. But few thought the ‘church’ … should ‘direct’ the government, either as a matter of theology or politics.""  Steven Heyman, a law professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, said the whole point of the establishment clause is that there’s no national church, so ""then there's no way for it to ‘direct the government,’ as Rep. Boebert claims."" While the establishment clause is open to interpretation, the Supreme Court in recent years has used what’s known as the ""Lemon test"" when considering cases involving government and religion, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.  That refers to a 1971 ruling in Lemon v. Kurtzman, which established a three-part test to determine whether a state action violated the establishment clause: 1) Whether the state aid had a secular purpose; 2) Whether it promoted or hindered religion; and 3) Whether there is excessive entanglement between church and state. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in 1984 proposed a modification of the Lemon test called the endorsement test, which asks whether the challenged government action endorses or disapproves of a religion, a test that many lower courts apply. The Supreme Court, now led by a conservative majority, three of whom were appointed by former President Donald Trump, has made several recent rulings in religious plaintiffs' favor, includng one that specifically rejected both the Lemon and endorsement tests. One came June 27, a day after Boebert’s comments. The court ruled 6-3 in favor of a Washington state public high school football coach who was disciplined after refusing to stop praying on the field after games. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority that the coach, Joseph Kennedy, was not praying as part of his job duties. He said that ""both the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment protect expressions like Mr. Kennedy’s. Nor does a proper understanding of the Amendment’s Establishment Clause require the government to single out private religious speech for special disfavor.""  Gorsuch wrote that ""in place of Lemon and the endorsement test, this Court has instructed that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by ‘reference to historical practices and understandings.’"" In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that the coach’s prayers may have a coercive effect on students, and that the ruling prioritized the free exercise clause over the establishment clause.  Another recent ruling came June 21, when the court ruled 6-3 that religious schools couldn’t be excluded from a program in Maine that offers tuition aid for private education. In that ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that ""Maine’s ‘nonsectarian’ requirement for its otherwise generally available tuition assistance payments violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment."" Boebert, in a talk to churchgoers, said the Founding Fathers intended that ""the church is supposed to direct the government.""  While some of the framers were more open to the mixing of religion and the state, the Constitution as adopted did not go anywhere near what Boebert describes, constitutional experts say. The part of the First Amendment that reads, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,"" makes clear the founders’ desire to avoid the establishment of a national church, such as the Church of England, that could direct government. That establishment clause has been interpreted by the court and scholars in various ways, but we find no interpretation suggesting its meaning to be that a church should direct the government.  We rate that statement False.",/factchecks/2022/jun/30/lauren-boebert/lauren-boebert-wrong-founding-fathers-intent-exper/

Ohio’s JD Vance wants to defund a federal law enforcement agency, but not all police departments
","In the Ohio Senate race, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan portrays himself as a candidate that supports the police and his  Republican opponent J.D. Vance as someone who does not.  A Ryan TV ad features uniformed Stark County Sheriff George T. Maier standing in front of a squad car. Maier says that when Vance ""calls law enforcement corrupt, it makes me angry, that makes my job harder. So does J.D.’s plan to eliminate an agency that combats violent drug traffickers."" Then a message on the screen makes this claim: ""J.D. Vance wants to defund law enforcement.""  No particular agency is identified, but the ad cites a Vance tweet from Feb. 1. In that tweet, Vance wrote that he would ""fight to abolish the ATF."" That’s a reference to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a law enforcement agency within the Justice Department. In the ad, Maier then makes this comparison: ""Tim Ryan knows defunding the police is ridiculous,"" Maier says.  ""He’s brought back $467 million to put good cops on the street.""  Ryan has served in Congress for nearly 20 years. Vance, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump, wants to get rid of one law enforcement agency, ATF, but he has not campaigned against defunding all law enforcement agencies. The Senate seat is opening because Republican Rob Portman is not seeking reelection. The Nov. 8 race is rated as ""leans"" Republican, ""likely"" Republican and ""solid"" Republican. The outcome could decide party control of the Senate, which is now split 50-50. The mission of the ATF is ""to protect communities from violent criminals, criminal organizations and illegal use and trafficking of firearms,"" among other things, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Vance, an author and venture capitalist, has called several times for getting rid of the agency, including in a February opinion article published by the Cincinnati Enquirer, in tweets and in a campaign ad.  His Feb. 2 tweet included a video clip of himself at a campaign event alleging that the ATF is ""spying on lawful gun owners"" by keeping a database of gun transactions. Joe Biden's ATF is illegally collecting information on the gun transactions of millions of law-abiding citizens & putting them into a digital database.As Senator, I'll not only lead the fight against Biden's unconstitutional gun database, I'll fight to ABOLISH the ATF. pic.twitter.com/cNY9wQ9OpW Vance falsely claimed in a February ad that President Joe Biden ""uses the ATF to illegally track your gun transactions."" The Government Accountability Office found that ATF is following the law in how it manages gun transaction records. A joint fundraising committee that raises contributions for Vance’s campaign and for his leadership PAC also ran an ad on Facebook and Instagram calling for the ATF to be abolished. Vance has been critical of the FBI, calling for an investigation of its ""corrupt leadership,"" accusing it of botching investigations and of spying on Trump.  We found that in January, Vance retweeted a tweet that said: ""The FBI is an irreparably corrupt and broken agency that needs to be defunded and eliminated.""  We searched Google and Vance’s Twitter feed for any other statements by Vance directly calling for abolishing or defunding the FBI, but did not find any.  Vance does not list law enforcement or crime generally on the issues section of his campaign website. His campaign did not provide comment for this article. Calls to ""defund the police"" emerged soon after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, murdered George Floyd, a Black man, in May 2020 by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes.

","Lea este artículo en inglés.  Una grabación de una llamada dirigida al 911 publicada en Facebook está siendo erróneamente vinculada con el hallazgo de docenas de inmigrantes muertos en un camión el 27 de junio en San Antonio, Texas.  Un usuario en Facebook publicó la grabación el 28 de junio con el comentario: ""DIFUNDEN LLAMADA DE AUXILIO. La llamada de auxilio de un migrante al 911 alertaba sobre el abandono del grupo en un tráiler, minutos más tarde las autoridades los ubicaron sin vida en San Antonio Texas Estados Unidos"". El post fue marcado como parte del esfuerzo de Facebook para combatir las noticias falsas y la desinformación en su plataforma. (Lea más sobre nuestra colaboración con Facebook.) En el audio se escucha a un hombre pedir auxilio asegurando que 80 personas se encuentran en una ""pipa"", un camión de cisterna, de color blanca y no pueden respirar. También se escucha a la operadora y algunas voces sollozando al fondo.  Una búsqueda de las palabras ""una pipa blanca"" conlleva a un video que presenta una llamada al 911 de parte de unos migrantes.  Sin embargo, la grabación no es de las víctimas migrantes del incidente en San Antonio, Texas. El audio es una grabación de una llamada publicada en YouTube por Noticias Telemundo el 11 de febrero de 2021. Ese reportaje es sobre unos migrantes que se encontraban atrapados en un camión de cisterna.  En el video se observa un camión de cisterna blanco captado por la cámara que dicta la fecha 8 de febrero de 2021 al borde en una carretera mientras el audio corre al fondo.  El presidente Joe Biden dijo que los primeros reportes indican que el incidente de San Antonio es atribuido al contrabando o trafico de personas y anunció el comienzo de una investigación.  ""La pérdida de vidas ayer en San Antonio es horrible – mis oraciones están con aquellos que perdieron la vida, sus seres queridos y aquellos que aún luchan por sobrevivir.Continuaré haciendo todo lo posible para evitar que los traficantes criminales exploten a los migrantes."" https://t.co/jy7nQPgf2C Funcionarios federales anunciaron que arrestaron a cuatro hombres y acusan a uno de ellos de contrabando de personas resultando en muerte; uno es acusado de conspiración y los dos otros son acusando de delitos de armas. Un comunicado de prensa del Departamento de Justicia aclaró que uno de los hombres fue encontrado en la escena del crimen donde se hacía pasar por un migrante antes de ser identificado como el conductor del camión por la patrulla fronteriza. Los otros tres hombres fueron detenidos luego de ser vinculados con el incidente en investigaciones telefónicas. Según el Departamento de Justicia, la policía de San Antonio llegó a la escena después de recibir llamadas al 911 de ciudadanos preocupados. Oficiales el 27 de junio descubrieron a 48 personas muertas en la escena; días después, la cifra de muertos subió a 53 personas. Una grabación publicada en Facebook dice que muestra la última llamada de un migrante al 911 antes del accidente de un camión en San Antonio, Texas el 27 de junio que cobró la vida de más de 50 personas.  Sin embargo, la grabación publicada pertenece a un incidente ocurrido el 8 de febrero de 2021,  cuando 80 inmigrantes estaban atrapados en un camión de cisterna sin poder respirar.  La publicación identifica erróneamente la grabación.  Calificamos la publicación como Falsa. ACLARACIÓN: Este artículo se actualizó poco después de su publicación para reflejar los cargos atribuidos a las cuatro personas arrestadas en relación con el incidente en San Antonio, Texas.

No, Border Patrol agents can’t enter a home without a warrant. SCOTUS case dealt with suing agents
","Amid the flurry of June Supreme Court rulings, an alarming post gained traction on Instagram claiming that the court gave border agents unfettered permission to enter the homes of nearly 200 million Americans. ""The Supreme Court ruled that border agents can enter anyone’s home within a 100-mile radius of the border without a warrant for any reason and federal courts cannot do anything about it,"" read the June 21 post. ""2 out of 3 Americans live in this radius.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screengrab from Instagram) The post, which was deleted while we were checking its claim, featured an orange map of the U.S. with a thick yellow line denoting a ""border enforcement zone"" and highlighted cities within that area. We found similar posts on Facebook and Twitter. The post gets some small details correct: There is a 100-mile zone where agents have certain unique permissions, and nearly two-thirds of Americans live within it, according to the ACLU.  But the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution still protects ""against unreasonable searches and seizures"" without probable cause — including by Border Patrol agents. And the Supreme Court’s ruling in Egbert v. Boule did not change what Border Patrol agents are permitted to do.  The ruling addressed how citizens can legally respond if they are victims of constitutional violations. While critics of the decision argue that the ruling makes it more difficult for agents to be held accountable when they do violate people’s rights, the Instagram post’s characterization of its effect misses the mark.  Limits on what exactly federal Border Patrol agents can and can’t do are outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The act, first passed by Congress in 1952 and amended in 1965, serves as the primary immigration legislation in the U.S. Among its many provisions, the law outlines several unique powers of Border Patrol agents that were established ""for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States.""  The law specifies that within ""100 air miles"" of any ""external boundary"" of the U.S. border (which includes coastlines), Border Patrol agents can, without a warrant, ""board and search for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car, aircraft, conveyance, or vehicle.""  This means that within 100 miles from the border, Customs and Border Protection agents can board buses and trains and request immigration documentation from passengers without a warrant or probable cause. Agents may also pull over vehicles if they have ""reasonable suspicion"" of an immigration violation according to the ACLU. The provision continues, stating that within 25 miles of the border, agents are allowed ""to have access to private lands, but not dwellings,"" for the purpose of preventing illegal immigration.  So, while agents do have access to vehicles (within 100 miles) and private lands (within 25 miles) the law explicitly excludes access to people’s homes. And the Fourth Amendment still protects ""against unreasonable searches and seizures"" without probable cause. To search a vehicle or a dwelling, Border Patrol agents still need to demonstrate probable cause, or reasonable belief that a crime has been committed. So, although CBP agents do have some unique powers within the 100-mile zone, those powers don’t include the ability to enter people’s homes without warrants, as the claim states.  ""The Supreme Court did not alter the border search exception law in any way"" said Art Arthur, resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that supports low levels of legal immigration.  On June 8, 2022, the Supreme Court released its 6-3 ruling in favor of Erik Egbert, the Border Patrol agent named in Egbert v. Boule. Robert Boule sued Egbert after he said the agent in 2014 entered his business, the Smuggler’s Inn on the U.S.-Canada border in Blaine, Washington, to investigate a guest suspected of entering the country illegally. Boule, who had previously served as a confidential informant for CBP, asked Egbert to leave. He claimed Egbert then ""became violent, and threw Boule first against the vehicle and then to the ground.""  Boule sued, seeking monetary damages for violations to his constitutional rights, claiming use of excessive force and retaliation.  The court found that Boule was not entitled to seek damages for the excessive force and retaliation of Egbert. But the court ""did not sanction the agent’s unconstitutional actions or grant agents permission to violate people’s rights in the future,"" according to the ACLU.  The court’s decision ultimately limits the scope of what is called a ""Bivens action"" — ""a lawsuit for damages when a federal officer who is acting in the color of federal authority allegedly violates the U.S. Constitution,"" according to a definition from Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute. Bivens actions have been used in federal courts since 1971, but ""the Supreme Court… has so many times said that Bivens really has limited application. And if you follow the trend of Bivens, then it is not that surprising to see what [the Supreme Court] did in this case,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. For people seeking damages due to a violation of constitutional rights, suing an individual CBP agent through a Bivens action in federal courts is no longer a viable option, Chishti said.   The majority opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas said that, except for rare circumstances, it is the job of Congress, not the courts, to address these claims. In the dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor disagreed with the ruling writing that thousands of ""CBP agents are now absolutely immunized from liability in any Bivens action for damages, no matter how egregious the misconduct or resultant injury…including those engaged in ordinary law enforcement activities, like traffic stops, far removed from the border.""  The ACLU similarly expressed concern that the limiting of Bivens actions removes important deterrents to misconduct and limits accountability for federal agents.   ""They have been given more of a green signal to act aggressively in the pursuit of their job than they did before Egbert,"" Chishti said. An Instagram post claimed that the Supreme Court ruled that Border Patrol agents can enter any home within 100 miles of the border without a warrant and that federal courts have no way to address it.  The Supreme Court ruling in Egbert v. Boule does not grant any new powers to Border Patrol agents, who still cannot enter any home without a warrant or probable cause under the Fourth Amendment.  The ruling did narrow the path that victims of excessive force and other constitutional violations have to seek monetary damages from those agents through federal courts. Critics of the decision argue the ruling makes it more difficult for agents to be held accountable when they do violate people’s rights.  We rate this statement Mostly False.   ",/factchecks/2022/jun/30/instagram-posts/no-border-patrol-agents-cant-enter-home-without-wa/

'Big Four' meat packers are seeing record profits
","Meat prices are soaring and Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) wonders whether there’s been collusion among the nation’s largest meat-packing corporations. ""The four big meat packers are raking in record profits,"" she wrote in a June 16 guest column for Fox News, which was co-authored by Brooke Miller, president of the U.S. Cattlemen’s Association.  We fact checked Spanberger’s claim about profits and found it is correct. Top executives of the four major meat packing companies have sworn to Congress that they are not fixing prices, saying their record profits are instead the result of unusual economic circumstances brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  Meat prices rose 12.3% over the 12-month period ending on May 31, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That outstrips the 8.6% inflation rate and a 10.1% increase in overall food prices.  Spanberger introduced in April, a bill that would establish an office at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate possible antitrust violations in the meat industry. The measure, backed by Democrats, passed the House on a largely partisan vote earlier this month on June 16. A similar bill passed the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee on June 22 with broad bipartisan support.  The four major meat conglomerates are JBS Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Marfrig. They are the middlemen in 55% to 85% of all the beef, pork and poultry sold in the U.S., according to White House analysis released in November 2021. They buy livestock, slaughter it and process the meat, and sell it to retailers. All of them operate internationally. JBS had a record net profit of $4.4 billion for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2022 —  a 70% increase over the previous 12 months.  Tyson had a record $4.1 billion net profit for the year ending March 31, 2022 — a 91% increase over the previous 12 months. Cargill is a privately-held company and isn’t required to publicly report its financial information. Bloomberg reported last August that confidential financial documents showed Cargill delivered a record $4.9 billion in net income for its fiscal year ending May 31, 2021 — up 60% over the previous 12 months. Marfrig reported a net profit of $820.1 million in 2021, a 32% increase over 2020. ""This was our largest profit ever,"" the Brazilian-based company said in its annual report. Net income dropped during the first quarter of 2022 due to the company’s $360 million stock purchase in BRF, a Brazilian poultry and pork processor. Even so, Marfrig’s chief financial officer said it was the company’s ""best operational first quarter."" While profits have been soaring for the large meat packers, many ranchers and cattle farmers complain that livestock prices have remained stagnant as their business costs have increased. Many Democrats, including President Joe Biden, have accused the four conglomerates of setting prices.  High-ranking executives of the four corporations, testifying before the House Agriculture Committee on April 22, said the meat industry is cyclical and a confluence of economic events have led to record profits. They said an oversupply of cattle in recent years pushed down meat prices and left farmers with more livestock than they could sell. At the same time, they said coronavirus outbreaks caused work disruptions at processing plants, leading to increases in the demand and price for meat. The CEOs also said that inflation has increased processing and transportation costs and those added expenses have been passed on to consumers. Spanberger wrote, ""The four big meat packers are raking in record profits."" The big four are JBS Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Marfrig. Each of the four reported record net income in the latest year-over-year financial information we could find. We rate Spanberger’s statement True.  ",/factchecks/2022/jun/30/abigail-spanberger/big-four-meat-packers-are-seeing-record-profits-sp/

Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld falsely claims concealed carry permit holders never committed mass shooting
","Weeks after massacres in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld falsely claimed that nobody with a concealed carry permit had ever committed a mass shooting. The comment came as Gutfeld and the co-hosts of ""The Five"" discussed the Supreme Court’s ruling striking down a New York law that put limits on carrying a concealed firearm in public.  ""I think about mass shooters,"" Gutfeld said June 23. ""I don't believe — and someone correct me later, I won't listen — but I don't believe anybody with a concealed carry permit ever committed a mass shooting. So I think the ban itself had no role in preventing these things, right?"" Now more than ever, it’s important to sort fact from fiction. Please donate to support our mission.  Here’s the correction Gutfeld asked for: His claim is wrong. Concealed carry laws, which are on the books in about half the states, are laws that require a permit to carry a firearm in public. Jaclyn Schildkraut, who researches mass shootings as an associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York, Oswego, said there is no national registry of concealed carry permits across those states. But a ""two-second Google search"" shows Gutfeld’s claim is ""inaccurate,"" Schildkraut said. ""Absolutely, wholly inaccurate,"" added Kristen Rand, government affairs director for the nonprofit Violence Policy Center, which tracks such cases as part of its focus on reducing gun violence. Citing news reports that indicate when a mass shooter had a concealed carry permit — including articles from Fox News’s own website — the Violence Policy Center counted 37 mass shootings by concealed carry permit holders between May 2007 and May 2022.  The list includes the accused shooter who killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October 2018. It includes a 2017 shooting that killed three people at a Florida airport, and a 2019 shooting in which 13 people, including the shooter, died in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The Violence Policy Center defines a mass shooting as a killing of three or more people; that’s in line with the definition used under a 2013 federal mandate to investigate such attacks following the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. There is no legal definition of a mass shooting, PolitiFact previously reported. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment. Gun rights advocates have often pointed to research showing that people with concealed carry permits have used their firearms to stop likely mass shootings.  Daniel Webster, who co-authored a 2020 study from Johns Hopkins University, told NPR in May that his research does not support the argument that carrying guns for self defense can help stop mass shootings.  ""The data do not bear that out at all,"" said Webster, co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""If anything, it shows higher rates of fatal mass shootings in response to weaker regulations for concealed carry by civilians."" A report Schildkraut wrote in 2018 said handguns were used in about three out of every four mass shootings. ""It’s difficult to conceal anything other than a handgun due to size,"" she told PolitiFact. Gutfeld said, ""I don't believe anybody with a concealed carry permit ever committed a mass shooting."" That’s inaccurate; there have been several such cases, including the 2018 mass shooting that left 11 dead at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Citing media reports, the nonprofit Violence Policy Center has counted 37 mass shootings that were committed by concealed carry permit holders since 2007.

The Instagram post was flagged by Facebook, as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline is real, but it’s from a 2021 article. The underlying Texas bill died in a legislative committee.  The headline comes from a March 9, 2021, report in The Hill about Texas Rep. Bryan Slaton’s bill, HB 3326. That bill would have criminalized abortion as homicide, a crime that can be punishable by death.  ""The bill will end the discriminatory practice of terminating the life of innocent children, and will guarantee the equal protection of the laws to all Texans, no matter how small,"" Slaton said on Twitter March 9, 2021. HB 3326 moved to the House Committee on Public Health on March 22, 2021, but did not progress past that point. Following the release of the Supreme Court’s official ruling June 24, 2022, Slaton pledged that he would reintroduce the bill. But he hasn’t done it yet. The next legislative session in Texas will begin in January 2023.
