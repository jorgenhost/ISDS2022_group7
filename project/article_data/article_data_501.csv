John Chiang’s claim on California’s affordable housing doesn’t add up
","State Treasurer John Chiang has made boosting California’s supply of affordable housing a key talking point during his run for governor. Chiang, one of several Democratic candidates in the 2018 race, claimed at a recent campaign event in Santa Monica that he’s helped greatly expand that supply. ""Since I’ve been the state treasurer, we’ve increased the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent,"" Chiang said in a Facebook live video on August 13, 2017, joined by Congressman Ted Lieu.  Chiang made a similar assertion in a Facebook post one month later. California’s struggle to build enough affordable housing is well documented: Estimates place the state's affordable housing shortage at 1.5 million residences. We wanted to know, however, whether Chiang was right about the pace of this construction upswing and whether he left anything out. We set out on a fact check. Our research Chiang took office as treasurer in January 2015. We asked his office for information supporting his statement about the 80 percent growth in construction since that time. It provided data showing the number of low-income housing units constructed -- or rehabilitated -- by developers receiving one of two types of federal tax credits. That combined number jumped from nearly 14,000 units in 2014 to about 25,500 in 2016 -- an increase of about 83 percent, which tracks with Chiang’s statement. These tax credits are awarded by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, headed by Chiang, and are a catalyst for building affordable housing. Matt Schwartz, president of the nonprofit California Housing Partnership, told us these credits are the driving force for as much as 95 percent of the state’s affordable housing construction each year. One type can cover more than half the cost of developing a unit while the other can cover a quarter of the cost, Schwartz said. Schwartz clarified that these tax credits are only used on affordable rental properties. The treasurer’s data seems like a fair starting point for tracking affordable housing construction. But given that some of the construction was for rehabilitation -- something Chiang did not make clear in his statement -- we wanted a deeper look at the data. How many rehabs?  We found rehab projects accounted for more than half of the construction in 2014 and more than 60 percent of construction in 2016. ""Most of the rehabilitations are of existing affordable housing units. That’s different than actually adding brand new units to the housing stock. That quote (from Chiang) is not spliced in a way that that’s obvious,"" said Carol Galante, a professor of affordable housing at UC Berkeley. A treasurer’s office fact sheet promotes the same 80 percent increase in affordable housing units, but clarifies that those are ""built or rehabilitated.""  SOURCE: California Treasurer's Office Not just a coat of paint Representatives for the treasurer told us they’ve always interpreted the term ""building, construction"" as including both new and rehabilitated units. Mark Stivers, who heads the state tax credit allocation committee, said rehabs involve far more than ""just slapping paint"" on an old apartment. The use of the federal tax credit for rehabilitation, he said, locks in that unit at an affordable rate for 55 years through a deed restriction. Schwartz, of the nonprofit housing partnership, added that rehabilitation is a key part of preserving California’s limited affordable housing stock. He added that Chiang has shown strong leadership in expanding affordable housing in the state. Our ruling California State Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed he’s helped boost ""the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent"" since he took office in 2015. Data from the treasurer’s office show an 83 percent increase in the construction -- and rehabilitation -- of affordable housing units from 2014 through 2016. But Chiang’s claim omits the fact that less than half were new units added to the housing supply. The majority were rehabilitation projects on existing homes. Experts told us such improvements help preserve affordable housing, but don’t necessarily expand it. A fact sheet on the treasurer’s website gets the details right. But Chiang's statement in a campaign video and later in a Facebook post leave out this important context.  For this reason, we rate Chiang’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Wisconsin 'guaranteeing' nearly $3 billion to Foxconn with no job guarantees, governor hopeful says
","Andy Gronik, one of the leading Democratic candidates for governor in 2018, has bashed Republican Gov. Scott Walker for Walker’s deal with Foxconn, which is nearing final approval. The Milwaukee-area businessman calls the offer to get a manufacturing plant that could employ 13,000 people ""nothing but a con to Wisconsin."" ""We are guaranteeing Foxconn almost $3 billion, but Foxconn is not contractually guaranteeing how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long and at what pay,"" he wrote in an op-ed published Sept. 5, 2017, in the MIlwaukee Journal Sentinel. Gronik’s right that the Taiwanese manufacturer hasn’t made any jobs guarantees. But the state is guaranteeing to pay Foxconn nearly $3 billion only if the company meets certain investment and payroll requirements. The Foxconn announcement Foxconn drew big headlines -- and a July 26, 2017, announcement at the White House with President Donald Trump -- by saying it plans to invest $10 billion to build a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing plant in Wisconsin. On Sept. 5,  2017, the state Legislature’s budget committee approved the $3 billion incentives package, which still needs the approval of the full Legislature. Walker said Foxconn ""is bringing"" 13,000 jobs, but we rated that claim Half True. Foxconn has said it plans to initially employ 3,000 people, with the potential for 13,000. We also rated Half True a claim that Wisconsin’s offer could amount to more than $1 million per job. That could occur If Foxconn invests $9 billion in the plant and equipment, but hires only 1,500 workers. But there is no evidence the company would invest that much and only employ 1,500 people. Now to Gronik’s claim. The incentive offer The incentive package is worth up to $3 billion, but $150 million of that is sales tax exemptions -- in other words, Foxconn wouldn’t have to pay up to $150 million in sales taxes on construction materials for the plant. That leaves $2.85 billion -- the nearly $3 billion Gronik referred to. It comes in two parts. 1. The state would pay Foxconn based on how much the company invests in the plant and equipment. The maximum payment is $1.35 billion, if Foxconn invests at least $9 billion. So, the $1.35 billion is not tied directly to jobs at the Foxconn plant, though the investment would clearly employ construction people. It’s theoretically possible, if unlikely, that Foxconn could receive the $1.35 billion, or some portion of it, if it builds the plant but then -- say, if market conditions change -- abandons it without employing anyone. It’s also possible the plant could be built to maximize automation, which would require fewer workers. 2. The state would also pay Foxconn based on the size of its payroll at the plant. The maximum would be $1.5 billion, if payroll reaches $8.8 billion within a 15-year period, Wisconsin Budget Project director Jon Peacock told us. For example, the $1.5 billion could be earned if Foxconn employs 13,000 people who make at least $30,000 and have an average salary of about $54,000, he said.     In other words, the more people hired by Foxconn, the more the state would pay to the company. In sum: There is no flat guarantee from the state of nearly $3 billion. Roughly half of the incentives would be based on how much is invested in the manufacturing plant, and roughly half would be paid based on employment. In both cases, the incentives are paid, on a pay-as-you go basis, based on what the company does. A parting note: Walker's administration is negotiating a final contract with Foxconn. So, it’s possible a minimum jobs requirement could be made part of the deal. Our rating Gronik says Wisconsin is ""guaranteeing Foxconn almost $3 billion, but Foxconn is not contractually guaranteeing how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long and at what pay."" Wisconsin is guaranteeing to pay Foxconn up to $2.85 billion -- but the full amount would be paid only if the company invests at least $9 billion in its plant and, in rough numbers, employs at least 13,000 people earning at least $30,000 per year. The payments would be less, if Foxconn doesn’t meet those targets. It’s true that Foxconn is not guaranteeing how many people it will hire, for how long and at what pay. That means it’s theoretically possible the company could earn up to $1.35 billion in investment incentives but not employ anyone, if it built the facility but never operated it. But the other $1.5 billion would be paid, on a graduated basis, only as people are employed at the plant. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB3AE80>],/factchecks/2017/sep/12/andy-gronik/wisconsin-guaranteeing-nearly-3-billion-foxconn-no/

Freedom Daily misleads about potential food poisoning at grocery stores, Hurricane Irma
","A misleading headline from a website called Freedom Daily suggests that reports of potential food poisoning at grocery stores emerged after people stocked up in preparation for Hurricane Irma. ""BREAKING: Muslims’ Disturbing Plan Comes Out After Grocery Stores Go Bare To Prepare For Irma,"" said the headline of an undated post on Freedomdaily.com Like a lot of fake news, the headline is extremely misleading while the text of the story itself is more accurate. The article summarizes and adds its own commentary to reports from the media and other sources about the Islamic State’s poisoning of prisoners and about the group’s followers potential to also poison Western grocery stores. In its About Us page, Freedom Daily said they ""post and decipher content to a level that is consistent with a common sense approach and falls in line with the ideals of American liberty and freedom."" Its Facebook page said the website ""gives Americans the real news as it unfolds with a conservative opinion."" In its story, the website doesn’t make any claims about active plots discovered against American supermarkets. ""Multiple outlets have reported that ISIS is utilizing social media to instruct members to poison food in supermarkets. It may or may not happen, but the thought of it occurring on a widespread attack on groceries could be terrorizing,"" said the post about the grocery stores. ""People could even entertain the thought of an ISIS attack before a hurricane in which the food is all poisoned and people falter in the midst of a category 4 storm before the storm even hits them. Of course, this is not something that has happened, but a mere idea or spectacle that theorists could allege."" SITE Intelligence Group reported on Sept. 3 that potential terrorists were advised to inject food sold at markets with cyanide poison. SITE said that message was distributed Sept. 3 on a pro-Islamic State channel on the social media platform Telegram and that it was part of a series of information promoting ""lone-wolf jihad in Western countries."" Freedom Daily linked to a Sept. 6 story on The Federalist Papers Project based on SITE’s report. Newsweek also published a story Sept. 7 headlined, ""ISIS supporters call for poisoning of food in grocery stores across U.S. and Europe."" But neither of them say the information came after people emptied shelves at stores as they prepared for Hurricane Irma’s path across the Caribbean and Florida. Freedom Daily’s story uses a photo of a woman in a blue blouse pushing a shopping cart past empty shelves in a grocery store. That photo was shot on Sept. 5 at a Publix supermarket in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. by the Palm Beach Post — two days after SITE’s report came out. The Miami Herald and several other outlets also reported on Sept. 5 about empty shelves at stores as Floridians prepared for Hurricane Irma. The New York Times on Sept. 4 also noted there were bare water shelves in Puerto Rico as they also braced for the storm. Freedom Daily’s story itself contains true information, but the headline ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Education', 'Unions', 'Illinois', 'Karen Lewis']","
""Scholarship,"" ""voucher,"" ""tax shelter for the wealthy:"" What's really in IL school funding bill?
","For many public education advocates in Illinois, Aug. 31 was a historic day. When Gov. Bruce Rauner put his signature on Senate Bill 1947, he set in motion a plan designed to end Illinois’ status as home to the most unfair school funding system in the nation. But for the Chicago Teachers Union, the good news was tempered by the inclusion in the new plan of the Invest in Kids Act -- a five-year pilot program that will allow up to $75 million in tax credits per year for donors to scholarship funds for private elementary and high schools. This, the union says, amounts to an Illinois prototype for public funding of a private school voucher system like those in 14 states and the District of Columbia. ""Unfortunately, Illinois legislators have voted to 'reform' the worst school funding system in the country with a ticking time bomb of a voucher scheme, and the Illinois Democratic Party has crossed a line which no spin or talk of 'compromise' can ever erase,"" the CTU said in an Aug. 28 press release. After Rauner signed the new formula into law, the union reiterated its opposition to the scholarship portion. ""Instead of raising revenue, the mayor and the governor have attached a parasitic voucher program to the bill to create a tax shelter that will benefit big corporations and billionaire patrons like Ken Griffin,"" read an Aug. 31 CTU blog post. And as CTU President Karen Lewis welcomed members back to classrooms on Sept. 4, she prefaced her praise of the new formula with yet another condemnation of the scholarship plan as a ""voucher program.""   ""While we’re disappointed that our lawmakers caved to right-wing ideologue Bruce Rauner and created a tax shelter for the wealthy and a voucher program, we believe the new evidence-based school funding formula is a step in the right direction—as we have always said—and brings us closer to at last adequately designating public dollars to fund the schools that Chicago’s students deserve,"" Lewis wrote in a blog post. The union consistently describes the scholarship plan as a voucher program and a tax shelter that will benefit the wealthy. But is that description accurate? We took a look. To the CTU, there is no distinction between calling the Invest in Kids Act a ""scholarship"" program or a ""voucher"" program. Use of the term ""scholarship"" is merely a ""scheme to get around the constitutional and public relations issues associated with vouchers,"" said Kurt Hilgendorf, CTU’s policy advisor. ""But make no mistake, the mechanism is functionally the same,"" Hilgendorf said. ""Public funds are shifted to private, predominantly religious schools – in Illinois, $375 million over the next five years -- only through a series of clearinghouses in a legal fiction that creates the illusion of no state support for religion."" The ""clearinghouses"" to which Hilgendorf refers are ""scholarship granting organizations"" -- not-for-profit entities that will be sanctioned by the Illinois Department of Revenue to receive donations and distribute scholarships. Under the Illinois plan, donors will receive state income tax credit for 75 percent of their donations to scholarship funds up to $1 million. The state will grant a maximum of $75 million in scholarship tax credits per year. But they still are tax credits, and that is an important distinction here. ""A traditional voucher program uses state funds and so it needs a state appropriation,"" said Josh Cunningham, who follows school choice programs nationwide for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those programs are different than scholarship plans like the one enacted in Illinois, which Cunningham said ""rely on private donations to private organizations. And in exchange for those donations the donors receive a tax credit and that's kind of the incentive to fund the program."" The terminology can be confusing. Indiana, for example, has a true voucher system called the Choice Scholarship Program. In the 2016-2017 school year, it distributed $142.2 million in private school tuition vouchers to more than 34,000 students, about 3 percent of its total statewide enrollment. But it also includes a donor-funded scholarship program that provides a 50 percent tax credit and is capped at $12.5 million in tax credits annually. Here’s a look at the numbers from Indiana’s Choice Scholarship Program from its 2017 annual report: ""The most simple way of differentiating between (scholarships and vouchers) is the scholarship tax credit requires individuals or corporations to donate to a scholarship granting organization…,"" said Robert Gilligan, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Illinois and one of the designers of the Illinois plan. ""No donations, no program, no scholarship. So this relies on the goodwill of people and corporations proactively doing this."" The Catholic Conference and other school choice advocates tried in 2011 to get a true voucher program through the General Assembly and failed, Gilligan said. He believes the scholarship structure might ultimately be a better program than the one sought six years ago. ""From where I sit right now and based on conversations with my colleagues in other states, this scholarship tax credit seems to be working,"" Gilligan said. ""It seems to be working in the states that have tried it and I think that was one of the reasons that people did take to heart and we were talking about this."" Lewis also refers to the program as a ""tax shelter for the wealthy,"" an accusation made by CTU in the Aug. 31 post that referred to hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, who has donated heavily to Rauner’s campaign fund. The plan offers a 75 percent state tax credit for any donor, with a maximum of $750,000 for those who donate $1 million. Donors will reserve their tax credits by registering on a website that will be operated by the Department of Revenue. For the first six months of the year, the credits will be distributed ""in a manner geographically proportionate to enrollment in recognized non-public schools in Illinois,"" according to the statute."" If the entire $75 million in credits is not claimed under that formula by June 1, the rest will be granted on a first come, first served basis. Thus the statute ensures that potential donors in all parts of the state will have a chance to get in on the program for the first five months of the year. But there’s no such protection based on the size of donations. So, theoretically, 100 donors giving $1 million each to scholarship granting organizations throughout the state could quickly gobble up all the allowable tax credits. Under that scenario, Lewis would be correct in her ""tax shelter for the wealthy"" claim. The Chicago Teachers Union describes Illinois’ impending private school tax credit scholarship plan as a ""voucher program"" that amounts to a ""tax shelter for the wealthy."" It’s clear that ""voucher program"" to the CTU means any system in which public dollars directly or indirectly reach private schools. By that definition, CTU is correct regarding Illinois’ Invest in Kids Act. But those who follow the issue make a distinction between voucher programs -- in which states directly appropriate funds for private school tuition -- and scholarship credit programs funded with private money and incentivized with tax credits. Illinois’ scholarship program has safeguards to ensure that potential donors from all parts of the state can contribute, but it doesn’t have protections against wealthy donors quickly claiming all $75 million of its tax credits. Lewis’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out some important details. We rate it Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC68AF00>],/factchecks/2017/sep/12/karen-lewis/call-it-what-you-want-karen-lewis-calls-illinois-s/

Tweets mislead saying Wisconsin's Paul Ryan doesn't know what the minimum wage is in his home state
","Twitter users skewered the speaker of the U.S. House with this attack: Paul Ryan doesn’t know what the minimum wage is in Wisconsin. Numerous tweets, made on Sept. 11, 2017, and more so over the previous several days, suggest the Janesville Republican has no idea what the minimum hourly rate of pay is in his home state. But that’s not really what went down. Live interview On Sept. 7, 2017, Ryan was on a live webcast interview with the New York Times before an audience in Washington, D.C. The newspaper described it as ""the first in a provocative new TimesTalks D.C. series."" At one point, Jonathan Weisman, deputy Washington editor for the Times, asked: ""What’s the minimum wage in Wisconsin right now?"" Ryan immediately said, ""Seven --"" then looks upward, apparently trying to recall the rest. Then he says: ""What is it? Seven and t--."" Perhaps he was starting to say twenty-five, or some figure in the twenties. At that moment, there’s a response from the audience, Ryan looks to the audience and correctly says: $7.25. So, if Ryan didn’t know the rate exactly at that moment, he certainly was in the ballpark. Wisconsin’s $7.25, by the way, is the same as the federal minimum wage, both of which have been in place since 2009. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, as of July 1, 2017, Wisconsin and Iowa were among 14 states with a minimum wage at $7.25 per hour. Twenty-nine states, plus the District of Columbia, had higher rates, with D.C.’s being the highest, at $12.50. The federal rate applies in states that have minimum wage laws at rates below the federal rate, or that have no minimum wage law at all. For the record, a Times news article said Ryan made it clear in the interview that he opposes legislation to change the federal minimum wage, saying: ""For every wage you raise, you actually end up losing jobs. You end up destroying jobs."" Our rating Tweets say: ""Paul Ryan doesn't know what the minimum wage is in Wisconsin."" Asked the amount in an interview, Ryan didn’t give a complete answer until he heard what a member of the listening audience said. But he had immediately started his answer by saying ""Seven,"" and seemed on the verge of adding 25 cents, or some figure in the twenties, before the audience member interjected. That’s when Ryan correctly said $7.25.

Karen Handel wrongly says Obamacare tax increase largest ever in her lifetime
","Republican lawmakers may have hit a brick wall in their drive to do away with Obamacare, but newly elected U.S. Rep. Karen Handel, R-Ga., stands firm on the need to repeal the health care bill. At a recent telephone town hall, a voter asked why she was not a fan of repairing the Affordable Care Act. ""The issue with quote ‘repairing the Affordable Care Act’ is the fact that it has so many taxes in it,"" Handel said Aug. 30. ""In fact, the Affordable Care Act is the single largest tax increase in my lifetime history. You can’t repair a tax. You have to repeal it. You have to get rid of it."" A reader asked us if the tax hike in the 2010 health care law was as large as Handel said. Handel was born in 1962, so we looked at the research on every major tax bill passed since then. We reached out to Handel’s office to learn the source behind her statement and did not hear back. We looked at the scale of the Affordable Care Act taxes and found that Handel is mistaken. In terms of the dollar amounts, there were three years that topped the Obamacare tax increases. Relative to the size of the economy (using the metric of the gross domestic product) six tax increases were higher. Jerry Tempalski at the Office of Tax Analysis in the Treasury Department ran the numbers in 2013. He calculated the tax impacts of 28 tax bills between 1968 and 2013. To winnow out the effects of inflation, we used the figures he generated based on 2012 constant dollars. Tempalski found that for any given tax bill, the impact would change from year to year. To fully test Handel’s statement, we picked the year with the highest amount for each bill. (Tempalski provided a 4-year average but that diluted the magnitude of the Obamacare taxes.) With that approach, three tax increases were larger. The Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 (Johnson), the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Reagan) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Clinton) ranked above the Affordable Care Act tax impact. But using constant dollars misses a big piece of the picture. A larger economy can absorb a higher tax hike and the nation’s gross domestic product has grown a lot over the years. To compare apples to apples, we took the federal government’s data on gross domestic product and calculated the impact of each tax increase relative to the size of the economy. By that measure, there have been six tax hikes that were larger than those in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. (All amounts are billions of constant 2012 dollars.) This analysis is a little different from one done by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates for deficit reduction, but the two match up on ranking the scale of the tax increases. Tempalski’s report goes only through 2013. To get the most current estimates of the size of the Obamacare taxes, we went to the Joint Committee on Taxation. That congressional body assessed what would happen if all the health care law’s taxes were repealed. The committee found that in 2020, those taxes would total $56.3 billion (no correction for inflation). The highest amount would come in 2025 when the value would reach $87.8 billion in 2025-dollars. Even in the highest year, based on the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of GDP in 2025, the Affordable Care Act taxes are about .34 percent of GDP. That’s less than tax hikes in previous years. The last way to weigh the scale of the Affordable Care Act taxes is to compare tax collections due to the law with total federal revenues in the year before. (We used the highest year when the taxes were in effect; for the ACA that was 2014.) The Affordable Care Act increase ranks last in this time frame. Handel said the Affordable Care Act is the single largest tax increase in her lifetime. Using constant dollars, three tax laws ranked higher. Relative to the size of the U.S. economy and federal revenues the year before, six tax hikes were larger than those in the Affordable Care Act. We rate this claim False. Correction: This report originally misstated which president signed the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC768F80>],/factchecks/2017/sep/11/karen-handel/handel-wrong-size-obamacare-taxes/

""This is a massively successful program. There is no good reason to shut it down. There's no legitimate reason to shut it down. No court has held it unconstitutional,"" Schneiderman said Sept. 6. We’ve heard lots of competing claims from lawmakers, pundits and others that walk the line between fact and opinion regarding the constitutionality of DACA. Schneiderman’s claim is clearly stated as a fact. We found that he is right: DACA’s constitutionality has not been determined by courts. DACA is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by Janet Napolitano, then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Napolitano’s memo outlined prosecutorial discretion so that resources would be used to remove immigrants who met the department’s priorities and protect from deportation young immigrants who met specific criteria. Napolitano said immigration laws were ""not designed to be blindly enforced"" without considering individual cases and circumstances. ""Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here,"" Napolitano wrote. DACA is a policy, but it is not a law. It also does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800,000 people who were approved for the program. Many have argued that creating DACA through the executive brach, rather than through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power. There’s debate among experts on whether DACA is constitutional or not, but there is agreement that a court ruling on the constitutionality of the program has not been issued. ""There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional,"" Anil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University. A lawsuit to challenge the 2012 DACA was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Kalhan said. ""So there was never any adjudication on the merits,"" he said. ""To my knowledge, no court has ruled DACA 2012 as unconstitutional and the one to even reach the court was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds,"" concurred Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a law professor and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Pennsylvania State University. Wadhia and more than 100 other immigration law professors and scholars wrote a letter to Trump providing legal analysis on the executive branch’s legal authority to implement DACA. Other experts from the University of California also told us courts have not stricken down DACA as unconstitutional. ""It's a straightforward fact that no court has declared DACA unconstitutional and that the one appellate court that considered a related program declined to address the issue,"" said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for Schneiderman. Texas and 25 other states won a lawsuit against the Obama administration by having a federal district judge block the implementation of an expanded version of the 2012 DACA and of another deportation reprieve program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An appeals court upheld the ruling, and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4-4 on the case, leaving in place the lower court's ruling. But when those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas, it was not on constitutional grounds, Kalhan said, ""but rather based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule-making, rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued."" A final, binding precedent even on that basis was not set either, since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked, Kalhan said. ""And even then, some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality—it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing,"" Kalhan said. Schneiderman said, ""No court has held (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) unconstitutional."" While there is debate on the constitutionality of DACA, that has not been determined by courts. We rate Schneiderman’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD257C0>],/factchecks/2017/sep/11/eric-schneiderman/has-daca-been-ruled-unconstitutional/

Claim about in-home care cuts Mostly False
","After Eric Greitens vetoed a bill in late June that would have created a possible mechanism for funding in-home care for Medicaid eligible seniors, veterans and people with disabilities, Rep. Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, and Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis City, wrote an open letter condemning the governor. In the letter published on Aug. 9, 2017, and picked up by several other newspapers, Quade and Merideth tried to rally support for a veto-override. The letter said, ""The governor’s cuts would kick over 8,000 people out of their homes."" But is the governor solely responsible for this outcome? And 8,000 people losing funding seems plausible, but physically kicked out of house and home? After talking to the chief of the public information office at the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, we found the representatives’ claim is not actually the case. (PolitiFact's database only allows us to check one speaker at a time, so we will check Quade here. The rating would also apply to the co-author, Merideth.) To start, Quade and Merideth put responsibility for the loss of funding squarely on the shoulders of the governor. In a literal sense, that’s true: Greitens’ veto means there will be no funding in place once the budget cuts go into effect. In early February, Greitens presented the annual budget proposal, which included cuts to Medicaid coverage for in-home care and nursing home services. Legislators scrambled to come up with a way to keep funding for vulnerable seniors in the budget. In the last minutes of the 2017 session, a bill was passed that authorized the government to divert funds from other boards and commissions to senior services. But Greitens called it a ""budget gimmick."" Because the bill failed to specify which funds were to be diverted, there was no guarantee there would be enough money to make up the difference. Greitens proposed the original cuts. Legislators tried to make up the difference, and they got a bill over the finish line. Greitens vetoed that bill. While legislators could have considered other methods of funding, the cuts to the budget ultimately fall on the shoulders of the governor, and a significant number of people will lose funding for in-home care as a result of them. We talked to Carol Hudspeth, director of the Missouri Alliance for In-Home Care, to get a better understanding of who these 8,000 people are that would supposedly be kicked out of their homes. State funding allows senior citizens, veterans and people with disabilities to receive care in their own homes instead of being moved to a nursing home facility. Hudspeth said eligibility for in-home care is assessed on a points system. The number of points given to a Medicaid-eligible senior is based on things like the number of medications taken, a state-issued health assessment and other needs. Currently, those assessed at and above 21 points are eligible for state funding for care. But budget cuts mean that now only those assessed at and above 24 points are eligible. When we reached out to Quade and Merideth about where they found the 8,000 figure, they directed us to several different sources, but those sources ultimately pointed us back to the Department of Health and Senior Services. Sara O’Connor, chief public information officer at the Department of Health and Senior Services, said people are rated on a scale with intervals of three, which means no one can be assessed at 22 or 23 points. The exact number of people currently assessed at 21 points, and effectively the amount of people currently eligible for funding that won’t be once these changes go into effect, is 7,913, according to the department. That’s pretty close to 8,000, but that’s 8,000 people losing state funding, not 8,000 people losing their homes.  When a senior is assessed by the state as being eligible for assistance with care, families can opt for a variety of ways to obtain it. Hudspeth said some families move loved ones into assisted care facilities, but others hire in-home care providers who help, often on an hourly basis, with cooking, cleaning and bathing. When cuts go into effect, certain seniors, veterans and people with disabilities will lose the funds to hire in-home care providers, and Hudspeth said that means they will also lose funding to receive care at nursing homes or assisted-care facilities. When these individuals are assessed as to whether they are eligible for state funding, that assessment applies to both in-home care and nursing home care. So when funding is cut, they may only get care at the hospital in emergent situations. There are cases when these seniors, veterans and people with disabilities were initially assessed that they opted for their state-funded care providers to be family members. Though spouses are not eligible to receive state funding, children and other family members can be paid by the state to provide care. In fact, Hudspeth said that is a ""very common"" arrangement. In cases like this, it is likely some families would be able to continue to care for the senior in their home without the funding. Other community organizations also make that kind of care possible. The point is, without funding, vulnerable seniors, veterans and people with disabilities will certainly have to make adjustments that might put significant strain on families. Those adjustments don’t necessarily dictate loss of home. Quade and Merideth said that the governor’s cuts would cause 8,000 people to lose their homes. Greitens proposed the original budget cuts to in-home care and nursing home services for qualified seniors, veterans and people with disabilities. Legislators tried to come up with another way to fund these services, but Greitens vetoed that bill. The numbers suggest that just about 8,000 people will lose their funding when the budget cuts go into effect, but that doesn’t mean these people will lose their homes. These seniors, veterans and people with disabilities will lose the funding for both in-home care and nursing home services. But in some cases, they may employ other mechanisms to receive care, or depend more heavily on family-provided care that is not funded by the state. We rate this claim Mostly False. CORRECTION, Sept. 13, 2017: This article has been changed to reflect that when seniors, veterans and people with disabilities lose funding for in-home care, they also lose funding to go to a nursing home (or state-assisted living facilities) to receive care. An earlier version had said that the affected group would be forced to move into state-assisted living facilities.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE48E40>],/factchecks/2017/sep/10/crystal-quade/claim-about-home-care-cuts-mostly-false/

Greitens' claim of improving business climate Half True
","Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens recently announced the launch of a new website aimed at cutting the red tape that he believes is negatively impacting Missouri businesses. This is but one of the initiatives Greitens has taken to grow business in Missouri. In a Facebook Live Q&A (at the 4:48 mark) on Aug. 23, 2017, Greitens shared that Missouri’s economy is on the rise, thanks to his work on cutting regulations. ""Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places … in the rankings of the best states to do business,"" Greitens said in the Facebook Live video. Parker Briden, Greitens’ press secretary, said the governor was citing CNBC’s annual list of America’s Top States for Business, which was published July 11. Missouri moved up nine spaces in 2017, from 31 to 22. Among other lists regarding the best states to do business is Forbes and Chief Executive, both placing Missouri at 25, falling within the range calculated by CNBC for its 2016 and 2017 lists. Five other lists also saw an increase in ranking for Missouri. Another site worth noting is Site Selection, which does not update its ranking until later this year. This could impact how progress is ultimately seen for states like Missouri. While consistent in nature, experts point out that compiling these rankings takes time, indicating that Greitens‘ ""mission to turn Missouri around,"" as his campaign website states, might not truly be all his doing. ""Much, if not most, of the data that goes into this ranking was collected more than six months ago. Thus, it may be a little premature to take credit for these changes,"" said Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. While these lists can garner a lot of media attention, they should be viewed cautiously. ""The issue of ranking states as ‘best for business’ makes for interesting reading, but I expect most serious economists would be skeptical of any one approach,"" said Lee McPheters, an economist at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. CNBC’s analysis compares states among 66 factors across 10 categories. The study takes into account what each state deems the most important to its business environment by analyzing each state’s economic development marketing materials. The 10 categories are workforce, infrastructure, cost of doing business, economy, quality of life, technology and innovation, education, business friendliness, access to capital and cost of living. Each category comes with individual point weights. The rankings are based mainly on publicly available sources from federal databases. Methodologies vary across different business surveys. ""There are many of these studies with varying methodology and there is not usually a lot of solid economic research to back up most of them,"" McPheters said. McPheters points out that, in order to see progress for a state, the numbers do not necessarily need to match up, but there must be a consistent improvement among the differing lists. Greitens, talking on Facebook Live about his first six months as Missouri governor, said, ""Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places … in the rankings of the best states to do business."" Greitens credited this change to his cutting regulations, which he said is prompting a rise in the state’s economy. CNBC moved Missouri up nine spots on its annual America’s Top States for Business list. That’s only one ranking, among many, that can be considered, and it’s impossible to say that its methodology is perfect. Experts suggest that, while the methodologies of these lists vary significantly, it might be better to derive a decision if Missouri’s ranking has increased on all of them, which is true among five other lists. However, experts said it is premature for Greitens to assume credit for the improvement in rankings. Greitens is partially accurate.

"['Immigration', 'New York', 'Louise Slaughter']","
Will Trump's decision on DACA hurt New York's economy?
","Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-Fairport, says ending an Obama immigration policy that protects children of undocumented immigrants from deportation would damage the economy. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will expire in two years after President Trump rescinded the policy earlier this month. Almost 800,000 people benefit from the program. More than 41,000 of those recipients are in New York state, the fourth most of any state. Slaughter claimed in a tweet that ending DACA would be bad for business. ""#POTUS’ decision will harm our economy and endanger the future of thousands of Americans,"" Slaughter tweeted. DACA allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before their 16th birthday to legally remain in the country for at least two years. They can apply to renew their status after those two years. DACA recipients have many of the same obligations as permanent U.S. residents, like paying income tax. But will ending DACA be bad for the economy? Origin of the data Slaughter's claim comes from a recent report by the Center of American Progress, a left-leaning policy research organization. It estimated the U.S. would lose $460.3 billion over a decade if working DACA recipients were deported. New York state would lose $2.6 billion each year. ""We're saying this is what would be taken away if these DACA recipients were taken out of the workforce,"" said Philip Wolgin, managing director for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress. The organization based its figure on a 2016 report from two economics professors at Queens College. The professors predicted the U.S. would lose $4.7 trillion in gross domestic product by 2026 if all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country were deported. Analysts from the Center for American Progress narrowed that finding to immigrants in the labor force protected under DACA. ""We looked at how many unauthorized workers there were and what the impact was of losing them,"" said Silva Mathema, a senior policy analyst at the Center for American Progress. ""We take that and we apply it to looking at the DACA workers."" The analysts applied the same logic to each state, with a few caveats. The analysts assumed the labor characteristics of the DACA workforce were the same as other undocumented workers. The data applies only to DACA recipients who are employed, which the analysts estimated to be about 87 percent in each state. Other research Researchers on the other side of the political spectrum agree ending DACA would harm the country’s economy, but they dispute the amount. The Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy group, estimated the national economy would lose $283 billion over the next decade if all DACA recipients were deported. New York alone would lose more than $49.4 billion in that time - more than $5 billion a year. ""The actual number may vary but all of the estimates find that DACA will shrink GDP,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute. ""The magnitude of GDP loss is in doubt but there is no doubt that GDP will shrink once DACA starts to expire."" Where's that money coming from? A small part of the lost economic contribution is tax receipts. Undocumented immigrants eligible for DACA contribute more than $2 billion in state and local taxes each year, according to research from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. More than $140 million comes from DACA eligible immigrants in New York state. The bigger part is that DACA allows immigrants to enter the labor force without restrictions, creating a domino effect that’s good for business. ""When you have people working it helps the larger economic activity of the area,"" Wolgin said. ""When there’s a bigger supply of immigrants, businesses ramp up their business and their hiring."" At the same time, these immigrants are not eligible for most public benefits, like Medicaid or food stamps. Our ruling Slaughter said ending DACA would harm the economy. Researchers dispute the amount but confirm Slaughter’s claim that deporting DACA recipients would do more harm than good for the economy.

U.S. is the least socially and economically mobile in developed world, says Jeb Bush
","Gov. Jeb Bush may or may not run for president in 2016, but he was certainly active in the 2014 elections. Not only did he campaign for other candidates, but he was doing fundraising for his Foundation for Excellence in Education. An October mailer he signed focused on the economy, a top concern for voters. ""Americans could always count on hard work leading to higher incomes and improved lives. The American dream was real and within reach,"" Bush said in the letter. ""But today, among the developed nations, we are the least economically and socially mobile country in the world."" Bush goes on to say fixing an ailing education system is key to turning things around for children and the country. There’s no question times have been tough the last decade or so, but is the American dream really that unattainable? We decided to work really hard to improve our lives by finding out the answer. American exceptionalism  First of all, we should point out that while social mobility and economic mobility are technically two different things, Bush is looking at them under the same umbrella -- a person’s ability to better their circumstances as measured by income. So that’s how we’ll look at them, too. His foundation didn’t have to dig deep to find experts who claimed the United States is lagging behind its global peers. They sent several articles and reports they said informed the claim, so we examined those. We’re not going to sugarcoat it for you, folks, because there’s plenty of evidence Bush’s assertion is on the money (so to speak). A 2006 study led by a Swedish economist compared earning potential across generations among the United States, the United Kingdom and Nordic countries. It determined that American men raised in the bottom fifth of family incomes had a 42 percent chance of staying there, considerably higher than the other countries (Britain was next at 30 percent). Only 8 percent rose to the top fifth in the U.S., the lowest in the study. In countries like Finland, Denmark and Sweden, that number is closer to 15 percent, almost twice as much as in America. University of Ottawa economist Miles Corak in 2006 reviewed several studies about generational income mobility -- that is, whether you will make more or less money depending on how much your parents made. Again, the United States came up last. ""The United States, the United Kingdom, and to a slightly lesser extent France, stand out as being the least mobile societies, with 40 to 50 percent of fathers’ earnings advantage being passed on to sons,"" Corak wrote. ""At the other extreme are Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Canada with about 15 to 20 percent of earnings advantage passed across generations, and in an intermediate position Germany and Sweden with about 30 percent."" There is some debate about whether generational income mobility is a proper measure of mobility, especially because social structures and salary trends vary from country to country, but it does look as if the States aren’t as mobile as they once were. A Brookings Institution study from 2007 found that only 6 percent of American children born at the bottom of the income ladder moved to the top. Almost half of kids born in the bottom fifth of family income didn’t move up, while 39 percent in the top fifth stayed at the top. A third of kids moved up in brackets, sure, but another third moved down. The Economic Mobility Project of the Pew Charitable Trusts found similar numbers in 2009, widening the field a bit: 62 percent growing up in the top fifth stayed in the top two fifths, while 65 percent raised in the bottom fifth stayed in the bottom two fifths. These numbers showed things have gotten worse in recent years for Americans trying to move up in the world. Essentially, if you were born to a richer family, you had a good chance of staying there. If you were born into a poorer family, good luck. That trend is much more defined in America than it is in other countries. Wait, it gets worse Now let’s remember Bush wrote ""among the developed nations."" All the things we’ve looked at so far have stuck to European countries and Canada. But that’s okay, because University of Wisconsin economist Timothy Smeeding told us we can say plenty more countries beat us, too. He pointed us to the Great Gatsby Curve, a concept championed in 2012 by former chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton. The curve, named after the 1925 F. Scott Fitzgerald novel about class-hopping romantic Jay Gatsby, used data from Canadian economist Corak to determine mobility in terms of ""intergenerational income elasticity"" against several nations’ inequality by income distribution, called the Gini coefficient. The curve usually includes 23 countries, most of which are Western, and shows the United States lags behind other developed countries like Italy, Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand. Countries considered even less mobile than America include China, Brazil, Argentina and Chile. ""Amongst the rich countries, Bush is right,"" Smeeding told PolitiFact Florida. ""There are no rich countries, save tiny Singapore, whom lie to the right of the USA."" With that data in mind, it’s hard to find fault with Bush’s argument, according to Isabel Sawhill, co-director of the Center on Children and Families and the Budgeting for National Priorities Project at Brookings. ""It's a bit over the top but consistent with much of the evidence,"" she said. Our ruling Bush said ""among the developed nations, we are the least economically and socially mobile country in the world."" His Foundation for Excellence in Education sent us a few stories backing up the claim on a broad level. We found even more data suggesting that yes, America does lag behind most every developed country in terms of being able to move from the bottom rungs of the income ladder to the top. Experts we talked to said it was a fair claim, although we must note there is some disagreement on how mobility is measured and minor differences among studies.

Delia Garza says Austin residents of Del Valle must drive to Bastrop for closest grocery
","Delia Garza, newly elected to the Austin City Council, said during her campaign that Austinites on the city’s southeastern fringe have to leave town and drive to the next county to find the closest grocery store. Garza, who won the District 2 seat representing Southeast Austin, told the Austin American-Statesman for an October 2014 news story that some communities in Southeast Austin lack basic modern amenities. ""Families in Del Valle, who are city of Austin residents, have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store,"" Garza said. Del Valle is an unincorporated community that sits on land granted to Mexican nobleman Santiago del Valle in the early 1800s. It has no local government of its own and no official boundaries. But Austin has annexed portions, including the site of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (which was founded as Del Valle Army AIr Base in 1942).  The site of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport was annexed by the City of Austin in 1990. After that, most recently in 2013, the city added more Del Valle territory to the east. (Map excerpted from City of Austin map of Austin City Council districts.) According to Google Maps, parts of Del Valle annexed into Austin are 8 to 13 miles southeast of downtown Austin and 15 to 20 miles from Bastrop to the east. So, is Garza right that Del Valle Austinites are closer to a grocery store in Bastrop than a store in Austin? Not so, we found. Some small Del Valle stores offer produce and perishable groceries. Besides, the nearest full-scale supermarket sits 10 miles away in Austin while the closest Bastrop supermarket is more distant. Garza’s backup Garza, asked the basis of her claim, said she learned about local difficulties reaching a major grocery at a September 2014 meeting in the office of Margaret Gomez, who represents the county’s southeastern Precinct 4 on the Travis County Commissioners Court. By phone, Gomez told us Del Valle residents have to drive 20 miles to the nearest grocery store in Austin or Bastrop. She also called the Del Valle area a ""food desert.""  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a food desert exists if at least 500 low-income city residents live over a mile from a supermarket or if at least 500 rural residents live over 10 miles from one. According to Gomez and Garza, the absence of a grocery store in the area has long bothered residents. According to a November 2010 Statesman news story, Del Valle activist Patricia King collected over 1,300 signatures on a petition to bring a big grocery to Del Valle. The story described King driving to a Bastrop H-E-B for groceries every two weeks. By phone, H-E-B spokeswoman Leslie Sweet told us the company has long received requests for a Del Valle store as it does for stores all over Texas. Sweet said H-E-B leaders consider population and density important criteria when deciding where to build. Checking mileage, talking to residents We were ready to check the distance from the part of easternmost Del Valle also in Austin -- hence, still in council District 2 -- to groceries in Austin and Bastrop, following up with a Del Valle field trip. Using Google Maps, we found that the closest Bastrop H-E-B, on Hasler Blvd. is about 20 miles away while the closest Austin H-E-B, on East Riverside Drive, is less than 10 miles away. Also, the Austin H-E-B on East Seventh Street is about 10 miles from Austin’s most distant Del Valle neighborhood and an Austin Walmart on Slaughter Lane is just over 16 miles away. A Bastrop Walmart is 20 miles away. In our trip to Del Valle, we paused first in Oak Ranch, a three-year-old approximately 350-resident neighborhood near the city limit, built on lands the city annexed in 2003 and 2006. Judy Lollich, Oak Ranch’s community manager,  called the lack of a nearby supermarket the neighborhood’s biggest problem and, she estimated, about half of Oak Ranch’s residents, particularly the elderly, buy groceries in Bastrop to avoid Austin’s traffic. Despite the shorter distance to the Riverside H-E-B, she said, that trip can take as long as the one to Bastrop. ""Sometimes with (Texas) 71 traffic, going to get an emergency food becomes over an hour’s ordeal,"" Lollich said. A couple Oak Ranch residents told us they occasionally shop in Bastrop to avoid Austin traffic. Other residents told us they bought groceries at the Texaco Breadbasket near Pearce Lane and Ross Road, a quarter mile from Oak Ranch. We parked at the Texaco to talk to customers. Twelve of 13 queried shoppers (none living in the Austin part of Del Valle) said easy access to groceries is a local problem. Four shoppers reported buying groceries occasionally in Bastrop or knowing someone who did.

Our Ruling Garza said Del Valle families who live within Austin’s city limits ""have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store."" It may be more stressful to travel to Austin than Bastrop to shop and we can see how the lack of a nearby big grocery is distressing. However, several Austin grocery stores are closer -- by about 10 miles -- than the nearest equivalent Bastrop grocery. This fact makes what Garza said False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Does raising the minimum wage always result in job growth?
","Raising the federal minimum wage is a high priority for President Barack Obama, but the issue is mired in debate over whether or not raising the minimum wage would kill jobs. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, and the White House and some congressional Democrats want to bump it up to $10.10 an hour. As of December, a majority of Americans support a raise. On Election Day, voters in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota approved state-level increases to minimum wages. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., wants to see the minimum wage increased, and he defended the idea in an interview on Fox News Sunday Nov. 2, 2014. ""Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs, not a loss of jobs,"" Cardin said. The effect of minimum wage increases on job growth is at the core of this debate, so we wondered if Cardin’s claim was accurate. As you’ll see, the data is inconclusive, and there isn’t an expert consensus -- even among leading economists. Some data Because Cardin was talking about congressional action, we’re going to focus on federal minimum wage increases and nationwide job growth. We asked Cardin’s staff and some economists, and we did some digging around, but there doesn’t seem to be any published research that specifically answers the question: Was there job growth every year that Congress increased the federal minimum wage? (There’s plenty of research analyzing individual years, states or industries.) So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For every year Congress increased the minimum wage since 1978, we looked at how much employment grew or shrank a year after the new wage went into effect. (The first federal minimum wage went into effect in 1938, but it was not consistent across all industries until 1978.) We know this measure doesn’t account for other economic factors or state-level minimum wage increases. But we wanted to look at Cardin’s claim as literally as possible before turning to the larger debate. Below is a chart showing the years that Congress raised the minimum wage, employment the month that the change went into effect, and employment one year later, as well as the number of months that saw job growth. Year Wage ($) Employment - effective date (thousands) Employment - year later (thousands) Months of job growth Overall growth? 1978 2.65 84,595 88,810 12 Yes 1979 2.90 88,810 90,802 11 Yes 1980 3.10 90,802 91,037 8 Yes 1981 3.35 91,037 90,567 6 No 1990 3.80 109,688 108,367 2 No 1991 4.25 108,367 108,527 8 Yes 1996 4.75 120,677 123,945 11 Yes 1997 5.15 123,604 126,775 12 Yes 2007 5.85 137,984 137,421 5 No 2008 6.55 137,421 130,617 0 No 2009 7.25 130,617 130,395 4 No   So Cardin’s claim isn’t literally true. Increasing the federal minimum wage isn’t always followed by national job growth, or loss for that matter. There were 12 solid months of job growth following the 1978 increase, but 12 months of job loss following the 2008 increase. Also, these minimum wage changes did not happen in a vacuum. The last three federal minimum wage increases (2007, 2008 and 2009) were followed by significant job losses, but that was all taking place amidst the global financial crisis. And the minimum wage increases in the 1990s that preceded job growth happened during an economic boom. The debate So what do the experts say? Economists are split over what effect minimum wage has on job growth. There’s some research that shows raising the minimum wage negatively impacts job growth, and a lot that shows it has an insignificant effect. For an idea of how split economists are, look at this University of Chicago poll. Researchers asked about 40 leading economists, if raising the federal minimum wage would make it ""noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment."" In response, 34 percent agreed with the statement, 32 percent disagreed, and 24 percent were unsure. One of the most thorough reports on this debate comes out of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank. The report concludes that the ""bulk of the best statistical evidence"" shows little to no effect on employment when the minimum wage goes up. Those who say raising the minimum wage results in job loss generally follow the logic that when workers become more expensive, businesses will be less likely to hire them, and unemployment follows. David Neumark is an economist who has researched the issue and believes raising the minimum wage reduces employment for the lowest skilled workers. He noted, though, that the economy has grown over the long term, resulting in job growth in all wage and skill levels. ""The causes of growth, and the business cycle as well, completely swamp (increases to) the minimum wage,"" said Neumark, director of the Center for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California Irvine. There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to minimum wage increases. First, it doesn’t affect that many people. Only about 2.6 percent of all wage and salaried workers in the United States are paid at or below federal minimum wage, according to 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Additionally, 23 states (and some municipalities) have minimum wages higher than the federal minimum wage. There’s also the question of whether or not minimum wage has actually increased. Yes, the sticker price gets higher, but those increases have not kept up with inflation. Adjusted for 2013 dollars, the current minimum wage is a couple of bucks lower than it was in the late 1960s. This Pew Research chart compares minimum wage in 2013 dollars to their unadjusted levels.  All this means that small adjustments to the minimum wage have historically had little effect on employment, said David Gleicher, an economist at Adelphi University who has researched labor economics. ""Thus there has been virtually no significant increase in prices because of higher costs, nor a significant increase in unemployment,"" Gleicher said. ""At the same time, there has not been all that much of an increase in demand causing a significant increase in jobs."" Our ruling Cardin said, ""Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs, not a loss of jobs."" We looked at nationwide employment data in the years following minimum wage increases since 1978, and sometimes there was job growth, and sometimes there was job loss. Modern research tends to show that raising the minimum wage has little significant impact -- positive or negative -- on employment. Cardin got carried away when he said increasing the minimum wage is always followed by job growth. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAC9D840>],/factchecks/2014/nov/06/ben-cardin/does-raising-minimum-wage-result-job-growth/
"['Campaign Finance', 'PunditFact', 'Joe Scarborough']","
Which side spent more on the 2014 midterms, Democrats or Republicans?
","Rare was the recent commercial break not dominated by negative TV ads this cycle, a nasty byproduct of record piles of money thrown at competitive races across the country. The money poured in from candidates, parties, super PACs and ""dark money"" groups that don’t have to report their donors, and also individual donors like you (though your influence is waning, sorry). On the eve of Election Day, MSNBC Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough and guest economist Jeffrey Sachs argued about whether the left or the right had more dough in what Sachs called the ""billionaire’s election."" Most of the money will be well-disguised, with huge sums coming from private oil and gas companies, Sachs said, singling out millions of dollars in contributions from billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Scarborough was not having this argument. ""Jeff, you just can't say that,"" Scarborough said. ""You can look at the numbers, and the left and the right are both equal. It’s like the arms race between the Soviets and the Americans. It’s equal. You can say ‘big oil’ all you want to, that’s just not factually accurate."" Sachs replied that the Koch brothers alone have probably put $300 million into the election. Scarborough said, ""You always talk about oil and gas when in fact there are environmentalists on the left that are putting in millions and millions,"" a reference to liberal super PAC donor Tom Steyer. ""Add up all the money, right now, it’s about equal on both sides,"" Scarborough said. Though the back-and-forth came before the votes were counted, we think it’s worth revisiting as a last homage to all those TV ads. The basic question: Who spent more, the right or the left? Understanding the playing field The problem in declaring a winner in the spending race, and also in the argument between Scarborough and Sachs, is the American political system makes it difficult to ultimately calculate just who spent what, on what. That hurts Scarborough’s assertion that spending on the left and right in 2014 was equal, because the claim is largely rooted in conjecture. Moreover, what facts do exist tend to undercut Scarborough’s claim. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan Washington group whose job is to track political spending, estimates that candidates, parties, committees, outside groups and donors will spend at least $3.67 billion on the 2014 midterm elections, $40 million more than what was spent in 2010. According to the center, ""Team Red,"" code for Republican-aligned groups, will have spent about $1.75 billion across the country by the time all the bills are paid. ""Team Blue,"" Democratic-aligned groups, will spend $110 million less, about $1.64 billion. The remainder of the money comes from groups that wouldn’t fit into one box or the other. The difference between both sides is a significant chunk of change, but it’s not like ""the Republicans are wiping the floor with the Democrats,"" said center research director Sarah Bryner. Put another way, if spending were an election, Team Red is estimated to win the cycle 47.7 percent to 44.7 percent. Some of that difference is logical. The GOP is spending more on House races, for example, because it has more seats to protect, she said. One thing to know about the center’s estimate: It does not account for money toward ""issue advertisements"" that run earlier in the election cycle, do not ask the public to vote a particular way and do not have to be disclosed. While there’s no reliable accounting of this kind of undisclosed spending, Bryner said some of the largest donors in this area are Koch-related nonprofit groups, which would pad the conservative number even more than it is. Can’t count dark dollars So from what we can see, experts say Republican causes slightly outspent Democratic ones in 2014. But the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation says ""dark money"" is a big X-factor. Dark money is a post-Citizens United term for spending by groups that do not disclose donors, which include trade associations, unions and nonprofit social welfare organizations like the Koch brothers-founded Americans for Prosperity. Sunlight Foundation managing editor Kathy Kiely says untraceable dark money is a preferred tactic of conservatives, while Democrats tend to use traceable super PACs. Take Steyer, a liberal environmental activist who poured millions of dollars into the 2014 elections attempting to unseat Republicans including Florida Gov. Rick Scott. Steyer is the single biggest contributor to super PACs in 2014 at $73 million, Kiely said. The next biggest donor is Michael Bloomberg at $20 million, who also supported Democrats in 2014. Conservatives donated to super PACs as well, but not to the same degree. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson gave about $5 million, she said. ""But the question is has somebody like an Adelson completely stepped out, or is he merely giving in ways that we can’t see?"" Kiely said. While Steyer’s contributions are declared because he gave to super PACs, there’s not as much certainty on the other side of the ledger. The Sunlight Foundation has recorded about $140 million in dark money, some of which comes from business groups who want to keep donations private. These so-called dark money groups also tend to give more heavily to Republican candidates, which would hint that donors are also Republicans. It wasn’t until January 2014, for instance, that the Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics were able to use tax filings to detail more than $400 million in spending on the 2012 campaign by a web of 17 conservative groups spearheaded by the Koch brothers. MSNBC did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Scarborough and a guest tussled over spending in the 2014 midterms, with Scarborough saying the spending on both sides in 2014 is equal. The estimates we have say Republican-aligned groups spent more, though the estimates are somewhat close. But there is a lot of money that was spent that we cannot track.  Scarborough’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Ben Shapiro says a majority of Muslims are radicals
","The rise of the Islamic State group and its strategic use of grisly beheadings has stirred a heated debate in this country about the nature of Islam. Some critics say core Muslim beliefs invite violence. Defenders of religious tolerance say extremists represent only a tiny minority of Muslims. Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro jumped in to say the nature of Islam is irrelevant. More important, according to Shapiro, is what its followers believe, ""because that’s what they act upon."" Through this lens, Shapiro painted a disturbing picture of the religious wellspring for people who fly planes into towers and behead their prisoners. Shapiro is an editor-at-large with the conservative website Breitbart.com and cofounded a conservative media analysis group, TruthRevolt. In a video, Shapiro blended survey data and population statistics for 15 countries. A good example of his thesis about Islam is in the way he talked about Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation. ""It’s got almost 205 million Muslims,"" Shapiro said. ""According to one 2009 poll, it showed almost 50 percent of Indonesians support strict Sharia law, not just in Indonesia but in a lot of countries. And 70 percent blame the United States, Israel or somebody else for 9/11. You make that calculation, it’s about 143 million people who are radicalized. You scared yet? We’re just getting started."" To get to 143 million ""radicalized"" Muslims, Shapiro took the 70 percent of Indonesia’s Muslims who blamed someone other than al-Qaida for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Shapiro then made similar extrapolations using polling data for a number of other countries, often measuring support for Sharia law -- codes of behavior in Islam. Then Shapiro summed up and applied the percentage of ""radicalized Muslims"" from the 15 nations to a number of other Muslim-majority countries and, with 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, reached a shocking conclusion. ""We’re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth,"" Shapiro said. ""That’s not a minority. That’s now a majority."" Shapiro spoke with great self-assurance, but as we looked at his claim that most Muslims are radicals, we were left scratching our heads. In the first place, Shapiro consistently used the highest percentages available in the surveys to maximize the number of Muslims he could tag with the ""radical"" label. Secondly, he used a broad definition of radical. To choose one main example, there are many varieties of how people interpret Sharia law and support for it says little about a person’s specific beliefs. Other numbers tell a different story Shapiro cited the work of the Pew Research Center in some of his analysis and much of our work relies on the same source. We tried to reach Shapiro and were unsuccessful. In about half of the countries he assessed, Shapiro focused on support for Sharia law. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, ""Sharia guides all aspects of Muslim life, including daily routines, familial and religious obligations, and financial dealings."" It is a moral code that covers marriage, crime and business. Different branches of Islam use different versions of the law. Some elements are widely accepted, such as the immorality of fraud. But for countries and sects that follow the harshest versions in which thieves have their hands cut off and unfaithful women are stoned to death, the opposition from the West, and parts of the Muslim world as well, is strong and visceral. For Shapiro, support for any form of Sharia law means one thing -- the believer is a radical. Accordingly, Shapiro looks at a place like Pakistan and says that 76 percent of Muslims want Sharia law in all Muslim countries. Pakistan has 179 million Muslims, therefore, ""that is another 135.4 million radicals."" But looking at a 2013 Pew report on Muslims, we found that the picture is more complicated. Pew reported that 84 percent of Pakistani Muslims wanted Sharia law, but of those, nearly two-thirds said it should only apply to Muslims. Run those numbers through and you get about 54 million Muslims who think all Pakistanis should be subject to Sharia law. That’s about 60 percent fewer than Shapiro said. We are not saying that Pakistan has 54 million radical Muslims. Our point is that more detailed polling data changes the results a great deal. Shapiro chose one yardstick. Other analysts could with at least as much justification choose another. The impact of which question is used becomes even clearer if we look at support for suicide bombings against civilian targets. Shapiro said actual terrorists draw ""moral, financial and religious support from those who are not terrorists themselves."" Even if you believe Shapiro, it doesn’t mean that attitudes towards terrorism are irrelevant. Pew asked Muslims if they supported suicide bombings against civilians. In Pakistan, 13 percent of Muslims said such attacks in defense of Islam could often or sometimes be justified. If that’s your definition of radicals, then Pakistan has about 23 million of them. Hardly a small number, but it’s a far cry from the 135 million Shapiro counted. The following table shows how using reasonable alternative measures of radicalism, Shapiro’s majority can become a distinct minority. You can see how Shapiro reached his totals by watching the video.   Country Population (millions) Radical total (Shapiro, millions) Alternative pct. Alternative total (millions) Indonesia 205 143 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 14.4 Egypt 80 55.2 Pew: 29% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.2 Pakistan 179 135.4 Pew: 13% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.3 Bangladesh 149 121.9 Pew: 26% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 38.7 Nigeria 75.7 53.7 Pew: 22% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 16.7 Iran 74.8 62.1 ICP/Charney: 47% would abolish the morality police. 35.2 Turkey 74.7 23.9 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 11.2 Morocco 32.4 24.6 Pew: 9% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.9 Iraq 31.1 24.3 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.2 Afghanistan 24 24 Pew: 39% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 9.4 Jordan 6.4 3.8 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1 Palestinian areas 4.3 3.83 Pew: 40% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1.7 France 4.7 1.6 No alternate used 1.6 Great Britain 2.8 2.2 Manchester Policy: 2% expressed some support for terrorism. 0.06 United States 2.6 0.5 Pew: In 2009, 8% said suicide bombings could sometimes be justified. 0.2 Total 946.5 680.03 181.76 Percent of total 72% 19%   To be clear, we’re not saying there are 181 million radical Muslims. We’re simply saying by applying different but reasonable criteria to the same data, you can reach a vastly different result. Sharia ≠ radical     Given that Shapiro used support for Sharia law in 7 of the 15 countries as a marker for radicalism, we should note that the experts we reached urged a more cautious approach. Pew found that when you ask Muslims about specific elements in Sharia law, support shifts. According to James Bell, director of International Survey Research at Pew, many Muslims will say they want religious judges deciding family or property disputes. But ask them about corporal punishments for criminals or the death penalty for apostates, and support drops off considerably. ""The key takeaway is that Muslims differ in what they mean by Sharia and how they want it applied,"" Bell said. Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, a political and policy advocacy group for Arab Americans, said most Muslims don’t think about every element of sharia. ""It indicates a degree of nominal faithfulness,"" Zogby said. If I say I support the law in the abstract, it doesn’t commit me to supporting various and assorted aspects."" In two countries, Shapiro focused on support for honor killings. Zogby said that as cruel as honor killings are, they are not tied to beliefs that underlie beheadings and suicide bombings. ""One has nothing to do with the other,"" Zogby said. Maria Sobolewska, a lecturer in quantitative methods and politics at the University of Manchester, England, studied polls in that country in the wake of the 2005 bus and subway bombings. Sobolewska found enormous variation in Muslim responses depending on small changes in the wording of questions. ""What we receive as a true picture of what Muslims think is mostly an artifact of what they get asked,"" Sobolewska wrote. We should note that we found no solid estimate of the number of radical Muslims worldwide. For example, a 2014 report on jihadist terrorism from the Bipartisan Policy Center did not quantify the size of the jihadist population. Our ruling Shapiro said that a majority of Muslims are radicals. To make his numbers work, he had to cherry-pick certain results from public opinion surveys. Given the choice between two possible percentages, he chose the higher one. Shapiro also relied heavily on the idea that anyone who supported sharia law is a radical. Some of the best polling work shows that Muslim beliefs are much more nuanced. Some countries where high percentages of Muslims support Sharia law show low support for suicide attacks on civilians. Large fractions of Muslims that endorse sharia law do not want it imposed on others. The meaning of Sharia law varies from sect to sect and nation to nation. Shapiro’s definition of radical is so thin as to be practically meaningless and so too are the numbers he brings to bear. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB36E00>],/factchecks/2014/nov/05/ben-shapiro/shapiro-says-majority-muslims-are-radicals/
"['New Hampshire', 'Government Regulation', 'Taxes', 'Daily Caller']","
Jeanne Shaheen hit by last-minute attack over Lois Lerner controversy at IRS
","By the time the sun came up on Election Day, a charge against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen -- the New Hampshire Democrat in a nip-and-tuck race for another term -- had begun making the rounds on social media. The Daily Caller, a web-based publication aligned with conservatives, ran a story headlined, ""BOMBSHELL MEMO: Jeanne Shaheen Conspired With White House Insider On IRS Targeting Scandal."" The story was posted at 9:36 p.m. the night before the election. The story accuses Shaheen of being ""principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election."" The night before Election Day is an unusually late moment for a ""bombshell"" to emerge in a Senate contest. But readers asked PolitiFact to take a look, even if our analysis would be published well into Election Day. So we did. Early in the election cycle, New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said that Shaheen ""got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views."" In our fact-check published Oct. 23, 2013, we concluded that what Shaheen actually ""got behind"" was the DISCLOSE Act, which requires nonprofit groups to share information about their campaign contributions. We determined that it was a stretch to suggest that Shaheen favored going after citizens ""for their political views,"" so we rated Horn’s statement Mostly False. Tuesday’s story is a little different because it accuses Shaheen of being part of  a ""plot"" of harassment against conservative groups. As evidence the story cited ""letters exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller."" Those letters were the result of a Freedom of Information request that was fulfilled on Oct. 9, 2014, according to documents provided to PolitiFact New Hampshire. Of the nine pages of documents provided, five of them reprint letters from Shaheen and six other Democratic Senators to Douglas Shulman, Commissioner of the IRS, asking the IRS to investigate any nonprofits that are avoiding being taxed while they ""are focused on federal election activities."" The remaining four pages are responses to that request. The IRS was noncommittal in its responses to making any changes. ""To ensure that section 501(c)(4) organizations meet the requirements for tax exemption under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS has ongoing programs that review the activities of organizations seeking IRS recognition of tax exemption,"" wrote Steve T. Miller, Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement in his response dated April 26, 2012. He later added, ""The IRS is aware of the public interest in this issue. These regulations have been effect since 1959. We will consider proposed changes in this area as we work with the IRS Office of Chief Counsel and the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy."" The letters themselves are not secretive. The first, dated Feb. 16, 2012, was signed by Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). It has been publicly available for more than a year; Shaheen’s signature comes on the third page. The second letter, signed by the same seven senators and dated March 9, 2012, was even the subject of a press release by Schumer. What the letters say The letter dated Feb. 16, 2012, asks the IRS to review its oversight of 501(c)(4) organizations that get involved in politics. (The name refers to a section of the tax code.) The Internal Revenue Code grants tax-exempt status for nonprofit organizations that promote ""social welfare."" But Shaheen’s letter said some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves social welfare organizations while spending a majority of their money on influencing politics. The letter says the code specifies that social welfare ""does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for political office."" The letter first came to prominence in 2013 after publication of a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that concluded that the IRS had improperly targeted conservative groups. Some Republicans cited the letter as evidence that Democrats were responsible for such actions. Meanwhile, the letter to the IRS commissioner dated March 9, 2012, did encourage the IRS to change the way it handles nonprofit organizations that spend money on politics, suggesting three changes, including that the organizations document the exact percentage of their money that goes toward social welfare. We don’t see how these letters support the linchpins of the claim -- that Shaheen was ""involved in a plot,"" that this plot involved Lerner and other Obama appointees, or that the issue concerned a ""program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups."" Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines this type of ""plot"" as ""a secret plan for accomplishing a usually evil or unlawful end."" The letters were not secret, and, while we won’t take a position on whether their effort was ""evil,"" they were clear that they wanted the IRS to adhere to the law, not break it. In addition, there is no mention of Lois Lerner -- the central figure in the controversy -- and no obvious connection to any Obama political appointee other than Schulman, who was actually appointed by President George W. Bush in 2008. As for a ""program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups,"" the letters do not urge a partisan or ideological focus to the effort. They point to 501(c)(4) nonprofits generally, not conservative groups alone. The Daily Caller did not return our request for comment. Our ruling The Daily Caller charged that Shaheen ""was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election."" Shaheen and six other Democratic Senators did send letters broadly connected to the issue of scrutinizing the activities of nonprofit groups. Their concern was that some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves social welfare organizations while spending a majority of their money on influencing politics. The Daily Caller article amps up the innuendo beyond the evidence. The letters weren’t secret, they didn’t cite Lerner or other Obama appointees, and they didn’t single out conservative groups. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC81C0C0>],/factchecks/2014/nov/04/daily-caller/jeanne-shaheen-hit-last-minute-attack-over-lois-le/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Herman Cain']","
Herman Cain says more losing insurance through Obamacare than gaining it
","Herman Cain’s longshot 2012 Republican presidential bid may be long over, but he’s continued to opine on national affairs. Take, for example, his recent blog post titled, ""Nine facts Democrats don't want you to hear before you vote tomorrow."" The post, published Nov. 3, 2014, and forwarded to us by a reader, begins this way: ""As we all get ready to head to the polls tomorrow, Democrats want you focused on the Koch brothers (that evil, fang-toothed fictionalized version, not the real ones who are excellent and highly successful businessmen) and their ‘war on women’ crapola."" The post goes on to offer nine bullet-point items that ""Democrats do not want to talk about,"" including claims about the economy, home ownership, taxes, debt and foreign policy. On health care policy, Cain offers this: ""Obamacare is a failure! More people are losing their insurance than are becoming newly insured, and 51 percent of those enrolled in the exchanges say they will not re-up given the opportunity the next time around. Then there are the 29ers (people being limited to 29 hours a week because of Obamacare mandates) and the 49ers (not the San Francisco ones ... the businesses intentionally staying under 50 employees to avoid the coverage mandate). There are also thousands of doctors refusing patients with Obamacare coverage because they can’t cover their costs on the reimbursements, while thousands more doctors are retiring early."" That’s a lot to chew on, but we were especially interested in checking Cain’s claim that ""more people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured."" (An inquiry to Cain’s staff was not returned.) We will start off with a big caveat: The data available on this question is imperfect. For starters, the most historically credible, long-term statistics for health coverage and uninsurance -- the annual figures published by the U.S. Census Bureau -- do not include the big surge in insurance signups that occurred during the first quarter of 2014, which was the deadline for obtaining insurance for 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. What remains is data compiled by the private sector. However, the figures for new signups are somewhat piecemeal, with a less certain historical track record than the Census data. And the figures for cancellations are even fuzzier. That said, we’ll look at the consensus of data compiled by private-sector organizations. These have been calculated on a net basis -- the number of newly covered Americans minus the number of Americans newly lacking coverage. For Cain to be right, this number would have to be negative -- more losses than gains. Is it? The polling company Gallup has been studying uninsurance rates every quarter in a reasonably real-time fashion. In its most recent study, covering the third quarter of 2014, Gallup found that 13.4 percent of Americans lacked health insurance. That’s down significantly from its 18 percent rate in the third quarter of 2013, before the health care exchanges began operations. (As a reminder, insurance-coverage gains from the health care law stem from several sources, including people who signed up for plans on the exchanges, people who were newly able to sign up for Medicaid coverage in the states that allowed it, and young adults under age 26 who were allowed to remain on their parents’ plan.) These Gallup numbers shows a decline in uninsured Americans of 4.6 percentage points since the law took full effect -- the opposite of the direction Cain suggests. All told, between October 2013 and June 2014, Gallup found that 10.3 million nonelderly adults gained health insurance coverage. It’s possible that this number has grown since the data cut off in June 2014. Gallup’s finding tracks with what other sources have found. The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that, through June, 10.3 million adults gained coverage. Also through June, the Commonwealth Fund estimated the number at 9.5 million. And over the same period, the Urban Institute offered an estimate of 8 million. An earlier study -- through March -- by the RAND Corp. estimated a net gain of 9.3 million American adults with health insurance. This is a high degree of similarity between five separate studies, pointing to a net increase of 9 million to 10 million through June. And there’s reason to believe that number could be higher. These estimates do not include children under 18, and it’s possible that additional Americans have gained insurance in the months since June. It’s certainly possible that some of the other elements of Obamacare, including employer mandates, will lead to further losses of coverage once they take effect. (The administration has delayed the start of employer contribution requirements.) And the administrative hassle of losing one’s former plan is undeniably a hassle, even if one ends up with a different plan later. But as of now, there isn’t any evidence to back up Cain’s claim that more people are actually losing coverage than gaining. Our ruling Cain said that ""more people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured."" While it’s reasonable to ask questions about the limitations of the available data, there is wide consensus from five private-sector organizations that roughly 10 million more Americans are insured today than were before the law began operations in late 2013.

State Republican Party: 25,000 new businesses under Scott Walker
","The Republican Party of Wisconsin may have committed a Freudian slip in its Oct. 29, 2014 news release touting Gov. Scott Walker’s accomplishments. ""Over 110,000 new jobs and 25,0000 businesses have been created since Walker took office,"" the release originally said. We noted the extra zero on that second figure, an echo perhaps of Walker’s promise that Wisconsin would create 250,000 private-sector jobs on his watch. (He will fall far short and we have rated it Promise Broken). But what really got our attention was the corrected version of the release, which says 25,000 new businesses have sprung up since Walker took office in January 2011. It’s a nice round number, and a sharp contrast to what the GOP said in an earlier news release -- that 27,000 businesses ""fled the state"" due to the policies of former Gov. Jim Doyle and Mary Burke, the former state Commerce secretary trying to unseat Walker in the Nov. 4 governor’s race. We’ve heard the 25,000 new businesses claim before -- Walker’s campaign uses it, pointing to figures published by a state agency, the Department of Financial Institutions. The agency reports the number of registered ""business entities"" in Wisconsin, including filings by newly formed business corporations, non-stock nonprofit corporations, cooperatives, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and partnerships, common law trusts, veterans organizations and certain religious corporations. The numbers rise and fall as some entities fall away and others are created, giving what economists say is a rough sense of economic activity. The net gain in the number of active entities during Walker’s three-plus years is 24,947, or a 7 percent increase. (There were 389,316 business entities registered as of Sept. 30, 2014). So that’s the 25,000 figure in the GOP claim. That’s far from the end of the story. That number turns out, in many cases, to have very little to do with actual operating businesses and job creation. We’ve closely examined this issue before. In May 2014, we reported that the count of newly registered ""business entities"" includes not only new ventures that bring new jobs, but thousands with no workers on the payroll at all -- and little if any prospect of hires to come. That analysis by PolitiFact Wisconsin found that the count includes: -- Thousands of limited-liability companies set up by real-estate investors solely to hold ownership of property or properties. Even investors as far away as Australia are on the list because they bought Wisconsin rental properties. -- Out-of-state firms that registered in Wisconsin because they may want to do work here. -- Hundreds of nonprofit organizations, often volunteer-run, including Scout troops, condo associations, youth sports leagues, volunteer fire departments, historical societies, ""friends"" fundraising groups, scholarship funds and many more. -- Startups that are just getting organized and not yet able to pay employees. As PolitiFact Wisconsin has noted several times in evaluating Walker’s promise to create 10,000 new businesses in his term, business experts caution that many LLCs are set up for tax and liability purposes and employ no one. To judge Walker’s final progress on his new business promise, we will also consider a second measure related to business formations -- the number of new locations, or ""business establishments,"" set up by companies. We reported in September that the state had added 6,657 such establishments through March 2014. To be sure, there are many job-producing startups among the thousands of entities cited by the GOP. But it’s impossible to say, without calling every person registering a new firm, exactly how many fit in that category. It is easy, however, to say the GOP claim, which ignores the thousands of non-operating businesses in the mix, is far off the mark. At the same time, the party’s characterization of a net loss of business entity filings during the Doyle years as firms having ""fled the state"" is off base. The drop reflected the slowdown in business activity during the Great Recession, but there is no official tally of how many active employers shut down or picked up and left. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP claimed that ""25,000 businesses have been created since Walker took office."" There’s an element of truth: that’s the number of business ""entities"" that were created. But portraying these registrations as businesses in the context of job creation is a major stretch because many are just corporate shells, non profit organizations, reconstituted versions of existing businesses and out-of-state firms. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEE4480>],/factchecks/2014/nov/03/republican-party-wisconsin/state-republican-party-25000-new-businesses-under-/

Trammell: Brat says seniors should get back what only what they've paid into Social Security
","Democratic Congressional candidate Jack Trammell says David Brat, his GOP opponent, is proposing to cut Social Security benefits. ""David said the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more,"" Trammell says in a TV ad. Trammell and Brat are facing off for the 7th Congressional District seat, previously held by Eric Cantor. Libertarian James Carr is also in the race. With the election looming, we thought Trammell’s statement was worth reviewing. When we asked for proof that Brat made the statement, Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for Trammell, pointed us to a May video of Brat addressing the Mechanicsville Tea Party. Brat said Social Security and other programs need big cuts: ""And it’s not just little marginal changes, right, in order to avoid those insolvency issues with Medicare and Social Security, you’re going to have to do some major cuts,"" Brat told the crowd. ""And so that’s what politicians aren’t willing to say, right? We’re going to have to take some bad medicine coming up. And so we’re going to at least have to just balance the budget."" Brat went on to say people will have to work longer before receiving benefits from the major federal entitlement programs. ""And then you’re going to have to increase the working age, right? Social Security and Medicare and these weren’t intended to be retirement programs. These were intended to be disaster prevention for seniors, and I’m all for that. Right? But it’s in the worst case scenario. It’s not been 65, get to retirement – the average death age back then was 65, so it broke even. Now the average death age is 80. Right? So can you pay everyone in the country a huge chunk of money for 15 additional years? No. That’s why it’s insolvent. That’s the beginning."" We also found a video of Brat answering questions after a speech at Life Church in Mechanicsville in April. A man in the audience noted the Social Security Disability Trust Fund is expected to be depleted in 2016 if Congress doesn’t take steps to foster it, and he asked Brat what his response would be if benefits were cut. Brat: My general answer is we have to do what’s fair. Right? And so, you put together a graph or a chart and you go out to the American people and you go to the podium and you say, ‘This is what you put in, on average. This is what you get out, on average.’ Currently, seniors are getting about $3 out of all of the programs for every $1 they put in. So, in general, I think you’ve got to go to the American people and just be honest with them and say, ""Here’s what fairness would look like."" So maybe in the next 10 years, we have to grandfather some folks in, but basically we’re going to move in a direct line toward fairness and we have to live within our means. Questioner: Fairness in that sense is defined as you get what is coming in and no more? Brat: Right. That’s what I’m aiming at. The questioner noted that would lead to benefits cuts in the disability program he cited. Brat: Right and I wouldn’t want that to impact people without it being announced. But that’s the downside of -- it’s not my fault that we’re there, right? It’s the current folks’ fault that we’re there, so my answer is I would never have let us get into that place in the first place. So that’s – what would you do – when Congress is about to hit a brick wall, what would you do? I mean, hit the brakes or something. On Brat’s basic point, the 2014 Social Security trustees’ report says that the retirement piece of the program now uses more than just the designated tax income and will run out of reserves to redeem and pay for the entire entitlement in 2033. Flowers, Trammell’s spokeswoman, said Brat’s position has changed over time as he moderated his message for the general election. But he certainly showed support for grandfathering in the April talk and reiterated it in a June interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""We must keep our promise to seniors who are near retirement or are already receiving benefits,"" Brat told the Times-Dispatch Editorial Board. ""Virginians who entrusted their hard-earned money to the Social Security trust fund must receive the benefits to which they are entitled. For younger Virginians, entitlement reform is critical in order to ensure the solvency of Medicare and Social Security."" In a recent article, Brat said he supported raising the retirement age by five years. Trammell said he would be willing to raise it by two years. Here’s what Gottstein told us Brat supports: A grandfather clause for those 10 years or less from retirement; A gradual increase in the eligibility age for receiving benefits for those farther than 10 years from retirement; Emphasis on stopping and punishing fraud; Reduced federal spending across the board. ""When Dr. Brat talks about fairness, he's talking about being fair to existing generations AND to future generations,"" Gottstein said in an email. ""’Grandfathering’ is one way to be fair to our seniors and the nearly-retired. But he also talks about how we have to fairly treat current workers who are contributing to the system by ensuring that the money THEY invest is there for their retirement."" Our ruling Trammell says Brat said ""the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more."" Trammell tries a typical scare tactic -- attacking a Republican as threatening to cut seniors’ benefits. But his campaign didn’t provide examples of Brat making that actual claim, and Brat’s support of the idea of grandfathering today’s seniors -- and those retiring within 10 years -- would protect them. Brat opened the door to some speculation about his views by making open-ended statements about reforming Social Security during the GOP primary this spring. But Trammell has gone overboard in interpreting them and putting words in Brat’s mouth. We rate Trammell’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE382C0>],/factchecks/2014/nov/02/jack-trammell/trammell-brat-says-seniors-should-get-back-what-on/

Last time GOP defeated two Senate incumbent Democrats? Try 1980
","For the past couple decades, Republicans have struggled to oust Democratic senators, though that trend is expected to change Tuesday. Many forecasters have Republicans taking up to eight Democratic Senate seats -- beating incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska and Colorado. If this scenario pans out, Republicans will gain control of the Senate, and they will have overcome a historical challenge. ""The last time we beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980,"" said Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer on CNN’s State of the Union on Nov. 2. It’s commonly understood that incumbent candidates have an advantage over their challengers for many reasons including visibility, accomplishments in the position, and being a high-quality candidate (why they were elected in the first place). But have Republican challengers really struggled so much to take Democratic seats? We looked at past Senate election results and found that Republicans have had some successful gains in the past 35 years, but many of those wins were in races for an open seat when a Democratic senator was retiring. In 1980, Republicans took 12 Democrat Senate seats (nine incumbents lost in the general election, while three lost in their primaries.). Spicer is correct to say they haven’t beat more than two incumbents since then. We found a great chart showing Senate seat turnover for the past half-century in the Brookings Institution’s most recent ""Vital Statistics on Congress"" report. (h/t to Sabato’s Crystal Ball.) The arrows show when a Democratic (D) seat switched to a Republican (R) seat and vice versa.       From 1981 on, Republicans have beaten only 12 incumbent Democrats for Senate seats. Republicans’ biggest Senate gains in that time frame all involve taking open seats -- such as 1994, 2004 and 2010, when they gained four, five and six open seats, respectively. Senate Democrats haven’t had quite the same struggle against Republican incumbents in recent years. Since 1981, they’ve beaten 37 incumbents total, compared to Republicans’ 12. So if Republicans are able to beat more than two incumbent Democratic senators Tuesday, it would be a clear break with the recent past.  If Republicans take seven seats, both beating incumbents and taking open seats (which the New York Times’ election model has as the most likely outcome), that will be their second-biggest overall gain since 1980. In 1994, Republicans won eight Senate seats -- beating two incumbents and taking six open seats. What made 1980 so special? In the same election, former President Ronald Reagan beat incumbent Democrat President Jimmy Carter. Carter was fast falling out of favor with voters, considering the Iran hostage crisis, a floundering economy and other issues. On top of Carter’s struggles, there was a major rift between Southern and Northern Democrats. It was an extraordinary political environment that allowed Republicans to sweep the congressional elections.   Compare that to this year’s Senate elections where, although there is no presidential election, Republicans are using President Barack Obama’s relatively low popularity to their advantage in races against incumbent Democrats.   Our ruling Spicer said the last time Republican Senate candidates ""beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980."" Republicans kicked a total of 9 incumbent Democrats out of office in 1980 (another three lost in a primary). Since then, Republicans have turned two or fewer seats each election. Most of their success has been in winning formerly Democratic open seats.

Last time Kansans elected someone other than a Republican to the Senate? Try 1932
","With results just hours away in the country’s closest political races, Sunday morning pundits made the case for the best and worst candidates of the 2014 midterm elections. One man frequently mentioned for the latter unenviable distinction is U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican locked in an unexpectedly tight race against independent Greg Orman. Roberts has struggled despite his status as an incumbent in a super conservative state, a headache of a situation for Republicans who want to flip control of the Senate. ""There’s a clear worst candidate this year. It’s Pat Roberts,"" ABC White House correspondent Jonathan Karl said on This Week. ""I mean, Kansas has not elected somebody other than a Republican since before The Wizard of Oz hit the movie theaters."" The classic film that opens with a tornado sweeping through a Kansas farm made its debut 75 years ago in 1939. Has it really been that long since Kansas elected someone who wasn’t a Republican to the U.S. Senate? Actually, it’s been longer. Eighty-two years, to be exact. The last Democratic senator the state sent to Washington was George McGill, a lawyer from Wichita who served from 1930-39. After winning a 1932 election, McGill lost his 1938 re-election bid. The only other Democratic senators from Kansas were John Martin, who filled out the remainder of a deceased senator’s term from 1893-95, and William Howard Thompson, who served from 1913-19, according to the Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress. Two Kansas senators served as members of the Populist Party, though both were elected at the turn of the century well before The Wizard of Oz movie release. The other 28 senators were all Republicans, including Roberts, who won his first election to Congress in 1981 and his first U.S. Senate race in 1996. For an incumbent such as Roberts to be in such a vulnerable position is highly unusual, said Burdett Loomis, professor of political science at the University of Kansas. Winning a seat in the U.S. Senate from Kansas has been mostly very easy for Republicans. The GOP has long dominated all layers of Kansas politics, with the state last voting for a Democratic candidate for president in 1964. (A notable recent exception is when Kathleen Sebelius won the governor's race as a Democrat in 2002 and 2006.) ""In that context, it’s just very weird because this is about as favorable an environment for a Republican as you can get,"" Loomis said, ""and it’s also supposed to be a good year for Republicans across the country."" Roberts was weakened early in his re-election bid by a New York Times report that revealed he does not have a home of his own in Kansas. He survived his primary despite tea party criticisms that he is a Washington insider. His attacks against Orman have largely failed and he has focused more on criticizing President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid than documenting his own achievements, Loomis said. ""I think Roberts could have more easily won a conventional race,"" Loomis said. ""Running against an independent, it really is harder."" Even though Kansas is usually a reliably conservative state, the state’s share of residents who identify as moderates (36 percent) is about the same as those who say they are conservative at 38 percent, according to a Gallup analysis. This could be one reason Orman is doing well in pre-election polls. Also, according to Gallup, Kansas is on the low end of the 10 reddest states in terms of residents who describe their political ideology as conservative. The Roberts-Orman race is considered a toss-up by Real Clear Politics and The Cook Political Report. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.com gives Orman a 54 percent chance of winning. Our ruling Talking about the midterm campaign with the most blunders, Karl said Roberts is the ""clear worst candidate of the year,"" pointing to the fact that ""Kansas has not elected somebody other than a Republican since before The Wizard of Oz hit the movie theaters."" Karl’s talking point is on the money. Kansas last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1932. The Wizard of Oz was released seven years later.

Brat: U.S. math and science scores rank ""at the bottom"" of industrialized countries
","The debate between two professors – David Brat and Jack Trammell – vying for the 7th District Congressional seat would of course include points about education. ""In K-12 education, our kids are scoring at the bottom of science and mathematics right now in the industrialized world -- at the bottom,"" Brat said during the Oct. 28 debate at Randolph-Macon College, where both he and Trammell teach. We asked Brat’s campaign where he got those figures. His spokesman, Brian Gottstein, sent us a column by Stanford University mathematician Keith Devlin that examines the Programme for International Student Assessment, tests in reading, science and math given to 15-year-olds every three years beginning in 2000. Most of the 34 member nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- an industrialized group of mostly Western European and North American countries -- participate now. A smattering of other countries, such as Russia, Indonesia and Brazil, and regional educational systems in China also take part. In 2000, 32 countries participated. That grew to 65 nations in 2012, the most recent test year with published results. Gottstein referred to a particular quote from Devlin’s column: ""In 2006, American students ranked dead last, 25th out of 25, in math and 21st out of 30 in science. The U.S. also scored worse than ranked countries outside the OECD (considered to be developing nations) like Russia, Azerbaijan, Slovenia and Estonia. Only 1 percent of American 15-year-olds could perform at the highest level, and 27 countries had a higher percentage of 15-year-olds who performed at level 6. And 28 percent of U.S. students appear to have essentially no math skills at all."" We remember from a past fact-check that American students have typically been middle-of-the-pack performers on international tests. But let’s dig a little deeper into the statistics from this column. First, let’s look at the United States’ rankings, as reported by the National Center for Educational Statistics: Science 2000: the U.S. scores ranked 14th among the 28 OECD countries and 14th of 32 total nations. 2003: 19th among 30 OECD countries and 22nd among 41 overall. 2006: 21st among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 57 overall. 2009: 17th among 34 OECD countries and 23rd among 65 overall. 2012: 20th among 34 OECD countries and 28th among 65 overall. Math 2000: the U.S was 18th among 28 OECD countries and 19th of 32 total nations. 2003: 24th among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 41 overall. 2006: 25th among 30 OECD countries and 35th among 57 overall. 2009: 25th among 34 OECD countries and 31st among 65 overall. 2012: 27th among 34 OECD countries and 36th among 65 overall. So, Devlin was correct on the science rank in 2006, but he underplays where the U.S. ranked among its peers on the math score. The U.S. wasn’t ""dead last"" in its math score that year and in fact hasn’t ranked ""dead last"" in any PISA test. Also, Brat and Devlin are referring to outdated results. We know from the 2012 results that among the 34 industrialized countries in the OECD, the U.S. ranked 27th on the math tests and 20th on the science tests. So the U.S. position among its peers on math and science tests has edged up slightly. In summarizing the U.S. results in the latest tests, the OECD said the U.S. math scores were ""below average"" among the industrialized countries in that organization. The U.S. science scores, the group said, were ""close to the OECD average."" Our ruling Brat said U.S. students rank ""at the bottom"" in math and science scores among industrialized nations. U.S. students have not fallen quite to the very bottom of the stack. The latest testing shows U.S. students rank near the middle of the pack among industrialized nations for science scores and in the bottom tier for math scores. The performance is nothing to celebrate, but Brat is wrong when he says twice in his statement that U.S. students rank ""at the bottom"" of developed nations in math and science scores. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEEC200>],/factchecks/2014/nov/02/dave-brat/brat-says-us-students-scoring-bottom-math-and-scie/

David Cicilline says U.S. has third-lowest minimum wage among developed countries
","During a highly charged -- and pretty entertaining -- debate on Channel 10 last Sunday, incumbent Democrat David Cicilline squared off against Cormick Lynch, the Republican who is challenging him for the 1st Congressional District seat. Lynch kept speaking over Cicilline, Cicilline repeatedly patted Lynch on the arm to quiet him, and moderator Bill Rappleye tried to keep everything under control. (""Please, don’t touch,"" he said more than once.) One of the issues that divides the candidates is the federal minimum wage. Cicilline is co-sponsor of a bill that would raise it to $10.10 from its current $7.25. Lynch vehemently opposes the move. ""Raising the minimum wage is going to further destroy the business environment,"" Lynch said in the debate. ""We need to drive private-sector investment and restore the economy, not legislate solutions to the problem."" Cicilline countered that raising the minimum wage would stimulate the economy by giving people more money to spend. ""No-one should work full-time in this country … and live in poverty,"" he said. ""We have the third-lowest minimum wage of countries in the OECD, of developed countries."" Lynch was hardly convinced. ""Congressman, what color was the unicorn you rode in on today?"" he said. ""What planet did it take you here from?"" Mythical creatures and space travel aside, we were interested in Cicilline’s claim about how the U.S. minimum wage stacks up against those in other countries. The ""OECD"" referred to in Cicilline’s statement is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international group headquartered in Paris that aims to stimulate world trade. It has 34 member countries that range from the highly-developed, such as the United States, Germany and Japan, to the emerging, such as Mexico, Turkey and Chile. The group compiles a range of data on the economies of  its member nations. One area of analysis is earnings, which includes minimum wages. When we first looked at the data on minimum wages, we thought Cicilline might be mistaken. The minimum wage in the U.S. measured in real dollars falls in the middle of the pack of 24 countries that supplied numbers to the OECD, according to this table. Australia ranked first with a minimum wage in U.S dollars of $15.20, followed by Luxembourg ($14.30) and France ($12.50). The United States ranked 11th and Mexico came in last at $0.60. But there’s another way of comparing minimum wages that offers more context by accounting for cost-of-living variations from country to country. The OECD compiles another table comparing minimum wages relative to the median wages of full-time workers. ""Median rather than mean [average] earnings provide a better basis for international comparisons as it accounts for differences in earnings dispersion across countries,"" the OECD explains. In the United States, the minimum wage is just 37 percent of the median wage. In a comparison of the 28 countries in the table, the United States ranks 26th, above only the Czech Republic and Mexico. The leading countries in that table are Turkey, where the minimum wage is 69 percent of the median wage, followed by Chile (68 percent) and France (61 percent). In that comparison, the United States is indeed third-lowest. Economists say that this type of comparison creates a benchmark for looking at minimum wages across time periods or countries. It shows the buying power of different minimum wages in different places, they say. On average, the minimum wage in OECD countries has hovered around 50 percent of the median wage, according to this paper from the Hamilton Project. In the United States, it used to be that high but has steadily fallen. (See page 3 of the paper for a good graphic showing this.) Cicilline’s spokeswoman told us that the source of the Congressman’s statement was an Oct. 24 interview on MSNBC with U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez. During the interview, as the screen flashed data from the same table that we found, Perez said that the United States has the third-lowest minimum wage among OECD nations. Our ruling David Cicilline said that the United States has the third-lowest minimum wage among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Although the U.S. minimum wage is not that low in terms of U.S. dollars, it is third-lowest in a more meaningful comparison relative to the median wage. (Here’s a good graphic from the Department of Labor showing how the U.S. stacks up against other developed nations.) We rule Cicilline’s statement True.

Democrats want Nunn even though she opposes some of Obama's policies
","Democrat Michelle Nunn is running a close race against Republican David Perdue for Georgia’s open U.S. Senate seat. Perdue, the cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, has made no bones that he doesn’t think the election is between him and Nunn, the daughter of longtime U.S. Senator Sam Nunn. In the race that could determine which party controls the Senate, Perdue has said that his real opponent is Barack Obama, a Democratic president with low approval ratings in Georgia. Obama ""handpicked her. He funded her. He supports her,"" Perdue said in an Oct. 7 debate in Perry. ""You will not bite the hand that feeds you."" Perdue continued the theme in an Oct. 26 debate in Atlanta. When asked to pose a question to Nunn, he said, ""Isn’t a vote for you just a vote for Barack Obama?"" Implicit in Perdue’s effort  to link Nunn with Obama is the often repeated charge that Nunn will be a rubber stamp for the president if she is elected. But Nunn has cited several areas where she disagrees with the president and reiterated that she will be a problem-solver and pragmatist in the Senate. ""No one is feeding me by hand, David. I’ve spent maybe 45 minutes out of my entire life with President Obama,"" she said at the debate. ""I do not agree with the president as some sort of rubber stamp."" The back-and-forth could be political rhetoric. But with so much on the line nationally, PolitiFact Georgia wondered: did the president hand-pick Nunn with the expectation she would blindly support his policies? We began by asking the Perdue campaign for the basis for its claim. Spokesman Derrick Dickey cited not the president but two potential proxies: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the group Organizing for Action, or OFA. Reid did single out Nunn as ""really good"" in a July 2013 speech to OFA, Obama’s political arm. ""The president is only as strong as his Congress,"" Reid said. ""I talked with Michelle Nunn today. I think there will be an important announcement out of Georgia tomorrow.""  Nunn declared her candidacy on July 22, 2013. She consulted with the Democratic Senatorial Senate Campaign Committee before throwing her name into the ring, according to published reports. But she and her father have both said in interviews that Reid actually asked her not to run for the seat. Congressman John Barrow, a conservative Democrat running for re-election in the 12th District, was mentioned as a possible candidate instead for the seat of retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. The DSCC did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo said the congressman had reviewed requests for a Senate run but in May 2013 announced he would stick with his initial House re-election plans. ""He ultimately decided that he could continue to be an asset to the people in the 12th District and the entire state in the House of Representatives,"" Carbo said. A DSCC poll, released by the political website Politico.com a day after Barrow’s announcement, lends credibility to Nunn being the preferred candidate. The poll shows Nunn would fare better than Barrow against the then-presumptive GOP nominee, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston. Dickey also notes that OFA committed to directing donors and money to Nunn’s campaign – the first such political effort for the group meant to be non-partisan. Since then, the president has told an Atlanta radio station that a Nunn victory in the race ""means that Democrats keep control of the Senate"" and his wife, Michelle Obama, headlined a fund-raiser for Nunn. ""There is no doubt that Barack Obama and his allies picked Michelle Nunn to be the Democrat nominee and attempted to influence the outcome of the primary election on her behalf,"" Dickey said. Such ties may give Perdue an opening – but they don’t translate into Nunn walking in lockstep with Obama, or even the national Democratic Party. Nunn, for instance, has long bucked her party in calling for immediate action to build the Keystone Pipeline. Notably, that puts Nunn in the corner of only one prominent Democrat – fellow Southerner Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. She has pushed for reversing cuts to military spending, notably opposing Obama’s proposed cut to the A-10 Warthogs. She also criticized Obama for delaying funding and authorization to deepen the Port of Savannah. ""Perdue's claim is ludicrous,"" Nunn spokesman Nathan Click said. ""The fact is that since the beginning of this race, Michelle has been very clear that she is running to fight for Georgians and bring Georgia values on Washington -- not kowtow to party leaders."" To that end, being the preferred candidate means only adding to the number of senators with a D after their name, not sharing all ideology, said Kerwin Swint, the director of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Nunn has been clear she does support some of the party’s policies. She is for raising the minimum wage and has given support to Obamacare, with some changes. But it’s unlikely she could be a rubber stamp, or would even want to be, given the state’s politics, Swint said. ""In a state like Georgia, you’d expect her to take a more conservative stance,"" Swint said. ""She’s a moderate Democrat in a Southern state. Democrats would welcome her with open arms, knowing full well she’s going to have serious disagreements with them."" Our ruling So, where does that leave us with Perdue’s claim? There is strong evidence that Democratic leaders – if not the president himself – made it clear that they preferred Nunn as the party’s nominee in Georgia. But Nunn’s stated opposition to some of Obama’s key policies supports the idea that she would not be a rubber stamp for the president.   Perdue has a point about Nunn’s selection by top Democrats. But it needs a lot of additional information to be fully understood. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE65300>],/factchecks/2014/nov/01/david-perdue/democrats-want-nunn-know-she-will-often-oppose-the/

Jeanne Shaheen says Scott Brown voted to reward companies to ship jobs overseas
","Everywhere they go, Jeanne Shaheen and Scott Brown each tout their own record of supporting businesses. It’s been a familiar topic on the campaign trail, in TV ads and during debates in one of the most-watched Senate races in the country. During their first of three televised debates on Oct. 24, 2014, Shaheen, the Democrat, took it to the Republican Brown, saying he voted to give tax breaks to companies that move jobs overseas. ""One of the problems with our tax code is we encourage companies to outsource our jobs. We actually provide tax credits for companies that ship jobs overseas,"" Shaheen said directly to Brown. ""When you were in the senate, you voted to reward those companies to ship jobs overseas."" Brown had a definitive response: ""I have never voted to outsource jobs."" The exchange sounded like a job for PolitiFact. In this item, we will look into Shaheen’s claim that Brown ""voted to reward"" companies to ship jobs overseas. As evidence, the Shaheen campaign pointed to Brown’s vote on a 2010 bill introduced by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act  (S. 3816). The bill aimed to give companies incentives to bring overseas jobs back to the U.S. and to reduce tax breaks that companies can benefit from when moving jobs outside of the country, according to a summary of the legislation by the Library of Congress. In some cases, the 2010 measure would have taken away a firm's option to defer taxes on profits from goods made overseas but sold here. The bill drew opposition from major businesses and industry groups as well, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Koch Industries, both of whom registered to lobby on the bill. ""S. 3816 would create a payroll tax holiday for employers moving jobs to the United States from overseas in a purported attempt to stimulate job growth,"" wrote R. Bruce Josten, the executive vice president of government affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which now endorses Brown in the race. ""However, the concept of economic growth is not a zero-sum game. Replacing a job that is based in another country with a domestic job does not stimulate economic growth or enhance the competitiveness of American worldwide companies."" PolitiFact previously checked a claim by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., a co-sponsor of S.3816, who said the country’s tax code allows companies to deduct the expense of moving jobs overseas. That statement was found to be true. Shaheen voted yes, and Brown voted ""no."" However, he’s got some cover. First, while the intention of the Durbin bill was ""to create American jobs and to prevent the offshoring of such jobs overseas,"" it never came to an up or down vote. The bill died on a procedural vote to end debate, known as cloture. It gained only 53 of the 60 votes required to shut down debate and move to a final, up-or-down vote. Senators voted mostly along party lines: 52 of 57 Democrats voted yes (one didn't cast a vote), and 40 of 41 Republicans voted no (with one not casting vote). The chamber’s two independents were split. So Brown never cast a vote on the merits of the measure. However, Brown openly criticized the bill on Sept. 27, 2010 -- the day before the Senate vote -- saying it would hurt job creation and harm the economy. ""Mr. President, this bill on the floor tonight is not about job creation.  It’s about the campaign and November,"" he said at the time. ""They want to call us the party of ‘No’– I get it. Some pollster says that it plays well back home when politicians talk about ‘companies that ship jobs overseas.’ I get that too."" He added, ""Major employers in Massachusetts that I’ve talked to have said that these proposals are like getting a small piece of candy with one hand and hit with a sledge hammer with the other."" The second bit of cover for Brown is that Shaheen exaggerates somewhat when she says that Brown ""voted to reward"" companies ""to ship jobs overseas."" As we’ve noted previously, there is no tax break or loophole that addresses outsourcing or insourcing jobs specifically. When Democrats refer to ""tax breaks"" for outsourcing, they are typically referring to standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. This provision of tax law isn’t targeted at businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California. Our ruling Jeanne Shaheen says Scott Brown voted to reward companies to ship jobs overseas. A bill in the Senate in 2010 called the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act was aimed at giving companies incentives to bring overseas jobs back to the United States and reducing tax breaks that can benefit companies that move jobs outside of the country. On a procedural vote to move the bill forward, Shaheen voted in favor and Brown against. Brown did openly oppose the bill in a speech, but his actual vote was procedural -- not on the merits -- and it’s debatable whether his opposition amounted to ""rewarding"" companies that outsource or simply kept a status quo that treated all companies equally. On balance, we find Shaheen’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDA5580>],/factchecks/2014/oct/31/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-scott-brown-voted-reward-compa/

Is GOP attorney general candidate Brad Schimel working to make abortion a crime in Wisconsin?
","Surrogates joined the fray in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4, 2014 election for Wisconsin attorney general, a race that is hot partly because Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen didn’t seek another term. The state Republican Party attacked the Democratic nominee, Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, saying she took $180,000 in a ""shady"" land deal ""from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution."" We rated that claim False. The GOP distorted the timeline of events. The effect was a highly misleading attack without evidence to back up the idea that the defendant got a sweetheart prosecution deal from Happ. On Oct. 24, 2014, state Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, took aim at the Republican nominee, Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel. ""Schimel is in cahoots with Wisconsin Right to Life to make abortion a crime in Wisconsin,"" Taylor told reporters in a conference call. The liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee made a similar statement in a TV ad. Let’s get to the bottom of it. Taylor’s evidence Taylor, a former public policy director at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, was criticizing Schimel for signing onto a legal paper issued by Wisconsin Right to Life. The Milwaukee-based Right to Life group says one of its missions is to make abortion ""socially, ethically and legally unacceptable."" The legal paper, issued in January 2012, argued against supporting a proposal to add a ""personhood"" amendment to the state constitution. It made these assertions: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the United States, could be overturned in the next seven to 10 years. That would pave the way for a Wisconsin statute, which predates Roe, to immediately make abortion in Wisconsin illegal in almost all cases. ""Wisconsin unborn children will be best protected"" by preserving that statute, rather than backing the personhood amendment. So, Wisconsin Right to Life was promoting a strategy, albeit a passive one, that it hopes would result in abortion being illegal in Wisconsin eventually. Seventeen attorneys put their signatures on the legal paper -- indicating, according to the paper, that they agree with its ""content and conclusions."" Among them were former Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann, a Democrat; Milwaukee criminal defense attorney Gerald Boyle; and Richard Esenberg, president of the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative, libertarian public interest law firm. And Schimel. Taylor told us that Schimel’s endorsement of the legal paper means he is seeking to make abortion illegal because -- as is noted in the paper -- Wisconsin Right to Life has fought attempts to repeal the statute that outlawed abortion in Wisconsin. In other words, she said, Schimel agrees with the strategy to preserve the old statute with the hope that it will one day take effect again if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Wisconsin Right to Life sought the endorsement of district attorneys such as Schimel, she argued, because they would be the ones to enforce the statute outlawing abortion if it became law. Schimel, however, was the only district attorney among the 17 attorneys who signed the paper. One other prosecutor, Thomas Potter from the Milwaukee County district attorney’s office, also signed it. Schimel’s response On the day Taylor made her comments, Schimel said in response: ""I respect the law of the land, and the law of the land is Roe v. Wade. That’s all there is to that. I’m pro-life and I make no apologies for that."" When we asked Schimel’s campaign to respond to Taylor’s claim, Schimel, who has said he believes life begins at conception, issued a statement emphasizing that Roe v. Wade, and not the Wisconsin statute, is the controlling law. The statement also said Schimel has stated several times during the campaign that he would ""not defy the law of the land,"" and that he would ""defend Wisconsin’s laws the way they are written, but I will respect the law of the land from the (U.S.) Supreme Court."" Our rating Taylor said Schimel ""is in cahoots with Wisconsin Right to Life to make abortion a crime in Wisconsin."" Schimel signed a legal paper by the group that argues that, under an old statute, abortion would immediately become illegal in Wisconsin if Roe v. Wade is overturned. But we’re not aware of any evidence that Schimel is actively working with Wisconsin Right to Life to make abortion a crime. And he has said he would not defy U.S. Supreme Court decisions such as Roe, which makes abortion legal. Taylor’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

Scott Walker says gender gap in his support similar to other GOP candidates
","In mid-October, Republican Gov. Scott Walker answered a journalist’s question about Democratic challenger Mary Burke’s superior poll numbers among women, minorities and young people. How did he account for that? ""Some of those issues are just historic patterns, they’re not unique to me,"" Walker told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s editorial board Oct. 14, 2014. ""If you look at Republican-Democrat (numbers) you could make -- in the last dozen or so elections -- similar parallels to that. So there’s not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and U.S. Senate elections."" He added: ""For a lot of this it’s a matter of getting our message out, getting our story out. We’re not conceding any votes in the state of Wisconsin."" With several gender-based issues at the heart of each side’s TV advertising, and experts saying the Nov. 4, 2014 election is likely to come down to turnout efforts on each side, we wanted to check the historical record on the so-called gender gap and Republican candidates. Are Walker’s 2014 poll numbers among women and men pretty similar to the gender gap seen in past Wisconsin elections for GOP candidates? For this pre-election analysis, we turned to the exit polls taken of voters as they leave the voting booth after each election. We examined comparable races in recent Wisconsin history, as well as polling data in the 2012 and 2014 campaigns in Wisconsin. Defining the gap The gender gap -- Republicans doing better with men than women; Democrats doing better with women than men -- is a feature of contemporary politics. Within each party, men and women don’t vote that differently. But the Democratic Party has fewer men among its supporters; the Republican Party has fewer women.   One way to measure the gender gap is to simply take the difference between how a candidate does with men and how that candidate does with women. In the 2012 recall race, Walker got 59 percent of the male vote and 47 percent of the female vote -- a gender gap of 12 points. (His opponent Tom Barrett got 40 percent of the male vote and 52 percent of the female vote, also a 12-point difference). That 12-point gender gap was the largest in a Wisconsin U.S. Senate or governor’s race for which we were able to obtain exit poll data in recent decades. But it is not dramatically at odds with how Republican candidates have performed in Wisconsin in other major races in the past few years. Historical picture The gender gap has been growing in Wisconsin. In her 1988 U.S. Senate race against Democrat Herb Kohl, Republican Susan Engeleiter did three points worse with women than men. In his 1992 Senate race against Democrat Russ Feingold, GOP Sen. Bob Kasten did two points worse with women than men. But these gender gaps grew in the 1990s and 2000s -- ranging in the mid- to high-single digits. For example, former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson did four points worse with women than men in 1994 and seven points worse in 1998. Republican Mark Neumann did four points worse with women in his 1998 race against Feingold.  And Republican Mark Green did five points worse with women than men in his race against Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle in 2006. The gender gap got bigger still in the 2010 election. Walker did nine points worse among women than men in winning the governor’s race, as did Republican Ron Johnson in winning his U.S. Senate race against Feingold. In the 2012 U.S. Senate race against Tammy Baldwin, Republican Tommy Thompson did 10 points worse with women than women. Looking back over that landscape, it’s clear that Walker’s 12-point gender gap in the 2012 recall race is the biggest of all these races, but it’s consistent with the trend of a growing gender gap. And it’s not a great deal bigger than other big statewide races in 2010 and 2012. Presidential races When you broaden the focus to consider presidential voting in Wisconsin, the biggest difference is that the gender gap appeared earlier in time and hasn’t really grown that much. Some examples: George Herbert Walker Bush did 10 points worse with women than men in his 1988 race;  George W. Bush did 11 points worse with women in 2000 and six points worse in 2004; John McCain did six points worse with women in 2008 and Mitt Romney did nine points worse with women than men in 2012. We have been describing these Republican candidates as doing ""worse with women"" but you could just as easily describe them as doing ""better with men,"" since the gender gap is a double-edged sword for the two parties. For Republicans it can result from weakness among women, but it can also result from strength among men. For Democrats, it’s just the other way around. In his two victories for governor, Walker lost women voters, but not overwhelmingly, getting 48 percent of women in 2010 and 47 percent in 2012.  The gender gap in those races was more about Walker’s strength with male voters, winning men with 57 percent in 2010 and 59 percent in 2012. 2014 governor’s race What does the gender gap look like in the 2014 race between Walker and Burke? For the answer, we can turn to the regular polling done by the Marquette University Law School. We also looked at the gender gaps in these other races in Marquette’s polling: the June 2012 recall race between Walker and Barrett; the 2012 Senate race between Baldwin and Thompson; and the 2012 presidential race between Romney and Barack Obama. We calculated the average gender gap in all the polling for each race. And once again, the Walker races featured the biggest gender gaps, though they were only marginally bigger than the other two races. The 2012 recall race had the biggest gender gap of the four contests. We should note that if the question is not the gap between men and women, but Walker's performance with women specifically, his numbers are actually better than the most Republicans in recent years in Wisconsin. That is, he has lost among women, but not by as much as many other candidates in his party in this state. The most notable exception is Thompson, whose landslide victories for governor featured big winning margins among both men and women. Thompson’s victories in the 1990s, in fact, are the only case we could find in recent decades of a Republican winning women in Wisconsin in a statewide contest for governor, U.S. Senate or president.   One last note about the gender gap this year. In Marquette’s polling of the Walker-Burke race, the gender gap has fluctuated a lot from poll to poll, raising some eyebrows among political observers. It’s not unusual for swings to occur among subgroups of voters, and it’s sometimes due to random variation from survey to survey. The gender gap shrank dramatically in Marquette’s first October poll, but returned in Marquette’s last pre-election poll taken Oct. 23 to 26. If you average all the Marquette polls this year, you find that the gender gap is alive and well. Walker has been winning 52 percent of male registered voters and 42 percent of female registered voters over the course of nine 2014 polls. Burke has been winning 48 percent of female registered voters and 40 percent of male registered voters.        Our rating Walker said the gender gap in his support is ""not unique to me"" and ""there’s not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and US Senate elections"" in recent years. Walker is correct when he suggests the gender gap in his race is not dramatically different from that seen for other Republican candidates in other comparable races in Wisconsin in recent history. At the same time, according to exit polls, Walker’s 2012 recall win featured a bigger gender gap than any other recent race for governor or U.S. Senate in Wisconsin. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC03F480>],/factchecks/2014/oct/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-gender-gap-his-support-similar-o/
