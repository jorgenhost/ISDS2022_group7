Even the Gipper
","As the candidates fell over themselves in a game of I-loved-Ronald Reagan one-upsmanship during a Jan. 10, 2008, debate in South Carolina, Mike Huckabee had the audacity to note that in Reagan's first year as governor of California, the Gipper raised taxes. A lot.
 
""You know, if Ronald Reagan were running tonight, there would be ads by the Club for Growth running against him because he raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California,"" Huckabee said. ""It would be $10-billion today.""
 
Ronald ""Send the welfare bums back to work"" Reagan?
 
""Basically, yeah,"" said Kelly Barton, an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.
 
In the summer of 1967, during Reagan's first year as governor, and contrary to his campaign promises, Reagan signed off on a record tax increase for the state of California — an 18 percent, roughly $1-billion hike.
 
According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, the increase included boosting sales taxes from three to five cents on the dollar; raising the maximum income tax from 7 to 10 percent; and increases in bank, corporation, inheritance, liquor and cigarette taxes.
 
A little context is in order. In his autobiography,

An American Life,

Reagan said he inherited a $200-million deficit from his predecessor, Pat Brown. Reagan ordered a hiring freeze and other spending cuts.
 
But Reagan was a Republican governor in a state where the legislature was controlled by the Democrats, and he wasn't able to muster support for additional cuts. So, he ended up reluctantly signing off on the tax increases.
 
This is the second time in week that a Republican candidate has used Reagan to defend himself. In a debate on Jan. 5, 2008, Rudy Giuliani correctly pointed out that Reagan had endorsed a policy of amnesty for some illegal aliens. Read our ruling

here.

 
Now, Huckabee's math may be a little off on what that $1-billion would translate to today. It's actually closer to $6.3-billion.
 
But the bottom line, Huckabee's statement about Reagan is true.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
McCain led the charge, but he wasn't alone
","No candidate in the presidential race is more closely linked to President Bush's policy in Iraq than Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain. McCain's campaign nearly imploded last year — during some of the war's darker days — because of McCain's outspoken support for the president's troop surge policy, which was announced a year ago this month.
 
But McCain was stretching the truth in a Jan. 10, 2008, Republican debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., when he said, in reference to the surge: ""I supported that, I argued for it. I'm the only one on this stage that did.""
 
While McCain can make a case that he offered the strongest arguments in favor of the surge — and is now reaping the political benefits as violence has declined in Iraq — four of the other five candidates in the Fox News debate made arguments in favor of it. The one exception is Texas GOP Rep. Ron Paul, who supports an immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq.
 
Three of the four remaining Republican candidates on the stage — Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Huckabee — supported the surge when it was announced and advanced arguments in its favor, although Huckabee expressed reservations early on. Now, he's an ardent surge backer. The final candidate, former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson, also spoke in favor of the surge when he joined the presidential race last summer.
 
Romney in a statement released on the day Bush announced his surge policy said he agreed with the president that ""securing Iraqi civilians requires additional troops."" Later, in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in March 2007, he reiterated his support.
 
Giuliani, likewise, put out an immediate statement endorsing the surge after Bush announced it. ""I support the president's increase in troops. Even more importantly, I support the change in strategy — the focus on security and the emphasis on a political and economic solution as being even more important than a military solution."" He, too, later made a speech in support of the surge.
 
Thompson has been less clear in endorsing the surge. In an interview with the Hoover Institution's Peter Robinson in June, for example, he said the strategy in Iraq required evaluation on a ""day-to-day basis."" But he's always been forthright that he believes U.S. forces must remain in Iraq until the war is won and has repeatedly expressed confidence in Gen. David Petraeus, the surge's architect.
 
Huckabee, who like McCain has accused fellow candidates of insufficient support for the troop surge, initially had qualms. Shortly after the surge was announced, for example, Huckabee told MSNBC's Norah O'Donnell that he wasn't sure he could support the troop increases in Iraq if it meant calling up more National Guard and Reserve forces. He now says he firmly supports Bush's military tactics in Iraq, and recently wrote in

Foreign Affairs

magazine that he would ""not withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq any faster than General David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander there, recommends.""
 
There's no doubt that McCain is the surge's most powerful advocate among the candidates, and has been from the start. But to say that none of his fellow GOP candidates supported it, or argued in favor of it, is False.

Church claims commitment as ethnic heritage
","An anonymous chain e-mail warns its readers that the church Barack Obama belongs to has a ""nonnegotiable commitment to Africa."" That is an accurate statement from the church's Web site. But the e-mail implies that that commitment is anti-American, which we find is not the case. (Read our story about the whole e-mail

here

.)
 
Obama belongs to Trinity United Church of Christ, which is considered among the larger black megachurches in the United States. The presidential race has kept him away from the church recently, but he typically attends when he's in Chicago, according to his campaign.
 
Trinity preaches a Bible-based message of black self-reliance. Its motto is ""Unashamedly Black and Unapologetically Christian.""
 
Trinity's commitment to Africa appears to be more a statement of philosophical orientation than of political support for any particular African country. The church offers classes about the continent and sponsors trips there. Its Web site, www.tucc.org, says it seeks to represent the concerns of Africa in the United States and compares its allegiance with other mainstream immigrant groups:
 
""Just as those of Jewish heritage advocate on behalf of the state of Israel, and those of Irish heritage advocate on behalf of Ireland, and those of Polish descent for Poland, so must we of African descent care about the land of our heritage — the continent of Africa.""
 
Obama's father is from the nation of Kenya on the continent of Africa.
 
Trinity defended its teachings in a statement responding to the recent attacks:
 
""There is no anti-American sentiment in the theology or the practice of Trinity United Church of Christ. To be sure, there is prophetic preaching against oppression, racism and other evils that would deny the American ideal,"" it said.
 
The e-mail is correct that the Web site espouses a ""nonnegotiable commitment to Africa,"" and a nonnegotiable commitment is pretty strong language. But the e-mail implies there's something politically sinister about this and that it somehow supersedes a commitment to America. We find no evidence for that contention. For these reasons, we rate the claim Mostly True.
 

UPDATE:

Barack Obama belongs to Trinity United Church of Christ, which serves predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Chicago and has a mostly African-American membership. But you do not have to be black to join Trinity. The church, which has been overwhelmed with media inquiries, said in a statement that it welcomes people of all races and has white members.

Dwight Hopkins, a professor of divinity at the University of Chicago who attends Trinity and is black, said he also regularly sees a few white people at Trinity.
 
Many churches are ethnically homogenous, but that doesn't mean they require members to be a certain race. We find the e-mail's statement that Trinity United Church of Christ only accepts African-Americans for membership to be False.

First off, Barack Obama's middle name is not Mohammed; it's Hussein. He was named after his father, a Kenyan who came to the United States from Africa as a student.

Capacity has increased
","When it comes to energy independence, the United States has ""an idea"" but lacks ""a program,"" according to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. During the Jan. 5 debates in Manchester, N.H., he said, ""We haven't built a refinery, I think, in 30 years.""
 
It's been more than 30 years, said Bill Holbrook, communications director for the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, an industry trade group. The last spanking-new refinery built in the United States was the Marathon Oil refinery in Garyville, La., in 1976.
 
But that's not the whole story, he said.
 
""When people say that, they're implying that the industry has done nothing to increase capacity,"" Holbrook complained. ""And that is inaccurate.""
 
The industry has found it costs less money and takes less time to expand existing facilities, he said. Over the past 15 years, the U.S. refining industry has added the equivalent of one new, state-of-the-art refinery a year, each with a capacity to refine 150,000 to 300,000 barrels per day.
 
Jonathan Cogan, senior analyst with the Energy Information Administration, echoed Holbrook: ""Not quibbling with the wording, but it leads you to believe we haven't increased our refining capacity. We have.""
 
In fact, the United States has added nearly 1.7-million barrels per day of refining capacity since 1985, according to the administration's records.
 
Cogan said Garyville is the last ""significant"" refinery built, and industry experts often think of it as the most recent. But there have been a handful of smaller refineries built since then. However, those can handle only a fraction of Garyville's capacity, according to the EIA, the information arm of the Department of Energy.
 
So Giuliani has the date right, but tells only part of the story. No significant refineries have been built in more than 30 years, but refining capacity in the United States has expanded substantially and smaller plants have been built. We rule his statement Barely True.
 

UPDATE:

The last new refinery of significant size built in the United States was a Marathon Oil refinery in Garyville, La. Previously, we reported an incorrect name for the facility.

Yes, but it's not illegal
","Thousands of subsidiaries, many from U.S. corporations, have indeed set up shop — or more precisely, hung a nameplate — at the five-story Ugland House and other financial centers in the Cayman Islands. They include Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, General Motors, Intel, FedEx and Sprint. But while Sen. Barack Obama is right on the general point, calling the practice ""the biggest tax scam on record"" is questionable. From the quote itself, it's hard to tell if Obama is taking issue with the way companies use the Caymans as a tax shelter, or if he's objecting to the U.S. tax code that makes it possible. ""There's nothing better than to beat up on a tax haven on a beach,"" said Douglas Shackelford, a professor at the University of North Carolina's business school. ""It sounds crooked, but if one really thinks about the facts, I don't see the grounding."" Weather isn't drawing the corporations, of course. The Caymans do not have a corporate income tax. The United States taxes corporate income at 35 percent, higher than most countries. As long as profits are not brought back to the United States, or ""repatriated,"" no tax is due. Federal law allows the taxation of ""passive income,"" meaning the interest earned on profits of those subsidiaries. But typically the companies reinvest the money elsewhere, Shackelford said. Obama is the co-sponsor of legislation that would crack down on offshore activities by corporations and individuals. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act would target an estimated $100-billion annually, including $30-billion from corporations. According to published financial reports, Coca-Cola alone saved $500-million in U.S. taxes in 2003 through foreign subsidiaries. Its Cayman company controls syrup-producing facilities in Ireland. The subsidiary pays taxes in Ireland at 12.5 percent, still far less than in the United States. So, Obama is right that thousands of corporations, and some do say more than 12,000, are in one building in the Caymans, but he goes too far when he implies it's an illegal scam.

No evidence to support conspiracy theory
","A strident letter mailed to voters in late December 2007 attacked Mitt Romney and the Mormon faith, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or the LDS Church. The 11-page letter makes a number of claims, both political and theological, many of which are disputed by Mormons themselves and other sources. In the interest of brevity, we confined ourselves to checking the false contention that the Mormon faith has a ""devious plan for our country"" that advocates the overthrow of the Constitution in favor of a government run by Mormon religious authorities. (To read the letter for yourself, it's available on the Internet

here

.)
 
The letter's claim is ""unhinged"" and ""rooted in no reality,"" said Michael Cromartie, vice president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a think tank that studies the role of religion in public life. Cromartie is a conservative Protestant.
 
""And if you're going to have a Mormon theocracy, who's going to lead it? Mitt Romney or Harry Reid from Nevada?"" asked Cromartie. (Reid, also a Mormon, is the Democratic majority leader in the U.S. Senate and on the other end of the political spectrum from Romney.)
 
""It's one of those claims that so absurd you don't want to dignify it by responding to it,"" agreed Kathleen Flake, a professor of religious history at Vanderbilt University who studies the Mormon faith and is a Mormon herself. ""There's no evidence to support such a claim as a cabal.""
 
""It's so far from what Mitt Romney would ever want, I can't imagine it,"" said Jan Shipps, professor emeritus of history and religious studies at Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis. Shipps, a Methodist, is considered the most prominent non-Mormon historian who studies the religion.
 
""It's a conspiracy theory,"" she said.
 
We checked official teachings from the Mormon Church, and found that it has an policy of political neutrality. Its Web site states: ""The Church's mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, not to elect politicians. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in matters of party politics.""
 
The church also says it does not advise its members on which candidates or parties they should vote for. ""This policy applies whether or not a candidate for office is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,"" the Web site states.
 
Accusations that the church wants to abolish the Constitution are not new, say people who monitor attacks on the Mormon faith.
 
""This is old chestnut stuff that we've dealt with for years and years and years,"" said Greg Kearney, a member of the Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research, a nonprofit organization that runs a Web site explaining and defending Mormon doctrine, belief and practice. He read the letter at our request.
 
""The idea that Mormons speak with one political voice and one political motive is just plain nonsense,"" Kearney said. ""I'm a liberal, Labor, New Deal Democrat.""
 
We interviewed the author of the letter, John M. Boyd of California, who describes himself as a Christian and a cult expert. He agreed that overthrowing the Constitution is not part of current Mormon teaching and ""wouldn't happen overnight."" But it could happen if a catastrophe occurred and a Mormon president decided the end of the world was at hand, based on Mormon historical writings, he said.
 
Boyd sent out the letter in the name of a recently formed political action committee called Freedom Defense Advocates, but he said he was motivated not by politics, but by his beliefs as a nondenominational Christian. He said he is conservative, but not affiliated with any campaign and hasn't decided who he's supporting for the Republican nomination.
 
""This is about the theological issues that surround the religion of one of the candidates, who happens to be Mitt Romney,"" Boyd said. ""I classify the Mormon church as a cult.""
 
The letter adds an entrepreneurial kicker at the end –- it urges readers to send in money for DVDs that attack the Mormon church.
 
Boyd declined to name the financial backers of Freedom Defense Advocates, but said the letter had been mailed to ""thousands of people throughout the whole of the United States … a very sizable amount.""
 
The theological differences between Mormons and other Christians are complex and multifaceted. But significant areas of theological difference involve Holy Scriptures and the concept of God.
 
Mormons believe Joseph Smith, the church's founder who died in 1844, discovered additional books of Scripture in the United States. Those books form the Book of Mormon, which Mormons consider as Scripture in addition to the Bible.
 
Their concept of the nature of God differs as well. Protestants and Roman Catholics believe that God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are different aspects of one being who has existed eternally. Mormons believe that God the Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are separate entities, and that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are subordinate to God the Father.
 
The Mormon belief that God the Father created all things is the root of the ""Jesus and the Devil are brothers"" claim that came up earlier in the campaign when Mike Huckabee mentioned it to the

New York Times

. (He later apologized to Romney.) The contention, which is repeated in the letter, is based on a kernel of truth, but distorted. Under Mormon teaching, God created everyone, so every person or being who has ever existed is Jesus' brother or sister.
 
We asked the Romney campaign for a response to the letter, and they gave us the following statement: ""It is sad and unfortunate that this kind of bigotry has been employed. There is absolutely no place for these attacks in American politics. Governor Romney isn't going to dwell on attacks from his opponents. Rather, his campaign is about the issues that are important to the American people, and bringing conservative change to Washington.""
 
As for the facts behind the claim that the Mormon religion wants to see the Constitution revoked and the government run by Mormon religious leaders, we find a decided lack of concrete evidence. And given the extreme nature of the claim, we must give it our Pants on Fire ruling.

Clinton's work has been low profile
","Before he bowed out of the race, Sen. Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. Biden was particularly direct summing up Clinton's tenure, saying, ""There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it.""
 
In some ways, Biden's assessment is correct: Clinton has not been the lead sponsor of legislation dealing with a major national issue that made its way to President Bush's desk. But New York's junior senator has had comparatively few opportunities after spending four of her seven years in the chamber as a member of the minority.
 
Instead, she has worked the way many senators do, introducing bills that wind up getting included in another's initiative, drafting a Senate companion bill to a popular House initiative or working with home state Republicans to send money to New York or protect local interests.
 
After eight years as first lady, Clinton deliberately sought a lower profile in the Senate, respecting the seniority system and tending to steer away from contentious national debates such as health care. She also has adopted moderate — some would say carefully calibrated — rhetoric on abortion, the war in Iraq, fiscal policy and social issues. The approach surprised many of her critics, who suspected she would stake out more liberal positions and primarily use New York and the Senate as a stepping stone for her national ambitions.
 
She was the leading Democratic sponsor of a 2003 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to order drug companies to test their drugs to determine the proper dosages for children. The effort was inspired by cases in which children died or were injured taking drugs or using medical devices shown safe for adults. She worked with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2006 to get portions of legislation she authored to extend health coverage to National Guard troops and reservists included in a fiscal 2007 defense authorization bill.
 
After the Sept. 11 attacks, Clinton authored a companion bill to House legislation ensuring that public safety officers killed or injured in the line of duty during the attacks would receive expedited payment of benefits. On another matter closely related to her home state, Clinton worked with Republican congressman Tom Reynolds to keep the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station open at a time when the Pentagon was closing bases — a move that saved 800 jobs.
 
Clinton has effectively used her senatorial power to influence a handful of issues and to focus on local politics. Biden is correct when he says her name is not on a major bill, but as Biden knows better than most, that's not a fair measure of a legislator's accomplishments. We rule his statement Mostly True.

Barking up the right tree
","Who sends a dog to do their bidding? A cute, ribbon-in-its-hair Yorkie named Spike, at that?
 
Mitt Romney.
 
Yes, in his latest round of yapping with rival Mike Huckabee, Romney sent Iowa voters a mailer that assails Huckabee's tax record and, more notably, features many adorable pictures of Spike:
 
""Dear Iowa Republican ... "" it begins, ""At the risk of making Chuck Norris angry, I must disagree with his endorsement of Mike Huckabee for President. (Please stick with me here. If putting Chuck Norris in a television ad makes sense, a dog responding in a mailing makes just as much sense.)""
 
It's signed: ""Bow wow, Spike"" with a paw print.
 
Now we know Iowa is passe, but given New Hampshire's antitax climate, we wouldn't be surprised to see this attack ad in a few Nashua mailboxes. And we can't help but give Romney points for humor. This is the joke attack ad style the Hillary Clinton campaign missed out on when it dug up quotes from Sen. Barack Obama's kindergarten teacher to prove he's been aiming for the White House longer than he admits.

(True!)

 
But, back to Spike. He attacks Huckabee for ""all the different taxes"" he raised as governor of Arkansas, including the one that really gets him: the tax on dog groomers. (We checked Huckabee's record on the other tax increases

here.

)
 
""Sales tax. Gas tax. Groceries tax. Even the tax on nursing home beds. Fine,"" Spike writes. ""But he went too far when he taxed the people who make me beautiful!""
 
Would you believe Spike is barking up the right tree?
 
A number of services were made subject to the Arkansas state sales tax with Act 107 of the 2003 legislative session. Wrecker and towing services. Body piercing, tattooing and electrolysis services. Locksmith services. And, pet grooming and kennel services.
 
As of July 1, 2004, charges for those services and nine others named in the legislation are subject to a 6 percent state sales tax, all part of an effort to generate revenue to balance the budget in the face of a dramatic projected budget shortfall.
 
""Like most states at that time, revenues were dropping, so they levied (additional taxes),"" said Tom Atchley, excise tax administrator for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.
 
Act 107 became law on Feb. 12, 2004, without a signature from then-Gov. Huckabee, who has said he had little choice but to accept the tax increases because Arkansas state law requires a balanced budget.
 
Still, no bones about it, Spike makes a solid case. And Romney scores a funny jab. If you'd like to see the mailer, which is worth a peek, it's posted at the

Washington Post

blog ""The Trail""

here.

 
But because Huckabee didn't sign the law, we can't say Huckabee himself put a tax on dog groomers. But he didn't stop it either, so we rule Spike's statement Mostly True.

Obama sponsored a bill that became law
","Before he bowed out of the race, Sen. Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. About Barack Obama, he said, ""Barack Obama hasn't passed any.""
 
By that wording, Biden is wrong.
 
Obama, who was sworn into office in January 2005, spent much of his time in the Senate taking a high-profile position as spokesman for Democrats' efforts to overhaul congressional ethics standards, including his own bid to make Senate colleagues pay the full charter rate, rather than first-class airfare, for rides in corporate jets. The effort drew the ire of such senior senators as Ted Stevens of Alaska, whose state is so big that corporate planes are often the only way to get around. Senate leaders included that jet travel requirement in a lobbying practices and disclosures bill signed into law in September 2007.
 
But as a member of the minority party, Obama also worked across the aisle with Republicans to push several measures that became law in 2006.
 
Working with Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Obama won enactment of a law creating a single, searchable database of all federal contracts, grants and loans.
 
He also partnered with senior Indiana Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, the former chairman of the Foreign Relations panel, to sponsor legislation to strengthen international efforts to destroy conventional weapons, though it did not advance out of committee.
 
Separately, Obama was lead sponsor of a bill to provide relief and promote democracy in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was signed into law in December 2006.
 
He introduced legislation in 2005 to require federal preparations for an avian flu pandemic, but it didn't advance.
 
And he weighed in on another ""good government"" initiative during congressional debate on tougher lobbying disclosure standards, by backing the creation of an independent ""Office of Public Integrity"" that would investigate congressional ethics cases and receive and monitor financial disclosure reports required from members of Congress, officers and employees of Congress and lobbyists. The bid failed in 2006 due to opposition from members of the Senate Ethics Committee, who said it would politicize the panel. Another attempt to include it in the Democrats' ethics bill failed in early 2007.
 
Obama's tendency to focus on nonidelogical issues is pragmatic, because they tend not to have powerful enemies or, if they do, are shielded by solid support in both parties. But some of his initiatives have languished, either because he was a junior member of the Democratic caucus or because they encountered institutional resistance. One would have rewarded troubled school districts with extra federal help in exchange for deep changes.
 
Though advocacy groups generally gave him positive marks for taking action, Obama's absence from heated political battles makes it difficult to assess his effectiveness as a legislator. Still, he has passed one bill signed into law, making Biden's statement False.

Edwards a significant player on several bills
","Before he bowed out of the race, Sen. Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. About John Edwards, he said, ""John doesn't have a record in the Senate. John's only passed four bills. They're all about post offices.""
 
Edwards was similarly depicted as inexperienced by Democratic primary opponents and President Bush's re-election campaign during the 2004 presidential race. But as a freshman senator, he worked with senior Democrats like Edward M. Kennedy to see that his views on public school accountability, border security, bioterrorism and other issues were incorporated into bills moving toward enactment.
 
Edwards took a lead role enacting a law that authorized federal grants for local agencies and nonprofits to find missing adults. It was named ""Kristen's Law"" after Kristen Modafferi, a North Carolina State University student who disappeared in 1997, shortly after her 18th birthday.
 
He collaborated with Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to enact a law to combat deceptive sweepstakes notices. And in his third year, Edwards was active in the 2001 debate over President Bush's bid to revamp federal education policy, which put an emphasis on annual testing and created consequences for schools with chronically low test scores. Edwards authored a provision in the final version of a landmark education bill that established ""support teams"" to help turn around failing schools.
 
In the wake of the Enron corporate governance scandal, Edwards wrote language in a law regulating the accounting industry that requires attorneys to report corporate wrongdoing to a company's officers or, if necessary, to its directors. And three days after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Edwards introduced legislation aimed at strengthening security at airports and seaports. Elements of the plan were eventually incorporated into aviation security and port security laws, including requirements for strengthened cockpit doors and the establishment of special port security units within the Coast Guard.
 
Edwards also took a prominent role in an important health care debate, joining with John McCain and Kennedy in 2001 to unveil a plan that would give patients more leverage over their managed-care health insurance plans. The plan, which promised new patient protections and liability caps for employers, passed the Senate 59-36 that summer but then stalled over the question of whether patients could sue their health plans. Congress' attention shifted to national security following the Sept. 11 attacks, and the measure was not revived.
 
""You can't hold it against him that his bills don't pass as they flow from his pen,"" former Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in assessing Edwards' record after he was tapped to be John Kerry's running mate in 2004. ""Major bills come from committee chairmen and occasionally ranking members. . . . If a younger member has an idea, those ideas are often incorporated into a larger bill in committee.""
 
As for less significant legislation, Edwards, like many members of Congress, sponsored several bills authorizing the naming of post offices in his home state, as Biden correctly states. He also drafted a 2001 Senate resolution honoring Dale Earnhardt after the NASCAR driver was killed in a crash. But because Edwards successfully injected himself into a number of significant debates and shaped their outcomes — often while serving in the minority party — we rule this Biden statement False.

Liberal blog: U.S. cops killed more people in one month than U.K. cops killed last century
","As the country learned about the shooting death of Walter Scott in North Charleston, S.C., a comparison between police in the United States and the United Kingdom began to spread across the Internet. The liberal website Addicting Info put up a graphic under the headline ""U.S. Police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century."" Other groups made similar claims -- including RT, the English language cable channel financed by the Russian government. According to Addicting Info: U.S. police killed 111 people in March 2015 U.K. police killed 69 people from 1900-present. A reader asked us to check it out.  Tracing the source of the data Addicting Information used this eye-catching graphic to tell its story.  You won’t find this image on the Addicting Information website any longer. Elisabeth Parker, the author of the piece, explained to us where she got her information. She started with a post that made a similar but not identical claim on Daily Kos, a liberal website. The post’s count of American deaths in March tracked back to a website called Killed by Police. Killed by Police has a singular task. Each time a television station or newspaper reports that a person has died at the hands of the police, the people behind Killed by Police (we don’t know who they are) add a link to the news story in a spreadsheet. When we saw the list for deaths in March, it had 115 entries. We read each news report and found that just about every death, 98 of them, involved a police shooting. There were 16 cases when a person died from other causes, most frequently when police used a taser. One time an officer accidentally hit and killed a person with his car. In a category by itself, an officer in Hawaii got into an argument with a neighbor and killed him, thus becoming a common murderer completely apart from his role in law enforcement. The warning here is the warning with all fact-checks and analysis of police-related deaths. There is no singular, verified U.S. database of police shootings. So all we have are estimates. In this case, University of Missouri-St.Louis criminologist David Klinger said the Killed by Police numbers -- whether you settle on 98, 111 or some other figure -- ""wouldn’t be unexpected."" Deaths in the United Kingdom So, yes, the U.S. figure for March is plausible. But this claim really hinges on the stat encompassing more than 100 years in the United Kingdom. The fact is, that relies on a Wikipedia list of killings by law enforcement officers in the United Kingdom. ""I pored over the Wikipedia entry and realized that some incidents included multiple shootings and adjusted (the) figure to 69 police shootings,"" Parker said. The problem with that is that Parker had to make two big assumptions: That the list was accurate, and more critically, that it was complete. With Wikipedia, those are assumptions people should not make. In fact, the Wikipedia entry warns at the top that ""This list is incomplete."" So what’s the real number? Over such a long time horizon -- and in a country whose borders changed (Ireland was part of the United Kingdom until the 1920s) -- it’s really impossible to say. The British advocacy group Inquest has looked at police incidents in England and Wales going back to 1990. By its count, there were 55 police shooting deaths between 1990 and the present. The group reports another 1,453 deaths that had some connection to contact with police. However, the causes range from someone dying of a drug overdose while at a police station, to car thieves killing themselves in a wreck, to suicide while in custody, to excessive use of force by officers. There simply is no way to tease out the details. Comparing police shootings to the American data is the only reliable approach. The only other country in the United Kingdom for which we found hard numbers was Northern Ireland. Between April 2008 and September 2014, roughly a six-year period, members of the Police Force of Northern Ireland discharged their weapons nine times. However, there is no data on whether any deaths resulted. During the times of ""The Troubles"" from 1968 to about 2000 when separatists, generally Catholics, and unionists, generally Protestants, battled over whether Northern Ireland should break away or remain part of the United Kingdom, there were over 3,000 deaths. Some of those were at the hands of the police. Aogan Mulcahy, a researcher in the School of Sociology at the University College Dublin, walked us through the numbers. The Royal Ulster Constabulary was the police force in Northern Ireland until 2001. Based on an online database, Mulcahy told us that the RUC ""was responsible for 55 deaths over the period 1969-2001."" We found no information for Scotland. We should note that only the Northern Ireland police regularly carry firearms. In Scotland, Wales and England, the typical officer relies on less lethal equipment such as nightsticks, pepper spray and tasers. In sum, we know Wikipedia’s count is far low, but we don’t know how low. When we alerted Parker to the information we were finding, she retracted her original article and wrote another. Parker wrote that ""U.S. police killed more people in one month than the U.K.’s did in an entire year."" While the underlying numbers this time are still incomplete, that’s more accurate. Our ruling Addicting Information said that ""U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century."" This comparison was based on an incomplete Wikipedia list. While hard figures for the number of police-related deaths in the United Kingdom over more than a century are impossible to come by, our research shows the comparison is inaccurate. It’s certainly unproven. That makes it deeply flawed, which means it’s False.",/factchecks/2015/apr/15/addicting-information/liberal-blog-us-cops-killed-more-people-one-month-/

Apple's Tim Cook: Texas considering law to punish clerks who issue marriage licenses to gay couples
","A Texas lawmaker’s attempt to restrict the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses drew backlash all the way from Silicon Valley. In an op-ed article for The Washington Post, Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook suggested certain states are being transparent in their efforts to discriminate against others, particularly those of the LGBT community. Cook, who announced he was gay in October 2014, used Texas as an example: ""Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year."" Cook was also speaking out against Indiana’s ""Religious Freedom Restoration Act,"" which was signed into state law at the end of March by Republican Gov. Mike Pence. The law sparked a national outcry over whether it permitted businesses the ability to discriminate against customers based on religious beliefs, criticism that quieted after Indiana lawmakers amended the legislation to include specific protections for gays and lesbians. But this doesn’t mean other similar bills haven’t been filed in other state legislators including Texas. And is such legislation under consideration in the Lone Star state? Apple doesn't elaborate To our inquiry, Apple Inc. spokeswoman Rachel Wolf declined to say where Cook got his information or to otherwise comment. But we have a hunch Cook was referring to House Bill 623, filed by state Rep. Cecil Bell, R-Magnolia, on Jan. 7, 2015 and drew more than 40 House Republican co-authors though no senator filed a companion. Bell’s HB 623, titled the ""Preservation of Sovereignty and Marriage Act,"" would block pay, pension and benefits of state or local government employees who issue a same-sex marriage license.   Of course, hundreds of proposals are offered by legislators that don’t get voted on. And, given Apple Inc.’s silence, we don’t know how Cook decided this proposal was ""being considered."" In contrast, legislative records indicate HB 623 was referred to a House committee Feb 23 but as of April 14, 2015, more than two weeks after Cook spoke, hadn’t been set for a hearing, though Bell earlier told us he’d requested one. Bell told the Texas Tribune in January 2015 that he filed the proposal to prevent any federal court or federal action from allowing gay marriage in Texas. ""The federal government is trying to act to create moral standards, and that’s just not acceptable,"" Bell said. By phone, Bell told us Cook’s description was a ""correct assessment"" of HB 623. He said county clerks are currently not authorized to issue same-sex marriage licenses in Texas, where the Constitution was amended in 2005 to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Bell said those same employees should not be compensated for doing activities that are against state law. ""As with any job, we are subject to the laws that we’re working under,"" Bell said. HB 623 v. SCOTUS  Next, we wondered if a state law can outflank a Supreme Court ruling. Along those lines, we hunted other perspectives. Here’s what’s coming up: On April 28, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a 150-minute argument regarding four gay marriage cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee challenging a law in each state. Then, before the court’s current term ends in June 2015, the justices are expected to make a ruling — potentially on whether gays and lesbians have the constitutional right to marry or states have the authority to decide restrictions one by one. Asked for his assessment, Jonathan Saenz of the conservative Texas Values group, which says it seeks ""to preserve and advance a culture of family values,"" told us the court might stop short of a sweeping move. ""No one knows how"" the court will rule or even if it will rule, Saenz emailed. Also, he said, its ""ruling may not settle or clarify anything."" Another take: A January 2015 USA Today news article suggested that if the justices determine gays have a right to marry based on the 14th Amendment, and that states have to recognize these marriages when licensed by other states, then Texas’ gay marriage ban would no longer be upheld in federal court. Significantly, as hinted by Cook, Bell’s proposal includes language to supersede the Supreme Court, if necessary. Specifically, section ""H"" of his proposal states: ""The State is not subject to suit in law or equity pursuant to the eleventh amendment of the United States Constitution for complying with the provisions of this section, regardless of a contrary federal court ruling."" Dan Quinn of the liberal Austin-based Texas Freedom Network, which describes itself as ""monitoring far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders,"" suggested this means that under HB 623, even if the Supreme Court endorses same-sex marriage, a Texas county clerk who issues a same-sex marriage license would face state penalties. ""The intention here is to pass laws that would subvert a Supreme Court ruling striking down the same-sex marriage ban,"" Quinn said. Earlier, Bell told us if HB 623 makes it into law, litigation might prove necessary to resolve whether Texas government employees could be penalized for issuing same-sex marriage licenses even after the U.S. Supreme Court’s endorsement of gay marriage. ""Conjecturally, it will call another lawsuit to determine the interaction between state laws and the power of the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Bell said. Not so fast, lawyers on opposite sides of the Supreme Court fight told us by phone. Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign, which says it’s the nation’s largest LGBT civil rights organization, and Lynn Wardle, a Brigham Young University law professor, each said that if the justices agree on a constitutional right to gay marriage, that judgment would apply in every state, regardless of state laws declaring otherwise. Wardle, who led in writing a March 2015 brief to the court pointing out the limited number of nations that allow gay marriage, said of the Texas proposal’s section H: ""In all candor, that’s some state legislator-politician’s dream. It’s not reality. The states cannot say we are going to order our courts to not follow the Constitution."" Warbelow called the section a kind of ""court stripping,"" generally meaning an effort to eliminate a court’s duties. State legislators can try to do this for state, but not federal, courts, she said. Our ruling  Cook said: ""Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year."" Cook fairly summarized Bell’s legislation. But clarification was missing in that the proposal wasn’t ""being considered"" by lawmakers either then or when we completed our review a couple of weeks later. Like a lot of bills, HB 623 awaited legislative attention. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"['Georgia', 'Tourism', 'Taxes', 'Michael T. Owens']","
New hotel fee adds costs - but not always to guests
","It was clear that everyone would pay a bit more when the Georgia Legislature rammed through a $900 million transportation funding bill that voters and businesses alike said the state needed. State gasoline taxes will increase by almost 35 percent. Electric vehicle drivers, who haven’t been paying for gas, and truckers both will see new annual fees. And if Gov, Nathan Deal signs the measure as expected, it also will add a $5-a-night fee on hotel and motel stays starting July 1. The hospitality industry opposed that last-minute provision. Michael T. Owens, President and CEO of the Tourism Leadership Council in Savannah, told GPB that the charge would have a ""serious effect"" in that tourist hotspot and statewide. ""We absolutely expect to see cancellations of major, major groups,"" he said. PolitiFact Georgia can’t fact-check predictions. But there is a part of Owens’ comments that calls out for a ride on the Truth-O-Meter:  claims that the fee would hurt convention business by adding tens of thousands of dollars in costs for large groups. Georgia does not have a statewide hotel tax. Instead state law allows local governments to levy up to a 3 percent excise tax or up to an 8 percent sales tax. Some of the collections have no limits while others must pay for tourism promotion or specific projects or attractions. Atlanta sets its hotel rate at the maximum 8 percent. Savannah charges 6 percent. The new charge is a flat $5 fee, tacked on for every night of a hotel stay. Owens was out of town when PolitiFact called, but Tourism Leadership Council Vice President Molly Swagler said the group is concerned about an increase to the bottom line of a multi-day stay. ""We would typically have a 500-room convention and that adds up to another $2,500 on their bill,"" Swagler said. ""In a larger market like Atlanta, you’ll see 15,000 room nights, so it could be a $75,000 increase out of a $5 fee."" Lawmakers did not discuss any of those figures in committee or public, since the fee was added only after a dramatically revised compromise bill. That means the fee was not part of the fiscal note, or official estimate of the effect a bill will have on tax revenues or public spending. Teresa MacCartney, the state’s chief financial officer, released the state Senate’s original fiscal note but said the updated report, with estimates from the bed tax, will not be available until later this week. Senators did request an analysis from the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of West Georgia, that will be part of that updated note. William J. Smith, the university’s economics chair who did the work on the fee, said his research involved collecting information about the average number of hotel rooms and occupancy rate in Georgia, plus the state’s share of tourism visits relative to the rest of the country. That gave an estimate of room nights per year that, multiplied by $5, showed the fee will generate about $160 million a year for transportation projects. In the most basic economics of supply and demand, that tab appears to back up tourism officials’ worry. After all, when prices go up, don’t people buy less? Sometimes. But there are more complex economic realities to that $5 fee. First, even tourism officials agree that the visitors who are set on seeing the historic squares and other Spanish-moss draped sites will still come. Paying $5 more every night could eat into those visitors’ budgets for their stay – costing restaurants and shops business. But there is nothing that says visitors must pay the new fee. Put bluntly, the hotel could eat the cost, if it meant remaining competitive with the likes of, say, Charleston, said Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University who specializes in the impact of projects and attractions. Seaman used 2013 data from the Savannah Area Chamber to see if the city’s hotels would be better off absorbing the cost or increasing the cost to guests. His math included sympathy to the idea that some guests would be sensitive to price changes and stay away. In his scenario, the price change could chase away about 7.5 percent of room nights – costing Savannah-areal hotels about $22.5 million a year. And if the hotels eat the $5 per night themselves? With 3.6 million room nights at a 67 percent occupancy rate, the price tag would be $18.7 million. ""The bottom line is, to whatever extent they pass along any of this cost to their customers, they will pay more in a year,"" Seaman said. ""Except, no one is requiring hotels to increase the price paid by customers and in this case, it looks like it would cost them less to eat it than pass it forward."" In other words, the overall point from Owens is legitimate. The $5 per-night fee is an increase that will affect business. That is, there are downsides to levying any new tax or fee. But part of that risk can be mitigated by the business eating some of the cost – additional context that shows there is not always a price increase with a new fee. More money is headed to state coffers if the transportation plan becomes reality. But the state is not requiring hotels, which change their rates constantly as a reflection of demand, to raise rates. Considering that caveat, we rate Owens’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/apr/15/michael-t-owens/new-hotel-fee-adds-costs-not-always-guests/

Kirsten Powers claims Rand Paul lied over opposition to Israel aid
","Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has acknowledged that he might need to temper his style during interviews. Paul had several testy encounters in his first week as a presidential candidate. But even the most pleasant demeanor in Washington won’t end the questions about policies he pushed for in the past. Speaking on Fox News Sunday on April 12, columnist and former Democratic operative Kirsten Powers said his views on money for Israel are entirely fair game and she focused on his conversation with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie. ""She was asking normal questions, and he actually was lying to her,"" Powers said. ""He's put forward a bill basically saying, I'm going to zero out foreign aid and specifically spoke about Israel, and he's acting all self righteous that he's being asked about it."" In this fact-check, we look at what Paul said during that NBC interview, and whether Powers is correct in saying Paul denied having a bill that would eliminate foreign aid and directly mentioned Israel. The interview Paul’s session with Guthrie got contentious when she asked him about his policy shifts, especially on Israel. Guthrie: ""You have had views on foreign policy that are unorthodox, but you seem to have changed. You said Iran was not a threat and now you say it is. You once proposed ending aid to Israel, and now you support it, at least for the time being. And once offered to drastically cut --"" Paul: ""Well, before we go, before we go --"" Guthrie: ""Wait, wait. Once wanted to drastically cut defense spending --"" Paul: ""Before we go into a litany of --"" Guthrie:  ""-- and now you want to increase it 16 percent. So I just wondered if you mellowed out?"" Paul: ""Why don’t we let me explain instead of talking over me, okay?"" When things settled down, Paul gave this response on Israel. Paul: ""My opinion has been we shouldn't borrow money from China to send it to any country. Pakistan, Israel or any other country. But I also realized that things will have to be done gradually and if we are going to try to eliminate or reduce foreign aid, why don’t we start with the countries that hate us or burn our flag. And the one thing that is true is that Israel doesn’t burn our flag. So I haven’t proposed removing aid from Israel, but I still agree --"" Guthrie: ""But you once did."" Paul: ""-- with the original precept. Let me answer the question. I agree with my original statement from years ago that ultimately, all nations should be free of foreign aid."" A tale of two budget proposals We dug into the question of Paul and money for Israel about a year ago and we can see the two-month period in 2011 when Paul changed his stance. In the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, we found a 65-page budget proposal released by Paul’s office in March 2011. Citing a pattern of squandered and unwise spending on foreign governments, the report offered a straightforward bottom line on foreign aid: ""Eliminate all international assistance."" The section on Israel says this: ""While this budget proposal does eliminate foreign aid to Israel, it is not meant to hurt, negate, or single out one of America’s most important allies. This proposal eliminates all foreign aid to all countries. Israel’s ability to conduct foreign policy, regain economic dominance, and support itself without the heavy hand of U.S. interests and policies, will only strengthen the Israeli community. The elimination of all foreign aid, including provisions to Israel, is not necessarily a new idea. In 1996, during an address before the U.S. Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his nation would eventually wean itself from dependence on U.S. foreign aid. Prominent Israeli politicians and economists alike have called for the end of foreign aid. Among them is economist Amon Gafney, who served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 1970 to 1981. He pointed out that foreign aid has caused Israel to suffer from ―Dutch Disease, a situation in which a generous gift brings short-term benefits but impairs a country’s long-term competitiveness."" This was not some trial balloon. Paul put his plan into writing within weeks of arriving at the Senate in January 2011, and he defended his position to eliminate aid to Israel in at least four separate interviews: On Jan. 26, 2011, on CNN, Feb. 3, 2011, with ABC, Feb. 8, 2011, on Fox News and in an interview with Slate, published Feb. 18, 2011. Paul was well aware that his view was unpopular. He told several interviewers that out of the $500 billion budget reduction he proposed, he was hearing the most complaints about the money for Israel.    ""The cuts to that one particular country were three-fifths of 1 percent of it,"" he told ABC. Later, he said on Fox News, ""I support Israel as our greatest ally in the Middle East, but at the same time, we can't give them money that we don't have."" You won’t find that proposal on Paul’s official website. By May 2011, Paul had a new budget plan, which we also found via the Internet Archive. Here are the title pages of both.  The new proposal scrapped the section on Israel in its entirety. Indeed, Israel isn’t mentioned anywhere in the 65-page document. Also, Paul’s new bottom line for foreign aid wasn’t to cut it to zero. Rather, the proposal said, ""Freeze foreign aid funding at $5 billion."" Though the report doesn’t say so explicitly, that would have been enough to cover the outlays for Israel. That plan was the one that came up for a vote in the Senate where it was rejected 90-7. Paul has since said that he favors continuing aid for Israel. The problem with Powers’ statement is that she said Paul had ""put forward a bill"" that cut all aid to Israel. The language there is sloppy. Paul put forward a concurrent resolution which is a way to capture the sense of the senators. Unlike a bill, if passed, such a resolution would never go before the president and would not have the force of law. Also, Paul changed his budget plan before he submitted it as a resolution. Powers told PunditFact that she was thinking of Paul’s first proposal and ""used the wrong terminology."" ""I don't know why I said bill when I knew it was a proposed budget plan,"" Powers said. Our ruling Powers said that Paul denied having a bill that would cut all foreign aid and specifically mentioned Israel. In Paul’s NBC interview, he said he hadn’t proposed removing aid from Israel. Actually, Paul put forward a budget proposal that cut aid to Israel and stood by it for at least three months before quietly dropping the idea.  The concurrent resolution that Paul proposed and that the Senate voted on did not cut aid to Israel. Powers is correct that Paul denied his effort to cut aid to Israel but she mischaracterized the form of his proposal. We rate the claim Half True.

Rick Scott says feds are 'walking away' from funding Florida's Low Income Pool program
","Florida simply can’t trust the federal government to follow through on expanding Medicaid because Washington has already abandoned funding a current statewide health care program, Gov. Rick Scott says. Scott is pointing to the state’s loss of federal money for safety net hospitals called the Low Income Pool. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services made it crystal clear in February 2015 that some $1.3 billion in Florida’s LIP funding won’t be renewed after June 30. That left a billion-dollar hole in Scott’s proposed budget, which assumed that LIP money would be available. ""The same federal government that offers some money for a program is walking away from another health care program,"" Scott said during an April 9 stop in Sarasota. ""How can you feel comfortable picking up another federal program when they are walking away from an existing program?"" The Florida House and Senate are currently debating a potential state solution to Medicaid expansion, but this claim deals with the specifics of this LIP funding -- namely what it is, how it’s funded and when Washington told Florida they’d be doing without. The issue sounds confusing, but don’t worry, PolitiFact Florida will nurse you through it. Washington gets out of the pool LIP money is part of a special agreement between Florida and Washington called a Section 1115 waiver, and was approved to deal with a burgeoning number of uninsured adults who could not pay their medical bills. (Some other states have their own 1115 programs to deal with different issues.) The money mostly goes to safety net hospitals and clinics that treat uninsured and underinsured patients to reimburse some of their expenses. The LIP fund gets about $1.3 billion, but the entire 1115 waiver program includes other supplemental programs that together total about $2.2 billion in federal matching funds. Only the LIP money is at stake here. These waivers are designed essentially as policy experiments. A state has a problem not covered by Medicaid and comes to Washington to help fund a possible solution. Programs approved by the feds have a five-year time limit, and are subsequently renewed in three-year intervals or allowed to expire. Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, said these waiver programs allow states to ""substantially modify their Medicaid policies and finances, provided that the purposes still serve the underlying purpose of Medicaid and do not cost the federal government more than it would have spent otherwise."" The LIP started in 2005 and was renewed until 2013. But when it came time to negotiate another extension for 2014 and beyond, Florida upped the funding request to a whopping $4.5 billion to expand the program. This was after the state refused some $51 billion in Medicaid expansion money over 10 years under the Affordable Care Act, to expand that program to anyone making up to about 133 percent of the poverty level, as the Obama administration wanted. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 ruled states had a choice whether to take the money or not. On April 11, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the state they were approving the LIP portion of the program for only one more year instead of the usual three-year extension. CMS required Florida to report how well the Medicaid system was working and suggest reforms, and asked the state to improve the system to work without federal LIP payments. The agency did not specifically mention expanding the program per the Affordable Care Act. Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, said the federal government had been concerned that the LIP program had problems keeping track of how the money was being spent or how rates were being set, shown in part by a 2012 General Accounting Office report on transparency. There also were questions about how Florida was matching federal funds, an issue with Medicaid even before the LIP program. The one-year extension in 2014 was notice that the federal government wanted Florida to overhaul LIP. Now fast forward to 2015: Scott released his budget proposal in January assuming that LIP funding, which was set to expire June 30, would be available. But in February, Eliot Fishman, director of the Children and Adults Health Programs Group in the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, told an Orlando health care conference audience that there was ""no way"" the program would continue ""in its present form."" Fishman’s pronouncement threw Tallahassee into an uproar, as discussions about a $1 billion surplus suddenly turned to big gaps in the budget. On March 4, Scott sent a letter to President Barack Obama saying the state needed the money to help the uninsured, but the funding was ""not associated with Medicaid expansion in any way."" Scott has opposed the Medicaid expansion for relying on tax dollars and for requiring the state to assume 10 percent of the larger program’s cost by 2020. He recently earned a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter after a short time of supporting the expansion during his re-election campaign. Some have suggested Washington is withholding LIP money to strongarm Florida into the expansion, a move many doctors oppose because of Medicaid payment limits, among other problems. In many ways, LIP isn’t associated with Medicaid expansion, Alker said, given that LIP started while Jeb Bush was governor and George W. Bush was president. But an expanded Medicaid would cover many of those patients, or use preventive care to keep them out of the hospital to begin with, she said. Washington and Lee University professor Timothy Jost added that money for the Medicaid expansion was guaranteed by law in the Affordable Care Act, something not true about the program that created LIP, which is doled out as discretionary spending. (Jost supports the health care law.) Of course, it’s technically possible the federal government could change the law to do away with whatever program they like, including Medicaid. But that would require both houses of Congress and the president to agree on the terms, something ""that isn’t likely to happen anytime soon,"" Jost said. Now Florida faces a tough set of choices: Find a new source of LIP funding, end the program altogether or negotiate with CMS to either revamp the program or get another extension, possibly for as short as one month. Florida also could decide to cover those patients by expanding Medicaid. With the Legislature still in session, experts said the result is anyone’s guess. But Alker said Scott was being disingenuous for blaming Washington for an issue they warned him was looming. ""The LIP doesn’t fix the fundamental problem,"" Alker said. ""The LIP is just a Band-Aid for the high rate of uninsured."" Our ruling Scott said, ""The same federal government that offers some money for a program is walking away from another health care program."" He was contrasting Medicaid expansion with how the federal government set an end date for funding for the Low Income Pool, a program that helps pay hospitals that served uninsured patients. The federal government did say it would stop paying for the program, so Scott has a point about losing LIP money. But possible brinkmanship about Medicaid expansion aside, Washington gave plenty of notice it was going to let the experimental LIP program expire. CMS told Florida in April 2014 that it was no longer going to fund the current version of LIP after one more year. Several experts said Florida had time to evaluate the program, make changes and address funding. They also raised the point that federal LIP funding is discretionary, while Medicaid money is guaranteed by law, which is unlikely to change anytime soon.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Voting Record', 'People for the American Way']","
Did Marco Rubio vote to deport Dreamers?
","On the day Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced his presidential campaign, opponents came out with an ad attacking his record. People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, released a Spanish-language radio ad that calls Rubio ""just another Republican with a dangerous plan"" and claims he supports tax cuts for the wealthy and cutting Medicare funding. The ad is set to run in Denver and Miami, Rubio’s hometown. The ad also pits Rubio against ""Dreamers"" -- young people who arrived in the United States illegally as children who have been granted temporary status for deferred deportation under a 2012 White House program. ""Instead of giving Dreamers an opportunity to go to college and build a future, Marco Rubio voted to deport them,"" the ad’s narrator said. Rubio, a son of Cuban immigrants, has long been an advocate for changing immigration law, including a path to citizenship. Did he really vote to deport the approximately 700,000 immigrants covered by this program? The votes A spokeswoman for People for the American Way sent us evidence for the ad, which points to three instances where the group believes Rubio voted on legislation that amounts to deporting Dreamers. We also reached out to Rubio’s staff but did not hear back. To be clear: Rubio did not vote on any sort of yes-no measure that specifically called for deporting this group of individuals. Rather, these three votes had to do with an appropriations bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. In February, the fight between Democrats and Republicans over Homeland Security funding ultimately turned into a proxy war over immigration. Many Republicans, including Rubio, wanted to pass a bill that funded Homeland Security but stripped money from programs that would fund the 2012 program -- called ""deferred action for childhood arrivals,"" or DACA -- as well as President Barack Obama’s 2014 executive action that attempts to extend deferred deportations to a larger group of people. Rubio voted in favor of this limiting funding three times this year (Feb. 3, Feb. 4 and Feb. 5). Nowhere does this version of the legislation say young people protected by Obama’s 2012 action would be deported. Though by stripping funding from the program, it’s possible that they wouldn’t be able to renew their participation in the program, meaning they could face a greater threat of deportation in the future. Politico described it as such: Gutting the program ""effectively could leave more than 600,000 of the so-called Dreamers open to being deported."" (Pew says there’s 700,000.) Senate Republicans also proposed a version of the bill that would have targeted Obama’s 2014 expanded executive action but continued funding for the 2012 deferred action for childhood arrivals program, protecting Dreamers from deportation. But Democrats didn’t bite, hoping instead for a bill that left both programs in tact. So that bill never came up for a vote. In any case, the votes referenced by People for the American Way were not final; they would have simply moved the bill closer to a vote on final passage. Democrats blocked the bill from moving any further, and eventually Congress passed ""clean"" Homeland Security funding that did not block Obama’s immigration orders. While he does not support expanding the program to apply to more recent arrivals, Rubio expressed support for maintaining Dreamers’ status in the days after the vote -- at least while Congress works on a permanent solution.   ""Eventually that program has to end. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States,"" he said in a Feb. 18 press gaggle. ""What I'm not advocating is that we cancel it right now at this moment, because you already have people that have signed up for it. They're working, they're going to school. It would be deeply disruptive. But at some point, it has to come to an end. It can't be the permanent policy. And my hope is that it would come to an end because it's replaced by a permanent solution like the one I've outlined through the three-step process."" It’s worth noting that back in 2012, Rubio supported a plan quite similar to Obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals program. A spokesman told the Tampa Bay Times that Rubio’s plan never materialized because they were concerned that it would encourage illegal immigration. Our ruling A radio ad from People for the American Way said, ""Marco Rubio voted to deport"" young people known as Dreamers. Rubio did not literally vote to deport young immigrants protected by Obama’s ""deferred action for childhood arrivals"" program. He voted in favor of an appropriations bill that would have stripped funding from the program, which might have resulted in future deportations if it had passed. But that’s only speculation. Additionally, Rubio has specifically said that he does not support affecting the status of current Dreamers, though he does oppose expanding the program and has said it should not be permanent policy. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/apr/14/people-american-way/did-marco-rubio-vote-deport-dreamers/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal's statement on education funding missing critical context
","Gov. Nathan Deal has promised financially strapped local school districts that better days are ahead. He started down that road last year. When running for re-election, he won legislative approval of a 2015 state budget that reduced the education austerity cut to $747 million, the lowest since 2009. In his latest State of the State address, Deal said public education remains a budget priority. ""This year’s budget, coupled with my proposal for next year’s budget, represents an infusion of over one billion additional dollars for K-12 education,"" he told a joint session of the state House and Senate on Jan. 14. Those were sweet-sounding words to educators. But do they ring true? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check now that state lawmakers have met for their annual 40-day session and approved a 2015 revised state budget, as well as a budget of about $21.8 billion for 2016. We began our fact-check by contacting Jen Talaber, a Deal spokeswoman. Talaber said the governor put more than $1.2 billion in additional money into K-12 education in the two budget cycles. Specifically, the state Department of Education received $535,118,581 in the Fiscal 2015 budget, $139,242,817 in the 2015 amended budget and $557,647,889 in the 2016 budget, for a total of $1,232,009,287, she said. A majority of the money is going to two big-ticket items: reducing the austerity cuts and covering annual student enrollment growth, state records show. An austerity cut is the gap between what a district needs to provide a quality education to all its students, as determined by the Quality Basic Education (QBE) formula, and the amount of money the General Assembly and governor approve. The first austerity cut was implemented in 2003, pre-Great Recession. In the years that have followed, the state’s 180 local districts have collectively been shortchanged about $8 billion, based on the formula. As a result, many districts have raised class sizes, abandoned the traditional 180-day school calendar, dropped electives and furloughed staff in recent years. Deal last year reduced the annual austerity cut -- which had hovered around $1 billion -- to $747 million by sending the districts collectively an additional $314 million. For the upcoming fiscal year, he proposed and lawmakers approved giving them an additional $280 million to reduce the austerity cut to about $460 million. Those back-to-back austerity reductions absorbed about $594 million -- or nearly half of the $1.2 billion. Student enrollment growth took another big share. For example, the 2015 amended state budget included $128.5 million to send to school districts for new students who enrolled last August. ""That doesn’t enable us to provide new services,"" said Claire Suggs an education policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said of the enrollment payments. ""We’re just keeping up."" In the recent General Assembly session, lawmakers agreed that 22,000 part-time school employees and their dependents should be able to remain on the State Health Benefit Plan,  the state's health insurance program for teachers, retirees and state workers. Deal had proposed booting part-time school bus drivers and cafeteria workers off the coverage. But both chambers said local school districts need to come up with $103 million more in the upcoming year to pay for coverage for the so-called non-certified school employees. Our Ruling: The governor said in his State of the State address that the 2015 and 2016 state budgets represent an infusion of $1 billion in additional money for K-12 education. To districts that, in 2014, collectively were living with $1 billion in austerity cuts and next year will see those reduced to about $460 billion, that probably does seem rejuvenating. Deal’s statement is accurate, but also misleading. A billion-plus additional dollars will be in the budget, but most of the money is going to cover routine growth in student enrollment and to reduce austerity cuts. We rate the governor’s statement Half True.    ",/factchecks/2015/apr/14/nathan-deal/deals-statement-education-funding-missing-critical/

90% of American workers don't own their own business, Rick Santorum says
","Rick Santorum, a potential candidate for president in 2016, argues that the Republicans should focus more on people working for businesses than people who own businesses, if only because of simple math. Santorum said Republicans need to concentrate more on the concerns of ordinary voters. ""I've made the central focus of what I've been out talking about the fact that 90 percent of American workers don't own their own business. They're actually working for businesses and that Republicans better have a message that appeals to their place in the world today and their opportunity to rise in society,"" Santorum said on CBS’s Face the Nation on April 5, 2015. We wanted to know whether Santorum is correct that 90 percent of the American workers do not own their own business. Matthew E. Bynon, a staff member at Santorum’s organization Patriot Voices, sent us a link to a policy brief, ""The Causes of Racial Disparities in Business Performance,"" from the National Poverty Center. This 2008 article mentions in its introduction, ""Roughly 1 in 10 workers owns a business,"" which are ""13 million business owners."" The report based its numbers on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census report Survey of Business Owners estimated the number of business owners as 20.4 million in 2007. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the labor force in 2007 was about 153 million people. So there were around 13.3 percent business owners, a little higher than Santorum’s source. A new census survey about business owners will be released in May.   The economists of the Small Business Administration used more recent data from 2012 and found a slightly higher percentage of business owners as well. The SBA found that about 16 percent of people owned a business, said staff member Miguel Ayala. It’s important to note that the SBA based its 16 percent number on total employment of about 116 million people. If you use the entire labor force, both employed and unemployed, the number drops to 11.8 percent. So the SBA estimates the total of business owners in the United States to be 18.3 million people. The census found out that there were 20.4 million business owners back in 2007. We couldn’t help noticing that the data Santorum referred to does not match, because it says 13 million. So we asked Robert W. Fairlie, economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for an explanation. Fairlie was one of the authors who wrote the study ""Black-, Asian-, and White-Owned Businesses in the United States,"" which was used for the NPC policy brief Santorum referred to. Fairlie said there are different ways to define small business owners. Not all people who own a business do it as their main source of employment. ""The 20.4 million businesses represents all business entities and not necessarily what someone does for their main job activity. If someone gets a little self-employment income, but mainly works as a wage or salary worker, then they would not get included in the 13 million number of business owners, but would get included in the 20.4 million definition,"" Fairlie said in an email. Our ruling Santorum said 90 percent of people don’t own their own business. Several sources show that Santorum’s number is close. However, there are different ways to count whether someone owns a business or not, and so the percentages are approximate. Overall, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/apr/13/rick-santorum/90-american-workers-dont-own-their-own-business-ri/

Scott Walker says Clinton, Obama backed laws similar to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act
","Concerns about Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act were broad enough that the head coaches competing in the Final Four college basketball championship, including Wisconsin's Bo Ryan, issued a joint statement saying ""discrimination of any kind should not be tolerated."" The Indiana law, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, ""allows individuals to use religion as an excuse to discriminate against LGBT people and other minorities."" Yet later on the day the coaches issued their statement, April 1, 2015, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called reactions from around the country overblown, saying the new law is not so unusual. Asked by Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio talk show host in Milwaukee, if he would sign Indiana's law, Walker replied: ""We don't need to. In Wisconsin, we have it in our Constitution."" The front-running potential presidential candidate added: ""And remember, it's not just what we have here. I mean, President Clinton signed something very similar to this nationally back in '93. President Obama voted for something like this in the neighboring state of Illinois when he was a state senator. I just think this is people who are chronically looking for ways to be upset about things, instead of really looking at what it is."" So, is the Indiana law merely a similar version of a federal law signed by Bill Clinton and an Illinois law backed by Barack Obama? The backdrop All of this dates back more than 30 years to Alfred Smith and Galen Black. They worked as alcohol and drug counselors at a private drug rehabilitation organization in Oregon. Both were members of the Native American Church and, for sacramental purposes, ingested small amounts of peyote, an illegal, hallucinogenic drug, during a church ceremony. They were later fired, one of them in 1983 and one in 1984. The two were denied unemployment compensation under an Oregon law that disqualified employees who were discharged for work-related ""misconduct"" and their case went to court. In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Oregon could prohibit the religious use of peyote, and therefore could deny unemployment compensation to the two workers. That ruling led to federal legislation -- which, like the Indiana law, is called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- that Clinton signed into law in 1993. Four years later, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law didn’t apply to states. That kicked off a spree of states passing their own versions of the law. Currently, 21 states have such religious freedom laws. In 2015, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states have introduced legislation regarding the creation of, or alteration to, a state religious freedom law. (Wisconsin is not among the 21 or the 16.) Language The intent of the 1993 federal law was to protect religious practices -- such as Native Americans using peyote as part of religious practices, or a Muslim prison guard wearing a beard -- from government interference. Illinois, in 1998, was among the initial wave of states that approved state versions of the federal law. All Illinois state senators, including Obama, voted for it.   Indiana’s law carries the same title as the federal and Illinois laws and much of the same language. But there are a couple of differences. Under Indiana’s law a ""person"" is extended to mean ""a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association"" or other entity. That doesn’t appear in the federal law. However, the federal law has now been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court (in what is known as the Hobby Lobby case) to extend in this same way to private companies and associations. Indiana’s law states it can be used to protect religious freedom in private disputes, even if the government is not a party. That provision has been viewed as having been written to specifically cover a situation such as a New Mexico photographer who did not want to participate in a same-sex wedding. However, the day after Walker made his claim, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a revision to the law. The revised law prohibits service providers from using it as a legal defense for refusing to provide goods, services, facilities or accommodations. It also bars discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or U.S. military service. Context On another level, the context between the federal and Illinois laws on the one hand, and the Indiana law on the other, has changed. Whereas the earlier laws were adopted to protect religious practices from government interference, conservatives in Indiana and elsewhere see the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage. At the private signing ceremony for the original version of the Indiana law, people who work for groups that oppose same-sex marriage were in attendance. And one of the lobbyists heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty ""for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples."" Generally speaking, there isn’t all that much difference between the Indiana law and the Illinois and federal laws. But proponents of the Indiana law are pushing the measure as a way that businesses can seek protection ""for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage."" That was far from what prompted the federal and Illinois laws. A final note: Another possible GOP presidential contender, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, made a claim similar to Walker’s, saying Florida has a religious freedom law like Indiana’s. PolitiFact Florida found the Florida law is in line with the federal law, and rated Bush’s statement Half True. Our rating Walker said Bill Clinton signed a federal law ""very similar to,"" and Obama voted for an Illinois law ""something like,"" Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act.   The three laws share the same title and much of the same language, but Indiana’s law has at least two significant provisions that the other two laws don’t. Moreover, the federal and Illinois laws were passed with the intent to protect various religious practices from government intervention. Conversely, supporters of the Indiana law see it as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2015/apr/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-bill-clinton-barack-obama-backed/
"['Debt', 'Health Care', 'Virginia', 'Dave Brat']","
Brat says Obamacare repeal would save nation more than $2 trillion
","U.S. Rep. Dave Brat is backing a federal budget plan recently proposed by his fellow House Republicans -- in no small part because it would end Obamacare. ""This budget fulfills Republicans’’ pledge to voters to repeal Obamacare in its entirety -- including all of the tax increases, job-killing regulations and mandates -- saving our nation more than $2 trillion,"" Brat, R-7th, said in a written statement.  He tweeted a similar message. We wondered whether the death of Obamacare -- formally known as the Affordable Care Act -- really would save the U.S. more than $2 trillion. Brian Gottstein, Brat’s director of communications, told us the figure -- which is cited in the GOP proposal -- came from a Jan. 26 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It estimated that mandatory federal spending provisions in the ACA would cost $2.03 trillion over the next 10 years. But an immediate problem arises from Brat’s use of the figure: The estimate was out of date when the congressman made his statement on March 17. Eight days earlier, the CBO issued a new report dropping the 10-year price tag to $1.75 trillion. The agency reduced its estimate because it concluded that spending on health care during the next 10 years will not be as high as previously predicted. As a result, the CBO said insurers are not expected to charge as much as once expected for health plans and the government will save on subsidies to cover low- and moderate-income families. Also, savings are being generated because fewer companies than expected are cancelling their insurance plans and fewer people, therefore, are turning to the ACA for coverage. All of this begs a question: Would Brat have been accurate if he had cited the latest CBO report and said repealing Obamacare would save the U.S. more than $1.7 trillion? The answer is no. The reason is that the ACA was set up to be self supporting, with a series of new taxes and health care efficiencies balancing the costs. Brat’s statement focuses on the expenses of Obamacare but ignores the revenue and saving sides of the program, which also would be wiped out by the repeal. The CBO examined the bottom line in 2012 at the request of House Speaker John Boehner, who wanted to know what effect abolishing Obamacare would have on the national debt. In such a case, the agency concluded, deficits would increase by $109 billion over 10 years. That figure has not been updated. The agency concluded that the ACA would more than pay for itself by generating almost $1.79 trillion in revenues and savings over 10 years. Of that amount: *$711 billion would come from efficiencies built into the ACA that would slow the projected growth in Medicare spending. The bulk of those savings would come from lower federal reimbursements to hospitals and reduced payments to Medicare Advantage -- an HMO program offered by private companies that contract with Medicare. These savings would disappear with the repeal of Obamacare. *Almost $1.08 trillion would come from an assortment of ACA taxes. Under Obamacare, for example, companies with at least 50 full-time employees face fines for not providing health coverage and so do individuals who can afford policies but don’t buy them. The ACA also increases payroll and capital gains taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000. Some might say that the repeal of Obamacare -- even if it doesn’t lower deficits --would at least save taxpayers more than $1 trillion in new levies. But this contention does not hold up under the Republican budget proposal that Brat endorses. That’s because the House plan, while abolishing the Obamacare taxes, counts their revenues in its long-term bottom line. In addition to ending ACA levies, the plan also calls for lowering individual, family and corporate income tax rates. House Republicans say they would completely fill the revenue holes by closing unidentified ""special interest"" tax loopholes. Our ruling Brat says the repeal of Obamacare, as envisioned in the House GOP budget proposal, would save ""our nation more than $2 trillion."" The congressman, an economist, gets his figure from an outdated CBO estimate of 10-year ACA costs. An updated analysis, published eight days before Brat’s statement, put the cost at $1.75 trillion. But there’s a much larger problem: Brat’s claim only deals with the expense side of Obamacare and ignores a series of built-in special taxes and health care efficiencies that the CBO has said more than enables the program to pay for itself. Brat describes the repeal of the ACA as the death of its mandates, regulations and ""all of the the tax increases."" The CBO has estimated such a repeal -- instead of saving the nation money -- would wind up increasing federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years. We rate Brat’s statement False.  ",/factchecks/2015/apr/13/dave-brat/brat-says-obamacare-repeal-would-save-nation-2-tri/
"['Candidate Biography', 'PunditFact', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney said Hillary Clinton deleted emails that were subject to congressional review
","Hillary Clinton’s announcement that she would run for president was met with a round of attacks from Republicans on the Sunday shows. Taking up the cause on Fox News Sunday was 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. ""You've seen in polls and in discussions across the country a feeling that Hillary Clinton is just not trustworthy,"" Romney said April 12, 2015. ""This whole story about her having erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress, I think that's made people remember that with the Clintons, it's always something."" We have dissected before the web of laws and regulations that surround Clinton’s use of a private email account as Secretary of State. For this fact-check, we look at Romney’s claim that she erased all of her emails when they should have been kept for use by Congress. A review of the facts shows Romney had a point, but he mangled the details. A quick recap In March, the public learned that instead of using a State Department email account when she was in charge, Clinton ran all of her email through a private server in her New York home. When State Department officials asked for copies of her government-related emails late last year, Clinton’s staff went through her files and sent over about 30,000. According to Clinton, about an equal number of emails were judged to be personal and were erased. Specific to Romney’s statement that Clinton erased all of her emails, there is no question that she preserved and delivered thousands to the State Department. Clinton has said that all of this was in line with federal regulations. We have found that it isn’t so cut and dried. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) oversees federal recordkeeping, and its code requires federal agencies to keep records that document agency activity so that they are readily available when needed -- such as for Freedom of Information Act requests or congressional inquiries. However, not all records need be retained. Agencies have the discretion to delete material that is deemed to have no value. The laws are tighter today than when Clinton was secretary, but even during her tenure, her sole reliance on a private email account skirted the law, experts tell us. ""The key thing is that while use of a personal account was not prohibited, exclusive use of it was,"" said Daniel Metcalfe, professor of law at American University and former director of the Department of Justice’s Office of Information Policy. With a State Department email account, all of Clinton’s emails would have been stored on a government computer. Any researcher or government body would then have access, pending the normal privacy and security reviews. (That said, the department preserves relatively few emails.) Clinton’s private email account changed the process completely. She, not a government worker, had control over the emails, and even though emails she sent to government workers would have been saved under their email accounts, searching those records would be infinitely more complicated. Romney’s botched wording The legal experts we reached said Romney’s use of the phrase ""recall and review by Congress"" is ambiguous. (We tried to reach Romney for clarification and did not hear back by the time we published. If we learn more, we will update this fact-check.) Jason R. Baron is a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath and a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration. Baron told PunditFact that in the most literal sense, Congress plays no role at all in deciding what materials should be preserved when an official leaves office. ""This is an executive branch function,"" Baron said. ""In most agencies when a senior official leaves, there is a protocol to review the documents that the official might have. The Federal Records Act doesn’t expect Congress to review anything."" On the other hand, Congress has the right to subpoena records as part of an investigation and congressional committees have been investigating the deaths at the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. This might be what Romney had in mind. But if he did, that makes his point even harder to prove. Douglas Cox is a law professor who specializes in government records law at the City University of New York. Cox said Romney is on thin ice if he meant that Clinton ducked a congressional subpoena. ""Clinton has stated that she turned over to the State Department any records responsive to congressional subpoena at the time,"" Cox said. ""An allegation that she destroyed records subject to subpoena is a serious one, and it is speculative absent more specific evidence."" Baron raises one legal wrinkle that might bolster Romney’s claim. He said it’s possible that Clinton had a reasonable expectation that a committee might want to dig further. Baron said in the private sector, if you think that a future lawsuit might call for certain records, you should keep them. ""If I were her lawyer, I would have told her that it would be prudent to preserve any evidence that might be subject to a congressional inquiry,"" Baron said. Regardless of the legal arguments on that score, Baron said he believes that what Clinton did -- stepping down without a department review of her records and then unilaterally deleting some -- was inconsistent with the spirit if not the letter of the Federal Records Act. Cox shares that view, even as he discounts Romney’s statement. ""Clinton's decision to destroy all emails that she and her private attorneys unilaterally decided were not federal records is both shocking and suspicious,"" Cox said. ""But the problem is that not all of her emails were ‘subject to recall and review by Congress.’ There is plenty of justifiable criticism for Clinton's actions, but that does not appear to be one of them."" Our ruling Romney said that Clinton ""erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress."" Romney got it wrong when he spoke of all of her emails. We know that about 30,000 emails were turned over to the State Department. Romney’s words about recall and review by Congress are ambiguous. In terms of preserving records, legal experts agree that Congress has no direct role. That is a function of the executive branch. In terms of a congressional investigation, a legal expert told us Clinton did respond to congressional subpoenas, and there is no proof she destroyed evidence subject to a congressional investigation. Romney’s statement contains an element of truth -- Clinton did delete some emails -- but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Rand Paul attacks Hillary Clinton's response to Benghazi attack
","With Hillary Clinton making her presidential run official, Republicans from Mitt Romney to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul jumped at the chance Sunday to revisit Clinton’s biggest controversies from her tenure as secretary of state. Paul, who entered the presidential race last week, turned to the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by armed militants on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. The attack was ""a 3 a.m. phone call that she never picked up,"" he told Dana Bash of CNN’s State of the Union. ""She didn't provide the security, not just that day, for nine months,"" Paul said. ""Dozens and dozens of requests for more security, all completely ignored by Hillary Clinton."" Paul’s claim that Clinton herself ignored a litany of security requests for the Benghazi outpost does not completely check out, though it is true that the U.S. diplomats in Libya had warned of insufficient protection and the deteriorating climate in eastern Libya in the months ahead of Stevens’ death. The accuracy of his claim comes down to this: There is no hard proof that Clinton ""completely ignored"" ""dozens and dozens"" of requests for more staffing. Still, there is smoke. Clinton’s reason for not responding to requests from U.S. diplomats in Libya outlining the need for enhanced security staffing was simple: The requests did not make it up to her through the chain of command, she has said. To critics like Paul, Clinton assumes responsibility for what went wrong during her four years at secretary of state regardless of whether she was informed. ""Did the State Department, under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's leadership, deny the request for additional security? The answer is yes,"" said Paul spokesman Eleanor May. Experts say we may never know what Clinton knew about the security shortfalls in Benghazi, which officials envisioned as a temporary outpost to monitor eastern Libya’s nation-building efforts after the collapse of the Moammar Gadhafi regime. ""I would be suspect of anyone making firm conclusions one way or another,"" said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist and expert in Middle Eastern affairs at the RAND Corporation. What investigations found Multiple investigations of what went wrong that night revealed lower-level diplomats made repeated requests to boost security in Libya. The State Department’s Accountability Review Board in December 2012 noted ""certain senior State Department officials within two bureaus demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in their responses to security concerns posed by Special Mission Benghazi, given the deteriorating threat environment and the lack of reliable host government protection."" The board did not directly blame Clinton or any specific employee. Congressional Republicans, including Paul, have highlighted diplomatic cables bearing Clinton’s name between diplomats in Libya and State Department officials as evidence of turning a blind eye. Almost two years ago, PolitiFact rated a similar claim from Paul that Clinton ""was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions, including direct cables,"" as Mostly False. Paul’s office reasoned that diplomatic cables, called ""telegrams,"" sent from diplomats in Libya to Washington and addressed to ""SECSTATE"" in ""WASHDC""  were evidence of a direct message to Clinton about the security needs. But that markup appears on 1.4 million cables the department receives each year and is the standard ""location indicator"" for the entire State Department, including the Peace Corps, according to the Foreign Affairs Manual. So just because Clinton’s position was on the telegram doesn’t mean it was intended for her desk. When she testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January 2013, she said requests from staff in Libya never came to her and she ""was not aware of that going on."" Other Republican committee reviews of the Benghazi attack focused on the other side of diplomatic messaging. Any cable from Washington to an embassy around the world bears the name of the secretary of state, even if she did not personally send it. In April 2013, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released an interim report that  highlighted ""numerous communications"" from U.S. officials in Libya asking for more security staff and Washington officials turning them down. This GOP report focused on two cables and two emails exchanged among diplomats in Libya who requested more security staff and Washington officials who said no, preferring training Libyan security staff instead, in the months ahead of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. The investigation held up Clinton’s ""signature"" on one cable from April 2012 as proof that requests for more protection at the vulnerable compound were ""denied at the highest levels of the State Department."" Again, just because Clinton’s name was on it doesn’t mean the rejection came from her desk. Any cable coming out of Washington would bear her ""signature."" (Here’s more on an ""absurd"" cable signature claim from the Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler, who covered the State Department for nine years.) In a May 2013 House Oversight Committee hearing, Republicans questioned the State Department’s former regional security officer in Libya, Eric Nordstrom, who authored some of the messages asking for more security staff. Nordstrom said he expected Clinton to have read his cable, or at least know about it, because she ""had an involvement in the security process"" and had toured the facilities. However, when asked if the State Department’s review board let anyone off easy for the security lapses, Nordstrom brought up the undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy — not Clinton. ""There is something apparently wrong with the process of how those security recommendations are raised to the secretary,"" he said. ‘Dozens and dozens’ Paul said there were ""dozens and dozens of requests for more security"" that Clinton ignored. A firm number for the requests is elusive, experts said. Paul’s office directed us to 120 pages of declassified documents released by the House Oversight Committee as documenting the dozens of requests. The packet contains some of the emails already discussed, as well as weekly reports from the embassy detailing the ""security vacuum"" of the city, a 50-page report by Nordstrom detailing security issues in Tripoli and Benghazi from June 1, 2011, to July 2012, as well as other safety evaluations. But we only counted a half-dozen emails concerning requests for security for Benghazi. What the real number is is hard to say. ""It may very well have been dozens and dozens, but we don’t know that information,"" Brennan said, saying Paul might have been ""overplaying his hand"" here. Our ruling Paul said Clinton ""didn't provide the security, not just that day, for nine months,"" for the consulate in Benghazi, and she completely ignored ""dozens and dozens of requests for more security."" The numerous requests from officials on the ground in Libya for better security for the Benghazi compound are undeniable and well-documented, though saying ""dozens and dozens"" might be an overstatement. Paul is treading into uncertain waters in saying Clinton flat-out ignored those requests. No one has shown Clinton willfully ignored the cries for help from Libya. Paul did not claim cables went to Clinton directly as he has in the past, but he came fairly close. His statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/apr/12/rand-paul/rand-paul-attacks-hillary-clintons-response-bengha/

Disputed KGB memo sparks Mac Owens claim that Kennedy tried to help Soviets undermine Reagan policy
","Forty-seven U.S. senators, all Republicans, ignited a strong reaction last month when they signed a letter that notified the ""Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran"" that any treaty with the U.S. on nuclear weapons would require Senate approval. Secretary of State John Kerry accused the letter’s signatories of diplomatic interference that treaded on more than two centuries of  precedent. The Republicans’ letter, Kerry charged, was an attempt to pressure Iran’s leaders to negotiate with 535 members of Congress rather than with the administration. Other reaction, in support of the senators, came from some critics of the administration, including pundit Rush Limbaugh. On March 18, Newport’s Mackubin Thomas Owens joined Limbaugh in spotlighting a purported 1983 episode involving Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy and Republican President Ronald Reagan. ""In the early 1980s, Sen. Edward Kennedy secretly offered to help Soviet leaders counter the Reagan administration’s position on nuclear disarmament,"" Owens wrote in a piece on the op-ed page of The Providence Journal. A former professor at the Naval War College, Owens directed legislative affairs for the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons programs during the Reagan administration. Much of his op-ed article amounted to an effort to provide context on Congress’ role in foreign affairs and he did not take a side on the senators’ letter to Tehran. But like Limbaugh, Owens did latch onto the alleged episode involving Kennedy, arguing that it exemplifies the ""rank hypocrisy"" of Democrats accusing Republicans of undermining U.S. foreign policy. We wondered what Owens might know about any secret outreach to the Soviets made by Kennedy and we asked him for his sources. Owens cited a 2009 article in Forbes, which was based on a KGB memo about Kennedy. He forwarded us a copy of the memo.   PunditFact, an arm of PolitiFact, recently examined the same memo while fact-checking a statement that Limbaugh made about the Kennedy matter. PunditFact found serious issues with the memo and labeled Limbaugh’s statement False. The KGB memo referring to Kennedy first emerged in the early 1990s and it was the basis of a news report published in the Times of London in 1992. Written by the head of the Soviet spy agency, Viktor Chebrikov, the 1983 memo was addressed to the Soviet Union’s top leader, Yuri Andropov, general secretary of of the Communist Party. Chebrikov discussed  Kennedy’s purported  views  on Soviet-American relations and claimed Kennedy had a proposal to counter Reagan’s disarmament position. The spymaster based his memo on information provided by an intermediary, not by Kennedy himself.   In the first sentence of the memo, Chebrikov signals that the information he is about to share in the letter comes from ""a close friend and trusted confident"" of Kennedy, who he says had visited Moscow on May 9 and May 10 of 1983. The memo identifies the intermediary as ""J. Tunney,"" a  reference to John Tunney, a private businessman and former Democratic U.S. senator who had been friends with Kennedy since law school. Tunney, Chebrikov wrote, had spoken to the Soviets on the senator’s behalf, sharing Kennedy’s perspectives on Reagan’s foreign policy and delivering ""a message"" for Andropov. At that time in 1983, Reagan’s plan to station medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe had concerned the leadership of the USSR. ""Kennedy believes that, given the current state of affairs, and in the interest of peace, it would be prudent and timely to undertake the following steps to counter the militaristic politics of Reagan and his campaign to psychologically burden the American people,"" the memo says. The steps proposed by Kennedy, through Tunney, according to the memo, included an invitation for the senator to visit Moscow where he could ""arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament."" The memo says Andropov could then use these explanations during appearances on the big three broadcast networks and speak to the ""peaceful intentions of the USSR."" It also says that Kennedy wanted the Soviets to invite a Republican, possibly Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, to Moscow. As PolitiFact reported last month, Tunney told the The Times of London in 1992 that Chebrikov’s information was baloney, using an off-color term. Tunney emphatically repeated that denial last month in an interview with Politifact. ""The idea that I would be handling contacts with Andropov is preposterous,"" he said. ""The memo is completely false."" When PolitiFact asked archivists at the Reagan Library to search White House files on Kennedy, they were unable to find any episode involving the USSR in 1983. A search by the Senate Historical Office didn’t find anything either. According to PolitiFact, Stephen Cohen, a Princeton University political scientist with years of archival experience in Soviet era documents, said that many KGB documents were false and the papers cannot be taken at face value. In addition, a spokesman for Kennedy acknowledged in a 1992 exchange with a Boston Herald reporter that the senator had made other efforts to meet with Andropov, but nothing came of that outreach and ""the rest of the memo is KGB fiction."" Kennedy’s activities in Congress weren’t  in lock-step with Reagan’s foreign policy. In 1982, for example, Kennedy and Hatfield proposed a resolution calling for both the U.S. and the Soviet Union to establish a freeze on the testing and production of nuclear weapons prior to negotiating reductions in armaments. Reagan rejected the proposal, asserting that an immediate freeze would put the U.S. at a disadvantage due to the Soviets’ ""definite margin of superiority."" He wanted reductions in armaments, to achieve parity, and then a freeze. Despite such public disagreements, the memoirs of Reagan’s disarmament negotiator Max Kampelman suggest that the administration appreciated the back-channel information conduit that Kennedy maintained with the Soviets. Kampelman’s memoirs say he welcomed Kennedy’s contact with the Soviets and in 1985 Reagan approved the arrangement. ""I learned that the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency of official,"" Kampelman wrote. Our ruling Who’s to be believed? A couple of Washington politicos? The KGB? That’s a tough one. Owens’ statement rests on a 1983 KGB memo. The memo says a friend of Kennedy’s had made a verbal overture for the senator to meet with Andropov as part of an effort to counter the Reagan administration’s position on nuclear disarmament. The man who allegedly made the secret offering says the memo is completely false. Kennedy’s spokesman and Reagan’s disarmament negotiator have attested to the senator’s work behind the scenes with the Soviets, but neither says Kennedy worked secretly to undercut the President, as Owens claimed. So given Tunney’s denial, Kampelman’s memoir, and also questions about the reliability of KGB memos in general, we rate Owens’ claim, Mostly False.

Rand Paul attributes NH motto 'Live Free or Die' to its founders
","U.S. Sen. Rand Paul invoked New Hampshire's state motto while speaking to its residents this week, seizing a chance to emphasize the idea that his libertarian-leaning ideals align with Granite State history. ""When the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die, they didn't leave a lot of wiggle room,"" he said to a crowd in Milford's town hall in his first New Hampshire appearance since announcing his run for president. ""New Hampshire founders didn’t seek out the mushy middle. They admonished you to live free."" The Kentucky Republican didn't just use the phrase. He attempted to explain where it came from. And it looks like he got a little mixed up along the way. We reached out to Paul’s New Hampshire advisors, but didn’t hear back. New Hampshire was one of the original 13 states and ratified the U.S. Constitution on June 21, 1788. Before that it was formed as a royal province in 1677, and John Cutt was its first president. The words ""Live Free or Die,"" as cited by New Hampshire law, were written by General John Stark on July 31, 1809 – long after New Hampshire became a state. A legendary military man, Stark offered the phrase as a toast. Because of his failing health, he declined an invitation to head up a reunion of the 1777 Battle of Bennington in Vermont, but left the group with those famous words. A similar invitation was extended again the following year, saying, ""The toast, sir, which you sent us in 1809 will continue to vibrate with unceasing pleasure in our ears, 'Live Free or Die; Death Is Not the Worst of Evils.' "" It must still have been vibrating in 1945, when the motto was formally adopted by the state Legislature. Who ""the founders of New Hampshire"" are depends on your definition, but Stark isn't typically considered among them. They could be the group that turned a community of towns into a ""royal province"" in 1679 – 49 years before Stark was born. They could also be the Congress of New Hampshire, which created in 1776 an independent constitution. Or they could be the people that ratified the U.S. Constitutiona few years later. But none of those groups included Stark. Nevertheless, a strong liberty-oriented sentiment existed in the state long before Stark, and even before it was called New Hampshire. Among the earliest explorers of New Hampshire was Captain John Smith of England, who upon seeing the land is quoted as saying, ""Here should be no landlords to rack us with high rents, or extorted fines to consume us. Here every man may be a master of his own labor and land in a short time."" And in 1775, less than a year before New Hampshirites drew up their own constitution, Patrick Henry uttered famous words, ""Give me liberty or give me death,"" that people outside of New Hampshire often confuse with the state motto. Henry delivered those remarks during a speech in Virginia during the American Revolution. It’s fair to assume liberty, and independence from the the royal rule of England, was on the minds of New Hampshire’s founders at the time it became a state, but not specifically Stark’s words. New Hampshire’s motto is often invoked by politicians, like it was last month by Sen. Ted Cruz and in February by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, as the Associated Press reported. And Paul isn't the first one to get the facts about Stark wrong. In 2011, Vice President Joe Biden referred to Stark as a former New Hampshire governor. That same year, Perry referred to him as ""John Spark,"" Holly Ramer of The Association Press reported. Our ruling Rand Paul said ""the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die."" New Hampshire’s motto is attributed to General John Stark, who was instrumental in defending it and the other colonies. But he wasn’t a founder of the state, and the motto wasn’t adopted until well after his death. As one of the original 13 states to ratify the U.S. constitution, it’s not a stretch to think New Hampshire’s founders were focused on liberty, but not specifically the words of Stark. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/apr/10/rand-paul/liberty-themed-speech-rand-paul-attributed-nh-mott/

Group says daughter of Earth Day founder was ordered not to do climate change work on the job
","Two weeks before the 45th anniversary of Earth Day, Tia Nelson, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, was again the topic of a contentious meeting of the agency’s board. It’s been that way for several months at the obscure public lands agency, which is overseen by three board members -- Attorney General Brad Schimel, state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Douglas La Follette, a Democrat. The 10-employee agency is in charge of managing some of the state's public land and operates a trust that provides funding for school libraries and makes loans to municipalities and school districts. The board has been suggested as a potential source of bonds to help finance a new Milwaukee Bucks arena. Since Adamczyk won election in November 2014, he has raised questions about Nelson’s performance and her background as an environmentalist. He requested years of her phone and travel records and unsuccessfully tried to get her fired at the March 3, 2015 meeting. Schimel and La Follette voted down a motion by Adamczyk to remove Nelson, daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson. Tia Nelson’s performance came up again at the April 7, 2015 board meeting, and not long after the meeting NextGen Climate, a group that says its aim is to bring ""climate change to the forefront of American politics,"" posted an item on its blog saying Nelson had been muzzled by the public lands board. The group said Nelson had been banned from ""engaging in global warming or climate change"" work on state time and compared the action to a move in Florida to block state workers from using the term ""climate change."" Did the board really order Nelson -- and other agency employees -- not to talk about climate change on state time? Some background In 2007-’08, Nelson was tapped by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, to co-chair a state global warming task force. During that time she also held her position at the public lands agency. Not long after the global warming report was issued, Nelson traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify about climate change at a congressional hearing and discussed the report in other settings. Adamczyk has called her task force work theft of the state’s time and also criticized Nelson and La Follette for recently attending a land commissioners’ conference in Phoenix. At the April 7 meeting, Nelson defended herself and said she served on the task force at the request of Doyle. She said she hasn't actively worked on global warming since the task force disbanded. ""I have never lobbied on climate change on state time in the entire 10 years I've been at the board of commissioners,"" she said. After her comments, Adamczyk asked for approval of a resolution to ""prohibit staff from engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time."" Adamczyk and Schimel voted in favor, La Follette voted no. We contacted Nelson and she declined to discuss the board’s action -- or climate change. She did note she was going to be on vacation April 22, which is Earth Day, giving a talk about her father at his alma mater, San Jose State University. Our rating The advocacy group NextGen Climate says Nelson, daughter of the founder of Earth Day, is under orders not to discuss global warming on state time. That’s indeed the wording of the resolution approved 2-1 by the agency’s board.

Is Facebook planning to ban religious content? No
","Is Facebook planning to ban all posts related to religion? A reader recently sent us links to an article shared on Facebook, titled, ""Facebook To Ban Religious Posts, Memes After Criticism From Atheism Groups,"" asking if we could verify its accuracy. The article was originally published several months ago on a website called the National Report; other versions have circulated as Facebook memes. Here’s a portion of the article: ""In a closed-door session with shareholders on Tuesday, Facebook executives wheeled out a set of new rules which, when implemented later this year, will ban their users from creating status updates and image posts related in any way to religion, while also vowing to disband groups and take down pages with religious goals or affiliations."" The story goes on to claim that Facebook will implement the new rules in three phases by removing pages with religious themes; prohibiting the posting or sharing of religious images and memes; and implementing filters to weed out status updates that include words like ""Jesus,"" ""prayer,"" ""church,"" or ""God."" This would be a pretty big deal if it were true, but there’s a problem: The National Report is a fake news site. The website, established in 2013, once included a disclaimer making that point clear. The disclaimer has since been removed, but was archived by urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com. It said, in part, ""All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental."" As for Facebook banning religion, similar bogus rumors have been floating around cyberspace for years. In March 2014, Snopes investigated a nearly identical claim. The message, allegedly issued by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, said that Facebook would be launching a ""No Religion"" campaign prohibiting the ""spreading (of) religious beliefs,"" and planned to delete the accounts of those who violated the new policy. Just to put the final nail in the coffin, we went looking and found many religiously affiliated pages on Facebook that have collected hundreds of thousands of ""likes."" The Facebook page Jesus Daily, which claims to be the ""#1 most active Facebook Page in history where you can learn how to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior,"" has more than 26 million likes. Facebook pages for the Bible, Koran, and Torah have netted more than 40 million likes altogether. None have been deleted from Facebook.

The session isn't over until the fat gavel bangs
","Sine die. Pronounced with a twang under the Gold Dome as sigh-knee die, the Latin phrase refers to the final day of business in the legislative session. The witching hour arrived on sine die in Georgia last week with House members already having celebrated adjournment with cheers and tossing up files the way new graduates throw their caps. Across the hall, though, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle kept the state Senate in session. Minutes after midnight, Senators passed a tax break for Mercedes-Benz that also included as much as $350,000 in breaks for the private Baptist college where the bill’s lead negotiator serves as a trustee. ""Typically, the Legislature ends by midnight of the last day so as not to exceed the constitutionally mandated 40-day session,"" according to Atlanta Journal-Constitution coverage of the last-minute deals. House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, was more blunt in his comments before adjourning that chamber. ""For time eternal, this day has ended at midnight,"" Ralston said. ""It is going to end at midnight today in the House even though I understand the other chamber may stay later."" On the Senate floor, no one referenced such a deadline. But Ralston’s implication is clear: History dictates the session’s final day -- and eligible votes -- ends at midnight. In a ""never say sine die"" sort of mood, PolitiFact Georgia jumped in to see whether the vote, and the $1 million-plus in tax breaks (on top of the breaks to the private college)  that came with it, will stand. The leap took us back to 1777, the first time the body known as the Georgia General Assembly began operations under direction of the state constitution. The Legislature – made up of both the 180-member House and 56-member Senate – convenes on the second Monday of January every year and ""may continue in session for a period of no longer than 40 days in the aggregate each year,"" according to the state constitution. There are no court cases on the issue, and the state attorney general has never weighed in on how to count those days. But at the request of PolitiFact Georgia, the attorneys who advise lawmakers on legislation and legal issues offered an opinion on how to interpret that mandate. In a letter to Cagle, legislative counsel Wayne R. Allen noted the distinction is that the ""days"" in question are legislative days, not calendar days. A calendar day would run from midnight to midnight. Under that definition, and with the mandate for an early January start, the Legislature would work only through mid- to late February. It doesn’t of course. That’s because Georgia meets by legislative, not calendar, day. By definition, that is a day in which the body holds a floor session. The day ends only when members vote to adjourn, according to the book ""Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure."" The Senate could therefore remain operating on legislative Day 40 ""without regard to the hour or calendar day,"" Allen wrote. The National Conference of State Legislatures confirmed that interpretation. At least 11 states besides Georgia limit session length by counting legislative days. The remaining states operate by calendar days or specific dates that lawmakers can meet, said Brenda Erickson, a senior research analyst with the group. ""You used to see tactics, like covering the clock or holding it from moving, but the courts have ruled you can’t do that,"" Erickson said. ""And that really applies to those states with a date-specific or calendar day count. "" So that famous 1964 photo of state Rep. Denmark Groover from Macon hanging off the House railing, trying to stop the clock during a heated debate on congressional redistricting? It didn’t matter. The clock crashed to the floor in the stunt – but the session continued. Likewise, when House Speaker Tom Murphy grew angry at the governor and state Senate in the 1980s, he was able to stop all business with an adjournment vote before dinnertime, said former state legislator George Hooks, a Democrat from Americus. ""It has never created a problem in the past,"" Hooks said. ""You work as needed. You try to make it before midnight, but it doesn’t end until that gavel comes down and we say ‘sine die.’ "" So the state Senate’s wee hour vote last week? Ralston implied that there is a midnight deadline for action. Most years, the chambers do end their work before midnight. Legal experts in the state and nationally agree, though, that no such clock watching is needed. Lawmakers meet for 40 legislative days, which end only when the chambers adjourn.
