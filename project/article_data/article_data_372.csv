In House race, Mike Gallagher's false claim about Tom Nelson and taxing Social Security benefits
","The competitive race for an open congressional seat in the Green Bay area has been marked by attack ads on Social Security. Democrat Tom Nelson and Republican Mike Gallagher are vying in the Nov. 8, 2016 election to succeed Reid Ribble, a Republican who decided not to run for a fourth term.   The Rothenburg and Gonzales Political Report, as well as the Cook Report, both recently shifted the race from ""toss up"" to ""leans Republican."" On Sept. 1, 2016, Nelson, the Outagamie County executive, released a TV ad accusing Gallagher of having a plan that would ""cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors."" Our rating was Half True.   Gallagher, a former U.S. Marine and former congressional aide, has not made such a proposal. However, he has praised a proposal that would make those cuts, saying he is most influenced on Social Security by the proposal’s author. On Sept. 12, 2016, it was Gallagher’s turn. He released a TV ad accusing Nelson of having ""backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million."" Let’s see how this one rates. 2005 votes Gallagher points to a vote that Nelson, then a member of the Wisconsin Assembly, took on the 2005-’07 state budget -- a 394-page document with thousands of figures and provisions. One provision in the budget, which was adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, eliminated state income taxes on Social Security benefits. So, despite Gallagher’s claim, there was not a proposal for higher taxes on Social Security. But eliminating the tax did save Wisconsin Social Security recipients an estimated $99.7 million per year, roughly what Gallagher claimed, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Nelson voted against the budget. But does that mean he voted against the Social Security provision it contained? When voting on something as huge as a state budget, a lawmaker could vote no for any number of reasons having to do with spending, policies or other factors. In other words, a no vote on the overall budget doesn’t mean a lawmaker opposed every single provision, or even any particular provision. Nelson has said he voted no because the budget reduced funding for education. The budget didn’t actually reduce funding for public schools. It added $458 million over the two-year period. But the amount was less than half of the $938 million increase advocated by Doyle, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time. There’s one more point -- a significant one. Nelson voted for an amendment that added the repeal of the tax on Social Security benefits to the budget.  So, he was for the repeal, even though he voted against the overall state budget that ultimately accomplished the repeal. Gallagher’s campaign called it a ""show"" vote.  But unlike the budget, it was an up-or-down vote on a single provision and, as such, gives a clearer idea of his position. Our rating Gallagher says Nelson ""backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million."" Nelson voted against the 2005-’07 state budget, which ended the state income tax on Social Security benefits, saving seniors more than $95 million per year. But that’s not the same as backing higher taxes on Social Security, something that was not even on the table. And a vote against the overall state budget doesn’t mean Nelson opposed eliminating the tax on Social Security benefits. Indeed, he voted for the amendment that added that provision to the budget. We rate Gallagher’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B9640>],/factchecks/2016/sep/30/mike-gallagher/house-race-mike-gallaghers-false-claim-about-tom-n/

Barack Obama says VA budget has risen 85 percent on his watch
","During a CNN town hall on Sept. 28, 2016, President Barack Obama took an emotional question from Donna Coates, the widow of Army veteran Barry Coates, who died of cancer after being misdiagnosed at a VA hospital. ""My mama's always told me that if you stop talking about stuff and do it, then you don't have to talk about it any longer,"" Coates said. ""So when are we going to actually start holding these contracted doctors and the VA employees accountable?"" Obama expressed his sympathies and said, ""I don't want to in any way pretend that we're where we need to be."" Still, he said, progress has been made in such areas as replacing outdated patient-intake systems. ""We now have a situation where about 80 percent of individuals who interact with the VA are satisfied that they're getting timely treatment,"" he said. ""I want that to be 100 percent. And that requires more work."" Obama went on to say that ""since I came into office, just to give you some sense of perspective, we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent."" Even over an eight-year presidential tenure, that sounded like a pretty big increase to us. So we decided to see if it was accurate. Mandatory vs. discretionary spending We turned to VA budget data to see how large the increases have been. This chart summarizes what we found: This chart shows that VA spending has certainly increased since 2008. But we've broken it down into two colors because it’s important to distinguish between two types of funding. The blue portion, known as discretionary spending, is funding that needs to be passed by Congress and signed by the president every year. The red portion, known as mandatory spending, includes funds allocated based on eligibility rules established long before the year when they’re allocated. Examples of mandatory funds include payouts for disability claims, burials, pensions and education. The White House confirmed that the 85 percent increase refers to the entire VA budget, including mandatory and discretionary spending.  They said that the Obama administration did have an impact on the mandatory spending figure by enacting increased access to benefits, including expanding eligibility for benefits related to Agent Orange exposure. Still, a large reason for the growth in mandatory spending is that the United States has been engaged in fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thus creating more and more veterans who qualify for mandatory benefits. So, to a great extent, mandatory spending is on autopilot when a president takes office, meaning that it’s not obvious that Obama can take significant credit for increasing the mandatory portion of the spending bump on his watch. The size of the increases It’s also worth noting that when Obama uses the 85 percent growth figure, he’s choosing the largest of several figures he could have used. There are so many choices because comparing budget growth in the way Obama did is more complicated than it seems at first glance. For starters, fiscal years -- the October-to-October time frames that are typically used in federal budgeting -- do not line up neatly with presidential terms, which always begin on January 20. So one could make an argument that the best base year to use in Obama’s comparison could be either fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2009. And the end years are tricky, too. The most recent year for which final, solid dollar figures are available is 2015. For 2016, we only have projections. We ran the numbers for each of the four possible time spans and found that the increase in overall spending ranged from 67 percent at the low end to 86 percent on the high end. So Obama’s 85 percent figure is cherry-picked, although even the worst calculation for Obama shows a 67 percent increase, which is still pretty substantial. Remember, however, that the president has the most influence -- along with Congress, with whom Obama had to agree -- on the discretionary portion of the VA budget. And the increases in discretionary spending were smaller. For discretionary spending only, the same four possible calculations produce anything from a 36 percent increase to a 61 percent increase. That's a less impressive sounding claim -- at the low end, it’s an increase of roughly 4 percent a year, rather than 10 percent a year, as Obama’s original statement would suggest. That said, Stan Collender, a budget specialist and executive vice president of the firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, cautioned that even an increase of 4 percent a year ""is nothing to sneeze at these days in federal budget land. I doubt many other parts of the discretionary budget had increases of that size, or at all."" Our ruling Obama said, ""Since I came into office … we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent."" Obama has a point that the VA has seen significant percentage increases during his tenure, particularly for a period of budgetary belt-tightening elsewhere. However, it’s a stretch for him to take credit for that, since so much of the increase stemmed from mandatory spending that originated with a continuing stream of veterans returning home and qualifying for benefits. Obama has also cherry-picked the highest numerical figure he could have. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/31e464bc-18c7-4796-aadf-5c9cb65de6c7",[<zip object at 0x000002809703DA40>],/factchecks/2016/sep/30/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-va-budget-has-risen-85-percent-h/

In a nuclear claim, Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton 'gave up' one-fifth of U.S. uranium to Russia
","At a campaign rally in Waukesha, Wis., Donald Trump made a number of attacks on Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, including one involving Russia. Clinton ""gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia -- to Russia,"" Trump said Sept. 28, 2016, two days after their first debate. ""You know what people do with uranium, don’t you? It’s called nuclear. Twenty percent. They could have never done it without her."" That's a more narrow, and less inflammatory, version of an attack that Trump made previously. But it still has problems. The uranium deal Before we get too far ahead of ourselves -- the United States gave a fifth of its uranium to Russia? What? Uranium is used to power commercial nuclear reactors that produce electricity and to produce isotopes used for medical, industrial and defense purposes around the world. As for the transaction Trump alluded to, it involved the Russian nuclear agency and Uranium One, a Toronto-based company. As PolitiFact National has reported, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, which also builds nuclear weapons, bought a controlling stake in Uranium One. The company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. So, to be clear, the 20 percent is capacity, not uranium that has been produced. Given that Russia doesn’t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest uranium producer, our colleagues said. As the New York Times has reported, the deal was made in separate transactions from 2009 to 2013. It made Russia’s atomic energy agency one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Russian President Vladimir Putin ""closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain."" U.S. involvement So, what was Clinton’s role? Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. At the time, the United States was seeking to ""reset"" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal. The national security issue at stake in the Uranium One deal was not primarily about nuclear weapons proliferation, the Times reported, because the United States and Russia had for years cooperated on that front, with Russia sending enriched fuel from decommissioned warheads to be used in American nuclear power plants in return for raw uranium. Instead, it concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources. While the United States gets one-fifth of its electrical power from nuclear plants, it produces only around 20 percent of the uranium it needs. Trump’s claims Now, back to what Trump said. Trump’s previous claim on the topic, made in June 2016, was that Clinton’s State Department ""approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation."" PolitiFact National rated it Mostly False -- mainly because there is no evidence of a quid pro quo. As for Trump’s current claim, it’s overstated. The State Department did approve the Uranium One deal, but it didn’t act unilaterally. It was one of nine U.S. government agencies, plus independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal. And as FactCheck.org noted in a related fact check, while any of the nine agencies could have objected to the deal, only President Barack Obama had the power to veto it. Even then, the president can only prohibit such transactions only with ""credible evidence"" that the ""foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.’ Our rating Trump says Clinton ""gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia."" The reference is to Russia’s nuclear power agency buying a controlling interest in a Toronto-based company. That company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity (not produced uranium). Clinton was secretary of state at the time, but she didn’t have the power to approve or reject the deal. The State Department was only one of nine federal agencies that signed off on the deal, and only Obama had the power to veto it. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbdc6c17-60c1-4ca0-b4e9-84c404095d12",[<zip object at 0x0000028097214E80>],/factchecks/2016/sep/30/donald-trump/nuclear-claim-donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-ga/
"['Florida', 'Marijuana', 'Vote No On 2']","
Amendment 2 would bring 'kid-friendly pot candy to Florida,' opponents say
","Opponents of Florida’s medical marijuana amendment are warning that cannabis-enhanced edibles will endanger children, hoping that voters will eat up their dire predictions and reject the measure. ""Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida,"" the anti-drug campaign Vote No On 2 said in a flier we received in the mail Sept. 22, 2016. The campaign is run by the Drug Free Florida Committee, an anti-drug group started in 2014 by longtime GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler and his wife, Betty, with financial backing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. We wanted to find out whether the medical marijuana amendment allows ""pot candy,"" and whether it really would be ""kid-friendly."" Candy plan As a quick refresher, Amendment 2 would let doctors recommend medical marijuana for patients with a host of certain conditions, including cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and more. It’s only a recommendation, because marijuana still is illegal under federal law, so doctors can’t prescribe it and pharmacists can’t distribute it. The patients would take their recommendations to what is referred to as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, which would be regulated by the state to provide the drug. Here’s where we get into Vote No On 2’s assertion about pot candy. The amendment language says the following (emphasis ours): "" ‘Medical Marijuana Treatment Center’ (MMTC) means an entity that acquires, cultivates, possesses, processes (including development of related products such as food, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments), transfers, transports, sells, distributes, dispenses, or administers marijuana, products containing marijuana, related supplies, or educational materials to qualifying patients or their caregivers and is registered by the Department."" So while the amendment doesn’t specifically mention candy, it does allow edibles. Proponents argue that edible forms of marijuana are better for some patients, in part because the effects can be longer-lasting than other methods of ingestion. That’s also part of the problem, because it can be difficult to gauge how the drug may affect people when eaten instead of smoked. Vote No On 2 cites an uptick of children being hospitalized in many of those states for eating marijuana-laced candy, which they say is tempting to kids if left out. They pointed to several news stories about children in medical marijuana states consuming cookies, chocolate bars, brownies and other sweets and candies. In some of their cases it wasn’t apparent if the candy was medical marijuana or from some other source. (It’s also possible that people could always just buy cannabis in bud form and make their own edibles.) Ben Pollara, director of United for Care, the group behind the amendment, said Vote No On 2 was creating a ""total dystopian fantasy about the way the amendment could be implemented."" He said a child getting into an adult’s medical marijuana presents the same issues as any medication, and it was up to the adult to prevent accidents from happening. ""Put it away,"" he said. ""That’s Parenting 101."" Kate Bell, legislative counsel at the Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the amendment, said 19 of the 25 medical marijuana states allow edibles, although they all handle them a bit differently. Amendment 2 offers the state plenty of leeway on how it could regulate the marijuana industry. The Legislature would have to pass a law on the issue and the Department of Health would have to write the regulations. What those rules would specifically say is anyone’s guess, and the health department told us that they couldn’t speculate. A health department spokeswoman pointed out that under current Florida law allowing medical marijuana for some epileptics and terminal patients, the only prohibited form is smoking, which Amendment 2 would allow. That leaves us to look to see how other states handle guidelines about things like packaging and sales practices. Washington, for example, bans products designed to appeal to kids. Connecticut requires tamper-resistant packages just like prescription drugs. California, which is phasing in new regulations, requires labels warning patients to keep products away from children. New Jersey only allows edibles in lozenge form, which were previously only available to child patients to take at school. (There’s an overview of guidelines for each state here.) In Colorado, which started selling medical marijuana in 2001 and recreational marijuana in 2012, there has been an increase in the number of children hospitalized for ingesting marijuana. A spokeswoman for the state’s marijuana enforcement division acknowledged in 2014 that edible forms carry ""a significant public safety risk."" Colorado this year banned some products shaped like people, fruit or animals. The state also requires opaque, tamper-resistant packaging and a label announcing the content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. The state also is starting to use a universal symbol designating a marijuana product. That doesn’t mean kids don’t end up getting exposed to the drug. Mike Van Dyke, the chief of environmental epidemiology, occupational health and toxicology at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said the state continues to adapt its packaging policies to make edible marijuana less accessible to children. A Colorado report on the amount of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for marijuana exposure shows the number of affected children under 9  — when use is more likely to be accidental — has increased over the last 15 years. But Van Dyke says they still are small numbers. In 2000, prior to medical marijuana being legalized, only 1 child was hospitalized statewide. In 2014-15, there were 37 ER visits and 15 hospitalizations. There’s also been an increase among people older than 9, too, but there are caveats to the data. Hospitals record these as exposures, but they don’t necessarily specify how patients were exposed, or if they were at the hospital because of the exposure or for a related issue. ""We’ve definitely seen an increase, but a lot of people are inflating the impact of these cases,"" Van Dyke said. ""Prior to 2010, we didn’t have commercially available, edible marijuana products, so of course there’s going to be more instances with an increase in availability."" The Journal of the American Medical Association this year published a study of marijuana exposures in Colorado for kids younger than 10. It found between 2009 and 2015, children’s hospital visits increased from 1.2 to 2.3 per 100,000. The Washington Post noted that means hospitals and poison control centers are much more likely to get calls about diaper cream, toothpaste, laundry detergent and crayons than they are about marijuana. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, ""Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida."" The proposal would allow edible forms of marijuana, but the amendment does not specifically identify candy. Calling it ""kid-friendly"" plays on parents’ fears without any proof that’s what will happen.  The statement is partially accurate but requires additional context. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973B8840>],/factchecks/2016/sep/30/vote-no-2/amendment-2-would-bring-kid-friendly-pot-candy-flo/

Atlanta mayor cherry picks numbers to make point on trade proposal
","Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been tapped by President Barack Obama to help sell the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The partnership, or TPP as it is commonly called, is a complex — and controversial — trade agreement that is meant to reduce barriers to trade in Pacific Rim countries while curbing China’s influence in the area. Supporters say it would boost the U.S. economy. Critics counter that it would lower wages, cost jobs and hurt American workers. In a joint press conference held Sept. 16 with Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the White House, Reed said: ""The bottom line is, if you look at any real analysis, this bill is going to generate better-paying jobs that are more stable."" We can’t check whether the trade deal will create jobs and economic stability, but we can check whether Reed is accurate when he states that ""any real analysis"" projects that specific outcome. PolitiFact decided to take a look and found that some studies back up the mayor’s assertion, while others paint a different picture. The TPP, which still needs to be passed by Congress, would lower tariffs and reduce regulations between 12 countries — the United States, Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Reed’s role in advocating for the TPP puts him in a delicate political position. He is a major supporter and surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who now opposes the agreement. PolitiFact rated her position on the issue a Flip Flop. ""I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages — including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" Clinton said at a recent Ohio campaign stop, according to the Los Angeles Times. PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Reed to find out how he came to his conclusion. Reed’s director of communications, Anne Torres, said the mayor was alluding to a Commerce Department blog post on the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement around 2014: ""At the same time that we were experiencing the longest streak of job growth, we also experienced a record year when it came to export-supported jobs: more than 11.7 million. This number includes the 2.8 million jobs supported by the exports to our North American Free Trade Agreement partners Canada and Mexico. And we know those export supported jobs pay 13 to 18% higher wages than non-export supported jobs."" The blog post says similar, positive effects could be felt by TPP countries by 2030. PolitiFact looked at six studies on the impact the agreement could have on jobs. Like politicians, research institutions are divided on the issue. Clinton said she changed her stance on the issue because the current agreement wasn’t the original version she supported as secretary of state. The 800-page report by the U.S. International Trade Commission estimates an increase in wages and 128,000 new jobs. The Brookings Institution, which has argued in favor of the TPP, says the agreement will increase service-sector jobs. Much of the pushback, including from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, centers on the loss of manufacturing jobs to other countries through free trade. U.S. manufacturing accounts for about 9 percent of jobs in America. Since Obama took office, there’s been a net loss of about 95,000 manufacturing jobs. The conservative group Americans for Tax Reform’s analysis found ""more than 1 in 5 American jobs are tied to trade, and these workers earn 16 percent more than jobs in industries not tied to trade."" The group has said the TPP is a step in the right direction but needs work. To further address the ""better paying"" part of Reed’s quote, a study by Johns Hopkins University and the East-West Center estimated the agreement would raise U.S. real incomes by 0.5 percent by 2030. Median household income grew 5.2 percent in 2015 in the U.S., an upward swing that hadn’t been seen in years. Finally, the labor-supporting Economic Policy Institute says, ""this deal will lead to more job loss and downward pressures on the wages of most working Americans."" This analysis is neither stable nor high-paying. Measuring stability The stability of jobs that could be created by the TPP is another issue. Some studies, including one cited by Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, predict a loss of jobs. This loss of half a million jobs is a notable number cited in the TPP debate. A study by Tufts University found 448,000 jobs could be lost under the agreement, though this is the largest number of job losses reported. PolitiFact rated this half-a-million job loss Half True when it was cited by Sanders. Dean Baker, co-director at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the near-half-a-million figure ""wouldn’t be my best guess, but it’s not an obviously ridiculous number."" But Baker notes the gains and losses go both ways. While trade deals open markets, the U.S. imports more than it exports. Our ruling Reed said, ""If you look at any real analysis,"" the Trans-Pacific Partnership is ""going to generate better-paying jobs that are more stable."" The mayor is cherry-picking studies on this issue. Of the numerous studies conducted on the possible outcomes of the TPP, some predict a loss of jobs, while others say higher-paying jobs will receive a boost. Overall, it’s difficult to calculate the stability of the jobs that may be lost or may be created as a result of the TPP. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Partial credit: Chelsea Clinton says Gary Johnson wants to eliminate public schools
","Cosmopolitan magazine interviewed Chelsea Clinton the morning after the first presidential debate and asked the former First Daughter about the move of millennials from Democrat Bernie Sanders to Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein. ""I would just urge young voters to actually look at what the different candidates are offering,"" Clinton said. ""Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party want to get rid of the public school system in our country. If that’s what you believe, then you should actually support him. I think the public school system in our country has been one of the greatest, if not the greatest, investment of our values of the belief that everyone and anyone should have the chance to, as my mom says, 'live up to their God-given potential.' "" ""We have a lot of work to do to ensure that that is true in every school district and every school in our country,"" she added. ""But I don’t think the work that we have to do entails getting rid of the public school system."" A reader asked if Clinton was correct and if abolition of public education is really part of the platform of Johnson and his party. Because a party platform doesn't necessarily reflect the views of a presidential candidate, we'll consider them separately. The party The Libertarian Party believes that government should play a minimal role in human affairs and that this minimalist approach fosters liberty, enterprise and personal responsibility. The party's website says, ""Government's only role is to help individuals defend themselves from force and fraud."" That would leave out education. Its latest platform, adopted at its May 2016 convention in Orlando, Fla., doesn't directly call for getting rid of the public school system. But it does say, ""Education is best provided by the free market, achieving greater quality, accountability and efficiency with more diversity of choice. Recognizing that the education of children is a parental responsibility, we would restore authority to parents to determine the education of their children, without interference from government. Parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children’s education."" In short, public education is not one of the roles government should play. Johnson's stance As for Johnson's philosophy, both the Clinton campaign and the Johnson campaign referred us to a Sept. 14, 2016, entry in Politico's education blog. It states that Johnson wants to eliminate the U.S. Education Department, a proposal that has been popular with Republican candidates in recent years. When Politico asked Johnson what the federal role should be in public education, he responded, ""I don't see one."" It's important to note here that the federal government doesn't run America's public school systems. That's done by state and local governments. The Politico piece notes that Johnson has been an advocate for universal vouchers as a way to improve educational performance through competition. The candidate told the website, ""I do think ultimately it would be the end of traditional public schools, and that would be for the better. Public schools are not going to go away, but they are going to embrace the innovation that would occur if students had a choice."" To say that ""public schools are not going to go away"" at the same time you say this ""would be the end of traditional public schools"" seems to amount to doublespeak, so we asked the Johnson campaign for some clarification how this would be handled on a state and local level, where the real education work is done. We didn't hear back. On his website, Johnson says that ""state and local governments should have more control over education policy"" and calls for the elimination of ""attempts to impose national standards and requirements on local schools (that) are costly, overly bureaucratic, and actually compromise our ability to provide our children with a good education."" Meanwhile, we found a May 30, 2016, Forbes article reporting how Johnson initially raised education spending when he was governor of New Mexico but then decided to push a voucher system. The plan was to let each student have a voucher valued at about $4,000 at a time when the public school system cost was roughly $6,000 per pupil. If a student spent that voucher on a private school, that would mean more money left behind to educate a public school child, Johnson argued. Parents would pull their children out of the bad schools — public or private — and they would have to close. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party want to get rid of the public school system."" The Libertarian platform calls for a free market educational system that puts the responsibility on the parents. Johnson clearly wants to get the federal government out of the education business, but public schools are run by the states and local communities, and there Johnson is giving mixed signals about the degree to which he wants to fully privatize public education. Because Clinton's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809708AE80>],/factchecks/2016/sep/29/chelsea-clinton/partial-credit-chelsea-clinton-gets-says-gary-john/

Democrats mislead in attack on Carlos Curbelo's record on climate change, drilling
","While Miami Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo portrays himself as an environmentalist, the Democratic Party says he is no treehugger and is aligned with Donald Trump. ""Republican Carlos Curbelo and Donald Trump's ideas about the environment are more alike than you think. Curbelo talks about protecting the environment,"" says a TV ad by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The ad then shows a clip of Curbelo talking about protecting the environment and then pivots to a clip of him on an oil rig. The narrator continues: ""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump, and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" Curbelo represents a Democratic-leaning Westchester-to-Key West district. He faces a rematch Nov. 8 with former U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami. (Curbelo does not support Trump but said he won’t vote for Hillary Clinton, either.) We found that Curbelo supports current drilling but opposes an expansion near Florida’s coasts. And while Curbelo has taken some votes related to pollution and climate change that Democrats criticize, he has been one of the more outspoken Republicans about combating climate change.   Trump on drilling Trump has generally spoken in favor of offshore oil drilling in recent months, although his position hasn’t always been clear. He sounded skeptical about expanding offshore drilling in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" But Trump has been more forceful about his support for drilling since that time. ""We’re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies,"" he said in North Dakota in May. In September, Trump said in a fact sheet that he will ""open up vast areas of our offshore energy resources for safe production"" and will eliminate ""unnecessary restrictions"" on offshore oil and gas. ‘Curbelo supports drilling offshore’ While Curbelo defended current offshore oil drilling in 2015, he has fought against efforts to expand it closer to Florida than the current 125-mile restriction. Curbelo made a video of himself standing on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015: ""The offshore oil industry in the United States fuels about 20 percent of our economy and assets like this are an important part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will grow the American economy and make our country more secure,"" he said. But Curbelo has voted three times in favor of Democratic amendments to protect coasts from drilling by banning funds, research or testing. He also got the House to pass a bill to force companies that spill oil in foreign waters to clean up any damage to Florida coasts. ‘Repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change’ The Democrats point to a handful of votes that Curbelo took that were contrary to Democratic efforts to fight pollution and climate change. In all four cases, Curbelo sided with Republicans in party line votes on legislation or a resolution. But the votes are cherry-picking Curbelo’s record, which also reflects his efforts to combat climate change and pollution. • In January Curbelo took a stand along with virtually all Republicans against a controversial proposal by the federal government to define which bodies of water fall under its jurisdiction. Curbelo thought the ""Waters of the United States"" rule was too vague and it was later stayed by the courts. • In 2015, Curbelo voted in favor of a bill Republicans said would prevent the EPA from using ""secret science"" and require transparency. The EPA argued it already is transparent and uses sound science. • The only vote directly about climate change was minor. The House, along with Curbelo, barred funds for a government climate model program in 2015. Curbelo opposed it because he said it was duplicative, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said. • Curbelo also voted in favor of a bill to limit environmental reviews to move projects along in 2015. Importantly, the ad omits that Curbelo has been one of the leading Republican voices in Congress to come up with solutions to combat climate change. In September 2015, Curbelo signed onto a congressional resolution acknowledging climate change’s existence and later, along with U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., formed the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. ""It is vital for Congress to acknowledge the reality of climate change as a legitimate issue requiring feasible solutions, and we need leaders on both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will make a difference,"" Curbelo wrote in an op-ed in the Miami Herald Oct. 24, 2015. We found other actions that Curbelo took in an effort to fight pollution. In December 2015, Curbelo was one of 10 Republicans to vote against a resolution to nullify the EPA’s rules to regulate carbon emissions from new power plants. In July 2016, Curbelo opposed a vote by a Florida commission to increase allowed levels of toxins for over two dozen known chemicals in waterways.   Our ruling The DCCC said,""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" Curbelo supports current drilling, but the ad omits that he has repeatedly voted against expanding drilling off Florida’s coasts. Trump, though not always consistent, has sounded more favorable to drilling than Curbelo. Curbelo has taken votes against Democratic efforts to curb pollution and to model climate change, but that is cherry-picking his record. The ad omits that Curbelo has been a leader among Republicans speaking out about the need to combat climate change.

Clinton wants to admit thousands of refugees with no vetting, Rick Scott says
","Gov. Rick Scott backed up Donald Trump’s first presidential debate performance, praising the Republican nominee and lamenting that Hillary Clinton wasn’t pressed hard enough on her policy positions. In a Sept. 27 Facebook post touting an ad from the pro-Trump Rebuilding America Now PAC, Scott declared the real estate mogul ""the winner in last night’s debate because he is the candidate for change."" ""The biggest loser was the American people,"" Scott wrote, ""because we never got to hear a vigorous conversation about why Hillary set up an illegal email server for classified information or why she wants to bring in thousands of refugees to America from all around the world without any kind of security screening."" We’ll set aside the email controversy and focus on the assertion about vetting refugees. Does Clinton want to bring in thousands of foreigners with no background checks at all? She does want to allow refugees into America, although the figures are up for debate — but the idea that there will be no security screening is wrong. Refugee review Scott’s office did not clarify anything about his post when we contacted them. But he’s using fairly broad language by saying Clinton wants to bring in thousands of refugees from across the globe. That would not be a shocking plan, because the United States routinely accepts tens of thousands of refugees annually, averaging more than 83,000 refugees a year worldwide from 1980-2008. In fiscal year 2015, the last year for which we have data, the State Department said it would admit up to 70,000 refugees. It ended up admitting 69,933, records show. These refugee slots are allocated by region, so the United States takes different numbers of refugees from different parts of the world. Scott’s accusation echoes Trump, who falsely said Clinton planned to bring in 620,000 refugees during her first term and denied they would be subjected to a vetting process. Clinton has only talked about a single year’s plan for how many refugees to let into the country — specifically expanding Obama’s plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016.   ""I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in,"" she said in a September 2015 interview on Face the Nation. Clinton’s campaign has not elaborated beyond that initial 65,000 refugees, which would have been a 550 percent increase. Syrian refugees have been a focus of political arguments because of fears radical Islamic terrorists would infiltrate the United States. Trump once advocated banning all Muslims as his response. That’s why the vetting process is important to the discussion — and let’s be clear, there is a vetting process. The United States can perform background checks for refugees through a process that involves the FBI, plus the State Department, the Homeland Security Department, the Defense Department and other agencies. This can take two or even three years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. With so much concern over terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. For her part, Clinton has repeatedly said that while she supports bringing refugees into the country, screening protocols must be followed. ""Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people,"" she said in a November 2015 national security speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals in close coordination with our allies and partners."" During a December 2015 counterterrorism speech at the University of Minnesota, she noted, ""Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it's a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months."" She told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in July that  ""we should only let people into this country after we have thoroughly screened them, no matter how long it takes and no matter, you know, what the pressure might be to act more quickly."" And as recently as a Sept. 19 press conference in White Plains, N.Y., she said ""I am absolutely in favor of and have long been an advocate for tough vetting."" Our ruling Scott said Clinton ""wants to bring in thousands of refugees to America from all around the world without any kind of security screening."" Clinton has said she would welcome thousands more Syrians fleeing civil war, but the United States routinely admits tens of thousands of global refugees annually. There is already a strict vetting process in place, and Clinton has routinely advocated following it.

Ted Strickland's misleading claim about Portman voting to allow terrorists to buy guns
","CORRECTION, 5:48p.m., September 29, 2016: Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly described an amendment by Sen. Susan Collins. The story has been updated to reflect her as the author of that measure. Our rating on the claim did not change. A new TV ad from Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland features a veteran of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan who says he carried a gun ""so we wouldn’t have to worry about terrorists using them here."" But Sen. Rob Portman, Strickland’s Republican opponent, ""is blocking commonsense laws to stop terrorists and criminals from getting guns. Sen. Portman said no to background checks on all purchases,"" the ad’s soldier continues. ""He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."" That last statement caught our attention.  No, Portman did not vote to allow suspected terrorists to purchase guns. The attack obscures what really happened. The ad cites Senate voting records from June 20 and 23. First, we’ll consult the record. Votes 106 and 109 were two of four votes on gun control measures considered by the Senate after the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. On June 12, Omar Mateen, a man who had twice been investigated by the FBI for suspected terrorist ties, killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.. Vote 106 asked senators to vote to end the debate, or to keep debating, an amendment by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein which would authorize the U.S. attorney general to deny requests to sell firearms to ""known or suspected terrorists."" Portman voted ""nay,"" a vote against bringing the issue up for passage or failure. The week ahead of that vote, Portman told reporters in his weekly media conference call, ""I do believe that you should not be able to buy a weapon when you’re on the (terrorist) watch list."" Strickland’s ad doesn’t mention the other three votes taken that day, June 20, 2016, on the issue of suspected terrorists and gun sales. All four measures failed, largely along party lines. Portman voted in favor of Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley’s amendment to ""address gun violence and improve the availability of records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System."" He also voted in favor of Republican Sen. John Cornyn’s proposal, an alternative to Feinstein’s measure to prevent watchlisted terrorists from buying guns. The main difference between the Feinstein amendment and the one proposed by Cornyn had to do with due process -- granting an avenue for an individual to appeal if they are wrongfully listed as a terror suspect and denied a gun purchase. The Republican amendment allowed authorities to detain a terrorism suspect who tries to obtain a firearm, and gave a judge 72 hours to determine whether there was enough proof to bar the gun sale. Feinstein’s amendment provided for an individual to appeal to the Justice Department if they felt they were wrongfully listed and barred from buying a gun. It did not have a three-day limit for the government to make its case. Republicans argued that Cornyn’s amendment, with a stronger check-and-balance requiring a court order, was necessary in light of well-known errors on federal no-fly and terrorist watch lists. Former Sen. Ted Kennedy is often cited as an example after he was erroneously stopped for extra airport security checks because ""T. Kennedy"" was an alias used by a terror suspect. A motion to table a tweaked version of Feinstein’s amendment, proposed by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine -- the ""Vote 109"" referenced by Strickland’s ad -- failed on June 23 with a 46-52 vote, short of the 60 votes required to advance. Portman voted ""yea,"" or against the amendment, in line with all but eight Republicans. Our ruling Strickland’s campaign ad said of Portman, ""He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."" The ad distorts facts on many levels. People on the terrorism watch list could already buy guns before the votes in question. Portman voted along party lines on the gun control measures that came up for Senate vote on June 20 and 23. He voted against Feinstein’s amendment to enact a blanket ban on firearm purchases by terrorists or suspected terrorists. But he voted for the Republican version of the legislation, sponsored by Cornyn, that would ban a gun sale after a three-day period of judicial review to determine whether an individual was on a watch list for legitimate reasons. The vote for Cornyn’s legislation was literally a vote to stop terrorists from buying weapons — but the extra hurdles for the government were not supported by Democrats. We rate the ad’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/75c564aa-58eb-4640-9db2-99437d9cd9cd",[<zip object at 0x000002809703AF40>],/factchecks/2016/sep/29/ted-strickland/sen-rob-portman-voted-let-terrorists-buy-guns-nope/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says 1,800 people who were going to be deported ended up becoming citizens
","Right before the first presidential debate wrapped up, Donald Trump repeated his desire to ""make America great again"" and his views that the current state of the country is not good. ""We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country,"" Trump said. ""The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption. But these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens -- ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know."" We wanted to know more about the hundreds of people Trump said became citizens instead of being deported. His campaign pointed to a CNN article published Sept. 20 about a report from the Inspector General of the Homeland Security Department about 858 immigrants who were supposed to be deported but were granted U.S. citizenship instead. ""But the truth is the report is even worse than reported, with more than 1,800 individuals naturalized who should have been deported from the country,"" the CNN article said. Inspector General’s report The Inspector General of the Homeland Security Department issued a report Sept. 8 about ""potentially ineligible individuals"" being granted U.S. citizenship due to incomplete fingerprint records. Immigrants applying to become naturalized U.S. citizens are required to submit fingerprints, reveal other identities or names used and if they have been in deportation proceedings.               U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) then runs the applicant’s fingerprints against DHS and FBI digital fingerprint databases to check for other possible identities, criminal arrests and convictions, immigration violations, deportations and links to terrorism. If there’s a match, USCIS determines whether the applicant is still eligible for naturalization. The Inspector General’s office determined that 1,029 people had become citizens even though they had final deportation orders under another identity. Of the 1,029 individuals, 858 did not have digital fingerprint records available in DHS’ fingerprint repository when USCIS was reviewing and deciding on their applications, the report said. (For comparison, roughly 701,000 people receive naturalization each year.) The people who received citizenship may have had old paper-based fingerprint records, but those are missing from DHS’ digital repository. Those old records were not digitized and uploaded into it when the repository was initially developed in 1994, the report said. The vast majority of those paper-based records are from the 1990s, DHS said. The Inspector General’s report does not specify the years when the individuals became naturalized citizens. The CNN article referenced by Trump’s campaign emphasized a footnote on the report, which said that as of November 2015, an additional 953 people had been naturalized while being subject to final deportation orders. The footnote said it was not known when the fingerprints of the 953 people were digitized or how many of their records were available in DHS’ digital files when their applications were being examined and decided. It seems likely the actual number of people ordered deported but who became U.S. citizens is actually 1,982 (the 1,029 plus the 953 identified in the footnote), said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring restrictions on immigration. ""So Trump was actually understating the results,"" Krikorian said. A DHS spokesman said a review team is looking into hard copies of each file identified in the Inspector General’s report. A total of 1,811 cases are being reviewed -- the 858 for whom digitized records were not available during the naturalization process,  and the 953 for whom it’s not known if their digital records were in the system when their applications were being reviewed and decided. DHS said more investigation is needed before it can be determined if people were naturalized when they shouldn’t have been. ""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization, fraudulently,"" said Neema Hakim, DHS spokesman. Hakim said the ongoing review found approximately 100 cases among those identified in the OIG report where the individuals were not in fact granted citizenship. Lack of digitized fingerprints During the debate, Trump said hundreds of immigrants who were to be deported became citizens perhaps because officials ""pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption."" The Inspector General’s report does not outline corruption as a reason, but a lack of modernized records. ""As long as the older fingerprint records have not been digitized and included in the repositories, USCIS risks making naturalization decisions without complete information and, as a result, naturalizing additional individuals who may be ineligible for citizenship or who may be trying to obtain U.S. citizenship fraudulently,"" the report said. Immigrants who become naturalized U.S. citizens can petition for others to come to the United States, may obtain security clearances or perform security-sensitive work (as was the case of three naturalized citizens identified in the report, their credentials have been revoked). Our ruling Trump said, ""These people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know."" Trump’s statement accurately references a CNN report that at least 1,800 people who had deportation orders had become naturalized U.S. citizens. An Inspector General report found that old paper records hadn’t been transferred to modern digital databases. There are a few details worth noting. An ongoing review found that about 100 cases identified in the Inspector General’s report were actually not granted citizenship. And, having a previous final deportation order does not always make an individual ineligible for naturalization. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096886340>],/factchecks/2016/sep/29/donald-trump/trump-says-1800-people-who-were-going-be-deported-/

Dan Flynn says raw milk has caused just six Texas illnesses in 20 years
","CORRECTION, 12:30 p.m., Sept. 30, 2016: After this fact check posted, Rep. Dan Flynn's office pointed out an error. We'd presented all national illnesses and deaths tied to food by the federal government as being linked to raw milk. We've now amended that sentence below to note only the illnesses and a death connected to raw milk. These changes didn't affect our rating of the claim. Thirteen legislators charged Texas authorities with unwarranted interference--in milk deliveries. At issue: Whether consumers may legally designate an agent to bring raw--meaning unpasteurized--milk from a farm to a pickup spot. State law says licensed producers may sell raw milk to retail customers where the milk is produced. Our curiosity was stirred, though, by the legislators suggesting raw milk rarely poses a health risk. After all, pasteurization kills the bacteria responsible for diseases including typhoid fever, tuberculosis and diphtheria. Still, the lawmakers said in their September 2016 letter to the Texas Department of State Health Services: ""Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in our state in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years."" Do those counts hold up? The letter, we determined, failed to account for up to 10 suspected illnesses in 2015 due to drinking raw milk. Before then, it appears, there were indeed a handful of identified illnesses. Flynn: Two illnesses in 2000, four in 2011 When we asked the letter’s lead author, Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Van, how he reached his conclusion about no illnesses in more than four years and just six in 20 years, an aide, Kelli Linza, emailed us a chart citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The chart included an entry stating the agency confirmed two Texas illnesses, both in February 2000, traced to drinking unpasteurized milk. Linza later told us Flynn also recognized four 2011 cases of salmonellosis allegedly linked by State Health Services to raw milk from a North Texas dairy. Agencies: Seven to 10 illnesses in 2015 Next, we emailed the CDC about such Texas illnesses; spokeswoman Brittany Behm pointed us to its database of foodborne outbreaks enabling us to glean, clicks later, that from 2005 through 2015, Texas had two suspected outbreaks and seven illnesses (but no deaths) attributed to raw milk--all in March and April 2015. Nationally in the decade-plus, the government tallied more than 421 illnesses and one death linked to raw milk, according to our database search. Closer to home, we asked State Health Services about the frequency of illnesses tied to drinking raw milk. Spokesman Chris Van Deusen replied by email that in 2015, ""raw milk was the suspected source of at least 10 reported cases of illness in Texas. ""As is frequently the case with foodborne illness investigations,"" his reply continued, ""we weren’t able to test the milk consumed by the people who got sick, so we can’t say 100 percent definitively that raw milk was the cause. Often, by the time someone gets sick and an investigation occurs, the food has been eaten or discarded, so there’s no longer product available to test. ""Also, it’s worth noting that only a small percentage of foodborne illnesses are diagnosed and reported, so there may be additional cases out there that we don’t ever find out about,"" Van Deusen wrote. We circled back to Flynn about the reported illnesses from 2015. By email, Linza expressed concern that the suspected 2015 instances of illness linked to raw milk that we found didn’t show up in what Flynn fetched from the CDC in July 2016. Linza, asked whether Flynn asked State Health Services to tally raw-milk illnesses, said she didn’t remember doing so. Separately, Van Deusen affirmatively answered our inquiry about whether the count of 10 suspected 2015 illnesses linked to raw milk would have been available to anyone asking the agency about such illnesses in July 2016, which was when Flynn queried the CDC. National hospitalizations, deaths Nationally, we found in an online search, the Food and Drug Administration tallied 133 health incidents  from 1987 to September 2010 due to raw milk or raw milk products, accounting for 269 hospitalizations, three deaths, six stillbirths and two miscarriages. Also, CDC research published in 2012 found that ""between 1993 and 2006, more than 1,500 people in the United States became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk."" According to the CDC study, states where the sale of raw milk was legal had more than twice the rate of outbreaks as states where it was illegal. The 30 states where raw milk sales were legal at the end of the study in 2011 included about a dozen states, like Texas, that allowed raw milk sales only on the farm where the milk was produced. Then again, a chart with the study says the identified outbreaks occurred in 25 states--with no outbreaks in Texas:                          SOURCE: Study, ""Increased Outbreaks Associated with Nonpasteurized Milk, United States, 2007–2012,"" Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, in journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases, January 2015 (accessed Sept. 19, 2016) We also spotted a nongovernmental website funded by a Washington state law firm that represents food-poisoning victims. When we peeked, the site, realrawmilkfacts.com, had a chart itemizing 2,468 U.S. illnesses and two deaths from June 1998 through October 2013, all attributed to raw milk products. By phone, Bill Marler, managing partner for the Marler Clark law firm, told us the firm doesn’t have a hand in the figures, relying instead on California researchers. In Texas, the chart indicates, four residents took ill with salmonella in November 2010 after ingesting raw cow milk from a farm store. In April 2011, Dallas County’s Health and Human Services Department said a 56-year-old resident had been hospitalized after drinking unpasteurized milk. The agency said that since November 2010, three other similar cases of illness linked to raw milk had been investigated by the state. Previously, per the Real Raw Milk Facts chart, a June 2005 Texas outbreak involved a dozen residents who ate cheese made from raw milk. Before that, in February 2005, two Texas residents took ill from eating cheese made from raw milk, the chart indicates, with another 14 Texas illnesses attributed to raw milk in 2000 and 2003 (when one person died). Our ruling Flynn wrote: ""Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in"" Texas ""in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years."" Government counts suggest raw milk only rarely touched off illnesses in Texas over those decades. However, Flynn presented an incomplete too-low count, failing to note seven to 10 illnesses tied to raw milk that reportedly occurred in Texas last year. We rate his claim Mostly False.

Tom DeLay says most illegal immigrants draw 'welfare benefits,' send children to public schools
","Former Republican powerbroker Tom DeLay recently raised alarm about Houston ""illegal immigrants"" taking advantage of tax-funded benefits. DeLay, seated in what looked like a comfortable spot, took split-screen questions from MSNBC’s Kate Snow--both of them not quite getting facts straight. DeLay initially agreed in the Sept. 1, 2016, interview that ""deportations are up"" under President Barack Obama. Deportations hit a record high under Obama in 2013. However, the counts have since come down. The former U.S. House majority leader once known as the Hammer went on to say the flow of illegal immigrants also has gone way up--a claim that as of that month wasn’t reflective of border-area apprehensions by the Border Patrol. ""I mean, right here in Houston, Texas,"" DeLay said, ""you can go three blocks from here and you have apartment complexes after apartment complexes packed full with illegal immigrants."" He shortly added: ""Most of these illegals are drawing welfare benefits, they’re sending their kids to school, they’re using the public services. Many of them are paying taxes, I grant you that. But the impact,"" he said, ""is monumental."" DeLay’s comments fell in stride with a hot topic of the 2016 presidential race--the impact of unauthorized immigrants. Monumental or not, we wondered if he was right about government-funded benefits drawn by such residents. Some relevant recent fact checks: --In August 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s claim there could be up to 30 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. came out Pants on Fire; the U.S. government and independent think tanks put the figure between 11 and 12 million. --The same day, Trump said unauthorized immigration costs more than $113 billion annually from federal, state and local coffers. That’s Mostly False, PolitiFact found, in that Trump cited the highest of all estimates from a range that varied widely, and excluded data on unauthorized immigrant tax payments. --The month before, we found Half True a claim by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that unauthorized immigrants annually pay $12 billion into Social Security. That amount was paid jointly by unauthorized immigrants and their employers. DeLay offers no backup DeLay, who resigned as majority leader in 2005 after his indictment on Texas campaign finance charges (his subsequent conviction was ultimately overturned), gave us a lot to consider, starting with what he had in mind in mentioning nearby apartment complexes rife with ""illegal immigrants."" For a moment, we contemplated a field trip to see for ourselves, an option that fizzled after DeLay didn’t provide backup information; when we reached him by phone, the line went dead. Dani DeLay Garcia, his daughter who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman, told us by email that he wouldn’t be elaborating. Public schools and paying taxes For our part, we recognized that DeLay was correct about public schools serving children regardless of immigration status. In 2013, we found True a claim that the U.S Supreme Court had decided in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free public schooling through the 12th grade. Unauthorized immigrants also pay taxes, as DeLay said. Tanya Broder, a staff attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, said by phone that ""undocumented immigrants have the same tax obligations as any other resident."" Broder emailed a 2015 report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank, which drew on its analysis of state tax laws to estimate that unauthorized immigrants in Texas in 2012 paid about $1.5 billion in state and local sales and property taxes. Earlier, a 2006 report from the Texas state comptroller, applying Pew Research Center population research and comptroller tax models, estimated that unauthorized immigrants in Texas in 2005 paid $1.58 billion in state and local taxes. We focused next on whether unauthorized immigrants draw welfare and tap other public services. Welfare benefits The federal government hasn’t distributed welfare checks to eligible people in poverty for around 20 years; that approach was replaced in the late 1990s by targeted aid programs jointly administered by the federal and state governments that provide assistance with cash, food, housing and health care. That act, the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, also barred unauthorized immigrants from drawing benefits. Title IV of the act, subheaded ""restricting welfare and public benefits for aliens,"" states that ""aliens who are not qualified aliens"" are ineligible for ""federal public benefits"" and for ""state and local public benefits."" The act defines qualified aliens as people with certain legal documented immigration status, meaning unauthorized immigrants are not eligible. We confirmed from eligibility rules posted on government websites that unauthorized immigrants aren’t eligible for major aid programs including Medicaid, the joint federal-state health coverage for people in poverty; Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provides cash assistance to the impoverished elderly or disabled; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which used to be food stamps; housing assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), which provides grants for state-administered family assistance programs like child care, cash assistance or counseling.  Separately, Broder and Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that believes in the benefits of well-managed immigration, each told us federal welfare benefits aren’t available to unauthorized immigrants. By phone, Jack Martin, author of reports on unauthorized immigrants in Texas for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates tighter immigration controls, put it this way: ""Illegal aliens are not eligible directly for welfare assistance"" though, he said, parents living in the country without permission can sign up qualified children for aid. All U.S.-born children are automatically U.S. citizens, even if born to unauthorized immigrants--and Martin was correct, we found, in that Medicaid eligibility rules specify that unauthorized immigrants ""may apply for coverage on behalf of documented individuals."" Eligibility rules for SNAP say that a person who is ineligible because of immigration status ""may choose to apply only for his or her U.S. citizen children in the household."" On the other hand, Broder said, certain federal benefits are available to children regardless of residency status: the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides food aid to care centers for low income children, elderly or disabled adults; the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program, which subsidizes in-school meals for children from low income families; and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, which provides nutritional supplements and health education for pregnant women, breastfeeding women and their infants up to five years old who are deemed ""at nutrition risk"" by a doctor. Capps agreed those programs are open to unauthorized immigrants but said they’re ""programs that I wouldn’t consider welfare."" Case said the basic nutrition programs qualified as public health spending. Regarding the school lunch program he said: ""I wouldn’t consider it welfare the same way I wouldn’t consider public schools welfare."" Public services Finally, we found validity to DeLay’s assertion that unauthorized immigrants use ""public services."" Capps said there were state-administered public health services available to residents regardless of immigration status while Alex Nowrasteh, an analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, nudged us afresh to the 2006 report from the Texas state comptroller. That report, ""Undocumented Immigrants in Texas: a financial analysis of the impact to the state budget and economy,"" listed nine publicly-funded programs for which unauthorized immigrants in Texas were eligible--public schools plus eight health care programs: emergency medical care for indigent residents; Children with Special Health Care Needs; substance abuse services; mental health services; immunizations; Women’s and Children’s Health Services; public health programs; and emergency medical services such as ambulances. We wondered if the listed programs continue to be open to anyone regardless of immigration status. Seems so; agency-posted eligibility requirements do not say beneficiaries must be legal U.S. residents. SOURCE: Report, ""Undocumented immigrants in Texas: a financial analysis of the impact to the state budget and economy,"" Texas state comptroller Carole Strayhorn, December 2006 In 2005, the report estimated, Texas spent about $58 million caring for unauthorized immigrants through the eight programs--compared to $57.8 billion in total state spending that year. Health Care As the largest health-related service used by unauthorized immigrants, the comptroller identified indigent care at public hospitals. The Texas Indigent Health Care and Treatment Act of 1989 requires Texas counties to fund stabilizing health services for indigent people without insurance. According to the act, county hospitals, public hospitals and hospital districts must admit anyone who earns 21 percent or less of the federal poverty level. That includes unauthorized immigrants, who the comptroller estimated drew $1.3 billion in such services in 2004. The services required under the 1989 act include: ""primary and preventative services,"" inpatient and outpatient hospital services, rural health clinics, laboratory and X-ray services, family planning, physician services, payment for up to three prescription drugs and ""skilled nursing facility services."" We found specifics in a 2010 report from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission titled ""Report on services and benefits provided to undocumented immigrants."" The report listed uncompensated costs incurred at each Texas public hospital in 2008, plus the estimated share of that cost ""attributable"" to unauthorized immigrants. The report estimated that between two and 22 percent of uncompensated costs are attributable to unauthorized immigrants at each of 99 public hospitals statewide, totaling about $717 million in 2008.   Our ruling DeLay said most illegal immigrants draw ""welfare benefits, they’re sending their kids to school, they’re using the public services."" People living in the U.S. without authorization indeed draw on public services including government-supported hospitals. Also, children of all origins attend public schools. But counter to DeLay’s prime point, adults lacking legal residency are barred by law from government programs that fit the ""welfare"" category. Parents still may seek benefits, though, for their child-citizens. All told, we rate this claim Half True.

Ad accuses Catherine Cortez Masto of not addressing rape kit backlog as Attorney General
","A new Nevada ad campaign claims Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto ""failed Nevada rape victims"" during her tenure as the state’s attorney general. Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has launched several ads attacking the former attorney general on the issue of untested rape test kits. ""Catherine Cortez Masto failed Nevada rape victims,"" the ad says. ""While Attorney General, thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis."" Cortez Masto’s campaign has taken the ads seriously, as she’s staked much of her candidacy on her record of combating human trafficking and violence against women (even releasing two ads attempting to push back on the claims). However, it’s hard to find any evidence that she took on the specific problem of the state’s rape kit backlog while in office from 2006 to 2014. How the backlog happened ""Rape kits"" are shorthand for sexual assault forensic evidence kits, intended to be collected soon after a sexual assault or rape by a nurse or doctor. It collects a variety of evidence including the patient’s medical history, tissue and hair samples from the victim’s body and clothes, photos of injuries sustained by the victim, and biological samples such as saliva, blood, semen, urine, skin cells and hair. Nevada came under fire in October 2014 when a nonprofit group released a report showing Las Vegas tested only 16 percent of kits collected by police between 2004 and 2013, with more than 4,300 left unprocessed. Nationwide, the backlog of untested kits was estimated to be more than 400,000 in 2014. Kits aren’t tested for several reasons, including if police decline to request a test in favor of other evidence or if the victim decides not to proceed with prosecution. Testing kits can also be expensive (up to $1,500 for an individual kit), which contributes to backlogs. Advocates say that testing every kit is important because DNA samples from the kits are entered into an FBI database which can uncover new leads and introduce evidence linking sexual assault or rape cases together. Who to blame? The Senate Leadership Fund ads use several pieces of evidence to claim that Cortez Masto ""neglected"" the issue for eight years, including video of an October 2014 exchange between her and a member of a criminal justice committee on the backlog issue. The video highlights a question from Richard Siegel, former president of the Nevada American Civil Liberties Union, asking Cortez Masto if she’s aware of recent articles about the unprocessed rape kit backlog issue. Cortez Masto responds that she hasn’t (clip begins at 2:17:40), which the ad highlights as evidence that she had ""no idea"" of the issue. A review of the video shows the ad plays the exchange relatively straightforward, but Siegel (who is supporting Cortez Masto) says it’s taken out of context and ignores all the other work she did on the issue. ""The truth was the opposite of that,"" he said. ""She was the leader without any question with anything to do about sexual violence."" Still, there isn’t much evidence that Cortez Masto specifically tackled the backlog issue while in office, though she did support legislation expanding access to rape test kits and more broadly sought support for victims of human trafficking and sexual violence. The most direct evidence provided by the Cortez Masto campaign is a 2012 letter that she and 52 other state attorneys general signed urging Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. The letter references a ""rape kit that goes unprocessed for lack of funding"" as an example of the consequences for not reauthorizing the bill. Cortez Masto also worked on legislation expanding access to sexual assault kits, secured grants to combat violence against women, and helped draft legislation preventing rape or domestic violence victims from being compensated due to their ""conduct,"" which critics say is a form of victim-blaming. As for the ad’s central claim, there is little direct evidence that she took direct action on dealing with the backlog. Her successor, Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt, made filling the backlog a campaign pledge and was able to secure roughly $3.7 million in grants and redirected settlement funds to pay for funding the backlog about a year after taking office. Though the funding is secured, filling the backlog is still a work in progress. Out of about 8,000 total untested kits, the Attorney General’s office says about 1,500 have been sent out for testing as of August 2016, with expectations that roughly half of backlogged kits will be sent out for testing by the end of next year. Adding to the complexity is that responsibility over untested rape kits is a jurisdictional web, as Nevada is an outlier among most states in not having a dedicated state-level forensic lab. The state is instead served by two separate police-run facilities in Reno and Las Vegas servicing the rest of the state. ""The attorney general has no responsibility over the laboratory or over the police agencies that the laboratory serves,"" said Renee Romero, former director of the Reno-area forensic lab. So there is no statutory requirement that Nevada’s attorney general must oversee rape test kits and any potential backlogs, but as the state’s top law enforcement officer, they clearly have the discretion and freedom to take on issues that aren’t clearly laid out in state law. The ads also claim that Cortez Masto was unable to find money needed to address the backlog, while her successor ""quickly"" found funds to fill the backlog. Laxalt did gain approval from legislators in December 2015 allocating $3.7 million targeting the backlog, but those funds came from various sources, including a one time payment of $1.7 million in settlement funds from JP Morgan Chase case over fraudulent debt collection practices. The initial action against the bank was taken by a group of 13 state attorneys general (not including Nevada) that negotiated the national settlement. Nevada received $1.7 million from that deal, which Laxalt asked to have specifically dedicated to filling the rape-kit backlog. Cortez Masto’s office did send out an advisory in 2014 encouraging Nevadans to file complaints about fraudulent debt collection practices with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though it’s difficult to draw a line between that press release and the ultimate settlement agreement, which Nevada played no part in negotiating and coming in July 2015, after she left office. ""It is unclear what former Attorney General Masto is referencing when she states that her work 'helped fund testing of Nevada’s rape kit' backlog,"" Attorney General’s office spokeswoman Monica Moazez said in a statement. Laxalt’s office also applied for and received around $1.9 million in federal grant money to address the backlog, which wasn’t available when Cortez Masto was in office. But it’s not a new issue, as Congress has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars targeting rape-kit backlogs since 2004 (though it’s been criticized for not effectively tackling the problem). One reason Cortez Masto may not have tackled the backlog issue specifically is because the extent of problem wasn’t revealed until the final months of her term. The first reporting as to the actual extent of the backlog appeared in October 2014, just two months before Cortez Masto left office. Our ruling Senate Leadership Fund claims, ""Catherine Cortez Masto failed Nevada rape victims,"" and ""while attorney general, thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis."" The ad is misleading in the sense that it portrays Cortez Masto as insensitive to the plight of victims of rape, but the charge that nothing was done to reduce the backlog during her time as attorney general is accurate. However, the labs where rape kits are tested are run by police, and not directly by the attorney general.

Ad attacking Joe Biden’s tax plan takes his comments out of context
","A new ad from a pro-Trump super PAC uses out-of-context footage of Joe Biden to claim that the former vice president wants to raise taxes for Americans across the board. Versions of the ad from America First Action began airing Aug. 4 on Facebook and on TV screens in Wisconsin and North Carolina. They focus largely on a comment Biden made in response to a voter during a February campaign stop in South Carolina. But the America First Action ad presents that remark out of context. And while some tax experts estimate that Biden’s plan would mean higher taxes on average for all income groups, those increases would be relatively small for all but the biggest earners.  The 30-second version of the ad opens with a narrator saying, ""Sometimes, politicians accidentally tell the truth,"" before cutting to the clip of Biden from the South Carolina event.  ""Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut,"" Biden says. The ad replays the clip later, in between additional narration. ""The New York Times says Biden’s tax increases are more than double Hillary Clinton’s plan. Even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase ‘on all income groups,’"" the narrator says, before showing the clip a second time. ""Big tax increases, crushing our recovery."" The spot finishes with Biden saying, ""It could go higher."" America First Action’s portrayal of Biden’s comments in South Carolina gives the impression that Biden told a crowd that all Americans would have their tax rates raised on his watch. That’s not the case. When Biden said ""your taxes are going to be raised, not cut,"" he wasn’t talking about his plan for all taxpayers. He was addressing one person at the February event.  The person indicated that they had benefited from the Republican-led tax bill that became law under President Donald Trump. The exchange took place after Biden said, ""By the way, how many of you did really well with that $1.9 trillion tax cut? Really good shape, right?"" The crowd mostly laughed or groaned, but one member of the audience caught Biden’s attention off camera by signaling that they benefited.  Addressing that person directly, Biden said: ""Well, you did. Well, that’s good. I’m glad to see you’re doing well already. But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.""  The full exchange shows that Biden was saying his plan would raise taxes for people who, in his words, ""benefited from"" the GOP’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. A Biden campaign official said his point was that the wealthy — not all Americans — would not benefit from his plan. The ad’s portrayal of the exchange leaves a different impression.  The same could be said of the ad’s second clip of Biden, in which he says, ""It could go higher.""  The ad doesn’t specify what Biden was referring to when he made the remark. But the complete December interview with CNBC shows that Biden was talking specifically about the top tax rate for capital gains, the profits earned from selling property or investments, which are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.  ""We should charge people the same tax for their capital gains as their tax rate is,"" Biden said. ""And I think we should raise the tax rate back to, for example, I take it back to where it was before it was reduced. It could go higher.""  America First Action frames Biden’s tax plan as providing increases that ""are more than double Hillary Clinton’s plan"" and would impact ""all income groups.""  The ad cites a report from the New York Times and an editorial from the Wall Street Journal, both published in December, as well as a March 5 analysis from the Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. The New York Times said Biden was proposing more than double the tax increases proposed by Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. That’s accurate, said Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center and co-author of the March analysis. The Tax Policy Center estimated that Biden’s proposals would raise revenues by 1.5% of gross domestic product over 10 years, Mermin said, citing what he said is the preferred metric for comparing across time. The group’s analysis of the Clinton plan put that figure at 0.6% of GDP.  But the America First Action ad was less exact in its claim that ""even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase ‘on all income groups.’"" As FactCheck.org noted, that’s a partial quote from the group’s March report. The full sentence from the report said: ""In 2021, the proposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups, but the highest-income households would see substantially larger increases, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes."" Biden has publicly vowed not to raise taxes for those making less than $400,000 per year. His plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, in part by rolling back some of the GOP-led tax law’s tax cuts for corporations and for people with taxable incomes over $400,000.  Among Biden’s proposed changes, he would: Increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. Raise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%. Place a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000. Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. The highest earners would bear the brunt of the new tax burden brought on by Biden’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center and other analyses of his proposals. The plan would lead to ""small, modest increases"" in costs for lower-income groups, Mermin said. But as we’ve reported, those changes would not be because of higher federal income tax rates across the board. ""Those small tax increases for the first four quintiles — and this is said in our brief — are almost all due to the indirect effects of the increase in the corporate tax rate,"" Mermin said, including lowered wages for workers.  On average, the Tax Policy Center’s March report predicted that the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra annually on Biden’s watch. It estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners. ""No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year,"" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis of Biden’s plan. RELATED: Facebook post wrongly claims Biden would hike tax rates for family earning $75,000 Biden has also added to his proposals since March, Mermin said, including pitching some tax credits that ""could potentially offset some of these increases for the middle-income folks.""  An America First Action ad showed Biden saying, ""Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut."" The ad takes his words out of context. Biden was not speaking about the impact of his plan on all Americans. The comment came during a South Carolina event, when a member of his crowd said he or she had benefited from the GOP-led tax bill. The full context of the quote shows Biden saying that individual’s taxes would be ""raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.""

"['North Carolina', 'Coronavirus', 'Chris Murphy']","

Senator forgets key context about UNC's COVID-19 testing
","The University of North Carolina made national news after reporting a coronavirus outbreak shortly after students returned to campus. Before students could even get their first assignments, university administrators abandoned their plans to hold in-person classes. The football team, however, is still scheduled to move forward with a modified Atlantic Coast Conference schedule. That upset U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. The University of Connecticut was the first major football program to cancel its season due to the pandemic. ""Notre Dame and UNC are sending kids home because of COVID outbreaks (at UNC 14% of students tested positive),"" Murphy tweeted on Aug. 18, adding: ""But...not football players! They need to stay no matter the risk, because the college football money machine needs to keep churning."" His tweet linked to a New York Times story about the situation at UNC.  Murphy was clearly trying to make a point about college athletes being exploited. While doing so, however, he failed to provide the full context of UNC’s outbreak. Is it true that 14% of students tested positive, as Murphy said? Not exactly. The percentage Murphy quoted is generally accurate. It’s what the percentage represents that he didn’t properly convey. Murphy’s tweet could give the impression that 14% of all students tested positive. That would mean that more than 2,670 of UNC’s 19,117 undergraduate students have COVID-19.  But that’s not the case.  While some schools (including Duke University) required students to be tested before entering campus, UNC didn’t. UNC encourages students to be tested if they believe they have been exposed to the virus. In the week from Aug. 10 to 16, 954 students were tested. Of those, 130 — or 13.6% — tested positive. The university updates its testing numbers weekly on its online dashboard. Is it fair to say that the week’s infection rate for those who were tested accurately reflects the entire UNC student population? No. Because UNC is only testing people who think they need it, the results are likely to skewed, said Donald Taylor, director of the Social Science Research Institute at Duke University. ""UNC is doing ‘symptomatic’ testing when folks are feeling sick, and contact tracing testing when you ask a person newly infected to say who they have been in close contact with, and then those folks are tested,"" Taylor said. ""People who feel sick, or who were in close contact with those who are positive would be expected to have a much higher rate of ‘positivity’ than would an entire population,"" Taylor said. If it was a random sample of students, you could extrapolate, ""but would need to say it is a rough estimate,"" said Peter Ubel, a physician and behavioral scientist at the Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. ""If they tested symptomatic students, or ones with known exposures, then that suggests the 14% figure is higher than probably seen across the student body,"" Ubel said. UNC spokespersons emailed PolitiFact to reiterate that the 14% positivity rate ""does not reflect all students."" It represents only students ""who took a COVID-19 test and had a positive result for coronavirus that week."" As for Murphy, his office doesn’t believe the tweet is misleading at all. ""Senator Murphy didn’t say it was 14% of all students,"" Murphy spokesperson Jamie Geller said. ""He said it was 14%, with no qualifier, which logically infers that it’s of those who are tested. But in case there was any confusion, he linked to the article."" We disagree with the notion that Murphy’s tweet clearly refers only to students who were tested.  Murphy tweeted that ""at UNC 14% of students tested positive."" Someone who reads Murphy’s tweet could understand that he’s referring to the small sample of students who were tested. But, on its face, the tweet could give the impression that more than 2,600 students contracted COVID-19. That’s not the case. It would have been more accurate to tweet that 14% of tests were positive, rather than students. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

New York Republican leader miscasts Democratic moves on tuition, scholarships
","Did New York state Democrats provide free tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants while shutting down scholarships for American citizens? That’s what Senate Republican Leader Robert G. Ortt charged. In a July 20 press release from the New York state Senate Republican Conference, Ortt took aim at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his Democratic allies in the Legislature, saying they’d halted the application period for the New York State Excelsior Scholarship program while the application for the DREAM Act remained open. Democrats were ""granting free tuition to illegal immigrants while closing Excelsior Scholarship applications to citizen students,"" the release said. This is partially accurate but draws a misleading contrast between undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens. In this article, we’ll explain what actually happened. In 2017, Cuomo proposed the Excelsior Scholarship program, which would provide tuition assistance to nearly 30,000 citizens from households earning less than $125,000 a year. The program was passed as part of the 2018 budget. To receive the assistance, a student must earn a minimum of 30 credits a year at a public New York college or university. After graduating, the recipient must work in New York for four years or else reimburse the tuition aid. As for the DREAM Act, it provides a pathway to legal status for youth who were brought to the United States as children with parents who entered illegally. A federal DREAM Act was introduced by senators of both parties in 2001 but has languished since then.  But in 2019, New York passed a statewide law modeled on the federal bill, officially known as the José Peralta New York State Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act. It includes provisions that secure the right of immigrants living in the United States illegally to apply for tuition assistance, including through the Excelsior program. Ortt said in the release that the DREAM Act application period granted ""free tuition to illegal immigrants."" That’s a bit oversimplified. In order to receive tuition assistance, someone without legal immigration status must first apply for DREAM Act status, according to the act’s website. Once accepted, the applicant needs to meet criteria for each financial aid program separately. The financial aid programs then calculate potential awards independently. In other words, free tuition is not guaranteed to every DREAM Act applicant, and any aid is provided by the Higher Education Services Corp., which is New York state’s higher education financial aid agency. ""No financial aid is available through the DREAM Act,"" said Angela Liotta, director of communications for HESC. ""The DREAM Act application only determines if a student is eligible to apply for funding under various New York state financial aid programs. Students meeting DREAM Act eligibility criteria can then apply for HESC-administered grants and scholarships, including the Excelsior Scholarship."" In addition, while the DREAM Act is most closely associated with those without legal immigration status, it also covers individuals with several categories of legal immigration status, At the time of Ortt’s statement, the Excelsior Scholarship program was indeed closed due to the coronavirus pandemic — for all students, not just citizens.  The HESC website said at the time of Ortt’s news release that it would not be accepting Excelsior Scholarship applications until July 24. Then, a week before that date,the agency reopened Excelsior Scholarship applications, and as of mid-August, the program remained open.  But Ortt drew an inaccurate distinction. The program was not handing money to undocumented immigrants while shutting the door on citizens. Any applicant, whether a U.S. citizen or a someone approved under the DREAM Act, would have been blocked from applying for an Excelsior Scholarship during the time the program was closed. And within weeks, the program was accepting applications again. Ortt said that Cuomo and Democratic lawmakers are ""granting free tuition to illegal immigrants while closing Excelsior Scholarship applications to citizen students."" This is a false distinction. The Excelsior Scholarship application shutdown affected both undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens equally. Individuals covered by the state’s DREAM Act -- could still seek clearance to apply for tuition assistance during the Excelsior Scholarship’s closure, but they could not be awarded financial aid as long as the scholarship’s website was closed.

"['Florida', 'Health Check', 'Coronavirus', 'Ron DeSantis']","
Fact-check: Ron DeSantis says COVID-19 is a lower risk for school-aged kids than flu
","Even as his state is a hotbed for COVID-19, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been pushing schools to reopen so parents have the choice of sending children back to the classroom or keeping them home to learn virtually. The Republican governor has said children without any underlying health conditions would benefit from in-person learning and the stimulation and companionship of being among other young people. He has also made clear that he thinks these benefits far outweigh what he considers to be minimal risks. ""The fact is, in terms of the risk to school kids, this is lower risk than seasonal influenza,"" DeSantis said, during an Aug. 10 televised roundtable discussion on education. DeSantis’ assertion got us wondering, so we asked the governor’s office what evidence it had to back up the claim. A spokesperson responded with data from the Florida Department of Health showing the state’s COVID-19 mortality rate is 0.02% for people 24 and younger. That’s the same as the influenza mortality rate for this age group. But for children 14 and younger, the spokesperson said, Florida’s COVID-19 mortality rate is 0.009%, far below the 0.01% for flu for that age group. And the risk of death is not the only concern children face if infected by the COVID-19 virus. They can develop complications that require hospitalization. ""The risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""However, infants and children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19."" The CDC estimates there were 480 deaths among U.S. children due to flu in the 2018-19 season, including 136 cases where the virus was confirmed by laboratory testing. As of mid-August, 90 children died of COVID-19 in the United States, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. More than 46,000 children were hospitalized for flu in that 2018-19 period. The hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children. The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 is 6 per 100,000 children for those ages 5 to 17, according to the CDC. The number and rate of COVID cases in children in the United States steadily increased from March to July. ""The true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness,"" the CDC wrote recently. While children have lower rates of using a ventilator than adults, 1 in 3 children hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States were admitted to the intensive care unit, the same rate as for adults, the CDC said. Dr. Chad Vercio, chair of pediatrics at Riverside University Health System in California, said DeSantis’ statement is partly true, with many caveats. Children’s risk from COVID-19 ""entirely depends on how widespread COVID is in any area,"" he said. U.S. hospitalization rates for children with COVID are lower than for those with flu, Vercio said. But that could be due to parents keeping children home and schools being closed since March, he added. ""It is unknown if these COVID hospitalization rates would rise when we open schools,"" he said. About two-thirds of Florida school districts have opened in the past two weeks with the rest planning to resume by Aug. 31. Most districts are offering in person classes while giving parents the option to keep students home for virtual learning. In South Florida, where the pandemic has hit hardest, districts are planning to at least initially only offer virtual teaching.  Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, had initially planned to reopen classrooms but reversed itself after doctors warned that school closures were likely to ensue. The county revised its plan to limit classes to only online instruction, but the state’s Education Commissioner rejected that approach, saying it denies parents the option of sending their children back to school. Fearing loss of millions in state funding, the district now plans to begin virtual learning for all students on August 24; and, on August 31, begin offering students the option to return to the classroom.  ""The direct impact of COVID-19 on children is currently small in comparison with other risks and that the main reason we are keeping children at home is to protect adults,"" concluded a report in the British Medical Journal published in June. Still, health authorities say parents should make sure children practice good hygiene and limit playtime with other children. Based on data from February through mid-May, the report found 44 deaths from COVID-19 for people 19 and younger in France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Spain, England and the United States. In a typical three-month period, there would be 308 deaths from lower respiratory tract infections, including flu, in those countries. ""At this stage of the pandemic, COVID appears to be less dangerous for children than influenza,"" said Sunil Bhopal, a co-author of the report and an academic clinical lecturer at Newcastle University in England. ""We don't need to wait for a whole season because, even at its peak in most countries, COVID killed a smaller number of children than estimated influenza deaths averaged from across a year,"" Bhopal said. ""While flu is likely to have caused more deaths than COVID, this may change as the pandemic progresses and major caution is necessary to ensure this doesn't change,"" said Bhopal, an honorary assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr. Sean O’Leary, professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said the growing number of U.S. deaths could be another reason to think about COVID-19 and children. ""We do know for sure that schoolchildren are major drivers of influenza epidemics in the community and, though that is not as much the case with COVID, it doesn’t mean they can’t spread it,"" he said.  DeSantis also maintained that kids are less likely to spread COVID-19 than they are the influenza virus. However, experts cautioned that there’s still a lot that is unknown about children’s ability to transmit the virus to the people they interact with — parents, grandparents and even their teachers. The perceived risk for teachers, for instance, is at the root of a lawsuit between the state’s largest teacher’s union and the DeSantis administration. The Florida Education Association wants a Leon County judge to stop the state’s order forcing school districts to open classrooms for in-person learning by the end of August.  Dr. Gabriela Andujar Vazquez, an infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said children are more likely to have zero or mild symptoms from COVID-19 compared with adults. ""The bottom line is kids can get infected and they tend to have less severe disease,"" she said. But the concern over reopening school is that children could spread the disease to others, including adults who are more likely to develop complications. ""Because schools are tied to the community — they are not in a bubble — and if community spread is not controlled in the community, it’s likely the school will reflect that,"" she said. One factor that can determine if disease is out of control is if positivity rates for people getting tested for COVID are over 5%. Many Florida counties have been well above that mark since June, although the rates have been dropping this month. Back-to-school risks will be handicapped based on the ability of the school to adopt physical distancing measures and enforce wearing of face masks, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Utah Health and Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital. ""This fall, we may see a lot of kids get infected as schools reopen, and those could be just the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""Even though most kids have mild or asymptomatic cases, what I worry about is just how big is the tip of the iceberg,"" Pavia said. He also noted there is a vaccine for flu — which about 50% to 70% of children receive. ""The vaccine is not perfect but does reduce the impact of the disease, and with COVID everyone is at risk and susceptible,"" Pavia said. Dr. Vidya Mony, an infectious disease expert with Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, California, said data suggests COVID-19 is not as bad for children as flu and that children are not the main driver of the pandemic. But, she said, there isn’t enough data yet to say indisputably that the COVID-19 risk is lower. ""We are learning something every day with this."" DeSantis said that COVID-19 is a lower risk for schoolchildren than is seasonal influenza. Studies show the number of COVID-related deaths and hospitalizations among children is lower than flu averages. Still, it’s uncertain if these lower rates among children were partly because schools were closed since March and whether those rates will rise as classrooms reopen this fall. It’s also unclear whether opening schools — particularly in communities with a high number of people testing positive — will lead to more spread of the disease.

Facebook post wrongly claims Biden would hike tax rates for family earning $75,000
","Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, has publicly pledged not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 if elected to the White House.  But a false claim spreading on Facebook says modest-earning families would get crushed by tax increases under a Biden presidency. ""Biden’s tax rate on a family making 75,000 dollars would go from 12% to 25%,"" the Aug. 16 Facebook post says. ""Let that sink in all you riding with Biden supporters!"" (Another post talks about a tax rate hike for families making $78,000) Readers asked about the posts, which were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The posts are inaccurate, we found. Biden’s tax plan calls for several changes aimed at raising up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to a March analysis from the Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation.  But Biden has not proposed bumping the federal income tax rate up to 25% for households earning $75,000 (or $78,000). The Associated Press and Reuters have already debunked the false Facebook claim, and Factcheck.org quashed a similar attack from President Donald Trump in May. Biden’s tax plan has been examined by tax analysts from multiple independent groups, including the Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation, the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.   Among Biden’s proposed changes, he would: Increase the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Raise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%. Place a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000. Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. There’s nothing in Biden’s plan, according to the analyses we reviewed, that would raise the federal income tax rate for a family making $75,000 or $78,000. Groups that have examined Biden’s tax plan, including the Tax Policy Center and the Committee for a Responsible Budget, have estimated that after-tax income for some lower earners could slightly decrease. But that’s not because of a higher tax rate. Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center and co-author of the group’s March report, said the small increases dealt to the lower income groups would be almost all due to ""indirect effects of the increase in the corporate tax rate,"" such as lowered wages for workers.  They would not be the result of direct changes to the federal income tax rate. ""No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year,"" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis of Biden's plan. On average, the Tax Policy Center’s March report predicted that the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra on Biden’s watch. It estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners. A Facebook post said, ""Biden’s tax rate on a family making 75,000 dollars would go from 12% to 25%."" Biden hasn’t proposed raising the federal income tax rate from 12% to 25% for married couples filing jointly and earning $75,000.

Here are some relevant dates, which the Detroit Free-Press includes in its comprehensive timeline of the coronavirus in the state. On Jan. 25, three people from Michigan were tested for COVID-19 but the tests came back negative.  On Jan. 29, the Detroit Metro Airport started screening people for COVID-19. On Feb. 5, a sick traveler at the airport is suspected of having COVID-19 but cleared the following day.  By Feb. 25, about 325 people in Michigan were being monitored for the disease and self-isolating. There were only 34 confirmed cases in the United States at that point.  On March 2, the U.S. surgeon general asks people not to stockpile masks.  On March 10, the state’s department of health and human services identified the first two presumptive-positive COVID-19 cases in Michigan. Whitmer declared an emergency.  On March 12, Whitmer ordered the state’s schools to close for three weeks. On March 13, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. Whitmer issued a press release that day about a temporary ban on large gatherings and urged people to stay 5 feet away from each other in public settings.   On March 16, Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, theaters and casinos to close, and she restricted gatherings to less than 50 people.   On March 23, she issued a stay-at-home order.  On April 1, she declared a state disaster. On April 24, more than a month after Biden’s campaign rally, Whitmer signed an executive order requiring people to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces.  This Facebook post, though, suggests that the politicians in the photos are flouting the restrictions that the state has imposed on residents to try to stop the spread of COVID-19. In reality, the rally happened before such limitations existed.  We rate this post False. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Sen. Cory Booker is from New Jersey.

Calling Goodyear dress code a “ban on MAGA hats” mischaracterizes company policy
","The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company’s dress code has drawn presidential condemnation.  On Aug. 19, President Donald Trump tweeted, ""Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!)."" In the hours that followed, Goodyear’s stock prices dipped, and one Republican mayor announced that his town would no longer use Goodyear tires for police, fire, and emergency vehicles. But how accurate is it to describe Goodyear company policy as ""a ban"" on hats that promote Trump’s ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan? Trump’s tweet came a day after a Topeka, Kan., news station shared a photo of a slide leaked by a Goodyear employee who claimed that it had come from Goodyear’s corporate office in Akron, Ohio, and was shared by an area manager during a diversity training presentation. The slide header reads ""Zero Tolerance,"" and appears to provide a definition of what is and is not acceptable to wear under the Goodyear policy.  Under a column labeled ""Acceptable"" are two bullets that read: ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender pride."" In a column labeled ""Unacceptable: ""Blue Lives Matter,"" ""All Lives Matter,"" ""MAGA attire,"" and ""politically-affiliated slogans or material."" It’s not clear who made the slide or if it is authentic; Goodyear later said only it ""was not created or distributed by Goodyear corporate, nor was it part of a diversity training class."" After CNN affiliate WIBW published the photo, it spread on social media, leading Trump and others to slam the company’s dress code as biased against Trump supporters and police.  Goodyear released a public statement clarifying its policies. The company did not reply to our inquiry. According to the statement, the company asks its associates to ""refrain from workplace expressions in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party, as well as similar forms of advocacy that fall outside the scope of racial justice and equity issues.""  This means that the ban also applies to hats and T-shirts supporting Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Goodyear said that the policy was not meant to delineate acceptable political viewpoints from unacceptable ones but to foster ""an inclusive and respectful workplace.""  Trump said Goodyear ""announced a ban on MAGA hats"" and said that ""this is what the Radical Left Democrats do."" This distorts Goodyear’s dress code and makes it sound as though the company singled out Trump campaign messaging. Goodyear has not announced a ban only on hats that display the Trump campaign’s MAGA slogan. Rather, the company requires employees to refrain from any political expression that falls ""outside the scope of racial justice and equity issues."" Campaign paraphernalia supporting Trump challenger former Vice President Joe Biden is also off-limits by this measure.  We rate this statement Mostly False.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097380100>],/factchecks/2020/aug/19/donald-trump/calling-goodyear-dress-code-ban-maga-hats-mischara/

No, Cunningham has not been 'silent' on defunding police
","To hear U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis tell it, his Democratic opponent hasn’t weighed-in on one of America’s most heated debates. Tills, a North Carolina Republican, faces a re-election challenge from Democrat Cal Cunningham. In a July 30 interview with conservative radio show host David Webb, Tillis suggested that Cunningham wants to defund the police. ""I'm very, very concerned that we're going to see, I believe, mass retirements of police officers, fewer people going into academies because (of) the Democrats. Cal Cunningham has been silent on this on defunding the police; I assume his silence is consent. I think that is a very dangerous path,"" Tillis said. Tillis has previously suggested Cunningham hasn’t taken a position on the issue. In a July 28 interview with WLOS in Asheville, Tillis told a reporter that he ""would ask (Cunningham) how he feels about defunding the police."" Is it true that Cunningham has been ""silent"" on the issue of defunding the police? No. Calls to defund the police spread after the death of George Floyd, who died at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. The phrase ""defund the police"" can imply different things, depending on who says the phrase, as PolitiFact has reported. Some protesters want to eliminate police departments entirely, while others want to reexamine the functions of police departments and redirect some of their funding to other services. On Webb’s show, Tillis spoke about why he believes defunding the police is a bad idea. The campaign provided a copy of the transcript: ""We are doing the worst possible thing with this concept of defund the police. I ask people this all the time, ‘When you dial 911 and a policeman shows up at your door are you afraid or are you relieved?’ And you know what the answer to that question is.  The bad apples need to be prosecuted and there are ones in jail. But the vast majority of law enforcement officers out there are putting their lives on the line every day and it is despicable how they are being treated. So of course crime is going to go up. Now you’ve got law enforcement officers wanting to try and stop the violent situation, but you’ve got to admit they’re humans and they don’t know. Where they would push in a little more, they’re not drawing back and that’s got to be a part of the crime, and a majority of the crime are all these people who have hijacked peaceful protests and they’re killing the very people that they profess to be representing or helping.  This is a very dangerous time in American history. I’m very, very concerned that we're going to see, I believe, mass retirements of police officers, fewer people going into academies because (of) the Democrats. Cal Cunningham has been silent on this on defunding the police; I assume his silence is consent. I think that that is a very dangerous path and our communities are going to become less and less safe as a result."" So what has Cunningham said? Cunningham told the News & Observer for a June 11 story that he is in favor of some reforms, but not defunding. He said: ""Twenty-first century policing reform will require increased investment in law enforcement, not defunding it."" His quote was later republished in articles by RealClearPolitics and The Federalist, conservative news outlets. That same day, he published an op-ed elaborating on his position. Cunningham said he supports a program that issues grants to police departments that reform their use-of-force policies. ""These policies must counsel de-escalation, prohibit chokeholds, limit no-knock warrants, and specifically address the use of deadly force, while making sure law enforcement preserves its right to proportional self-defense,"" Cunningham wrote. Several days after Tillis’ quote, Cunningham reiterated his position during an interview with WLOS in Asheville.  ""I’ve, in fact, very specifically said I don’t support defunding the police,"" Cunningham said. We asked the Tillis campaign what the senator meant by his comments. Campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said Tillis' broader point was that Cunningham ""has been silent by comparison when it comes to the overall topic of standing up for law enforcement and against violent protestors."" Tillis said ""Cal Cunningham has been silent on this on defunding the police; I assume his silence is consent."" Cunningham has not been silent on the issue. He published an op-ed in June, saying ""Twenty-first century policing reform will require increased investment in law enforcement, not defunding it."" The Tillis campaign says the senator meant something else. But PolitiFact judges people on what they say, and Tillis’ claim on Webb’s show is inaccurate.

Spanberger's no-corporate-PAC pledge needs a 2.6% elaboration
","Rep. Abigail Spanberger sits in a yard with her parents during a TV ad, talking about the lessons they imparted. ""Growing up, my parents taught me, ‘Correct what’s wrong, maintain what’s right,’"" the Virginia Democrat says.  Then, Spanberger addresses something she’s trying to correct: Corporate donations to political campaigns. ""When I ran for Congress, I promised to refuse money from corporate PACs,"" she says. ""I’ve kept that promise."" Spanberger is seeking a second term this fall in one of the nation’s most closely watched House races. She’s opposed by Republican state Del. Nick Freitas in Virginia’s 7th District which, prior to Spanberger’s election in 2018, had a long history of voting Republican. The National Republican Campaign Committee says Spanberger is lying in her ad and accepting backdoor corporate contributions. So we fact-checked Spanberger’s claim that she’s spurned corporate PAC contributions, and found it needs elaboration. According to her latest filings with the Federal Election Commission, Spanberger has raised $4.2 million in contributions since the start of 2019 through the end of June 2020. We found no money that came directly from corporations. But the NRCC has a small point. While Spanberger refuses direct corporate donations, she accepts contributions from PACs that do take corporate contributions. In other words, she receives a small amount of corporate PAC money that has been filtered.  A corporate PAC is affiliated with a specific company that gathers donations from its employees and distributes it to politicians and political interest groups. Corporate funds cannot be contributed to the PAC. There are two main conduits that receive corporate PAC money and pass it on. One of the pipelines is formed by leadership PACs, which are set up by most members of Congress to help candidates from their party. For example, Spanberger has received a maximum $10,000 from the Forward Together PAC, associated with Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. Forward Together has accepted contributions from a list of corporations, including Merck, Citigroup, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, General Electric and Altria. We counted 60 leadership PACs that have contributed to Spanberger’s campaign. The second conduit is formed by ideological PACs, which are established by groups focusing on special causes, such as regulation, defense or health care. Spanberger has received $651,000 from PACs since the start of 2019. About $111,000 of that money filtered down from corporate PACs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics - a Washington nonprofit that tracks political money. The Center made its estimate by converting the percentage of money each Spanberger PAC donor received from corporations to a fraction of money it gave to her campaign.  Perspective As we’ve said, Spanberger has raised $4.2 million since 2019 began. The $111,000 that trickled in from corporations is 2.6% of all contributions to her campaign. Sixty members of Congress - including three Republicans - have promised not to accept corporate money, according to End Citizens United, a Washington nonprofit seeking to tighten campaign finance laws. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-2nd, is the only other Virginia congress member to make the pledge. Campaign finance advocates told us they’re unaware of any incumbent who is declining both corporate and leadership PAC money. End Citizens United has endorsed Spanberger largely because of her no-corporate-money pledge and is not upset by her acceptance of leadership PAC money, according to Adam Bozzi, spokesman for the organization. Michael Beckel, research director for Issue One, another Washington non-profit seeking campaign finance reform, also told us Spanberger has been consistent.   Bozzi and Beckel said direct contributions often give corporations access to politicians. They said office holders are far less likely to feel beholden to a corporation when its money has been filtered through a leadership PAC. ""If anything, the candidate may feel indebted to the politician whose leadership PAC contributed to his or her campaign,"" Beckel said.  Spanberger ""has kept her promise to voters,"" Bozzi said. Sarah Bryner, research director for the Center for Responsive Politics, said it’s become ""vogue"" for Democrats to decline corporate PAC money, but voters should be aware. ""Candidates trying to remove themselves are putting themselves in an awkward position because to completely shut themselves off from corporate donations right now is impossible,"" she said. ""...If you need money to run a political campaign, unless you’re independently wealthy, you’re getting money from people. And most people work for corporations."" Bettina Weiss, Spanberger’s campaign manager, said, ""Abigail does not take corporate PAC money. Full stop."" She accused Republicans of waging a ""farcical"" attack on Spanberger’s fundraising. Weiss noted that Spanberger cosponsored the For the People Act of 2019, a comprehensive voting rights, campaign finance and ethics bill aimed at reducing corporate influence on Congress. The measure, with 236 cosponsors, passed the House and has stalled in the Senate. A final note: PolitiFact state bureaus have recently fact-checked two similar claims by politicians who said they have rejected corporate PAC money, but didn’t factor in leadership PAC money. Both claims were rated Mostly True. Our Ruling  Spanberger says she’s kept her promise to refuse corporate PAC donations.  She’s raised $4.2 million - none directly from corporations, although an estimated $111,000 of corporate money has come in indirectly through other PAC contributions. That’s less than 2.6% of her campaign’s take, but it counts. Realizing that it may be impossible to block all traces of corporate money from a successful congressional campaign, we rate Spanberger’s statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097646E00>],/factchecks/2020/aug/19/abigail-spanberger/spanbergers-no-corporate-pac-pledge-needs-26-elabo/

A young Kamala Harris was among Berkeley students bused to desegregate elementary schools
","Back when Kamala Harris and Joe Biden were opponents in the presidential campaign, and not running mates, she drew attention during a debate in 2019 for attacking the former vice president for his record on busing to integrate segregated schools.  ""There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,"" Harris said at the time. ""And that little girl was me."" Now that Biden is the Democratic nominee and Harris is on his ticket, her comments are again under scrutiny on social media.  ""Kamala Harris claimed to be bussed in the 60’s due to segregation type issues,"" one post says.

And the post’s comments are full of claims that Harris lied.  ""She’s a phony,"" one person said.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Harris didn’t say that she was ""bussed in the 60’s,"" as the Facebook post claims. In fact, she said, ""I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California, public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education,"" the 1954 Supreme Court decision barring racial segregation in schools. So that would mean she was referring to the late 1960s or early 1970s. We’ve previously looked at that claim and what we found supports Harris’ recollection.  The Facebook post is correct that Harris was born in Oakland in 1964. She grew up in a predominantly Black middle-class neighborhood in west Berkeley, and she was 3 years old when the city’s school board voted in January 1968 to desegregate the district’s elementary schools by busing starting that fall. Children in western neighborhoods, like where Harris lived, were bused to elementary schools in eastern Berkeley, which was more affluent and had more white residents. Children from the east were bused to the western neighborhoods, which were more racially and socio-economically diverse. Natasha Beery, a spokesperson for the Berkeley Unified School District, told PolitiFact California that Harris was ""absolutely"" accurate in her remarks on the debate stage. ""She would be part of that second class that integrated our schools through our two-way busing program,"" Beery said. ""It began in 1968. And she joined a group that had started kindergarten the following year in 1969, and so her description is correct."" Following the debate, the school district posted a history of its integration efforts on its website in response to media inquiries about Harris' experience. When Harris joined first grade in 1970, ""she joined a cohort that had entered kindergarten in the second year of the busing program, in 1969,"" the history says.  Harris attended a private school for kindergarten in 1969 and enrolled the following year in the public Thousand Oaks Elementary school, on the city’s northeast side. The city’s junior high schools had started integrating earlier, in 1964, though not using busing, and Berkeley has only one high school, so it was already desegregated.  With its ""wth?"" tag, the Facebook post implies that Harris was inaccurate in saying she was bused to desegregate public schools. That’s wrong. The timeline of Berkeley desegregation efforts and the school district corroborate her statement.  We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971B2180>],/factchecks/2020/aug/19/facebook-posts/young-kamala-harris-was-among-berkeley-students-bu/

""It’s embarrassing that even two months before the first game, you have a lot of these states deciding, oh, we’re not going to play football,"" Tuberville said Aug. 17 on Fox Business. Then he made a statistical claim. ""Let me give you this one stat: 26 of the states that have governors that are Republican, 25 have decided to play football,"" he said. ""Twenty-four states that are Democrats, three-fourths have decided not to play already and most will probably not play. So, politics involved? Yes."" Tuberville’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back his claim. But he gets a few things wrong. It’s not states or their governors that are deciding whether college football will be played this fall. It’s the colleges or the athletic conferences that they belong to, each of which spans multiple states. And Tuberville’s figures are off, too. The Alabama race could help determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. As of Aug. 17, the race was rated as ""lean Republican"" by the Cook Political Report. Jones won a special election in December 2017 for the seat vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions, who became President Donald Trump’s first attorney general. After Sessions was forced out by Trump in November 2018, he decided to run again for the seat he had held for 20 years. He lost the July primary to Tuberville, who is making his first run for public office. In big-time college football, the kind Tuberville coached in, there are 10 conferences in what is known as the Football Bowl Subdivision, which is considered the most competitive tier.  FBS, formerly known as Division I-A, encompasses more than 100 teams, from big-time programs like Alabama and Ohio State to less prominent ones such as Coastal Carolina in South Carolina and Old Dominion in Virginia. A handful of FBS schools play as independents, unaffiliated with a conference for football. Four of the FBS conferences — the Big Ten, the Pac-12, the Mid-American and the Mountain West — announced in August they will postpone all fall sports for 2020 because of the coronavirus.  None of the announcements referred to orders by governors, although some governors have issued orders affecting outdoor gatherings. For example, before the Big Ten canceled fall sports, member school Rutgers University in New Jersey said it would abide by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s order limiting outdoor gatherings to 500 people (Rutgers had a major COVID-19 outbreak among its football players.)  In South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster has warned that he will not lift an executive order that bans large gatherings, such as spectator sports and concerts, until the COVID-19 situation improves. No South Carolina colleges play in the four FBS conferences that have canceled fall football. Old Dominion (Conference USA) and the University of Connecticut, which left the American Athletic Conference in July to become an independent in football, have unilaterally canceled their fall football seasons. The decision by the Big Ten led one of its star football players, Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, to launch a ""We Want to Play"" online petition on Aug. 16. It gained more than 200,000 signatures on its first day. Tuberville was specifically asked in the Fox Business interview whether Fields’ petition has a chance to succeed. That’s when he responded with his claim about the governors.  The petition, however, is directed not at governors, but at the Big Ten commissioner and the athletic directors and university presidents of the conference’s member schools.  Conferences overlap state boundaries The other six FBS conferences — SEC, Big 12, Atlantic Coast, American Athletic, Sun Belt and Conference USA — still plan to play football this fall. So as things now stand, in Ohio, which has a Republican governor, Ohio State won’t play; neither will six Ohio teams in the Mid-American Conference. But college football is still scheduled to be played at the University of Cincinnati, for example, which is in the American Athletic Conference.  There are other examples: Pennsylvania, Democratic governor: Penn State (Big Ten) won’t play, but Temple (American Athletic) and Pitt (ACC) will.  Maryland, Republican governor: The University of Maryland (Big Ten) won’t play, but Navy (American Athletic) will. Iowa (Republican governor): University of Iowa (Big Ten) won’t play; Iowa State (Big 12) will. Finally, Tuberville’s numbers don’t add up. Based on a tally by Sporting News and a map by Stadium Network, there are only 17 states that don’t have at least one FBS team scheduled to play football this fall. Thirteen of them have Democratic governors: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. Four have Republican governors: Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska and Wyoming. Tuberville said that amid COVID-19, 25 of the 26 Republican governors ""have decided to play football,"" but ""three-fourths"" of the 24 Democratic governors ""have decided not to play already and most will probably not play."" Collegiate athletic conferences and some universities — not governors or states — are deciding whether their teams will play football this fall. Tuberville’s figures are also wrong. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D5FDC0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/19/tommy-tuberville/senate-hopeful-tommy-tuberville-fumbles-facts-abou/

Kamala Harris didn’t call Joe Biden “trash”
","During her first speech after Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden named her his running mate, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris said, ""Joe, I’m so proud to stand with you."" A recent Facebook post suggests this is a relatively new opinion.  ""I don’t like Joe Biden and do not like his history with certain people or who he’s aligned with, he’s trash to me,"" the post quotes Harris as saying in June 2019. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We didn’t find any evidence Harris said this when we looked for the quote in the Nexis news archives. In a search for the quote online, Google returned two results: a link to a Facebook page where someone had posted it in a comment, and a June 2019 blog post titled, ""Kamala Harris buries Joe Biden.""  The blog post is supportive of Harris, then still a presidential candidate, and praises her performance during a debate.  The statement that appears in the Facebook post is also in the blog post, but it’s not in a quote attributed to Harris. Rather, it’s the blog post’s author who writes: ""I don’t like Joe Biden and do not like his history with certain people or who he’s aligned with, he’s trash to me.""

Condoleezza Rice once spoke about entitlement, but this isn’t a direct quote
","The Democratic National Convention is underway and some of the party’s critics are newly cheering on Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state who is quoted in an old Facebook post that is again spreading on the social media platform.  ""CONDOIEEZZA RICE SUMS UP THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN 75 WORDS,"" the 2018 post says, misspelling her name before launching into the quote: ""If you are taught bitterness and anger, then you will believe you are a victim. You will feel aggrieved and the twin brother of aggrievement is entitlement. So now you think you are owed something and you don’t have to work for it and now you’re on a really bad road to nowhere because there are people who will play to that sense of victimhood, aggrievement and entitlement, and you still won’t have a job."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Searching for the quote online, we couldn’t find any credible, corroborating sources.  But we did find elements of the Facebook post in public remarks Rice has made in the past.  Part of the quote seems to come from a 2012 speech Rice gave at a fundraiser for a congressional candidate in Utah.  ""Rice said that what concerns here most is that the ‘essence of who we are and we believe is actually changing,’"" the Salt Lake Tribune reported at the time.  ""America has never had a narrative of grievance. We’ve never believed ‘I am doing poorly because you’re doing well,"" the paper quoted Rice as saying. ""The moment we begin to believe that we are doing badly because someone else is doing well, that moment that aggrievement takes over, it’s not long before his twin brother comes behind, and that would be entitlement.""  Earlier that year, during the Republican National Convention, she said something similar: ""My fellow Americans, ours has never been a narrative of grievance and entitlement. We have never believed that I am doing poorly because you are doing well. We have never been jealous of one another and never envious of each other’s successes. No, no, ours has been a belief of opportunity. And it has been a constant struggle, long and hard, up and down, to try to extend the benefits of the American dream to all."" Though the Facebook post could be read to mean that Rice said this describing the Democratic Party, that does not appear to be the case at either of these two events. However, it is clear that she is advocating for Republican candidates in both speeches.  As for other elements of the quote in the Facebook post, we couldn’t find evidence that Rice made those statements. If such evidence emerges, we’ll update this fact-check accordingly.  In the meantime, while this Facebook post does pull from statements Rice has made, this doesn’t appear to be a direct quote from Rice, or a shot at the Democratic Party.  We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976BC8C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/19/facebook-posts/condoleezza-rice-once-spoke-about-entitlement-isnt/

This Joe Biden coloring book isn’t marketing the former vice president as a sex symbol to children
","Coloring books are historically for kids but this one isn’t: ""Hot Cup Of Joe: A Piping-Hot Coloring Book with America’s Sexiest Moderate, Joe Biden."" Still, some people on social media are worried about it.  ""This is a real book at Walmart,"" reads one post that shows what appear to be pages from the coloring book — Biden stepping out of the shower and the former vice president shirtless on a bear skin rug. ""Trying to market Joe Biden as a sex symbol to kids? Why a coloring book?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  According to the Macmillan Publishers website, Hot Cup of Joe, which went on sale in June, is a ""satirical coloring book for adults."" ""Grab your colored pens and pencils and lose yourself in Hot Cup of Joe, an illustrated coloring fantasy featuring Joe Biden at his real and imagined best,"" the book description says. ""Whether he’s waving at you from his beloved Amtrak train, sailing his boat in a patriotic speedo, or wrestling a bear, he’s always the working-class hero you know and love.""  Walmart did not immediately respond to our questions about the Facebook post but the coloring book is listed on the store’s website under ""Funny Books/Politics"" — not the children’s section.  A spokesperson for Walmart told Reuters that the coloring book is for adults and that ""the proper placement in a store is in the adult, not the children’s area."" This isn’t the first time we’ve fact-checked a claim confused over the audience for a political book. In October, we debunked a claim that Barnes & Noble and Target were selling a parody book featuring a caricature illustration of President Donald Trump called ""If You Give A Pig the White House"" in their children’s sections.  This claim is also False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C18A180>],/factchecks/2020/aug/19/viral-image/joe-biden-coloring-book-isnt-marketing-former-vice/

Have overdoses in W.Va. increased 50% during the pandemic?
","Has the coronavirus pandemic also sent drug overdoses soaring? That’s what Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., said in a July 30 tweet. Miller tweeted, ""In West Virginia alone, overdoses have increased by 50% during the #COVID-19 pandemic. We must stop the illegal drug flow across our Southern Border. That’s why I added an amendment to 2021 government funding to #BuildTheWall. Sadly, House Democrats voted this down."" We’ve previously rated Mostly True the statement by fellow West Virginia Republican Rep. David McKinney that ""$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs."" We’ve also rated True the statement that West Virginia has the highest overdose rate of any state. In this article, we’ll focus on Miller’s assertion that the pandemic and the economic dislocation that has followed have driven an increasing number of overdoses in West Virginia. We found evidence in two West Virginia media reports published not long before Miller’s tweet that supports the idea that the state has seen a rise in overdoses since the pandemic. In late June, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported on increases in overdoses. West Virginia Public Broadcasting did so in early July. (Both outlets are PolitiFact West Virginia partners.) Both news reports cited data from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources showing that emergency responses for suspected overdoses had increased by close to 50%. At the time of those reports, the agency had recorded 923 emergency responses for May 2020, compared with 650 in May 2019. That was a 42% increase. The article also reported a more than fivefold increase for June in average weekly overdoses that are reversed by naloxone, a medication used to rapidly reverse opioid overdoses. Overdoses reversed by naloxone averaged 16 per week in June 2020, compared with norms of three per week and 12 per month, according to the article.  Miller’s office referenced the articles when we inquired, but because the articles had appeared several weeks before Miller’s tweet, we looked for state Health Department data that was available closer to the date of her statement. The data for each month are updated on the 15th day of the following month, Allison Adler, the department’s director of communications, told PolitiFact, but the updates could include some earlier months. Counting all the updates made as of Aug. 15, the number of overdoses in April 2020 held steady compared with the previous year, but the numbers did spike in May and June. Emergency response for suspected overdoses increased by 64% in May and 30% in June.  So for the three months combined, the number increased by 33% from a year earlier, but during May and June alone, the numbers rose by 47%, which is close to Miller’s figure. July numbers were on par with those in 2019, but Miller wouldn’t have known about that data point when she sent her tweet.   The department also offers another metric: emergency room visits related to overdoses. These increased by 12% in May and June compared to the year prior. (It would later rise by 28% in July.) This pattern has been echoed elsewhere in the United States.  The New York Times has reported that drug overdose deaths rose to record numbers in 2019, and are already 13% higher than average in 2020, according to mortality data from local and state governments covering 40% of the U.S. population. The Association of American Medical Colleges also reported that suspected drug overdoses rose 18% from mid-March through May, which would be consistent with the notion that the pandemic is pushing overdoses higher.  Miller said, ""In West Virginia alone, overdoses have increased by 50% during the #COVID-19 pandemic."" For the three months from April through June, EMS responses rose by 33%. Looking just at May and June, the increase was 47%.  We rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975AD3C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/19/carol-miller/have-overdoses-wva-increased-50-during-pandemic/
