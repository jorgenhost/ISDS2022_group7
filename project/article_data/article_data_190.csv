Ad about reduced tuition for Arizona’s immigrant students leaves out important information
","In the Republican primary race for Arizona governor, Kari Lake, who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, claimed that one of her opponents, Karrin Taylor Robson, is ""anti-America First."" In a 30-second TV ad that Lake tweeted July 7, she said Robson ""gave illegals tuition discounts and made us pay for it.""   .@Karrin4Arizona is trying to lie and buy her way into office.But her record shows her true colors: Pro-Amenesty & Anti-America First.Our new Ad highlights her betrayal of the American people. Share this if you're DONE with backstabbers & ready for the America First agenda. pic.twitter.com/E0xff6OOtE Lake also made the claim July 6 on Steve Bannon’s podcast ""War Room,"" saying Robson ""voted to give illegal immigrants a reduced tuition less than what American students had to pay.""  Robson served on the Arizona Board of Regents, the governing body of Arizona's public university system, from 2017 to 2021. Lake’s campaign said the claim is based on three Arizona Board of Regents votes on tuition for students in the country illegally. The claim is partly accurate. Students in the U.S. illegally who graduate from an Arizona high school qualify for a reduced out-of-state tuition rate in Arizona’s public universities — the board, including Robson, voted to allow this. (They do not qualify for in-state tuition.) But this reduced out-of-state tuition is unsubsidized, meaning taxpayers do not pay for it.  Also, the discounted rate isn’t available only to immigrants illegally in the country. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents are also eligible if they meet the specified requirements. In-state tuition for Arizona students in the U.S. illegally has undergone years of legal challenges. A 2006 Arizona ballot initiative, Proposition 300, prohibited in-state tuition for students in the U.S. illegally. However, in 2012 the Obama administration created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which prevents the deportation of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children. As a result, the Maricopa County Community College District began offering eligible DACA students in-state tuition, by accepting their employment authorization as evidence of residency. In 2013, then-Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne sued Maricopa Community College District over this decision, saying it violated Proposition 300. A Maricopa County Superior Court in 2015 ruled that extending in-state tuition to DACA recipients was not illegal. That same year, the Arizona Board of Regents voted to allow in-state tuition for eligible DACA students. Robson was not on the board at the time.  In June 2017, the Arizona Court of Appeals struck down the lower court ruling, saying DACA beneficiaries were not eligible for in-state tuition. Maricopa Community Colleges appealed the decision to the Arizona Supreme Court. That same month, on one of Robson’s first days on the Arizona Board of Regents, the board voted 7-1 to continue providing in-state tuition for DACA students while the case was under litigation. Robson supported the measure. In 2018, the Arizona Supreme Court agreed with the appeals court and ruled that DACA students were ineligible for in-state tuition. In response, the Board of Regents prohibited in-state tuition for DACA students, but turned to a 2015 board rule that allowed it to provide lower tuition costs for Arizona’s DACA recipients. That rule created an unsubsidized ""high-school graduate nonresident tuition rate,"" of 150% of in-state tuition for students who were ineligible for in-state tuition but met a set of criteria. The rate became an option for students who met all three requirements below: Attended an Arizona high school for at least three years; Graduated from an Arizona high school; and Were ""lawfully present"" in Arizona. (DACA recipients are considered to be ""lawfully present;"" that’s not the same as having legal status.) In 2019, the board unanimously voted to amend the 2015 policy so that all students who live illegally in Arizona, not just DACA recipients, are also eligible for the reduced nonresident rate.  Currently, in-state tuition at Arizona State University, one of the three public universities the board oversees, is about $13,000 a year. Nonresident tuition is around $19,000 a year, and the out-of-state tuition cost is $32,000 a year. In 2021, the board, in a symbolic vote, affirmed its support for legislation that makes DACA recipients and other Arizona high school graduates eligible for in-state tuition. This vote did not change any policies. In November, Arizonans will vote on a measure seeking a partial repeal of Proposition 300.  Lake’s ad misleads voters by claiming that Robson’s votes placed the tuition costs on taxpayers. A student who is eligible for the reduced tuition rate is responsible for paying it.  Students in the U.S. illegally are ineligible for federal financial aid, and in Arizona, because of Proposition 300, they are also ineligible for state-funded financial aid. These students rely on their own money and private assistance to pay for college. Arizona spends less than most states on higher education, according to data from the Urban Institute. A large part of Arizona’s higher education funding comes from tuition payments, not taxpayer dollars.  All students who graduate from an Arizona high school, regardless of their immigration status, are eligible for the discounted out-of-state tuition rate if they meet all required criteria. Lake claimed that Robson ""gave illegals tuition discounts and made us pay for it."" While on the Board of Regents, Robson voted to allow DACA students to continue paying in-state tuition while a case over their eligibility for this rate was resolved in the courts. She also voted to allow students in the U.S. illegally to qualify for a lowered out-of-state tuition rate if they meet other requirements. This tuition is unsubsidized, meaning the government does not pay for it. Students illegally in the country are not eligible for financial aid or student loans.

Electric vehicle fires can be extinguished with water
","Electric vehicles have received widespread praise from climate activists and President Joe Biden, but some social media users are not sold.  One user lobbed a barrage of criticism against such vehicles in a lengthy Facebook post shared thousands of times.  ""The problem with crashing any (electric vehicle) is that if you are trapped, you're dead, as it is impossible to remove victims,"" reads the July 22 post. ""Also can't put a battery fire out. Water makes lithium burn."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isn’t a new line of criticism in opposition to electric vehicles. Variations of the post have surfaced elsewhere on Facebook. It takes a lot of water to extinguish an electric vehicle fire, but the suggestion that it would cause such a blaze to burn further is wrong. Lithium-ion batteries, which are used in electric cars, have been used in smaller electronic devices, including cellphones, laptops and electric toothbrushes, for years. All batteries, including lithium-ion batteries, use positive and negative electrodes and an electrolyte solution, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. What makes a lithium-ion battery more difficult to extinguish is its use of a highly flammable organic electrolyte, Reuters reported. U.S. authorities have conducted a substantial amount of research on how to extinguish lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, the Fire Protection Research Foundation — sponsored by the U.S. Energy Department — found that water can be used to put out a burning lithium-ion battery. However, it requires copious amounts to complete the task. It took more than 2,600 gallons of water to extinguish one of the battery test fires carried out by the researchers. That's almost enough to fill a 12-foot round swimming pool. Further, the report found that ""the use of water does not present an electrical hazard to firefighting personnel."" There are also real-world examples of how such fires were extinguished. In 2021, NBC reported that when a Tesla caught on fire after it crashed in Houston, it was extinguished with water — 28,000 gallons, to be exact.  The Facebook post’s sweeping assertion that water can’t be used to extinguish a fire from an electric vehicle is inaccurate.

Evidence does not support link between Alzheimer’s and aluminum
","A favorite boogeyman — fluoride — is at the center of social media claims that it can contribute to Alzheimer’s disease.

And fluoride that’s added to drinking water and toothpaste is safe and beneficial. The idea that Alzheimer’s and aluminum might be linked first came to light in 1965, when ""researchers found that rabbits injected with an extremely high dose of aluminum developed toxic tau tangles in their brains,"" according to Alzheimer’s Society, a United Kingdom nonprofit. (Tau tangles are large accumulations of microscopic brain protein fragments that slow someone’s ability to think and remember.)

""No convincing relationship between (the) amount of exposure or aluminum in the body and the development of Alzheimer's disease has been established."" Other Alzheimer’s groups in the U.S., such as the Alzheimer’s Association and Bright Focus Foundation, concur, with the former noting, ""Studies have failed to confirm any role for aluminum in causing Alzheimer’s.""

There is no evidence that vibrational frequencies from Rife machines can cure cancer
","Did the science behind glass-shattering opera singers lead to a century-old cancer cure?  A viral image on Facebook suggests yes, writing that an American scientist named Royal Raymond Rife ""knew that everything vibrates at its own natural frequency."" Believing that if ""he could discover the frequencies of disease-causing organisms, he could destroy them with the same vibrational frequency."" The image goes on to claim that the device he invented — today known as a Rife machine — can cure cancer. But, the device is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and the American Cancer Society, Cancer Research UK, Medical News Today and WebMD have all reported that there is no reliable scientific evidence that the device works as a cure for cancer.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screenshot from Facebook) Rife machines, used in alternative medicine clinics today, emit low electromagnetic energy waves, similar to radio waves. The waves are delivered to the body via electrical pads on the hands and feet or through handheld plasma tubes. WebMD reports that these devices are generally safe.  According to a 1994 report from the American Cancer Society titled ""Questionable Methods of Cancer Management,"" Rife based his device on an unsubstantiated medical theory called ""radionics."" The theory was promoted by Dr. Albert Abrams who practiced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He believed that he could build a device that would detect the radio frequencies of diseases and cure people by emitting ""disease destroying vibrations"" at the same frequencies. He died in 1924, failing to cure himself of pneumonia or either of his wives’ cancer.  But Rife, who believed that cancer was caused by bacteria, created such a device based on the principles of radionics naming it the Rife Frequency Generator. Rife also invented several microscopes and believed he ""could visualize the auras of living microbes … (and), use the color of the auras to calculate the electromagnetic frequency of these microbes."" But the science behind it was flawed. ""Although sound waves can produce vibrations that will break glass, radio waves cannot destroy bacteria due to their low energy level,"" wrote the ACS in the 1994 report.  The device regained popularity in the late 1980s and 1990s with the publishing of a book titled, ""The Cancer Cure that Worked, 50 Years of Suppression."" While Rife clinics still exist, several practitioners have been convicted of fraud and sued for treating cancer patients with or selling devices similar to Rife machines.  Recent research has begun to explore the effect of radio frequencies on cancer cells, but research is in early stages, and uses different frequencies than the Rife machine used.   ""There is evidence that application of some radio frequencies can have favorable results. However, the human body, or even a cancer cell, is an extremely complicated system,"" said Ivan Brezovich, one of the study's researchers and professor emeritus at the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Alabama.  ""There are countless variables that need to be fully explored, such as what frequency or frequencies should be used, when should they be applied, at what intensity, at what body parts, for what types of cancer, etc.""  Brezovich believes that more research must be done and believes that ""patients should not forgo a proven method of treatment until a new modality has been verified in a scientific setting.""  A miraculous cure for cancer would be wonderful, but there is not currently evidence that Rife machines are that miracle.

Baby carrots are safe to eat, despite persistent claims otherwise
","Baby carrots may be best enjoyed with ranch dressing. But according to a Facebook post, they’ve been dipped in something far more deadly.  In a video posted to Facebook, nutritional consultant Louis Smith said baby carrots are soaked in bleach, and therefore linked to cancer. ""Did you know that little baby carrots aren't baby carrots? They're normally fully grown carrots shaped to look like a baby carrot, and then soaked in bleach or some kind of chemical to increase their shelf life from 24 hours to about eight or nine months, and that chemical could really aggravate cancer and harm your body,"" Smith said. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Smith, who is described on his LinkedIn profile as a nutritional consultant and entrepreneur, has a large following on Facebook and other social media platforms. However, his business page gives the caveat that the statements from his company ""have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration,"" and ""are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease."" We reached out to Smith to ask for more information, but did not receive a response. He’s partly correct in saying that baby carrots are made from longer carrots, and, as is the case with many vegetables sold commercially, are subjected to a highly diluted wash in bleach and chlorine. But the claim that they are ""soaked"" in bleach and are tied to cancer takes things a few steps too far. Overall, these carrots are safe to consume. Soohyoun Ahn, a lecturer in food science and human nutrition at the University of Florida and founder of the Florida Food Entrepreneurship, a program that helps provide beginning and established food entrepreneurs with information needed to run their businesses, confirmed that baby carrots come from longer ones. Thin carrots are harvested separately, she said, and then cut down and shaped into baby ones.  ""It is just a processing, and there is no harm in cutting and shaping. And carrots that (the) baby carrots are made of are thin ones, so it is very likely they would not be sold as regular carrots in the market anyway,"" Ahn said. ""So, I personally believe this is a great way to use foods without creating any waste."" The baby carrots soaked in chemicals rumor is one that’s gone around before — Snopes fact-checked it in 2008 and the website Have A Plant, run by the nonprofit organization Produce For Better Health Foundation, published an article. Both groups said baby carrots do get a wash in a diluted chlorine bleach solution, but that it evaporates quickly and the carrots are rinsed. ""The amount of chlorine used is similar to that in public drinking water and poses no health risk,"" Have A Plant wrote.  Ahn said this type of washing isn’t just limited to carrots. Many vegetables get this type of cleaning, she said.  ""Many vegetables (especially those that are ready to eat or packaged as prewashed) are washed with chlorinated (bleach) water for sanitization,"" Ahn wrote to us, explaining that the concentration of bleach is strictly kept under federal regulations. ""As long as the bleach solution concentration is under the limit set by the regulation, using bleach solution to sanitize raw vegetable is perfectly legal."" Many fresh produce have microorganisms on their surfaces when they’re harvested, Ahn said. Even though the fruits and vegetables have been processed and rinsed with a diluted bleach solution, it’s good to rinse them again after buying them to make sure there is no bleach on the surface. ""This is why consumers must wash their fruits and vegetables before consumption!"" she told us. ""So sanitizing them (especially if they will be processed into a product — such as salad mix, precut carrots etc.) is critical for food safety reasons.""  In 2021, baby carrots were recalled for safety reasons. But not because they had been oversanitized — it was because of salmonella contamination, something that ""again clearly shows the importance of sanitizing raw vegetables!"" said Ahn. Carrots are a good source of beta carotene, fiber, vitamin K1, potassium and carotenoids, which the Cleveland Clinic describes as an antioxidant pigment that ""may help protect against prostate, colon and stomach cancer.""  A Facebook video said baby carrots are soaked in bleach and can cause cancer. A nutritional expert said baby carrots are shaped from longer, thinner carrots that are unlikely to be sold as is on the market. They are washed in a diluted solution with bleach, but are rinsed off. The solution is safe under federal regulations, and is no more harmful than the chlorine solution in tap water.

Overheating can cause blood clots, but the UK’s Met Office didn’t issue a warning about it
","The United Kingdom has been hot this summer — super, super hot. It’s been so hot that U.K.’s health and meteorology agencies have issued unprecedented heat warnings.  But contrary to some social media posts, these agencies have not warned that extreme heat would heighten the risk of blood clots.   Recently, an image has been making the rounds claiming that the U.K.’s Meteorological Office, a weather and climate office, has warned that temperatures in the ""high 20s and 30s Celsius"" (or 68 degrees and 86 degrees Fahrenheit) is causing blood clotting. It shows a headline from The Telegraph stating ""‘Your blood thickens and then clots:’ What extreme heat can do to your body.""  This is the social media preview headline for an article in The Telegraph, and it was previously a headline on the article itself, although now the headline is different. The image appeared on Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.K.’s Meteorological Office, or Met Office, did issue its first-ever red extreme heat warning beacuse of temperature forecasts of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and above. Red is the highest-level warning for the Met office, indicating it is ""very likely that there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel, energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure."" However, PolitiFact found no Met statements that mentioned blood clots. A press representative at the Met Office wrote in an email to PolitiFact: ""I’m not aware of any claims we made about blood clots ourselves, but they might be getting slightly confused with the U.K. Health Security Agency Level 4 Warning — which would have spoken more about potential health impacts (as it’s designed for the health industry)."" But the Level 4 alert from the Health Security Agency doesn’t mention blood clots, either.  Cardiovascular diseases and respiratory illnesses are among the more common causes of death from excessive heat; however, dehydration, heat exhaustion and heatstroke are bigger concerns overall. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls heatstroke ""the most serious heat-related illness."" That said, there was some truth in the initial headline of the Telegraph article captured in the screenshot. Although the headline ""your blood thickens and clots"" was framed in a way that sounds absolute, heat does sometimes cause blood clots, including fatal ones. In 2017, the American Heart Association published a study about the danger of heat waves. Dr. Camilo Mora, lead author on the study and professor of geography and the environment at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, confirmed that heat waves can and do cause fatal blood clots. ""Perishing during a heatwave is like a slow torture with 27 endings to choose from,"" he wrote.  A study released May 19, 2022, analyzed excess deaths because of heat in the contiguous U.S. from 2008 to 2017. The findings state that ""each additional extreme heat day in a month was associated with (a) 0.07 additional death per 100,000 adults."" A 2014 study found that the most common excess hospital admissions during extreme heat events were for ""fluid and electrolyte disorders."" The National Institutes of Health wrote on July 21, 2022, that heat can put excess stress on the cardiovascular system, which ""can lead to a faster heart rate and an increase in inflammatory markers related to severe blood clotting."" Some people who shared or commented on these social media posts indicated they suspected a cover-up for blood clotting that is actually caused by the COVID-19 vaccines. This may be because there were rare cases of blood clots linked to the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines, the latter of which is not approved for use in the United States. But that link is small.  Getting COVID-19 carries a risk of blood clots 8 to 10 times higher than the risk from the mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna.  According to an April 2022 report, deep vein thrombosis, particularly blood clots in the leg, occurs four times more often in COVID-19 patients (0.4%) than in the control (0.1%). About 20% of people who end up in the intensive care unit because of COVID-19 develop blood clots, which is much higher than people in the ICU for other reasons.  Social media posts claim that the U.K.’s Meteorological Office warned about blood clots with extreme heat.  While blood clots are not the most common adverse effect of extreme heat waves, they can and do happen.  However, the U.K.’s Met Office did not warn about blood clots, as that office focuses on meteorology rather than health.  We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2022/jul/29/facebook-posts/overheating-can-cause-blood-clots-uks-met-office-d/

It’s physically impossible to overdose from touching a dollar bill laced with fentanyl
","Could someone overdose from simply touching an item with fentanyl on it? Medical experts say no, but that hasn’t stopped some from warning of the danger. ""Y’all be careful out there. Apparently a Jackson, Tenn. employee passed out this morning from handling a dollar bill with fentanyl on it,"" a July 21 post reads. ""Heard rumors of a 2nd store but haven't 100% confirmed that one."" The warning is light on details. It doesn’t say where in Jackson the employee worked or what happened after the employee passed out. However, medical experts have said it’s highly unlikely for people to overdose on fentanyl or react so severely to it after touching it with their skin. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that has been linked to a rise in overdose deaths in the United States. Nearly 108,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2021, with 71,000 of those deaths being linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drug can be up to 100 times stronger than morphine and is typically used to treat severe pain following surgery. It can also be prescribed to help resolve chronic pain for people who have developed tolerance to other opioids. Whereas prescription fentanyl is available as an injection, patch or lozenge, illegal fentanyl can be sold as a powder or liquid. Fentanyl is cheap to produce, its effects are potent and it’s often mixed with other drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine to deliver a more intense and addictive high while using less of the other substances, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported. Depending on the fentanyl’s purity and the user’s tolerance, just 2 milligrams of the substance can be fatal.  The drug’s lethality and prevalence have prompted law enforcement agencies to issue warnings, particularly advising people against picking up suspicious-looking money they find on the ground because it could be covered in the substance. One such warning came from Johnie Carter, director of the West Tennessee Violent Crime Drug Task Force, who on July 20 told WBBJ-TV in Jackson, Tennessee, that people shouldn’t touch rolled-up banknotes because they might have been used to snort fentanyl. ""I wouldn’t want to pick (it) up, especially with bare hands and no type of respiratory equipment,"" Carter said. We were unable to find any recent news stories or social media posts from law enforcement agencies about Jackson area incidents that would have prompted Carter’s message or the Facebook post. The Jackson Police Department did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. But, about 70 miles east of Jackson, the Perry County Sheriff's Office in Linden, Tennessee, issued a June 8 public service announcement on Facebook regarding two instances of fentanyl- and methamphetamine-laced money found on a gas station floor.  A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office told PolitiFact an employee at the gas station reported the suspicious money and threw one of the bills away. The remaining bill tested positive for the drugs.  At no point did the employee report being ill, and the sheriff’s office spokesperson said the post was meant to warn residents to be careful.  Other claims of people becoming ill after accidentally touching fentanyl made headlines in San Diego and Nashville, Tennssee, in the last year. But in each case, authorities who investigated the circumstances of the contact did not conclusively find that simply touching the substance resulted in illness. Medical experts say it’s highly unlikely someone who unwittingly touches a fentanyl-laced dollar will overdose on the drug. Although powdered fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology said in a joint statement in 2017 that the amount that enters a person’s system would not be enough to make that person feel the fentanyl’s effects, let alone overdose. Most of the drug would remain unabsorbed on the skin and could be easily brushed off or washed away without ill effect. ""It is very unlikely that small, unintentional skin exposures to tablets or powder would cause significant opioid toxicity, and if toxicity were to occur, it would not develop rapidly, allowing time for removal,"" the statement said. The symptoms reported by people who encountered fentanyl-laced money — dizziness, fainting, chest pains, blurred vision and anxiety — are also inconsistent with symptoms from opioid overdoses, which include slowed breathing, gradual loss of consciousness and constricting pupils. Prescription fentanyl patches made specifically to administer the drug through the skin would take 12 to 16 hours to deliver a significant amount of the drug to the bloodstream, so the chances of overdosing by touching a laced bill is remote, said Dr. Lewis Nelson, professor and chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine and chief of the Division of Medical Toxicology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Nelson told Reuters the symptoms people reported experiencing in stories about incidental fentanyl exposure are more consistent with stress or anxiety than drug overdoses. Dr. Ryan Marino, medical director of toxicology and addiction medicine at University Hospitals in Cleveland, told The New York Times the only way for someone to overdose on fentanyl is by actively ""injecting, snorting or some other way of ingesting it."" A Facebook post claimed a worker in Jackson, Tennessee, passed out from touching a dollar bill that was covered in fentanyl. We were unable to find any supporting evidence of the Jackson incident being reported to authorities or ever happening. But similar cases in the past have been reported in the media.  Medical experts have said the risk of becoming ill from fentanyl after touching an item covered in the drug is remote. Only a small amount of the drug would ever get absorbed through the skin and not nearly enough to cause opioid toxicity symptoms from developing, let alone an overdose. Symptoms reported by people who said they were exposed to fentanyl are also not consistent with opioid toxicity and are more in line with stress or anxiety, experts said.  We rate this False.",/factchecks/2022/jul/29/facebook-posts/its-physically-impossible-overdose-touching-dollar/

There’s no evidence the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is connected to the monkeypox outbreak
","How are monkeypox cases, COVID-19 vaccines and shingles infections connected? They are not. But if you believe claims circulating online, they are linked to a group of global elites that is using the coronavirus ""as a tool to reorganize global societies and economies to their benefit at the expense of ordinary people, with the ultimate goal of a global totalitarian regime,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League.  Those claims are part of ""The Great Reset"" conspiracy theory, which PolitiFact has repeatedly debunked. Other news outlets have also dismissed the idea as unsubstantiated. One article pushing the narrative that monkeypox is tied to this conspiracy theory appeared on The Exposé, a U.K.-focused blog that has repeatedly spread misinformation about the pandemic and COVID-19 vaccine.  ""‘Monkeypox’ is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer vaccine has been distributed and is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset,"" read a July 24 Exposé headline. The article claimed that the monkeypox outbreak is actually shingles cases caused by Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines.  ""We’re seeing the consequences of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection that causes untold damage to the immune system,"" the article said. ""And public health authorities are now scrambling to cover up COVID-19 vaccine-induced shingles and using it as an opportunity to advance their technocratic agenda of implementing ‘The Great Reset.’"" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Available evidence directly rebuts the article’s claims. Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine, marketed as Comirnaty, in August 2021 became the first COVID-19 vaccine to achieve full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Millions of people have received the two-dose Pfizer vaccine, which is a safe and effective way to prevent COVID-19.  A nurse gives a child, aged 5, the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Nov. 6, 2021. This was the first time children aged 5 to 11 across the United States had the opportunity to get immunized against COVID-19. (AP) In the seven days after vaccination, it is common to experience mild side effects including fever, chills, fatigue or headaches, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More severe side effects — including severe allergic reactions or myocarditis and pericarditis (especially for males ages 12 to 39) — are rare but can happen. Pfizer told PolitiFact it had agreements to provide its vaccine to more than 140 countries. As of July 28, cases of monkeypox have been reported in 77 countries, including 71 countries that have not historically reported monkeypox, the CDC reported. A map on Pfizer’s website shows where it has shipped vaccines, and a map on the CDC’s site also shows monkeypox cases around the world. Comparing these maps shows that the article’s claim that monkeypox is ""only circulating"" where the Pfizer vaccine was distributed is false.  Venezuela reported one case of monkeypox as of July 28, but Pfizer’s map does not show any shipments of COVID-19 vaccines. Venezuela has approved the use of Russian COVID-19 vaccines Sputnik V and Sputnik Light, Cuba’s Abdala and Soberana COVID-19 vaccines and the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines from China, according to the U.S. Embassy in Venezuela.  India reported four cases of monkeypox as of July 28. Pfizer has not sent COVID-19 vaccines to India, according to its map last updated July 3.  India is currently distributing four vaccines, per the BBC: the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, Corbevax, Covaxin and Sputnik V. Also, not all the countries that received Pfizer vaccines have reported monkeypox cases. As of July 28, for example, Indonesia has not reported any monkeypox cases, but Pfizer has shipped nearly 69 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine there.  A medical worker shows vials of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine during a vaccination campaign at the Patriot Candrabhaga Stadium in Bekasi on the outskirts of Jakarta, Indonesia, on Feb. 8, 2022. (AP)​ The CDC tracks adverse events reported after COVID-19 vaccinations, and has not indicated that the vaccines cause shingles. Nearly 10,000 cases of shingles have been reported to the CDC and FDA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System after doses of the Pfizer vaccine. This does not mean the vaccines caused shingles.  VAERS is an open system, meaning anyone can submit a report to the database, ""regardless of seriousness, and regardless of how likely the vaccine may have been to have caused the adverse event,"" per the CDC. On one occasion, a doctor said he’d submitted a report that a flu vaccine had turned him into the Hulk; that report was accepted and remained in the database for some time, he said.  Pfizer said it has not seen data that suggests its COVID-19 vaccine causes shingles. Monkeypox and shingles cause skin rashes, but they look different on the body.  Shingles causes a painful rash that typically ""occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body"" or on one side of the face, according to the CDC. In contrast, monkeypox causes ""a rash that can look like pimples or blisters that appears on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body, like the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus.""  This image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases shows a colorized transmission electron micrograph of monkeypox particles (red) found within an infected cell (blue). (NIAID via AP) The diseases are also caused by different viruses: Monkeypox is caused by an orthopoxvirus; shingles is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that also causes chickenpox.  A blog post claimed that monkeypox ""is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer vaccine has been distributed and is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset.""  ""The Great Reset"" is an unsubstantiated and widely debunked conspiracy theory. Monkeypox has been reported in countries that don’t have Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. And there are countries that received Pfizer’s vaccine that have not yet reported monkeypox cases.

No, Dr. Deborah Birx didn't change her 'tune' on COVID vaccines
","Dr. Deborah Birx, COVID-19 response coordinator under former President Donald Trump, didn't mince words as she spoke recently of the messaging around COVID-19 vaccines. Birx appeared on Fox News on July 22, the day after President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19. Host Neil Cavuto asked Birx what she would say to unvaccinated people who question the need to get vaccinated when vaccinated people like Biden are catching the coronavirus. Birx responded by touting the merits of testing and Paxlovid, the antiviral used to treat COVID-19 infections. She still recommended folks get vaccinated — but she also made a statement about vaccine communication that got plenty of people talking. ""I think we overplayed the vaccines, and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization. It will,"" Birx said.  Now some social media users are taking that comment out of context, with one viral Facebook post suggesting it shows she ""changed her story"" on the efficacy of vaccines. ""WARNING US DNA under threat!; Dr Brix changes tune on vax; FBI Huawei interferes with US military,"" read the caption on a July 25 Facebook post, misspelling Birx's name. The post shared a video from Front Page with Scott Goulet, a conservative YouTube channel.  ""Birx admits vaccines don't work,"" read the text across the screen as Goulet cut to a clip of Birx making the statement about ""overplaying the vaccines."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A look at Birx's full statements on Fox and an examination of her prior comments about the vaccines show she neither changed her tune nor admitted that the vaccines ""don't work.""  First, Birx did tell Fox News that she thought the vaccine was overplayed. But she also said the vaccine ""will protect you."" Here are her comments in full: Cavuto: ""I did want to get your take — a lot of people looking at the president having (COVID-19). And a lot of people vaxxed and boosted and they're getting it. The 20% of Americans who have not been vaccinated might look at that and say, 'Why bother? Why bother?' What do you tell them?""  Birx: ""If you're across the South and you're in the middle of this wave, what is going to save you is Paxlovid. But once we get through this wave, during that lull, you should get vaccinated and boosted, because we do believe it will protect you, particularly if you're over 70. I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection. I think we overplayed the vaccines, and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization. It will. But let's be very clear, 50% of the people who died from the omicron surge were older and vaccinated. Even if you're vaccinated and boosted, if you're unvaccinated, right now, the key is testing and Paxlovid. It's effective, it's a great antiviral. And really it's what's going to save your lives right now if you're over 70.""  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, and Biden have received high-profile criticism for overstating the extent of the vaccines' ability to thwart infection.  However, Birx has remained largely consistent in saying that COVID-19 vaccines do not provide long-term immunity, and she has repeatedly touted a multi-pronged approach to combat the virus.  We found no record of Birx saying the vaccine could provide complete protection against infection. In fact, as early as December 2020, she said that it could not curtail an uptick in COVID-19 cases.  ""I want to be very frank to the American people: The vaccine is critical, but it's not going to save us from this current surge,"" Birx said during a Dec. 6, 2020, interview with NBC. She went on to say a multipronged approach is needed to prevent the virus' spread.  Later that month, Birx said in a televised interview that much was still unknown about the level of protection the vaccines provide. She distinguished between what was known about the vaccine's ability to prevent infection and what was known about its ability to prevent disease.  John Hopkins University differentiates between infection and disease by writing that most COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent infection but do prevent infection from spreading within the body and causing severe illness.  ""Right now, we don't know how great these vaccines might be against preventing infection,"" Birx said in that Dec. 22, 2020, interview. ""So, you may get a low-grade infection. And you may shed virus. We know it protects against disease. And it protects against severe disease … But what we don't know is, 'Does it protect against infection?' And we'll be able to really understand that in the next few weeks to months."" She was blunter in 2022. During a May 1 interview with CBS, Birx criticized the false notion that vaccinated people are ""somehow invincible."" ""Let's be clear, not every vulnerable family member has an effective immune response either to the vaccine or the booster,"" Birx said. ""We have to make it very clear to the American people that your protection against infection wanes."" In Birx’s book, ""Silent Invasion,"" released in April, she recounted the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Trump administration's response. She also acknowledged the power of ""silent transmission by fully vaccinated,"" infected people.  She stressed that presuming ""vaccines have now solved the problem totally is a mistake,"" according to The New York Times. Such remarks did not deviate from Birx's previous messaging on the subject. The Facebook post pointed to an earlier comment from Birx hailing the efficacy of the vaccine to suggest she changed her mind:  ""I understand the depth of the efficacy of this vaccine,"" Birx said Dec. 16, 2020. ""This is one of the most highly effective vaccines we have in our infectious disease arsenal."" But the vaccine is effective, even if it doesn't provide full immunity from the virus. People who have been vaccinated possess varying degrees of immunity. Antibodies from the vaccine can prevent severe disease, though it doesn't always prevent reinfection. A Facebook post said Birx ""changes tune on"" COVID-19 vaccines and ""admits they don't work."" Birx's full comments show she said she believes the vaccines do work and people should get them. PolitiFact found no record of Birx stating the vaccine could provide complete protection against infection. During the initial vaccine rollout, Birx said it was unclear the level of immunity that the vaccine provided.  In subsequent interviews, she said a multipronged approach is needed to prevent the virus’ spread.

Gateway Pundit distorts unofficial Georgia 2020 results
","The midterms are about 100 days away, but allies of former President Donald Trump continue to promote false theories that election workers in key states shuffled Trump’s votes to President Joe Biden in 2020. That did not happen. Many of the falsehoods zero in on Georgia, where Biden won by about 12,000 votes. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the security of the election.  A July 22 headline on the website Gateway Pundit, which has promoted election misinformation, said: ""SHOCKING: On November 4th, 2020, Georgia showed 100% reporting and TRUMP WON – then 250,000 ballots were manufactured and Biden was given win by Raffensperger days later."" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Gateway Pundit’s headline attributed the information to Voter GA, a group led by Garland Favorito, who filed a lawsuit alleging counterfeit ballots were used in Fulton County in 2020. State investigators were unable to substantiate the allegations, and a judge dismissed the lawsuit.  Trump and his allies have attacked Raffensperger because he refused to go along with Trump’s pleas to ""find"" him more votes. Raffensperger defeated a Trump-backed candidate in the state’s May primary and will face Democratic state Rep. Bee Nguyen in November. The gist of these claims stems from a brief interview Raffensperger gave to ""Today"" on Nov. 4, 2020, the morning after the election. Raffensperger told the show that his state still had ""about two percent"" left to count out of 4.7 million votes. ""I don't think it will change any of the outcomes,"" he said, adding that he would leave speculation to people who predict elections.  As ""Today"" displayed a graphic showing Trump was ahead in Georgia by about 100,000 votes, MSNBC’s Chuck Todd noted that they still had to count some ballots in areas favorable to Democrats. Later that morning, Raffensperger told reporters that there were 200,000 ballots left to count, including absentee and early votes.  On the morning of Nov. 4, the state’s website for election results showed Trump was ahead. But there results from 13 precincts were still uncounted. A disclaimer at the top of the page stated: ""Unofficial results — totals may not include all absentees or provisional ballots.""  That disclaimer is key, particularly in 2020, when voting by mail proved popular because of COVID-19. Later in the week, the state website showed all precincts had been counted. Even then, the website still had the disclaimer about absentee and provisional ballots.  Trump’s lead shrank as more ballots were counted. By Nov. 6, 2020, the unofficial showed Biden had narrowly pulled ahead. The Associated Press didn’t call Georgia for Biden until about two weeks after Election Day as it waited for the results of another count. When the final results were certified on Nov. 20, Biden won Georgia by about 12,000 votes.  The Gateway Pundit article repeatedly and wrongly refers to Raffensperger as ""corrupt."" If a state election official ""manufactured"" ballots, that would be a crime. More than 20 months after Election Day, no court, law enforcement agency or election office has found such evidence. It also defies logic that Raffensperger, a Republican, would participate in a felonious scheme to help a Democrat win the presidency. In leaked audio released by Mother Jones earlier this month, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is heard telling associates in October 2020 that Trump was aware that the slow counting of mail-in ballots would mean the returns would likely show early Trump leads in key states. ""What Trump’s gonna do is just declare victory. Right? He’s gonna declare victory. But that doesn’t mean he’s a winner,"" Bannon is heard saying.  Georgia’s results were affirmed by three separate counts. PolitiFact was one of many news outlets before the 2020 election that told voters to be patient while awaiting results and that early winners may not be the final winners. State laws include timelines for officials to count ballots, including by mail, provisionals and overseas ballots. Those same lessons about not leaping to conclusions about partial or unofficial results apply to the midterms.  The Gateway Pundit wrote that in 2020, ""250,000 ballots were manufactured"" and the Georgia secretary of state, Raffensperger, improperly awarded the state to Joe Biden.  The article relies on unofficial results released the morning after Election Day to suggest a criminal intervention on Biden’s behalf. What really happened was that the total number of ballots for Biden grew as they were counted, flipping the state’s electoral votes from Trump to Biden. This is not a sign of ""manufactured"" ballots; it is a sign that it takes time for election officials to lawfully count all ballots. Raffensperger followed the law in certifying those final results.

Vos’ claim on ‘illegal’ drop boxes conflicts with earlier stance on their use
","On July 8, 2022, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the use of drop boxes to collect absentee ballots was illegal. It was a victory for Wisconsin Republicans, who now oppose the longstanding use of drop boxes – a voting approach that had grown increasingly popular during the coronavirus pandemic, including the 2020 presidential election.  Former President Donald Trump has heavily criticized drop boxes in his continued baseless allegations that fraudulent voting led to his reelection loss that year. (Multiple lawsuits, recounts and audits have failed to turn up evidence of widespread voting fraud. Trump even claimed the court’s ruling was retroactive to 2020, which we rated Pants on Fire.) Assembly Speaker Robin Vos was among those cheering the court ruling, tweeting: ""The legislature has long maintained that the law never allowed these illegal drop boxes and we’re happy to be vindicated by today’s decision.""  But some were skeptical of the first part of his statement, questioning just how long the party held that stance and pointing to an instance two years ago where Vos had advocated for the use of drop boxes.  Let’s check it out.  When Vos tweeted the sentiment, another Twitter user quote-tweeted his statement with the caption: ""This you?""  That tweet featured a Sept. 25, 2020 letter that Vos and then-Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald sent through a lawyer to Maribeth Witzel-Behl, Madison’s city clerk, prior to two ""Democracy in the Park"" events that were held in September and October 2020. At the events, more than 17,000 voters dropped off absentee ballots at stations set up in Madison’s 206 city parks. The events were staffed by poll workers who had either worked in the past or were scheduled to work the Nov. 3, 2020 election.   The Supreme Court decision, which said that state law does not permit drop boxes anywhere other than election clerk offices, and that the boxes have to be manned at all times, would render future events like that illegal.  The Vos and Fitzgerald letter, the one sent before the events, decries what they describe as the ""imminent, illegal collection of absentee ballots"" at the events. (Vos spokesperson Angela Joyce told us Vos was concerned that at the events, ballots ""were received in an unsecured manner with no clear statutory authority to do so."")  The letter suggested that voters instead use other available methods of returning their ballots.  Specifically, among the approaches they suggested: Dropping ballots in ""authorized ‘drop boxes,’ which ‘must be secured and locked at all times’ to protect ballot integrity."" As a reference, the letter cites an Aug. 19, 2020 memo from Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe describing absentee ballot drop box information. ""We wholeheartedly support any of these convenient, secure and expressly authorized absentee-ballot-return methods,"" the letter says.  Now, it’s important to pause here and note what kinds of drop boxes were authorized at the time. The memo from Wolfe outlines a handful of locations for municipalities to offer drop boxes. In addition to the clerk’s office, it instructs them to be placed in ""convenient, accessible locations, including places close to public transportation routes, near or on college campuses, and public buildings, such as libraries and community centers familiar to voters and easy to find.""  Since the letter from Vos and Fitzgerald cites this particular guidance and notes that they ""wholeheartedly support"" the methods they listed, it would seem that they supported such drop boxes at locations other than the clerk’s office, as long as they were secured and locked.  According to an affidavit from Wolfe, the commission was aware of 528 drop boxes across the state in 2020. For the following spring election, there were 570, including ones in at least 66 of the state’s 72 counties. So, when Vos says Republicans have long maintained the boxes were illegal, ""long"" would have had to mean less than two years ago, which is when that letter was sent. When we asked Vos’ office for evidence of the long opposition, Joyce did not point us to earlier statements or prior legal action as backup. Rather, she pointed us to the very same letter that we just examined. Let’s return to the issue: How long have legislative leaders maintained that the law did not allow such drop boxes?  Vos’ office did not point to any pre-2020 letters, legislative bills, lawsuits or other actions meant to curb them. Instead, Joyce also circled back to 2020, writing that Vos ""has opposed unsecured drop boxes since they became an issue in the 2020 election.""  She pointed to the Legislature’s ordering a nonpartisan audit of Wisconsin’s elections last February and the hiring of former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman to probe the 2020 election as proof that lawmakers were concerned about drop boxes. (The nonpartisan auditors concluded that rules on how to use drop boxes needed to be adopted should they continue to be used; Gableman’s review is ongoing.) But all of that has happened since 2020, which underscores that the boxes had not been an issue for many years.  Vos claimed that the Legilsature has ""long maintained that the law never allowed these illegal drop boxes."" His spokesperson drew a distinction between what was authorized by the court ruling and events like Democracy in the Park. But that seems to miss the point.  At the time that Vos sent a letter suggesting the Madison clerk’s office instead use approved methods like drop boxes, the state Supreme Court ruling was many months in the future. So, we can only assume the letter was referring to the drop box practice in place at the time. More importantly, his own staff noted his concern only arose during the 2020 election, when the boxes – which had been around for many years – gained widespread attention. So, we think that claiming long-standing opposition overstates the case. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/jul/29/robin-vos/vos-claim-illegal-drop-boxes-conflicts-earlier-sta/
"['Deficit', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Janet Yellen']","
The White House’s big deficit cut, and why it merits an asterisk
","Facing four-decade-high inflation and a declining stock market, the Biden administration has tried to tout some positive signs for the economy. Often, administration officials cite today’s historically low unemployment rate. On occasion, they’ve touted progress on reducing the federal deficit. During an appearance on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, ""We've cut the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this year."" Yellen has a point on the scale of the reduction, but it’s important to put this decline into the context of the coronavirus pandemic, which jolted the federal government’s fiscal picture and helped produce the large deficit decline Yellen is touting. First, a refresher about deficits. The federal deficit is determined by subtracting federal spending from federal revenue, primarily tax collections. If revenue exceeds spending, there’s a surplus. If spending exceeds revenue, there’s a deficit. (There hasn’t been a federal surplus since 2001.) The Congressional Budget Office’s most recent estimate of the 2022 federal budget projects a deficit of about $1.04 trillion. That may sound like a lot of money to be in the hole. But it’s a lot smaller than the federal government deficit was during the previous year: $2.78 trillion. That’s a difference of roughly $1.7 trillion. That is slightly more than what Yellen said. However, there are a variety of ways to measure income and spending, and all these numbers are moving targets until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. The bigger problem factually is Yellen’s characterization of the deficit reduction as a ""record."" This year’s projected decline is larger than any previous one-year reduction in the deficit, but that’s because of an extraordinary historical occurrence: the coronavirus pandemic, and the unprecedented government response. During 2020 and 2021, the federal government’s spending skyrocketed as both the Trump and Biden administrations tried to ease the pandemic’s economic blow. Moves included enacting stimulus payments, extending unemployment insurance, instituting business operation grants and increasing public health spending.  From 2019 to 2020 alone, federal spending rose by 47%, and then remained at a similar level in 2021, CBO data shows. Because tax revenue didn’t keep pace with spending, the deficit surged in 2020 and 2021. The deficit rose from $983 billion before the pandemic in 2019 to about $3.1 trillion in 2020 and $2.8 trillion in 2021.   The coronavirus pandemic isn’t over yet, but vaccines and therapies have cut the risks associated with it, and the economy has opened up again. As a result, spending programs passed earlier in the pandemic began expiring this year, meaning federal outlays have declined. This phenomenon — the passing of a temporarily expensive phase for the federal government —  caused the record amount of deficit reduction. Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group tracking the federal budget, said that although the spending on the public health emergency is understandable — much of it set in motion by Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump — it’s important to note the unusual circumstances of the decline. ""While I welcome deficit reduction, the $1.5 trillion was off of enormous deficits,"" Ellis said. ""It lacks a certain context."" Indeed, the deficit projected for 2022, just over $1 trillion, is a bit larger, but roughly in line with the deficit from 2019, the last prepandemic year, which was just under $1 trillion. So someone could just as easily say that the Biden administration has overseen a return to normalcy in budget deficits rather than set new records for deficit reduction. The Treasury Department told PolitiFact that the expiration of pandemic spending programs, rather than their continuation, stems from policy successes by the Biden administration, so it’s not unreasonable to give the administration some credit for enabling that reduction. ""The end of COVID relief spending is no accident and instead the direct result of the administration’s vaccination and COVID strategy,"" the department said in a statement. Such improvements were ""not automatic. In fact, there is plenty of evidence that distribution of the vaccine pre-Biden was riddled with problems."" Still, it’s important to note that the ""record"" deficit reduction is not an apples-to-apples historical comparison. The reduction followed an extraordinary period of high federal spending amid a global pandemic unseen in at least a century. Yellen said, ""We've cut the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this year."" The final figure remains to be seen, but projections range from $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion, which is in the ballpark. However, declaring this a record sidesteps the highly unusual circumstances that made it possible — the expiration of spending measures to combat the pandemic. Although the administration can claim credit for improving matters enough to be able to wind down the pandemic-related spending, the circumstances merit an asterisk when records are being touted.

Rubio says he didn't vote for tax increases as member of West Miami City Commission
","The tax-cutting bona fides of former House Speaker Marco Rubio and Gov. Charlie Crist were center stage during their first U.S. Senate primary debate.

In front of a national television audience March 28, 2010, on FOX News Sunday, Crist and Rubio tried to one-up each other on their voting records and accomplishments. If you weren't watching, it went something like this:

I cut taxes. You raised taxes.
Nuh-uh. You raised taxes. I cut taxes. You're a liar.
Well, you're a bigger liar, you tax raiser.

Crist told Fox's Chris Wallace that he signed the largest tax cut in the state's history, (a claim we twice have rated False) while Rubio proposed the largest tax increase ever in Florida (a claim we plan to rate soon). Rubio claimed that Crist broke a no new taxes pledge (he signed a 2009 budget with $2.2 billion in increased fees) while Rubio kept the same pledge (a claim we also rated False). Rubio also said Crist is distorting Rubio's tax record. That prompted a comeback from Florida's sitting governor.

""Just let me say that (Rubio) voted for tax increases when he was on the West Miami City Commission, and he said on his Web site that he has never voted for a new tax,"" Crist said. ""That's just not the truth, and he ought to be truthful to the people of Florida before he asks for their vote.""

Rubio responded flatly: ""Chris, that's also inaccurate.""

Because both candidates seem hung up on if either ever supported a tax increase, we wanted to examine Rubio's time as a West Miami City commissioner.

Before he was elected to the state House, Rubio was a member of the West Miami City Commission from 1998-2000. Records show that in 1998 and 1999, he voted to increase the city's property tax collections.

Understanding the process can be a little tricky.

Cities and counties across Florida set a property tax rate. That rate, which essentially is a percentage, is then mulitplied by the value of a person's property. The result of the calculation is a person's property tax bill.

West Miami didn't raise its property tax rate in either 1998 or 1999, but because property values increased (the other half of the calculation). West Miami took in more money in 1998 and 1999, and West Miami residents paid more in property taxes.

West Miami published a ""notice of proposed tax increase"" in 1998 and 1999, according to the Palm Beach Post, and state law requires city leaders to announce the tax rate as a tax increase.

PolitiFact Florida tracked down the final budget resolutions for both years. They show that the city of West Miami, without raising tax rates, was increasing property taxes -- 1.402 percent in 1998 and 5.545 percent in 1999. The roll call has then-Commissioner Rubio as voting ""Y"" both years.

A Rubio spokesman, Alberto Martinez, told the Post that Rubio did not vote for tax increases because the tax rate did not change. It's an ironic argument because Rubio argued as a member of the Legislature that local governments were raising taxes while being able to claim they were keeping the tax rate the same. ""One of the reasons the system is broken is because with the massive escalation of valuations, local governments have been able to brag about cutting your millage, yet you are still paying more in property taxes,"" Rubio wrote in a 2007 letter to supporters.

That's what happened in West Miami.

Responding to a claim from Crist, Rubio said it was ""inaccurate"" to say he voted to raise taxes while a member of the West Miami City Commission. But Crist got it right, records show. We rate Rubio's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/28/marco-rubio/rubio-says-he-didnt-vote-tax-increases-member-west/

When a reporter asked for evidence of spillover during a telephone press conference Cornyn hosted on the day the senators' letter went to Obama, Cornyn initially seemed to backpedal. ""As far as the Texas border is concerned, to my knowledge, we have not had spillover violence, per se ... I should have said the threat of potential spillover violence,"" he said. 
Cornyn continued: ""We have had American citizens die in Mexico, and I've been to ... Laredo and visited with families of Americans who have lost loved ones in Nuevo Laredo, some of whom have been kidnapped and others have not been heard from again. And, of course, the latest killings in Juarez raise this specter of security of American citizens who are visiting Mexico."" 
So which is it: real violence or the threat of it? 
Kevin McLaughlin, Cornyn's spokesman, told us later that Cornyn misspoke during his press conference. McLaughlin said: ""There are instances of spillover violence occurring in Texas along the border."" 
McLaughlin sent us nearly 20 news articles and editorials from 1999 into 2010 reporting incidents that could indicate the increasing bloodshed in Mexico is trickling into Texas. 
For example, Santiago Salinas, a man connected to a Mexican drug cartel was shot and killed in a Houston hotel in 2006. In 2008, a Mexican citizen and a distant relative of Rep. Silvestre Reyes' wife was kidnapped in Juarez and released after her family, who lives in the United States, paid some $32,000 in ransom. 
In September, Sergio Saucedo, who authorities say was connected to a Mexican drug cartel, was kidnapped at gunpoint from his home in Horizon City in El Paso County. His mutilated body was found in Juarez. In May, a member of the Juarez drug cartel was fatally shot outside his home in El Paso. 
In January, authorities linked a grenade used in an attack on a bar in Pharr, where three off-duty police officers were, to a drug cartel in Mexico. And in March, two men were kidnapped from the parking lot of a McAllen Wal-Mart and non-fatally shot in connection with a cartel. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued an alert warning El Paso law enforcement that the Barrio Azteca gang in El Paso might retaliate after officers arrested 54 members and associates of the gang the week before. The warning was based on ""uncorroborated information"" that the gang might authorize its members to murder officers in the El Paso area. 
Other reminders of violence near the Mexico-Texas border include the sighting of a Mexican military helicopter flying over Zapata County, the Texas Department of Public Safety warning spring-break revelers to avoid Mexican border towns and a recent inflow of Mexicans from El Porvenir seeking political asylum in Fort Hancock after members of a Mexican drug cartel threatened to kill residents and torch their homes. Earlier, in September, the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College closed for several days after stray bullets from a shootout along the Matamoros levee hit a car and building on campus. 
Last year, 79 Americans were murdered in Mexico, according to the U.S. State Department. From 2003 to 2008, the annual homicide toll ranged from the low 30s to the high 40s. Murders of people in Juarez increased from 1,609 in 2008 to 2,657 in 2009, according to the Texas Department of Safety. This year, more than 550 people have been killed in Juarez. 
Still, it seems the definition of ""spillover violence"" may depend on where you're viewing it from. 
The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides research analysis to Congress, recently found that no data exists that can definitively answer whether there has been significant spillover violence from Mexico, and anecdotal reports have been mixed. 
""Currently, U.S. federal officials deny that the recent increase in drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico has resulted in a spillover into the United States, but they acknowledge that the prospect is a serious concern,"" the service reported Feb. 16. 
According to the service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration defines ""spillover violence"" as ""violence targeted primarily at civilians and government entities — excluding trafficker-on-trafficker violence"" though other experts and scholars have recognized such in-fighting as central to spillover, according to the report. 
Testifying before the U.S. House Appropriations Committee in March 2009, Joseph Arabit, the special agent in charge of the administration's El Paso division, said: ""We are all tempted to paint the problem with a very broad brush and react emotionally to violent incidents inside the United States involving Mexican drug traffickers and their victims. But it is crucial, in order to address the problem with the appropriate programs, resources and operations, that we understand the difference between ""terrorist"" acts — the murder of a U.S. law enforcement agent, or the bombing of a U.S. government building, for example — and actions that are characteristic of violent drug culture, such as the killing of an individual who owes a drug debt to the organization."" 
The Texas Department of Safety defines spillover violence as ""Mexican cartel-related violence that occurs in Texas, including aggravated assault, extortion, kidnapping, torture, rape and murder. The victims of these crimes include illegal immigrants being smuggled into the U.S., Mexican or U.S. citizens working with the cartels or their innocent family members, and those who are not associated in any way with the cartels or transnational gangs."" 
Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Safety, said there's ""no question"" spillover violence is growing in Texas. 
When we asked McCraw about the federal government's definition of spillover violence, he said: ""We don't care how they define it. For obvious reasons, it doesn't matter — it's either a violent act or not a violent act."" 
""We've got ongoing kidnapping investigations, we've got murder investigations, without question, related to cartel activities,"" he said. 
The Texas department said it doesn't yet have statistical breakdowns of spillover violence, though McCraw listed 12 incidents since 2008 that the department considers related to Mexican cartels and transnational gangs. 
Among them: 
— In February, an illegal immigrant connected to a cartel was found murdered near Mission, at 10 Mile Line and Western Road. The same month, a Mexican Mafia member tried to run over a trooper in Laredo . 
— In August, border patrol agents near Laredo were pinned down by gunfire across the border, and a U.S. Border Patrol agent was run over by an ATV during a smuggling attempt. 
— In October 2008, a Donna man was kidnapped and taken to Reynosa, Mexico, where he was killed. Two months earlier, a Weslaco convenience store owner and drug dealer was kidnapped for ransom and taken to Reynosa and then shot, dismembered and burned. 
Also, the DPS said Adan Mondragon, who Austin police fatally shot after he fired an assault rifle in November 2008, was linked to a Mexican drug-trafficking organization. 
Still, other published news reports and our interviews with law enforcement officers suggest that officials closest to the border see little evidence of spillover violence. 
Deputy Sheriff Jesse Tovar of El Paso County told us spillover violence ""remains to be seen."" Tovar said he considered Saucedo's kidnapping and the El Paso homicide last year two ""direct spillover"" incidents, but he called that kind of violence ""nothing new."" 
""Statistically speaking, the streets are pretty safe,"" he said, but ""there's a war zone going on across the river."" 
With that in mind, Tovar said the sheriff's office has operation plans in place ""in case something happens,"" but declined to elaborate for security reasons. 
For Terrell County Sheriff William McDonald, so far the only spillover from Mexico has been smugglers, who have been breaking into homes in his jurisdiction more frequently since violence escalated in Juarez. (Terrell County is east of Brewster County, home to Big Bend National Park.) Cliff Harris, sheriff for Pecos County, whose southern border lies about 20 miles north of the border, said that there's a threat of spillover violence but that ""so far we haven't seen anything."" 
This month, The Texas Tribune reported that neither Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino or Laredo Mayor Raul Salinas were aware of any spillover violence. 
Monica Weifberg-Stewart, a retailer from McAllen and chair of border security and immigration for the Texas Border Coalition, which advocates for security on the Texas-Mexico border, said: ""(Do) we have the shootings, the kidnappings, all that violence, similar attacks of war? Absolutely not... Now, are there bad people everywhere that want to do bad things? Absolutely. We have that all across the United States."" 
She said, ""I go to work every day, I feel no different than I did before escalation of violence happened on the Mexican side. So if that's the definition of spillover violence, there is no spillover here."" 
Vince Perez, Rep. Reyes' press secretary, said Texas hasn't experienced violence like Mexico, noting that even though Juarez is just across the Rio Grande, El Paso is still the second-safest city in the country, after Honolulu. 
""We're trying to be very careful in terms of what we characterize as spillover violence,"" he said. 
But Don Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, said concerns about spillover are widespread. Reay said: ""It does affect the community. The threat is there, continually, day by day, up and down the border."" But Reay — who represents 20 sheriffs who belong the coalition, which lobbies for border security funding — said acts of violence north of the border remain ""mostly isolated incidents,"" though ""the threat is constant."" 
The University Medical Center in El Paso, for example, often treats victims of shootings in Mexico in the U.S., Reay said. And the threat of cartel members showing up at the hospital to kill the wounded has caused law enforcement to beef up security. 
However, Margaret Althoff-Olivas, director of public affairs for the University Medical Center of El Paso, said there is ""no sense of encroaching violence"" at the hospital and that law enforcement hasn't taken extra security measures there since June 2008. On three occasions, beginning in January 2008 when a wounded law enforcement official from Chihuahua State was treated at the hospital, authorities temporarily restricted hospital entrances and required all visitors to enter through metal detectors. 
Others likewise say they're not aware of spillover violence. 
Arturo Saruhkan, Mexico's ambassador to the United States, told the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio-Express News: ""The term 'spillover' would, at least in my eyes, seem to be a bit of a false dilemma. You speak of ‘spillover' as if you had the pristine waters of Alaska contaminated by the spill of the Exxon Valdez. That is, there was nothing there before the Exxon Valdez created the accident ... To assume that in Texas there are no distribution networks, drug traffickers don't have safe houses, they don't have banks, they don't launder money, is disingenuous or naive at the least. 
""So, 'spillover'? They're already there."" 
Sarukhan added that more violence in Texas was possible ""if the drug trafficking syndicates decide to use San Antonio as their hub and local law enforcement step up their efforts to shut them down."" 
Where does all this leave us with the senators' claim of escalating spillover violence? 
No one denies the omnipresent threat of spillover violence along the border. Yet officials including law officers closest to the border say there is no surge spilling over. Using its own measure about a year ago, the U.S. DEA similarly said there was no spillover violence. 
Then again, the Texas DPS says spillover violence, especially related to cartels and gangs, is a statewide problem on the rise. 
Mindful there's not yet an independent gauge of spillover violence, the authoritative CRS threw up its hands at this issue. 
For now, we're going with the officials who live closest to the border. There have been violent acts. They are sporadic. They aren't yet measurably increasing. 
We rate the senators' statement to Obama as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/28/john-cornyn/cornyn-says-spillover-violence-texas-real-and-esca/
"['Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
Dewhurst says state's health care tab is $2.4 billion per year
","The hot debate over health care policy boiled in the days after Congress acted to revamp the nation’s health care system. In Texas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, lashed out at the new law, saying in a Sunday statement: ""This federal plan costs Texas taxpayers $2.4 billion per year."" That's a big tab; the entire general revenue fund budget for state health and human services is about $12 billion this year.Was Dewhurst on the money?First, let's stipulate that the plan signed into law this week by President Barack Obama will cost states and the federal government. There is a cost to extending health coverage to as many as 32 million uninsured Americans — and with 6.1 million people lacking health insurance, Texas has the nation's largest share (25.1 percent) of uninsured residents.Among the changes wrought by health care reform: requiring most Americans to have coverage and expanding Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor financed with federal and state dollars. Both are expected to affect state budgets. Starting in 2014, the law makes it easier to qualify for Medicaid; everyone who makes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level will be eligible. (For a family of four, that level is currently $29,327. For a single person, it's $14,404.)The Texas Health and Human Services Commission assumes that about 2 million people will sign up for the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program because of the new federal law. The cost will be largely covered by an influx of federal aid, possibly amounting to more than $120 billion.That'll be a dramatic shift for Texas, which limits access to Medicaid more than most states. Currently, adult Texans without children do not qualify, and the vast majority of the people in Medicaid are children. Few poor parents are covered unless they're disabled or pregnant.Mike Wintemute, a Dewhurst spokesman, said the lieutenant governor was referring to a state Health and Human Services Commission analysis that estimates the health care law will cost Texas $24.3 billion over 10 years. To reach the annual figure, Dewhurst divided by 10.Dewhurst, Gov. Rick Perry and Texas House Speaker Joe Straus cited the 10-year figure in a March 19 letter to members of the Texas congressional delegation urging them to vote against the Democratic-backed health care legislation. Similarly, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, posted a Facebook message Thursday saying the law would ""cost Texans $24.3 billion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years.""Carter erred; the state estimate doesn't cover the next 10 years. Instead, Texas based its cost estimates on the decade that begins nearly four years from now, in 2014 — the year Medicaid costs will start surging. That's not the time frame (2010-19) the federal government is using to project costs. Using different decades makes it hard to compare Texas' cost projections with others.The figure cited by Dewhurst and others is also problematic for other reasons.First, Dewhurt's total is based on the maximum sum — $24.3 billion — that can be drawn from the commission's analysis. The agency's report, issued earlier this year, specifies $15.6 billion as the baseline cost of the legislation's 10-year impact. Another $6 billion related to losses in federal aid for hospitals is listed as ""possible."" The remainder (less than $3 billion) relates to provisions that were not yet part of the plan.Second, the state’s cost estimate is based on an earlier version of the legislation, not the final bill. Various ""fixes"" to the law — known as the reconciliation measure — passed Congress this week and will also be reflected in future updates of the cost estimate.  During the first few years, the federal government will shoulder 100 percent of the burden for Medicaid expansion and then scale back to about 90 percent. But much of the estimated cost of health reform to Texas is not due to Medicaid expansion per se — that is, serving people who do not yet qualify for the program — but from taking care of those who are eligible now but not signed up. The state calculates that, primarily because of the the new law's requirement that people get coverage, more than 550,000 already-eligible folks will be among the 2 million to enroll in Medicaid and CHIP in future years. When they start showing up, in what's called the ""welcome mat"" phenomenon, they will cost the state more than the newly qualified enrollees because the federal government will pay less of the cost to serve them.The state’s estimate puts these ""welcome mat"" costs at $11.4 billion — nearly half of the $24.3 billion total.The Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, an advocate for low- and middle-income Texans, has criticized the state for putting those costs in their estimate.A spokeswoman for the health commission, Stephanie Goodman, defended their inclusion, saying that no matter the reason they enter the government programs, those new enrollees will be costly.Anne Dunkelberg, the center's associate director, also questioned the ""possible"" $6 billion that the analysis says could be needed to replace hospital funding that might be lost because of the new law. That money goes to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid patients and the uninsured. As the number of uninsured patients drops, those subsidies are expected to fall too.Dunkelberg said that cost is overstated because the federal cuts will be targeted to states that have fewer uninsured people. In fact, said Goodman, state analysts will likely reduce that $6 billion estimate, though by how much is not known.A March 20 letter from U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, to U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, refers to a Congressional Budget Office estimate that Waxman says would put the Texas share of the Medicaid expansion, including the costs of increased enrollment by people already eligible, ""in the neighborhood of"" $1.4 billion from 2014 through 2019. Of course, that number covers only the first five years of the Medicaid expansion. But it seems unlikely that a full 10-year analysis would ramp up the total cost as high as the state's $24.3 billion figure.So, where does that leave Dewhurst's claim that the federal plan will cost Texas taxpayers $2.4 billion per year?Basically, on squishy ground. Here's why:            (1) $6 billion of the estimate was labeled by the state as a ""possible"" cost, and the agency has since indicated that figure is high.            (2) The state estimate covers a 10-year period that does not start until 2014 and is based on an outdated version of health care legislation.            (3) Nearly half of the $24.3 billion cited by Dewhurst is money the state would have to spend anyway — regardless of health care reform — if people already eligible for Medicaid and CHIP signed up now. But it's an expense that would probably not come due without the new law. We rate Dewhurst's statement as Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/27/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-states-health-care-tab-24-billion-ye/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Tom Coburn']","
Health bill appears to exempt some congressional staff
","Since President Barack Obama signed the health care bill into law, we've seen many criticisms that some congressional staffers are exempt from buying health coverage through an insurance exchange. Here's the latest iteration from Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn: ""The American people will be appalled to learn the health care bill exempts leadership and committee staff,"" Coburn told a group of reporters on March 23, 2010. ""This special deal for unelected staff underscores everything the public detests about the arrogance of power in Washington.""Conservative bloggers have picked up on the issue as well.Ben Domenech of the New Ledger wrote on March 22, 2010, that a surprise ""is found on page 158 of the legislation, which appears to create a carve-out for senior staff members in the leadership offices and on congressional committees, essentially exempting those senior Democrat staffers who wrote the bill from being forced to purchase health care plans in the same way as other Americans.""The issue has even become the subject of a poll on Facebook that states, ""The staffers who wrote Obamacare slipped in a hidden gem: They exempted themselves, Obama, and his staff from the new regulations. Should this exemption be repealed?"" We should note here that the new requirements in the bill do not, and never have applied to the president, vice president and members of the administration, though there have been legislative efforts to change that. And the Associated Press reported on March 24 that Obama plans to get his health care through the exchange. Coburn's quote may make it sound like lawmakers and congressional staff are exempt from broader health care reform, but they are not. Instead, he's talking about a specific provision in the bill that would require lawmakers and their staff to buy health insurance through an exchange, a virtual marketplace where consumers can pick and choose among plans based on coverage and price. To our knowledge, members of Congress and their aides are the only people who are being forced to give up their employer's health care plan -- in this case, one administered by the federal government. To check Coburn's claim, we turned to page 158 of the health care bill Obama just signed -- the Senate version of the bill -- and here's what it says:""The only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are — (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act).""The provision goes on: ""The term 'Member of Congress' means any member of the House of Representatives or the Senate... The term 'congressional staff' means all full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or outside of Washington, DC.""The history of this provision deserves some attention. In the summer of 2009, when the lawmakers were in a heated debate over whether the health care bill should create the public option, a government-run health care plan, Coburn and his Republican colleague Charles Grassley argued that if Democrats were so keen on creating new health care programs, the president, administration officials, members of Congress and their staff should also be required to participate. Up until this point, members of Congress and their staff have been enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which offers employees a stipend to cover the cost of their health insurance. Now, staff will use that subsidy to buy a plan through the exchange.The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee adopted a Coburn amendment that would have required lawmakers and their staff to enroll in the public option, while the Finance Committee incorporated a proposal by Grassley that would have required lawmakers and their staff to participate in the health insurance exchange. Over the next couple of months, Senate leadership merged the two bills. The legislation that ended up on the floor included the above language. Coburn and Grassley contend that the Senate leadership made some subtle but important changes to the language in the process, rephrasing the definition of ""congressional staff"" from ""an employee whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of Representatives,"" which was in the Finance Committee bill, to ""full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or outside of Washington, DC"" -- the same exact definition included in the HELP committee bill as a result of Coburn's amendment.So, what's the big deal about semantics? Coburn and Grassley argue that the narrow definition of ""congressional staff"" as someone who works for a member of Congress excludes higher-paid committee aides and leadership aides. Grassley and Coburn tried in December to offer an amendment to the Senate bill that would have broadened the definition of a congressional staffer and include the president, vice president and political appointees in the executive branch in the requirement, but the duo say they were prevented from offering it. Coburn and Grassley tried again to expand the definition during the latest round of discussions over a package of ""fixes"" to the new health care law, but the amendment was defeated. We should note that Coburn and Grassley have implied that changes to the provision were the result of back-room dealings. While we know that the provision did morph over time, we don't know exactly why or under what circumstances. What we are checking is whether the language excludes committee and leadership staff as Coburn says.A report issued by the Congressional Research Service, on Dec. 2, 2009, at Grassley's request provides this insight: ""It appears possible to argue that the definition of 'congressional staff' used . . . excludes any staff not directly affiliated with a Member’s individual or personal office,"" the independent research office concluded. ""Should this interpretation be adopted by an implementing body or a court, it would appear that it would exclude professional committee staff, joint committee staff, some shared staff, as well as potentially those staff employed by leadership offices including, but not limited to, the Speaker of the House, Majority Leader of the Senate, Minority Leader of the House, Minority Leader of the Senate, as well as the Whip offices in both the House and Senate. Moreover, this interpretation would arguably exclude other congressional employees, for example, those employed by the Office of the House Clerk, House Parliamentarian, House Historian, Secretary of the Senate, Senate Legal Counsel, House and Senate Legislative Counsel offices.""In an e-mail, Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, pointed out that the final language reflects Coburn's original proposal from the summer of 2009. He went further with Roll Call and Politico, saying that the provision does not apply to committee staff, but that leadership staff may not be exempted. When the two bills were merged, they chose Coburn's language over Grassley's because leadership was worried that Grassley's proposal was too broad; it may have required legislative counsel and employees of the Architect of the Capitol to participate as well, Manley said.So, that brings us back to Coburn's claim that committee and leadership staff are excluded from new rules in the health care bill. He is correct that the bill does not clearly include committee and leadership staff, and a CRS report unequivocally backs this concern. However, we quibble with two things: First, Coburn is quite definitive in his conclusion that committee and leadership staff are exempted. But the CRS report provides more wiggle room; it states ""it appears possible"" that the language could be interpreted that way. It would have been more accurate to say that the language ""may exempt"" some staffers. Furthermore, it is true that Coburn's original amendment language was as restrictive as the provision that ended up in the final version of the bill. However, on two occasions, Coburn tried to fix the problem. All that said, we find Coburn's claim to be Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/26/tom-coburn/health-bill-appears-exempt-some-congressional-staf/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Kendrick Meek']","
Meek accuses Rubio of wanting government out of health care
","The day before the U.S. House of Representatives approved the health care reform bill, Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek, who is running for the U.S. Senate, fired off this accusation about the Republican frontrunner: ""Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all.""Meek made that statement on his campaign Web site March 20, 2010 -- the day before the historic vote. Here is the full quote: Rubio's ""ideas on health care could jeopardize Medicare and veterans' care, programs which cover more than 5 million Floridians. Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all. That means these programs could be shut down. Moreover, his obstruction of the current health care bill means we could lose our best chance ever to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions and to close the Medicare prescription drug coverage 'donut hole.' That's what he stands for. If he were in the Senate he would lead the charge to scrap health care reform. If elected, he has sworn to do everything he can to repeal it.""Meek has leveled a sweeping claim that Rubio thinks government should get out of the health care business entirely -- in a state where millions of voters depend on government health care such as Medicare and veterans programs. We know that Rubio is against the Democratic-led health care reform plan that the House approved March 21, but is it fair to say he wants government out of health care entirely?Meek's e-mail cites two sources: an article ""Scrap Obamacare Today"" written by Rubio on March 15, in Human Events, a conservative publication, and a blog item in The Buzz, a St. Petersburg Times politics blog. Both quote Rubio criticizing the health care proposal.""The President’s health care proposal is a deeply flawed plan that should be scrapped entirely in favor of a truly bipartisan approach that pursues step-by-step reforms,'' Rubio wrote in Human Events March 15. Meek's campaign also cited a March 3 press release from Rubio in which he spoke against ""government-run health care.""""Unfortunately, my opponent [Charlie Crist] disagrees and has said he would not scrap this bill and process. It underscores why, fundamentally, this campaign is about trust. It’s about who Floridians can trust to go to Washington to unapologetically stand on principle against ideas like the stimulus, cap-and-trade and government-run health care,"" Rubio said in the press release. The Meek campaign's logic is that Rubio's use of ""government-run health care"" in that paragraph has a broader meaning that indicates he's not just against the Obama reform plan, he's against all government health programs.Meek's campaign also cited Rubio's vote in the Florida House of Representatives April 6, 2006, against a Democratic amendment to an appropriations bill that reduced contract services by $5 million and included funding for a dental program for veterans. The Meek campaign also cited three Rubio votes on the Cover Florida state health care initiative requiring coverage for prenatal care and prostate screening and mammograms. All three amendments, introduced by Democrat Dan Gelber, ultimately failed and Rubio voted against them. Rubio voted in favor of the overall bill. But we find those citations are flimsy evidence for a big, sweeping claim that could alarm Florida voters, particularly senior citizens. In our view it's clear that ""government-run health care"" was referring to the Obama plan and it doesn't prove that Rubio is against programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.Rubio's campaign also provided us with some evidence that he does believe government has a role in health care:* Rubio wrote an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel Dec. 3, 2009, about the proposed health care bill that indicated he was concerned about cuts in Medicare: ""The bill also would expand a financially unsustainable Medicaid entitlement program that is already straining state budgets. And it would fundamentally hurt Medicare by taking away access to Medicare Advantage plans and installing a new government bureaucracy to oversee Medicare reimbursements.""* In 2000, Rubio was part of a unanimous vote in favor of hearing screening for newborns and a unanimous vote related to expanding Kidcare, a health program for poor children. In 2004, Rubio voted in favor of changes to Kidcare. He also voted for changes to the Kidcare program in 2004 fought by Democrats because of changes to eligibility requirements.Our own search turned up a few other examples that showed that Rubio has supported certain health care programs or proposals.In a Feb. 19 interview on Morning Joe, Rubio said Medicare ""needs to be reformed,"" but did not provide details.Rubio supported expanding Florida's controversial Medicaid reform, which was initiated by former Gov. Jeb Bush in an effort to allow private companies to compete to provide serves for the poor, with the hope that it would slow growth in costs.Rubio was quoted in a March 6, 2008, Miami Herald article about the rising costs of Medicaid and the need to save it: ""Florida simply cannot afford to continue doing business like we are currently. In order to save the Medicaid system, continuing reform is vital. Expanding Medicaid Reform into Miami-Dade County is an important step in creating a system that can survive and is a step that we should enact this session.""In addition, Rubio supported a budget in 2008 that included an estimated $15.7 billion for Medicaid from federal and state sources, according to Florida's Medicaid expenditure estimating conference. Here is a list that shows Medicaid expenditures over several sessions when Rubio was in the House. Someone who believed government ""shouldn't be in the health care business at all"" wouldn't be supporting Medicaid.Another piece of evidence: A budget list compiled by the governor's office shows Rubio supported money for Jackson Memorial Hospital, a public hospital. ""The budget list also links Rubio to a $20 million special line item for Jackson Memorial Hospital in 2008. Months later, Rubio established a consulting firm with a former aide and scored an $8,000 monthly consulting contract with the hospital,'' the Miami Herald wrote in a March 10 article.The Meek campaign has failed to prove its claim. Rubio clearly has spoken against the federal health care bill, which he has repeatedly referred to as a ""government takeover"" of health care (a characterization we've repeatedly rated Pants on Fire). But Rubio's votes and his comments indicate he has supported government health programs such as Medicaid. Lambasting a health care reform bill isn't the same as declaring that ""government shouldn't be in the health care business at all."" We rate Meek's claim False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/26/kendrick-meek/meek-accuses-rubio-wanting-government-out-health-c/

The line graph starts in 2002 and ends in 2005, and indicates that Rubio's income more than tripled, starting at about $100,000 and rising to more than $300,000.We know state legislators are paid modestly, so we were curious if Crist's made-for-TV graphic is charting reality.To find out, we turned to the Florida Commission on Ethics, which requires elected officials to file a financial disclosure form each year. The forms list a person's net worth, assets and liabilities, and income.Connie Evans, an executive secretary with the commission, provided PolitiFact Florida with Rubio's financial disclosure forms from 1998, when he was a member of the West Miami City Commission, until he left the Florida House as speaker in 2008.The financial disclosure forms include legible income information for every year except 2000. (We could not discern Rubio's handwriting for that year).A lawyer by trade, Rubio reported his income for each year: For some context: Rubio was part of the House Republican leadership beginning in 2001 as a whip, rose to be majority leader, and was speaker from 2006 to 2008.Rubio's income in the first few years included his salary of between $72,000 and $120,000 plus his West Miami City Commission pay ($1,380) and later his legislative salary (around $30,000 a year). But in 2004, Rubio's income increased dramatically, records show. That year he collected almost $270,000 by working for three separate law firms in South Florida -- Broad & Cassel, Becker & Poliakoff and the Haggard Law Firm.Starting in 2005, Rubio earned $300,000 a year working for Broad & Cassel, a well-connected statewide firm that had done millions of dollars of legal work for the Florida House.Between 2002 and 2005, Broad & Cassel had billed state taxpayers $4.5 million for legal work authorized by former Speaker Johnnie Byrd. Byrd and a managing partner of the firm, Steve Burton, were friends. But the expenses appeared so great that the then-incoming speaker, Alan Bense, ordered an audit of Broad & Cassel's work. The results of the audit were never publicized.In 2008, Rubio added $69,000 from Florida International University where he was hired as a visiting professor.In the television ad, Crist focuses on the years 2002 to 2005, which is a bit misleading because it brackets Rubio's big salary spike in 2004. If you included more years, the income increase is still dramatic, just not as much.Let's compare Crist's graphic (it's the one near the top of this item under the ruling) with two graphics we created ourselves. First, we charted the same thing Crist did, years 2002-2005. Here's what it actually looks like:  Then we decided to chart all of the years on file with the state. That chart looks like this:  Not huge differences, mind you, but differences. In his TV ad ""We Thought He Was Different,"" Crist said Rubio's income skyrocketed and showed a red-line graphic that illustrates the dramatic increase. While his ad chose years that had a particularly steep increase, a broader range of years show much the same thing. In his eight years in the House, Rubio's income more than quadrupled.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'John Boehner']","
Boehner says federal debt will equal GDP in two years
","Ever since Barack Obama became president and began advocating such big-dollar federal programs as an economic stimulus and health care reform, Republicans have gained increasing political traction with warnings to voters about the growing national debt.On March 24, 2010, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register that was timed to coincide with a March 25 visit by Obama to Iowa City, Iowa. Obama visited Iowa City to tout the health care bill two days after signing it into law.Boehner's column -- titled, ""Why Republicans will fight to repeal health care takeover"" -- was a broadside against the newly signed bill, featuring a wide range of statistics. In it, he asserted that the health care bill ""is a recipe for further fiscal disaster at a time when our national debt ($12.7 trillion today) is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy (about $15 trillion) in just two more years.""That struck us as a huge amount, so we decided to take a closer look.First, we'll offer a reminder that the debt is different from a deficit. A deficit refers to the amount by which expenses exceed revenues in a single year. The debt -- which is what Boehner was referring to -- refers to the cumulative total of past deficits, minus any intervening surpluses.To sort out whether Boehner's numbers are right, we turned to the extensive historical tables in the president's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal.According to these figures, which come from the Office of Management and Budget, the gross federal debt by the end of fiscal year 2010 is projected to be almost $13.8 trillion. That's actually a bit more than Boehner had suggested.Two years later -- by the end of fiscal year 2012 -- the debt is projected to rise to $16.3 trillion, also higher than Boehner had indicated.But Boehner is correct that, measured by the share of gross domestic product, gross federal debt will reach a significant milestone in two years. By 2012, gross federal debt is projected to be 100.8 percent of gross domestic product, up from 99.0 percent for fiscal year 2011.These numbers, we'll add, have been growing for decades, roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency. Under Ronald Reagan, debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 33.4 percent to 51.9 percent, and under George H.W. Bush, it grew from 51.9 percent to 64.1 percent. It declined under Bill Clinton, from 64.1 percent to 57.3 percent, before rising from 57.3 percent to 69.2 percent under George W. Bush. It's expected to soar during Obama's first four years from 69.2 percent to 100.8 percent.It's worth noting that there is an alternative measure of debt known as ""public debt,"" which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself. Measured this way, the debt-to-GDP comparisons are much smaller. By the end of 2010, public debt is projected to be 60.3 percent of GDP, and by the end of 2012, it's projected to be 66.6 percent.Some economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt, but one measure ""isn’t more 'right' than the other – they are just looking at different things,"" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group. ""Boehner may be cherry-picking, but I don’t think he’s misrepresenting in any way.""It's also worth noting that these numbers are only estimates. They could change over the course of the next two years, depending on economic conditions and policy choices. Still, we consider Boehner's statistics valid. While he underestimates the size of the projected debt in 2010 and 2012, his assertion that ""our national debt ... is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy ... in just two more years"" is on target, according to the president's own Office of Management and Budget. So we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/26/john-boehner/boehner-says-federal-debt-will-equal-gdp-two-years/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Joe Scarborough']","
Bush I, Clinton and Reagan all pushed taxes higher than the bump from Obama's health care bill
","On his Morning Joe program on MSNBC on March 24, 2010, host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, sparred with Sen. Dick Durbin over the tax effects of the health care reform bill.

In the course of less than a minute, the bill was alternately described as ""the largest tax increase in U.S. history"" (Scarborough) and ""the biggest tax cut in history"" (Durbin).

This seemed like a good place to step in and referee.

First, here's the full context of the exchange between Scarborough and Durbin.

""If this fall's election is going to be a referendum on this health care bill,"" Scarborough said to Durbin. ""What should Democrats do when their opponents say, correctly, this is the largest tax increase in U.S. history? And it was passed at a time when we've got 17 percent real unemployment. And also, it's a further expansion of the federal government at a time when that worries a lot of Americans.""

""Joe, I keep hearing you every morning talking about the biggest tax increase in history, but you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history,"" Durbin responded. ""We have almost $500 billion in tax cuts. And the tax cuts go to small businesses to help pay for health insurance premiums. They're going to go to individuals who can't afford their health insurance premiums. It's really going to make certain everybody has a chance for affordable health insurance.""

We'll deal specifically with Durbin's claim in a separate item. Here, we'll tackle Scarborough's claim the health bill is ""the largest tax increase in U.S. history.""

On the tax increase side, here are the biggies, along with what the government's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates they will bring in over the next 10 years:

• Starting in 2013, an increase in the Medicare payroll tax by 0.9 percent on incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans,"" over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, new annual fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2014, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. The 10-year total: $20 billion. • Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. • Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. 
In all, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates various revenue-generating provisions in the health bill will bring $437 billion over the next 10 years.

When it comes to tax cuts in the health bill, that's a matter of some debate. The plan includes government money to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower income people who don't get insurance through their employer. Those subsidies, which are estimated to amount to $464 billion over 10 years, are paid directly to the insurance companies. They come via tax credits, but many Republicans and tax experts argue those shouldn't count as tax cuts. We'll get into that in more detail in the fact-check on Durbin's claim. There's also a no-doubt-about-it tax cut for some very small businesses that kicks in immediately, and allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees. That's expected to cost the government $40 billion over 10 years.

""There are big chunks of money coming in and big chunks of money going out,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute.

So let's talk net.

The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the changes in direct spending and revenue effects of the health care reform bill (as well as the reconciliation bill, which has yet to pass) and concluded the total net effect is that the bill would bring in an additional $525 billion in total revenues over the next 10 years.

Does that translate to the biggest tax increase ever?

Let's first agree to some ground rules. For starters, it doesn't make sense to compare, say, 2019 dollars to 1985 dollars. You have to adjust for inflation, or express the amount as a total of Gross Domestic Product at the time. The Republican calculation also uses the 10-year total effect of the net revenue gain, while in decades past, the Joint Committee on Taxation used to analyze tax provisions only in a 5-year window.

Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, thinks it makes the most sense to look at the last year of the 10-year CBO projections for the health care reform bill. By then, the plan is fully phased in, including the full effect of all the tax cuts and tax hikes. In that year, the total revenue increase is estimated to be $104 billion. That comes to a little less than 1/2 percent of the projected GDP that year.

Horney notes that that's slightly smaller than the tax effect in the fifth years of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (a tax increase signed by President George H.W. Bush) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (a tax increase signed by President Bill Clinton), as a percentage of the GDP at the time. And it's less than half of the tax increase (again as a percentage of GDP) from the Tax Equity And Fiscal Responsibility Act signed by President Ronald Reagan.

""CBO says the net effect on revenues is that it is an increase,"" Horney said. ""It's not insignificant. But it is far from being the largest tax increase in recent history.""

William Ahern with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group, said total new revenues of $525 billion over 10 years isn't close to the size of the Clinton tax hike in 1993 or the Reagan tax hike in 1982. However, he said, a rigorous comparison can't be made because in 1982 and 1993, the Joint Committee on Taxation only did five-year estimates.

Blumberg, of the Urban Institute, said both Republicans and Democrats would be wise to get away from the ""biggest"" jargon.

Again, here we're are looking at Scarborough's side of the hyperbole wars. There's ample evidence that the health care bills result in a net tax increase. But when Scarborough characterized it as ""the largest tax increase in U.S. history,"" that doesn't hold up when you level the playing field and compare several tax increases in recent decades to the GDP at the time. And so we rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/25/joe-scarborough/bush-i-clinton-and-reagan-all-pushed-taxes-higher-/

Durbin's tax reduction claim doesn't cut it
","Here, we examine a claim that nearly launched Rep. Mike Pence off the back of a treadmill. It came during a back-and-forth on the Morning Joe program on MSNBC on March 24, 2010, between host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., over the tax effects of the health care reform bill. Let's listen in: ""If this fall's election is going to be a referendum on this health care bill,"" Scarborough said, ""What should Democrats do when their opponents say, correctly, this is the largest tax increase in U.S. history? And it was passed at a time when we've got 17 percent real unemployment. And also, it's a further expansion of the federal government at a time when that worries a lot of Americans.""

And the tax cuts go to small businesses to help pay for health insurance premiums. They're going to go to individuals who can't afford their health insurance premiums. It's really going to make certain everybody has a chance for affordable health insurance."" Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, later told Scarborough he was watching the exchange live while working out on a treadmill and that when Durbin said the health care bill is also the biggest tax cut in history, ""I almost tripped and flew off the back of the thing."" We took a two-pronged approach to this exchange, and in a separate item, we examined Scarborough's claim that the bill is ""the largest tax increase in U.S. history."" In this one, we'll tackle Durbin's claim that the bill is ""also the biggest tax cut in history."" Is it really treadmill-launching wrong? During the interview, an incredulous Scarborough asked Durbin his source for that claim. ""Well, the source is the bill,"" Durbin said. ""And I've read it."" The bill may explain provisions, but Durbin gets his numbers that the bill includes $500 billion in tax cuts from a report by the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bulk of that, $464 billion over 10 years, comes from tax credits to subsidize the cost insurance for lower-income people not insured through their employer. In addition, the March 20, 2010, report from the CBO estimates that small companies will get $40 billion worth of tax relief over the next 10 years to help offset the cost of providing health insurance for their employees. Specifically, from 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the insurance exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost. Those small business tax credits are no-doubt-about-it tax cuts. But many Republicans and tax experts contend the subsidies provided to lower-income Americans to help pay for health insurance, even though they come through tax credits, hardly qualify as tax cuts. Here's why: Americans who make a decent living but qualify for some government help on health insurance premiums may have such a large tax burden that the tax credits really are a reduction in taxes, said William Ahern with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. But for many -- if not most -- of those getting the tax credits, the subsidies are more than the person would otherwise owe in income taxes. For those people, he said, the tax credits are ""just a check from the government,"" Ahern said. ""There has been a running debate over whether such checks should be called tax cuts,"" Ahern said. Ahern is of the school that thinks when the government is writing checks, that shouldn't be called a tax cut. A news release from the Republicans in Congress also correctly notes that the provision is a direct payment to insurance companies, not to the taxpayer. ""It would not reduce any individual's tax liability,"" the release states, ""and is therefore not a tax cut."" ""You can quibble over what to call it,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, but when you have subsidies tied to tax credits, as they are, they need to be reconciled with one's taxable income, and so a credible case can be made that they are tax cuts. We're not going to weigh into this philosophical debate on taxes, because there are other more clear-cut reasons why Durbin's claim is misleading. For one, it fails to mention that even if you regard the insurance subsidies for people in the exchange as tax cuts, there are also significant tax increases. Here are the biggies, along with what the government's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates they will bring in over the next 10 years: • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans,"" over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, new annual fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. •  Starting in 2014, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. The 10-year total: $20 billion. Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. In all, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates various revenue-generating provisions in the health bill will bring $437 billion over the next 10 years. ""There are big chunks of money coming in and big chunks of money going out,"" Blumberg said. ""We need to get away from the extremes in this conversation. There are big revenues being raised and big spending."" So let's talk net. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the changes in direct spending and revenue effects of the health care reform bill (as well as the reconciliation bill, which has yet to pass) and concluded the total net effect is that the bill would bring in an additional $525 billion in total revenues over the next 10 years. In recent weeks, President Barack Obama has repeatedly used a variation of Durbin's claim. For example, in remarks on health care reform in Iowa on March 25, 2010, Obama said, ""And when this exchange is up and running, millions of people will get tax breaks to help them afford coverage – credits that add up to the largest middle class tax cut for health care in history."" There are a couple qualifiers in there that Durbin failed to mention. For one, Obama referred to middle class tax cut. That conveniently ignores the significant tax increases that predominantly will hit higher income people, the Medicare payroll tax and those with ""Cadillac health plans."" Obama also limits his claim to tax cuts for health care. It in no way is the largest tax cut of any kind. The Bush tax cuts alone dwarf these cuts. ""It's wrong in both directions,"" Ahern said of claims that the health care bill is either the largest tax cut or tax increase in history. ""It's obviously not the largest tax cut."" To sum up, when Durbin said the bill is ""also the biggest tax cut in history,"" it's based first on the contentious assumption that tax credits to help lower income people buy insurance on the exchange can be called tax cuts. But more than that, if you look at the net effect, the bill is a tax increase. In general, higher income people will pay more, lower income people will get more. In any case, even if you only looked at that side of the ledger, the side with $500 billion of tax credits over 10 years, that wouldn't be the largest tax cut in history. Durbin would have been closer to the truth had he stuck to the president's script -- largest middle class tax cut for health care -- but we think even that is misleading because it ignores that the bill is an overall tax-raiser. But as Durbin even left those qualifiers out of his statement, that makes our call easy: It's False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/25/richard-durbin/durbins-tax-reduction-claim-doesnt-cut-it/

Crist claims Cover Florida benefits 'thousands'
","Gov. Charlie Crist has repeatedly boasted about Cover Florida, a health insurance program for Floridians who lack coverage. A few days after the U.S. House approved the health care plan, Crist ran a radio ad criticizing that plan as ""Washington liberals forcing government takeover of health care"" and touting Florida's own program.""But in Florida,"" the narrator says, ""one leader already enacted common sense conservative solutions: Charlie Crist. As governor, Crist passed Cover Florida. Now Floridians can take charge of their own health care through market-based strategies. Thousands already enrolled and climbing."" Health coverage is a major issue in Florida because about 20 percent of Floridians lack insurance -- about 3.6 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Before we analyze Crist's claim about the Cover Florida enrollment figures, it's helpful to know some basics about the program.Crist signed Cover Florida into law in May 2008, but enrollment did not begin until January 2009, according to the Agency for Health Care Administration. Floridians who have lacked health insurance for at least six months or are recently unemployed are eligible. The program offers coverage from six different health insurance companies with either catasrophic coverage that includes hospital stays or a more pared-down plan without hospitalization benefits.The Cover Florida Web site boasts that insurance can be purchased for as little as $23.70 a month, but monthly rates vary depending on level of coverage and other factors such as age and gender. For example in Broward County, the average monthly rate ranges from $50.75 with no emergency or hospital services, to $327.27 for more coverage. ""This legislation makes affordable health coverage available to 3.8 million uninsured Floridians through a comprehensive market-based strategy,"" according to the Cover Florida Web site.Now, a look at the enrollment figures.Crist's claim -- ""thousands already enrolled and climbing"" -- suggests it is a large initiative with significant growth. But for a state with about 3.6 million uninsured, the enrollment numbers are tiny and the growth is modest.They went from 952 in January/February of 2009 to 5,426 in December 2009, the most recent numbers available. The program added roughly 750 people per month in the first few months, but the growth slowed to only 180 from November to December. So the numbers have gone up, but they remain a tiny percentage of of the uninsured -- about 0.1 percent of all the uninsured Floridians. ""It's such a miniscule number and it's just definitely not the answer to getting millions of Floridians insured,'' said Democratic state Sen. Nan Rich of Weston, vice chair of the health and human services appropriations committee. ""It's clear people do not see it as the answer for providing access. I don't want to totally disregard it, some people are in it.""Technically, Crist is correct: ""thousands"" have already enrolled -- but barely more than 5 . . . thousands. And he is also technically correct to say enrollment is ""climbing"" because the number of participants has grown every month. Yet we think listeners of Crist's radio ad will get the impression that their governor has introduced a large program that is growing rapidly and making significant progress in covering Florida's 3.6 million uninsured. But it's a tiny effort that is growing a small amount. We find his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/25/charlie-crist/crist-claims-cover-florida-benefits-thousands/

That means Farrington's piece could be edited differently and have a variety of headlines in different publications.The original story was labeled as an analysis, and it appears most newspapers considered the piece as such.

In the AP story, Farrington makes a case that the accusations require asterisks or are overstatements.Farrington writes: ""Crist, who calls himself a 'happy warrior,' still smiles, but he is proving he will throw anything and everything at Rubio to try to win what is becoming one of the closest watched races in the country. Many of Crist's attacks are exaggerated, take words out of context, aren't true or over the top. Rubio has also exaggerated or taken out of context some of Crist's statements or actions, but not to the same extent."" The paragraph, the second in the story, includes each of the phrases Rubio cites in his television ad -- ""out of context,"" ""over the top,"" and ""not true"" (the actual wording in the article was ""aren't true"").

Castor says she was only (Florida) Democrat to vote against the Wall Street bailout.
","With a new report calling her Florida's most liberal member of the U.S. House, Rep. Kathy Castor said the label doesn't fit because she broke with her party on a key issue: the bailout for financial firms. Castor, who represents portions of Hillsborough, Pinellas and Manatee counties, was quoted in the Tampa Tribune last month saying she was ""the only Democrat to vote against the Wall Street bailout."" Castor spokeswoman Ellen Gedalius told PolitiFact Florida that the partial quote omitted some important context. She said that the congresswoman was saying she was the only Democrat in Florida to vote against the Troubled Assets Relief Program, an emergency federal plan in the fall of 2008 intended to keep the financial system from collapsing. ""The context was a discussion on the Florida delegation,"" said Gedalius, ""so her comment about being the only Democrat to vote against TARP was in that context of being the only Florida Democrat to vote against it.""Tampa Tribune reporter William ""Windy"" March, who wrote the story, said he did not want to characterize the quote or its context.""She didn’t explicitly say and I didn’t explicitly ask,'' he told Politifact Florida.Still, Gedalius' explanation matches our reading of the Tribune story. It is headlined ""Rep. Castor disputes liberal ranking,"" and is primarily about her political leanings relative to other members of the Florida delegation to the U.S. House. The article attributed the ranking to the National Journal, an influential Washington-based publication that covers politics and national affairs.The TARP was proposed by President George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who sought congressional approval for $700 billion to buy bad assets from the nation's banks. The first vote took place on Sept. 29, 2008, when the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bill in a stunning 205-228 vote. Ninety-five of the no votes came from Democrats, including Castor, who indeed was the only Florida Democrat to vote against it. The second vote came just days later when on Oct. 3 the House reversed itself, 263-171, in favor of another version of the same bill that had been approved by the Senate. Again, Castor was the lone Florida Democrat in the House to vote against the measure. This is what she said at the time: ""After thoughtful consideration and review, I voted against President Bush's $700 billion bailout. The Bush plan does not provide sufficient help to middle-class families in the housing squeeze or taxpayer protections.” So Castor is right, with the caveat that she was referring to Florida Democrats. And so we rate her claim True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/25/kathy-castor/castor-says-she-was-only-democrat-tarp/

Texas GOP says 57 percent of Texas House Democrats tumbled in March primaries
","Democrats gained 12 seats in the Texas House in elections and thanks to one party switch from 2004 through 2008, though a seat went the other way in 2009 when an East Texas member switched parties. Now the Republican Party of Texas sees Democratic weakening in the results of this year's March primaries. That’s of interest because Republicans seek to widen their 77-73 House edge on Democrats in November's general election while Democrats hope they can win the three additional seats they need to gain the majority. In a Twitter post on the morning of March 10, the GOP states: ""War for the soul of the TxDems: 57% of Dem incumbents for Tx House LOST their primary."" Hold the horses: Did nearly six in 10 House Democrats lose re-election all of a hurry — and if so, where was that story told? GOP spokesman Bryan Preston told us the 57 percent figure, which the party repeated in a second Twitter post that day, reflects the fact that four of seven House Democrats who had opponents lost their primaries. The losers were Reps. Terri Hodge of Dallas, Al Edwards of Houston, Dora Olivo of Rosenberg and Tara Rios Ybarra of South Padre Island. But that's an incomplete way of analyzing the results. It overlooks 64 Democratic incumbents who didn't have opponents and were renominated and Rep. Norma Chavez of El Paso, who faces an April runoff. The 64 unopposed incumbents are set to stand for re-election in November. One Democratic incumbent, David Farabee of Wichita Falls, didn’t seek re-election.Punch line: Some 67 of 72 Democratic incumbents on the March 2 ballot qualified for the November ballot. Take them into account and the share of incumbents who lost their primary drops to nearly 7 percent.Preston reminded us, correctly, that in order to lose a primary ""one must face a primary challenge, and of those state House Democrat incumbents who were challenged in the primary, 57 percent lost."" If the party had included the word ""opposed"" in front of ""incumbents,"" there'd be no confusion. It could have done so within the 140-character limit set by Twitter.Preston said: ""If I had it to do over again, I would certainly throw 'opposed' in there."" The GOP's item misrepresents the overall results for Democratic House incumbents. We rate the party's statement as Barely True. ",/factchecks/2010/mar/25/republican-party-texas/texas-gop-says-57-percent-texas-house-democrats-tu/

State Sen. Don Gaetz puts the tab for class size at $16 billion -- so far
","A school superintendent turned state Senator wants to relax a requirement that the state continue shrinking K-12 class sizes.State Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, says that while a 2002 constitutional amendment mandating smaller classes has produced positive results, the expensive cost in a weak economy don't justify a continued investment.Gaetz, the former superintendent in Okaloosa County, thinks voters might get sticker shock if they heard how much taxpayers already have spent implementing the state's class amendment.""The cost of class size so far: $16 billion,"" Gaetz said on the Senate floor March 23, 2010.That's an awful lot of money -- about a quarter of the total annual state budget. Put another way, with $16 billion the state could build new baseball stadiums in St. Petersburg and Miami ($1 billion), fund NASA's mission to put people back on the moon for two years ($2.5 billion) and give every Floridian $500 ($8.8 billion). With what's left over -- $3.7 billion -- the state could fund every Congressional campaign in 2010. Has the cost been that large?First, some background about the class-size amendment.In November 2002, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment that sets limits for how many students are allowed per class starting in the 2010-11 school year. The limits are no more than 18 students for grades K-3, no more than 22 students for grades 4-8 and no more than 25 students for grades 9-12.In 2003, the state started to slowly implement the changes. First, classroom reductions were measured at the school district average, then at the school average. This fall, districts are scheduled to meet the new limits in every classroom.But Gaetz wants to freeze the class-size reduction program. His proposed amendment to the constitution would require schools to meet class-size averages, instead of the exact numbers in every room. The proposal must be approved by three-fifths of the Legislature and 60 percent of voters in November if it is to become law.As for the costs, Gaetz is nearly right on.The House PreK-12 Appropriations Committee received a class size update from the state Department of Education in January. The report on class size, which you can see here (starts on page 36), includes a breakdown of the operating and capital costs to implement the class size amendment.The total cost listed in the report actually is slightly more than $19 billion, but that includes the money requested for the 2010-2011 school year.Counting only the money that's already been allocated, the cost so far is $15.8 billion, according to the same report. A Senate staff analysis of Gaetz's bill includes the same $15.8 billion figure.Gaetz said on the Senate floor that the cost so far implementing mandatory class size reductions has been $16 billion. The Florida Department of Education puts the bill at $15.8 billion to date, and could spend another $3.2 billion next year.

Crist accuses Rubio of supporting money for his football field
","In their battle for the Republican nomination U.S. Senate, Gov. Charlie Crist and former House Speaker Marco Rubio are accusing each other of supporting wasteful spending. Rubio cites Crist's support of the economic stimulus, while Crist says Rubio supported political pork.On Crist's campaign Web site, under the heading ""Despite Promises, Speaker Rubio's Shocking Lack of Fiscal Conservatism,"" Crist's campaign accuses Rubio of ""earmarks."" One example: ""Rubio Supported $800,000 for AstroTurf for a field where he played flag football.""Rubio, described in several news articles as an avid flag football fan, played with the South Florida Sports League -- the same group that requested state money in 2007 while Rubio was House speaker. Crist's claim raises questions about what role Rubio had in the legislative funding that was vetoed by Crist. Ultimately, the project was never built.We'll focus on two questions: Did Rubio support the project? And would it have provided $800,000 for AstroTurf where Rubio played flag football?First, some details about the project. The money was supposed to go to a joint project between a sports league and the city of South Miami for a plan to build several multi-use fields and buildings for programs to help at-risk youth. The total cost of the project was $1,050,000 and the proposal asked for $800,000 in state funds. The sponsors were State Rep. Mitch Needelman, R-Melbourne, and State Sen. Alex Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami.The line-item, No. 1239, made it into the house's budget bill and the conference bill. It doesn't mention the fields or turf explicity. It just lists the $800,000 for the South Florida Sports League under the heading ""LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES TO REDUCE AND PREVENT JUVENILE CRIME FROM GENERAL REVENUE FUND."" Rubio, along with the majority of legislators, voted ""yes"" on both on the House bill and the final version. And we should note that Rubio was not a rank-and-file legislator: he had power over the budget as the House Speaker. We turned to Steve Geller, a retired Senate Democratic leader, to summarize that power since he has no stake in the fight between Rubio and Crist. ""Obviously I have no knowledge of what Marco individually did here,'' Geller said. ""What I can tell you is that the House Speaker has absolute power to direct the appropriations staff, subcommittee chairs or appropriations chair to put in the appropriation or take it out. ... If the speaker said 'put it in', it's in, if he said 'take it out,' it's out. ... One of perks of being speaker or president is you get to put money places."" Still, as far as we could find, there had been no reference to artificial fields in news articles when the budget was approved. The first mention didn't come until two weeks after the final vote, when the Miami Herald published an article about earmarks in the budget. ""You like football?,'' the article stated. ""You'll be happy to know that in the new $72 billion state budget, there's $800,000 to pay for new synthetic football fields in Miami."" A list of ""Member Issues by Appropriation and Project"" created by Gov. Crist's office mentions that, ""these funds would provide the astro-turf for the fields."" But that update, too, was dated after the votes -- May 17, 2007. Alberto Martinez, a spokesman for Rubio's campaign, said the project wasn't billed as turf for football fields when legislators voted on it.""Members, including Rubio who voted for this appropriation as contained in the budget, were voting not for ""800,000 for astroturf,"" but rather for a new facility for ""at-risk youths and young adults in a tri-county area...offering services and programs to participants ranging from sports and recreational activities to education about healthy, drug-free, and alcohol-free living,"" Martinez said. Although the project became linked to Rubio in news accounts and editorials, we couldn't find any evidence he was a driving force behind the earmark. Needelman, who was chairman of the juvenile justice committee at the time, told PolitiFact Florida that it was his idea to put the money in the budget. ""Marco has never talked to me one on one on this at all,'' said Needelman, who is supporting Rubio for Senate. Guillermo Chacon, executive director of the sports league, said he never spoke with his friend Rubio about this proposal. ""Our business dealings were always with Needelman (and) Diaz de la Portilla,'' Chacon said. ""We never had a contact with Mr. Rubio."" So, to recap: Rubio voted for the state budget bill, both the original and the conference version that was reconciled with the Senate. So in that regard, he supported the project, although we couldn't find evidence that it was referred to as ""turf"" at the time of the April 11 and May 3 votes. As for whether it would have provided $800,000 for AstroTurf on a field where Rubio played flag football, we'll take the last part first. Rubio's campaign confirmed that he played flag football in the South Florida Sports League. But a campaign spokesman told us that the appropriation was not specific enough to confirm Crist's statement because the league used several fields at different locations. Still, we're satisfied Crist is right on this point. We asked Chacon if Rubio had played at this specific site in South Miami where the project was slated and he said Rubio had.Now, to the question of turf. Crist claims the money would be used for ""AstroTurf,"" a brand name so well-known that it's often used as a synonym for artificial turf. And that term was used by the governor's office in the 2007 ""Member Issues by Appropriation and Project.""News accounts and editorials used different words to describe the field material. The Orlando Sentinel used the more generic term: ""Rubio lost several Miami-Dade County projects he had tucked into the budget, including $800,000 for new artificial-turf football fields for the South Florida Sports League."" Chacon did suggest some sort of artificial material in a Miami Herald article May 20, 2007: ''Hopefully we will get a very nice park where the kids can play year-around,'' said Willie Chacon, executive director of the league, who said the group is going to install synthetic fields because ""there's no natural grass facility that could sustain so much sports programming.''Finally, let's examine Crist's claim. He said Rubio ""supported $800,000 for Astroturf for a field where he played flag football."" There's no proof that Rubio was the prime sponsor, but he voted for the bill, which in our view is ""support."" And yes, it was $800,000. But it was one of hundreds of items in a giant $71.9 billion budget bill and the bill didn't specify it was for artificial turf. It wasn't until later news accounts that the turf came to light. It's conceivable that Rubio knew it was for turf -- indeed, using Geller's account of the Speaker's power, you might think he did. But there's no proof. So we find the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/24/charlie-crist/crist-accuses-rubio-supporting-money-his-football-/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Orrin Hatch']","
Hatch says that families earning more than $80,000 could get health care subsidies
","In the many months of debate over health care reform, we don't recall hearing much about how low your income will have to be to qualify for federal health insurance subsidies. But on March 21, 2010, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah -- who, like all congressional Republicans, voted against the Senate version of the Democratic health care bill -- tackled the issue directly.""Do you realize they're going to subsidize families that make over -- families of four that make over $80,000 a year?"" Hatch said in an interview on CNN's State of the Union.That struck us as high, so we decided to see if Hatch was right.First, a word about how the subsidies work in the bill, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The subsidies will take effect in 2014 and are available to Americans who buy insurance on exchanges, which will be virtual marketplaces for health plans. The exchanges are designed to serve people who do not already have insurance through their employer and who are not covered by a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The bill offers two kinds of subsidies to people who buy through the exchange -- one for insurance premiums and one for out-of-pocket medical costs.Under the premium subsidy, the government will pay the difference between the premiums for a designated plan and a set percentage of your income. As for the cost-sharing subsidy, the mechanism is still evolving, but the idea is to reduce the amount that beneficiaries have to shell out for co-pays and other medical expenses.The subsidies will operate on a sliding scale, benefiting those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. At the upper end of the range of those who qualify for premium subsidies -- those earning 300 percent to 400 percent of poverty level -- the government will pay whatever amount of the premium that exceeds 9.5 percent of the beneficiary's income. (Those earning less than 133 percent of the poverty level qualify for Medicaid.)Officially, the federal poverty limit for a family of four is $22,050, and 400 percent of that amount would be $88,200. We checked with several health care experts and they confirmed that that would indeed be the top income at which someone could receive subsidies.That means that many people earning the subsidies will actually earn more than the median income for married couple familes -- $73,010. On the other hand, how big $88,200 is depends on where you live. In four states, $88,200 is actually below the median income for a family of four -- in New Jersey ($94,441), Maryland ($94,017), Connecticut ($93,821) and Massachusetts ($89,347). In each of these states, the cost of living is quite a bit higher than the national average, and in many cases these states have health insurance mandates that boost premiums above the national average. By contrast, $88,200 is well above the median income in Arkansas ($52,185), Mississippi ($52,992) and Hatch's state of Utah ($63,586). The bill does not include any mechanism to even out such geographic variations.Another point: Families making $88,200, wherever they are, will have to spend significantly before they see any federal subsidy kick in. The maximum someone would have to pay for health insurance premiums before subsidies kick in is $8,379 (or 9.5 percent times $88,200). For most people, that's a hefty premium. On average, a worker's share of health care premiums at smaller companies (three to 199 employees) that use an HMO for full-family coverage amounted to $5,039 in 2009, according to the annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.Still, premiums north of $8,000 are conceivable. Costs would be higher for those seeking insurance on the individual market (if coverage can be found), and the price would likely be higher in more expensive states. In the meantime, premiums could be especially steep for older Americans who are not yet 65 -- the age they can enroll in Medicare.""Those aged 64 can be charged up to three times as much as an 18-year-old for the same coverage,"" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ""So families that include older adults could face very high premiums relative to their incomes, even at 400 percent of the poverty level, making it unaffordable for such families to purchase coverage without a subsidy.""All of this helps explain the rationale for why a family earning $88,200 might need federal assistance. But it doesn't undermine the validity of Hatch's point. Starting in 2014, the health care bill will indeed ""subsidize ... families of four that make over $80,000 a year."" So we rate Hatch's statement True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/24/orrin-hatch/hatch-says-families-earning-more-80000-could-get-h/

White says the State Board of Education, led by a Perry appointee, voted to remove Thomas Jefferson from social studies textbook standards
","
The State Board of Education has provoked a national outcry for its effort to revise curriculum standards in Texas. Lately joining the chorus: Bill White, the former Houston mayor and 2010 Democratic nominee for governor. 
In a March 17 e-mail, White blames GOP Gov. Rick Perry for lackluster leadership at the expense of students' education. 
""Last week the Texas State Board of Education (SBOE), led by Rick Perry's appointee, voted to remove Thomas Jefferson from social studies textbook standards. That's right. Thomas Jefferson — Founding Father, author of the Declaration of Independence, and a world-renowned scholar who advocated democratic, limited government — was deleted from a list of historical figures who inspired political change,"" White's e-email states. 
Did White get that right? 
In July 2009, the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills review committee, consisting of seven social studies teachers from different school districts across Texas, recommended revising a high school world history studies course description to include various ideas from the Enlightenment era, an 18th-century period of philosophic thought whose tenets included reason, skepticism and revolution, according to scholars. 
The amendment read: ""Government. The student understands how contemporary political systems have developed from earlier systems of government. The student is expected to ... explain the impact of Enlightenment ideas from John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Voltaire, Charles de Montesquieu, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Thomas Jefferson on political revolutions from 1750 to the present ..."" (The review committee noted in its original draft that its suggested list was not meant to be exhaustive.) 
Board member Cynthia Dunbar, a lawyer and assistant law professor from Richmond, made a motion at the board's March 11 meeting to change the proposed standard, substituting ""writings"" for ""Enlightenment ideas"" and removing Jefferson from the suggested list. In Jefferson's place, she added Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin and Sir William Blackstone — respectively, a Roman Catholic priest and saint; a Protestant theologian; and an English jurist who wrote that the doctrines of common law are based on God's word. 
Dunbar, defending the amendment, said: ""It does take out (the) reference to Thomas Jefferson. But the reason is not that I don't think his ideas were important. It's just that this is a list of political philosophers from which the Founding Fathers based their ideologies and their principles."" 
Dunbar's amendment won preliminary board approval by 8 to 6. 
But that doesn't mean Jefferson has been stricken from Texas classrooms. 
""The only individual mentioned more times in the curriculum standards than Thomas Jefferson is George Washington,"" board chairwoman Gail Lowe says in a March 19 press release. 
In fact, members left intact these elements: In a fifth-grade U.S. history course, students are expected to ""identify the Founding Fathers and patriot heroes,"" including Jefferson. In an eighth-grade U.S. history course, students are required to ""explain the roles played by significant individuals during the American Revolution,"" including Jefferson. And in a high school government course, students must ""identify the contributions of the political philosophies of the Founding Fathers,"" and ""identify individuals in the field of government and politics,"" both including Jefferson. 
So Jefferson stays in U.S. history and government classes unless the board later decides otherwise when it finalizes the standards in May. 
How does White's statement stand up overall? 
First, the board was updating the state's curriculum standards, not textbook standards. Then again, the curriculum standards will serve as a framework when the board meets to revise textbooks in 2011. 
Next, he overstates Perry's role in determining the board of education's membership. Lowe, the chairwoman, is an elected official, not a Perry appointee. But the governor named her chairwoman of the board. 
Finally, White said the state board voted ""to remove Thomas Jefferson from social studies textbook standards,"" but the vote was on a single amendment to a single high school world history standard. White also implied that those standards were already in effect. They weren't. 
We can see how White might've been confused. Media coverage of the board's action hasn't always been precise. 
White's final sentence — that Jefferson was deleted from a list of historical figures who inspired political change — is a more accurate way to put it. 
We rate White's multi-part statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/24/bill-white/white-says-state-board-education-led-perry-appoint/
