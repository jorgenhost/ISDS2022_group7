No evidence that a dumpster dive found 2020 cast ballots shredded in Arizona
","Did someone’s dumpster dive outside the Maricopa County Elections Department in Phoenix, Ariz., turn up evidence of shredded ballots cast in the 2020 presidential election? That’s what an article and photos published by The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, contend. The March 6 article, widely shared on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  ""Piles of shredded ballots were located today in a dumpster in Maricopa County, Arizona,"" reads the first paragraph of the story. ""This find occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start."" We found the evidence didn’t hold up to scrutiny. The article includes a photo of an unidentified man standing inside a dumpster wearing jeans and a blue polo shirt. In another, the man poses next to a table top and kitchen counter covered with shredded paper that appears to have been spilled from a yellow plastic bag. A third photo shows a close-up of strips of paper that appear to say Maricopa County Elections Department in Spanish. Those photos, as well as dozens more, were posted on Facebook by someone named Staci Burk. Her post, which appeared the same day as the Gateway Pundit article, indicates she was with the man in the photo, reads: ""Ballots shredded and in dumpsters behind the Maricopa County Ballot tabulation center. Physical evidence collected. Went to three different dumps after that tracking down the other bags. Wrapped up physical evidence collection with a Purple Heart Vet willing to dumpster dive for his Country. This is 510 S. 3rd Ave, Phoenix, AZ."" Burk filed a lawsuit alleging widespread fraud in Arizona in the November 2020 election. It was dismissed. A judge found the suit ""sorely wanting of relevant or reliable evidence"" and that Burk didn’t have legal standing to sue because she wasn’t a registered voter. Maricopa County Elections Department spokeswoman Megan Gilbertson told PolitiFact that surveillance video captured images of the man who is pictured in The Gateway Pundit article in a dumpster outside of the department and attempting to get inside its warehouse on March 5 and 6. She said she doesn't know the man’s identity, but that the department would be contacting law enforcement officials. Gilbertson said sample ballots and other miscellaneous election materials are kept in the warehouse and could have been in the warehouse dumpster, but not cast ballots. All ballots that have been cast are kept in an indoor vault, she said, and surveillance footage shows no outsider gained entry to it. A judge ruled Feb. 26 that Maricopa County must turn over the 2.1 million cast ballots from the November election to the Arizona Senate so that the Senate can conduct an audit. Senate leaders have said they are unsatisfied with the county's multiple pre- and post-election audits, according to news reports. The Maricopa County Board of Elections, composed of four Republicans and one Democrat, voted unanimously on Nov. 20 to certify that Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the county.  Biden won 1,040,774 votes, or 49.8%, in the county; Trump won 995,665, or 47.7%. Biden won Arizona by 1,672,143 to Trump’s 1,661,686. The author of the Gateway Pundit article did not reply to our email. An article widely shared on Facebook claimed: ""Ballots in Arizona’s Maricopa County"" from the 2020 presidential election ""found shredded and in dumpster days before Senate audit to begin."" The county elections department said it has a surveillance recording of a man rummaging through a dumpster outside of its office and attempting to gain entry into its warehouse. The department says all voted ballots from the 2020 election are sealed in a locked indoor vault, awaiting shipment for an audit by the state Senate, that none are kept in the warehouse and none have been shredded.

No, Oprah wasn’t wearing an ankle monitor in her Meghan Markle interview
","In March 2020, after baseless allegations that Oprah Winfrey was under house arrest and wearing an ankle monitor started to spread on social media, the media powerhouse addressed the rumors on Twitter. ""Just got a phone call that my name is trending,"" she wrote nearly a year ago. ""And being trolled for some awful FAKE thing. It’s NOT TRUE. Haven’t been raided, or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world."" Following her interview with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry that aired on March 7, similar baseless allegations emerged.  ""Oprah?

Kansas senator leaves out context in claim about transgender athletes
","President Joe Biden on his first day in office signed an executive order saying his administration would enforce laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, and would address overlapping forms of discrimination. ""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,"" Biden’s order said. In response, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., argued in a Fox News op-ed that Biden’s order would ""destroy women’s sports,"" because ""letting biological boys compete in biological girls’ high school and college sports"" would give them an unfair advantage. Marshall added that hormone treatment doesn’t level the playing field, citing a 2020 study of adults in the military as evidence. ""A recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests that even after two years of hormone therapy, biological boys still maintain significant advantages over girls, including being 12% faster on the 1.5-mile run,"" wrote Marshall, a former OB/GYN in Kansas. PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at Marshall’s characterization of the study. We found that he cherry-picked the study’s findings and misrepresented its conclusions about the effect of hormone treatment. One of the study’s authors told us that he left out important context by focusing on just the speed test.  Marshall’s office did not respond to our request for more information. We’ve looked at other claims that allowing transgender athletes to participate in scholastic sports would ""destroy girls’ sports"" and found little evidence for that. Gender refers to the cultural roles, behaviors, activities and attributes expected of people based on their sex, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Biologists say that a person’s gender identity may be masculine, feminine, a combination of both or neither, or it may shift over time. Transgender describes people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Cisgender describes people whose current gender identity is the same as the sex they were assigned at birth. The study Marshall cited was not about scholastic or collegiate athletes. It centered on fitness test results and medical records of 29 transgender men and 46 transgender women who began receiving gender-affirming hormones in their mid-20s while in the U.S. Air Force. Researchers compared their pre- and post-hormone performance on speed and upper-body strength tests with the average performance of all women and men under age of 30 in the Air Force between 2004 and 2014. The study found that in a speed test based on a 1.5-mile run, the transgender women ran faster than the cisgender women, on average — 21% faster before taking hormones, and 12% faster after two years of hormones. So some advantage remained. But on strength tests, based on push-ups and sit-ups performed in one minute, the advantage for transgender women disappeared after two years. The study suggested that more than one year of testosterone suppression ""may be needed to ensure that transgender women do not have an unfair competitive advantage when participating in elite level athletic competition."" ""In general, the advantage of trans women continued to diminish the longer they were on testosterone blockers,"" said Dr. Timothy Roberts, director of the adolescent medicine training program at Children’s Mercy Kansas City, and co-author of the study. ""So, for strength or technique-based competitions, Sen. Marshall is misrepresenting our research."" The study said more research was needed to determine ""if guidelines for transgender inclusion in sports need to account for the athlete’s pubertal stage when testosterone or estrogen began."" Anatomical differences triggered during puberty — such as height, pelvic architecture and leg bones — which do not respond to changes in testosterone post-puberty may explain why transgender women retained an advantage in running speed, the study said. But that advantage in distance running also needs context, Roberts said. While the average transgender woman is still faster than the average cisgender woman after two years on hormones, she is still slower than the top 9% of cisgender women runners, Roberts said. ""Advantage? Yes. Destroy women's sports? No,"" Roberts said. ""There are many things that put women's athletics in jeopardy, such as gender bias, lack of funding, unequal pay and unequal access to athletic opportunities, but trans women are not one of them."" There’s no authoritative count of how many transgender athletes have competed recently in high school or college sports, because neither the NCAA nor most state high school athletic associations collect that information, according to the AP. Around 200,000 athletes compete in women’s college sports, and based on a researcher’s estimate, about 50 are transgender, the New York Times reported. Overall, there’s limited research on transgender athletes. The few studies available have been carried out in different populations and don’t consistently measure the same physiological factors or use the same outcome variables, so they cannot not easily be translated to a particular sport, said Katrina Karkazis, a cultural anthropologist and a senior research fellow with the Global Health Justice Partnership at Yale University. The problem with trying to do studies on athleticism in general is that there are too many variables to consider, including myriad biological factors, psyche, nutrition and training, Karkazis said. NCAA policy requires that transgender women complete one year of testosterone suppression treatment before competing on a women’s team. But the policy document says, ""according to medical experts on this issue, the assumption that a transgender woman competing on a women’s team would have a competitive advantage outside the range of performance and competitive advantage or disadvantage that already exists among female athletes is not supported by evidence."" Marshall claimed that a study ""suggests that even after two years of hormone therapy, biological boys still maintain significant advantages over girls, including being 12% faster on the 1.5-mile run."" The study he cited involved U.S. Air Force personnel who were mostly in their mid-20s, and it focused on only two measures: upper-body strength and running speed. After two years of taking hormones, the study found, the average transgender woman ran 12% faster than the average cisgender woman, compared with 21% faster before treatment. On a strength test, the same study found, the advantage of transgender women disappeared over that same interval. Experts say there’s limited research on transgender athletes, and little evidence that transgender women are dominating women’s sports. Marshall’s claim cherry-picks the findings of the study, and one of the authors of the study said he misinterpreted its conclusions.   We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B0A100>],/factchecks/2021/mar/09/roger-marshall/kansas-senator-leaves-out-context-claim-about-tran/

The founders didn’t put a Senate filibuster into the Constitution
","With the Democrats’ razor-thin majority in the Senate, and the intense partisan polarization embodied by the chamber’s strict party-line vote on President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief bill, there’s been a lot of discussion recently about the filibuster — a tool a minority can use to stall a bill unless 60 senators vote to take up the measure. Much of the attention has been focused on Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Manchin is generally considered the most conservative Democratic senator in the 50-50 Senate, which gives him significant leverage over his party. If Manchin — who represents a state that backed President Donald Trump in November by a 39-point margin — joins with Republicans on a given bill or amendment, he torpedoes any Democratic hope of passage. Manchin also plays a pivotal role on how the Senate operates, because he has long been a backer of the filibuster. This has irked other Democrats, who see little hope of winning Republican support in today’s polarized environment, making it hard for Democrats to secure the 10 Republican votes needed to break a filibuster and pass new laws.  Help shape our fact-checking! Take PolitiFact’s reader survey now >> One way for Democrats to ease this conundrum would be to eliminate the filibuster — but that would require at least 50 votes, and Manchin has long said he’s opposed that path, as have a few other Democratic senators, including Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.  After the Senate’s narrow passage of the relief bill on March 6, Manchin was asked repeatedly about the future of the filibuster during a round of interviews on the Sunday political talk shows.  On NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" host Chuck Todd asked Manchin what he thought about carving out election-related bills to move forward with 50 votes rather than 60. Manchin sounded skeptical, although he did say he’d consider a change that required a minority to actually talk a bill to death on the floor, something that is not required today. ""Can you imagine not having to sit down, where there's no reason for you to sit down with your colleagues on both sides and have their input?"" Manchin said. ""The Senate is the most unique body of government in the world. It's deliberate. It's basically designed, Chuck, to make sure the minority has input. That's exactly our Founding Fathers."" Todd pushed back on the mention of the founders. ""Well, Senator, the filibuster was never an idea of the Founding Fathers,"" he said. ""That is a Senate rule that was created by senators later, in fairness. It's not a Founding Father idea."" We wondered whether Todd was right that ""the filibuster was never an idea of the founding fathers."" Todd is basically correct, though in discussing the issue with experts, we found a few nuances to point out. (Todd did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) There is a legend of uncertain veracity that says George Washington and Thomas Jefferson came to agree that the Senate should serve as a ""saucer"" to the House’s ""tea cup"" — a vessel for cooling the hottest passions emanating from the House. Whether the specifics of the tale hold up, the Senate has long been considered the slower, more cautious half of Congress.  The filibuster was never ""established"" by a specific act; it emerged organically. Some analysts suggest that it began during the first decade of the 1800s, when senators mistakenly deleted a rule empowering a majority to cut off debate, though others disagree.   In any case, the Constitution delegates internal rule-setting to the Senate itself, and for much of its history, the chamber did not implement a mechanism to maneuver around a member determined enough to block action by mounting a filibuster. It took until 1917, when the Senate voted to empower a supermajority of 67 to cut off a filibuster and move on to other business, using a motion known as ""cloture."" Then, in 1975, the Senate voted to lower the supermajority to its current number, 60. Those 60 votes have become a significant hurdle in a chamber that has not often had one party win that many seats — and especially in recent years, as the two parties have become more polarized and more willing to filibuster, even on matters that had previously been treated as routine. Something we know for sure is that the filibuster does not appear in the Constitution.  The Constitution does include two tools that can be used by a minority to delay action — refusing to vote, and repeatedly calling for roll call votes, wrote Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist, in his 2010 study, ""Filibustering: A Political History of Obstruction in the House and Senate."" Some founders, such as George Mason, acknowledged ""inconveniences"" caused by the blocking actions of a minority but also believed that the fear of such blockages could have an energizing effect on the legislative process, according to contemporaneous notes cited by Koger. Other founders, including James Madison, more strongly opposed a minority being able to block the will of the majority. Madison wrote in Federalist Paper 58 that a determined minority could ""screen themselves from equitable sacrifices"" or ""in particular emergencies, to extort unreasonable indulgences,"" possibly leading to the ""ruin of popular governments."" Ultimately, the founders took something of a middle path in the Constitution. They required a majority quorum to do legislative business, which Koger sees as a ""balance between the delegates’ fear of mischief by small numbers of legislators and their concern that a high threshold would paralyze Congress at critical moments."" And the founders decided that one-fifth of those present could request a roll call vote. While this was another potential delaying tool for minorities, it represented a middle ground between allowing just one member to request a vote and not recording votes at all, Koger wrote. The founders may have felt that ""an occasional episode"" of delay ""might do more good than harm, but the Federalist Papers suggest that they did not intend obstruction to systematically impede majority action on most classes of legislation,"" Koger wrote. Todd said, ""The filibuster was never an idea of the Founding Fathers.""  The founders never wrote into the Constitution a filibuster, and contemporaneous writings suggest that the founders’ views ranged from ambivalent to negative about the value of delaying tactics in general.  The founders were aware that some of the provisions they included in the Constitution could be used by a determined minority to delay legislative business, even if that was not was not the founders’ reason for including them. In any case, the filibuster used in the Senate today was not among the provisions included.  We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BC7900>],/factchecks/2021/mar/08/chuck-todd/founders-didnt-put-senate-filibuster-constitution/

Misleading video suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci said vaccines don’t protect people from COVID-19
","Social media users are claiming that a viral video posted on Instagram shows Dr. Anthony Fauci saying that vaccines don’t protect people from COVID-19.  The video — which was edited to add voiceover commentary — shows CNN’s Chris Cuomo interviewing Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases.  The interview occurred on Dec. 10, after a panel of experts recommended the authorization of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. Cuomo asked Fauci to explain why people would still need to wear masks after they were vaccinated against COVID-19. The Instagram post excerpts a clip from the conversation: ""Just because you’re protected,"" Fauci is seen saying in the post, ""so-called protected by the vaccine, you still need to remember that you could be prevented from getting clinical disease and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx, because you can get infected. We’re not sure, at this point, that the vaccine prevents you against getting infected."" At that point in the Instagram video, a voice cuts in to emphasize what it appears Fauci is saying: Voiceover: ""We’re not sure at this point that the vaccine prevents you against getting infected."" Fauci: ""We know for sure it’s very, very good, 94, 95%, in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease."" Voiceover: ""Clinically recognizable disease? But not COVID?"" Fauci: ""And almost 100% at protecting you for severe disease."" Voiceover: ""And almost 100% from severe disease? Well then what does he call covid if that’s not serious?"" The video has been viewed more than 380,000 times on Instagram. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fauci was being very scientifically precise with his words, but there was nothing nefarious behind his statement. According to CNN’s transcript, Fauci’s full response to Cuomo’s question about the continued need to wear masks was: ""Well, the answer is unless you get the overwhelming majority of the country vaccinated, and protected, and get that umbrella of what we call herd immunity, there's still a lot of virus out there. ""So just because you're protected, so-called protected, by the vaccine, you should need to remember that you could be prevented from getting clinical disease, and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx because you could get infected. ""We're not sure, at this point, that the vaccine protects you against getting infected. We know for sure it's very, very good, 94%, 95% in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease, and almost 100% in protecting you for severe disease. ""But until you have virus that is so low in society, we, as a nation, need to continue, to wear the mask, to keep the physical distance, to avoid crowds. We're not through with this just because we're starting a vaccine program. ""Even though you, as an individual, might have gotten vaccinated, it is not over by any means. We still have a long way to go, and we've got to get as many people as possible vaccinated, of all groups."" When Fauci said this in December, research on the COVID-19 vaccines showed that the vaccines prevent people from developing the disease COVID-19. But research was — and is — still underway to determine whether or not the vaccines stop people from being infected with the virus and transmitting it to others. The confusion about Fauci’s statements stems from the distinction between the disease caused by the virus and the virus itself. COVID-19 is the World Health Organization’s official name for the coronavirus disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, is the WHO’s official name for the virus that causes COVID-19. Both names have been used when discussing the pandemic since they were announced in February 2020.  Help shape our fact-checking! Take PolitiFact’s reader survey now >> In recent months, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency use authorization for three vaccines that, in the FDA’s own words, are ""for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."" First on Dec. 11, just days after this Fauci interview, the FDA cleared the Pfizer vaccine for distribution and use in the U.S. On Dec. 18, the FDA cleared the Moderna vaccine for distribution and use. Finally, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine became the third vaccine cleared for distribution and use in the U.S. on Feb. 27. The CDC reports that after two doses, the Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective ""in preventing COVID-19"" and the Moderna vaccine is 94.1% effective.  The one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was tested ""during a more complicated phase of the pandemic"" when variants had emerged, is also effective at preventing COVID-19, according to the Washington Post.  ""It was more than 80% effective at preventing severe illness, including in areas of the world where concerning variants are circulating, but only 66% protective overall when moderate cases were included,"" the story said. It is important to note, however, that further research is needed to determine if any of the vaccines in use prevent people from being infected with the virus, therefore slowing transmission.  Many vaccines do not prevent against infection or transmission, but they do keep people from getting seriously ill and having to go to the hospital.  ""In general, most vaccines do not completely prevent infection but do prevent the infection from spreading within the body and from causing disease,"" reads a Johns Hopkins FAQ about vaccines. ""Many vaccines can also prevent transmission, potentially leading to herd protection whereby unvaccinated people are protected from infection by the vaccinated people around them because they have less chance of exposure to the virus."" Some preliminary research indicates the COVID-19 vaccines have some ability to reduce infection and transmission, but real world research into this complex topic is still underway. ""We are still learning whether or not the current Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"" the Johns Hopkins FAQ continues. ""It is likely they reduce the risk of virus transmission but probably not completely in everyone.""  This means vaccinated people might not develop the ""clinically recognizable"" COVID-19 disease Fauci was referring to, but they could become infected with the virus and spread it if they do not continue to wear masks and avoid crowds, for example.  A viral video suggests that Fauci said vaccines don't protect against COVID-19. In reality, Fauci was making a distinction between contracting the disease COVID-19 and becoming infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. While research shows that the vaccines authorized for use are effective at protecting people from COVID-19, it is still unclear whether or not the vaccines will prevent people from becoming infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

New York nursing homes granted legal protection, but not ‘blanket immunity’
","Assemblymember Ron Kim has been concerned about nursing home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and his policy disagreements with Gov. Andrew Cuomo garnered national attention after he said Cuomo bullied him during a phone call. New York approved broad legal protections for health care facilities during the pandemic as part of the 2020-21 state budget. The protections, retroactive to March 7, were meant to relieve some of the burden on the health care system amid an emergency. They were narrowed in August. But legislators have said the protections were not widely known when the New York State Legislature passed the budget in April. Kim, who voted against the budget for other reasons, said that he found out about them from a reporter months later. In an interview with Brian Lehrer on WNYC, the Queens Democrat said that Cuomo ""issued a legal blanket immunity, and snuck that into our budget, giving these facilities essentially a license to kill, a get-out-of-jail free card.""  These legal protections are a source of concern for people whose loved ones died in nursing homes, and we wondered about the breadth of the legal immunity granted to nursing homes.  Kim said the provision grants health care facilities ""legal blanket immunity.""  The protections are broad, but even nursing home advocates say they don’t provide blanket immunity. The original provision limited liability for health care workers, administrators, board members, and health facilities, including hospitals and nursing homes, as long as a state of emergency remains in effect. It pertained to the care of any patient, whether sick from COVID-19 or not. An amendment to the law in August limited the scope of the law to only coronavirus patients.   Under the law, health workers and health facilities ""shall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, for any harm or damages"" related to the delivery of health care. The law does not apply in cases of ""willful or intentional criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or intentional infliction of harm …"" But it also states that ""acts, omissions or decisions"" resulting from shortages of staff or resources should not be considered ""willful or intentional criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or intentional infliction of harm.""   Margaret Somerset, a lawyer with Underberg & Kessler in the Rochester area who represents nursing homes, said that the law only provides qualified immunity from civil and criminal prosecution if the medical provider does not act with gross negligence or recklessness.  She also said that the law specifically states that shortages of PPE or staffing may not be used as evidence of gross negligence or recklessness. The law was also amended in August 2020 to limit its application to providers engaged in either diagnosing or treating Covid-19 patients.   A report from state Attorney General Letitia James said the law should not be interpreted to mean it provides ""blanket immunity,"" but it also raised concerns. ""Due to several recent changes in law, it is unclear to what extent facilities or individuals can be held accountable if found to have failed appropriately to protect the residents in their care,"" the report said. It also said James disagrees with any interpretation that the law provides blanket immunity for things other than intentional harm, even when related to intentional resource and staffing allocations, calling it ""illogical, contrary to public policy, and contrary to the law’s intent."" Nina A. Kohn, a distinguished scholar in elder law at Yale University and a law professor at Syracuse University, said Kim’s use of ""blanket immunity"" is how she would expect a layperson to use the term. But legally speaking, it’s not accurate, because the law does not say that you can never be held liable for anything.  Nonetheless, Kohn said, the law gives ""a green light for facilities to understaff and underresource. The language seems plain to me.""  The exceptions, however, such as gross negligence, can be difficult to prove. James Snyder, a plaintiff’s lawyer in the Syracuse area who has written about the immunity law, said gross negligence exists in New York law, ""but imposes an incredibly high burden of proof upon  anyone attempting to make a claim for personal injury pursuant to it.""  Kim said the governor snuck the immunity protections into the budget. Kim’s chief of staff, Tony Cao, told us that when Kim inquired about the provision, once he learned about it after the budget vote, he was told by Assembly leadership that the administration fought forcefully for the provision, telling both houses it was non-negotiable.  Kim’s office also provided a letter from the Greater New York Hospital Association, which hailed the passage of the provision. ""GNYHA drafted and aggressively advocated for this legislation,"" President Kenneth Raske wrote to the association’s members.  We asked the Cuomo administration about the provision, and aides said that the budget, which is voted on by legislators, is the subject of negotiations between the executive chamber and both houses of the State Legislature.  ""It’s an impossibility to ‘sneak’ anything in to the budget — we engage with legislative staff in ongoing negotiations throughout the budget process, those staff must physically sign off on every individual provision before the bill is printed, and every legislator can of course read the language themselves,"" said Beth Garvey, special counsel and senior advisor to Cuomo.  The budget bills run hundreds of pages, and lawmakers typically have only hours from the time they are printed until the vote. The Assembly passed the 2020-21 budget in the wee hours of the morning.  Kim said that nursing homes have ""essentially a license to kill"" and a ""get-out-of-jail free card.""  Cao, Kim’s chief of staff, said that isn’t hyperbole. When the order granting immunity is combined with other measures the administration took to ease the burden on health care workers and institutions navigating an unforeseen crisis -- as well as the high bar to prove gross negligence, recklessness or intentional harm in court --– he said families have little recourse if their loved ones were harmed in nursing homes during the pandemic.
 
Cao pointed to an executive order relaxing paperwork requirements, which expired at the end of December. ""Any person acting reasonably and in good faith under this provision shall be afforded absolute immunity from liability for any failure to comply with any recordkeeping requirement,"" it stated. Without paperwork documenting patients’ conditions, and with the pandemic preventing visits by family members, building a case is impossible, Cao said.
 
The Cuomo administration said the expectation and intent of the recordkeeping order was not that facilities would keep no records, but that they did not always have to stringently complete records at all times during the emergency, Garvey said. Many of those records were finalized after the fact, she said.  
The Cuomo administration’s position is that the intent of the law was to prevent lawsuits unless there was intentional misconduct. If a facility accepted patients it could not care for properly due to staff or resource shortages, that could be intentional misconduct, she said.  But the attorney general’s report raises the possibility of a loophole in the law. It states that the law ""is silent as to whether the safe-harbor for ‘resource or staffing shortage’ is to be assessed only based on conditions that arose as a result of the COVID-19 emergency or whether it"" applies to shortages that existed before the emergency declaration.  The attorney general’s investigation found that poorly staffed nursing homes had higher death rates. James recommends eliminating the immunity provisions because they ""can provide financial incentives to for-profit nursing home operators to put residents at risk of harm"" by not employing enough caregivers or purchasing enough personal protective equipment. Kim said that a law protecting health care facilities gave them ""blanket immunity,"" was snuck into the budget by Cuomo, gave health care facilities get out of jail free cards and a license to kill.  The law contained broad protections, but doesn’t grant blanket immunity. Experts disagree on how broad the protections are. It will likely take court cases to resolve that question.  While Cuomo may have fought aggressively for the law during budget negotiations, saying that he ""snuck it in"" minimizes the legislature’s role. Staff and leaders knew about the provision even if many members didn’t.

Biden’s criticism of Trump administration vaccine contracts too broad to be accurate
","During a March 2 news conference on the COVID-19 pandemic, President Joe Biden claimed that former President Donald Trump’s administration did not ensure there would be enough vaccines for the American public.  ""When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America,"" said Biden. ""We rectified that.""  Biden then announced he was using the Defense Production Act to facilitate a partnership between two competing drug companies: Merck had agreed to help manufacture the recently authorized Johnson & Johnson vaccine.  The move, he said, would accelerate the timeline for the availability of vaccines to the American public: ""We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,"" he said, two months earlier than he had previously projected.  It’s been a common political message since the Biden administration took office that the initial vaccine rollout under Trump was ""chaotic."" PolitiFact previously rated a claim by Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, that the Trump administration left no vaccine plan behind as Mostly False.  So, we thought it was important to check whether Biden was going too far in alleging that the Trump administration hadn’t contracted for enough vaccines to cover the American public. Let’s see what the contracts, which are public documents, say.  As part of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration entered into contracts with multiple drugmakers. The contracts were generally signed while potential vaccines were still in clinical trials.  Experts told us this was smart, because the Trump administration didn’t know what vaccines from which drugmakers would work, how effective they would be or how quickly they could be produced.  ""That was the whole approach of Operation Warp Speed,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Not knowing which one would cross the finish line, the Trump administration took a portfolio approach and invested in multiple vaccines.""  Here’s what the Trump administration’s initial contracts called for drug makers to supply to the U.S. government:  In total, the amounts agreed to under these contracts equal about 800 million vaccine doses, or enough for more than 400 million people.  The U.S., based on U.S. Census estimates, has around 328 million people, of whom about 255 million are older than 18. (Vaccines are not yet authorized for children.)  So it appears that the Trump administration’s contracts with drugmakers did cover enough doses to vaccinate the entire U.S. adult population — and then some. By that measure, Biden’s statement is inaccurate.  An important point to remember, though, is that these contract numbers don’t necessarily represent deliverable vaccines. The contracts represent early promises. There were still important hurdles that had to be cleared before these possible vaccine candidates could be a reality.  Kevin Gilligan, a senior consultant with Biologics Consulting, a firm focused on pharmaceuticals, said once drugmakers develop a vaccine, they must test it through clinical trials with humans and amass enough data to show the vaccines are safe and effective and cause minimal side effects.  The data is then presented to the Food and Drug Administration, which decides whether the vaccine should be authorized for emergency use. Granting an emergency use authorization means the vaccine can then be distributed to the public.  Until recently, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were the only two that had reached that point, gaining authorization on Dec. 11 and 18 respectively.  The Trump administration announced Dec. 23 that it would buy an additional 200 million doses in total of both companies’ vaccines.  A Biden administration press official told KHN that the president was referring only to orders for the authorized vaccines. ""When the Trump Administration was in office, there were only two approved vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) and the Trump Administration had not contracted for enough of them to vaccinate all Americans. They only had 400 million doses of these authorized vaccines, which is only enough for 200 million Americans. Upon coming into office, one of our first steps was to ensure that we had enough supply secured for every American. We were prepared from Day 1.""  On this point, the Biden White House is correct. The U.S. government had in place agreements to buy 400 million doses of the authorized vaccines, which were both two-dose vaccines — not enough for the entire U.S. adult population.  It’s also true that five days after Biden became president, he announced his administration had reached agreements with Moderna and Pfizer to buy a combined additional 200 million doses. That purchase was finalized on Feb. 11 and brought the total U.S. supply to 600 million doses of authorized vaccines, or enough to vaccinate 300 million people.  In addition, on Feb. 27, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was authorized for emergency use. Under the Operation Warp Speed contract, J&J is supposed to provide 100 million doses to the U.S. by the end of May, but the company is reportedly behind on production.  The Biden administration’s move to get J&J to team up with Merck to achieve its production goal will increase vaccine supply.  But, is it fair for Biden to blame the Trump administration for not buying more of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines once they became authorized for emergency use?  The answer to that isn’t clear-cut, said the experts.  ""It’s not totally fair to say the prior administration didn’t purchase enough, since they did move to purchase more doses after the vaccine was authorized,"" said Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""I think the question is should they have purchased it earlier?""  The New York Times reported on Dec. 7 that before Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was shown to be highly effective in clinical trials, the company had offered the U.S. government the option to buy additional doses, but the Trump administration declined. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar disputed the news report, saying during a TV interview that Pfizer hadn’t agreed to a production amount or delivery time for the additional vaccine, so he couldn’t agree to the deal: ""I'm certainly not going to sign a deal with Pfizer giving them $10 billion to buy vaccine that they could deliver to us five, 10 years hence. That doesn't make any sense.""  James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a non-governmental organization that obtained copies of COVID-19 government contracts, agreed that once it was clear the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were likely to receive FDA authorization, the Trump administration could have taken action to make competing drug companies increase their vaccine manufacturing capacity in the way Biden did with Merck and J&J.   ""The U.S. could have forced technology transfer between companies, which meant they would have been assured of additional vaccine manufacturing capacity,"" said Love. ""The agreements we have now about scaling manufacturing are coming pretty late actually. It takes several months to get stuff up and running.""  But Gilligan noted that the Biden administration had the advantage of hindsight. ""Biden inherited the success of vaccine development done under Trump and then expanded on it,"" said Gilligan. ""And the Biden administration has the benefit of looking back at what was done well and what wasn’t and making the appropriate corrective changes. Hindsight is 20/20.""  Overall, there are questions around whether the Trump administration could have acted more quickly to buy doses or increase vaccine manufacturing capacity. And the Biden administration has certainly taken significant measures to expand supplies.  But it’s stretching the truth to say the Trump administration hadn’t contracted for enough Covid vaccines to inoculate the U.S. adult population.  Biden said the Trump administration ""had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America."" While Trump was still in office, his administration had agreements in place to buy 400 million doses of authorized vaccine, or enough to inoculate about 200 million people. That’s less than the U.S. adult population.  However, KHN/Politifact reviewed the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed contracts, and found that those included enough vaccine doses that, once cleared for use by the FDA, could inoculate about 550 million people — more than double the U.S. adult population.  Biden’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores facts that would give a different impression.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CFE100>],/factchecks/2021/mar/05/joe-biden/bidens-criticism-trump-administration-vaccine-cont/

Judge did order new election in small Miss. city after finding ballot problems, evidence of fraud
","Fallout from an election for alderman in Aberdeen, a Mississippi city of 5,000 described by the visitors bureau as ""historically significant, architecturally magnificent,"" produced this headline on social media: ""Massive 78% Of Mail-In Ballots Proved Fraudulent, Judge Orders Election Do-Over."" Among those sharing the headline from the National Pulse website was its editor, Raheem Kassam. He is co-host of the War Room, a podcast led by Steve Bannon, a former Trump White House aide and strategist. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline leaves out where the fraud took place or what election they were talking about. If you saw only the headline, you might think it would involve the presidential election. (Kassam and the National Pulse have promoted claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election.)   If you clicked, you’d see the relevant details. A judge ordered a new election for Aberdeen’s alderman seat after finding that 66 of the 84 absentee ballots cast, or 78%, contained irregularities. The judge also found evidence of fraud by two people who notarized paperwork for absentee ballots and ordered one of them arrested. A Democratic runoff election for Ward 1 alderman in Aberdeen was held June 16, 2020. Nicholas Holliday was officially declared the winner over Robert Devaull by 37 votes, 177-140, by the local Democratic Executive Committee.  Holliday in effect won the seat, because no independents or Republicans had filed to run in the July 6 general election. Devaull challenged the result, claiming numerous irregularities in the election, including that absentee ballots were improperly accepted or rejected.  But the executive committee upheld Holliday as the winner at a hearing on July 15. Devaull sued Holliday and the committee two days later.  The lawsuit alleged a number of election irregularities, including 60 absentee ballots that were counted that had not been properly filled out, and four absentee ballots that had similar errors but were rejected.  The lawsuit also alleged that then-Mayor Maurice Howard said during the executive committee hearing that he had ""dismissed"" some of the witnesses the committee had subpoenaed to appear at the hearing. The Mississippi Supreme Court appointed Judge Jeff Weill of Hinds County to the case. A hearing was held before him and three members of the elections commission of Monroe County, where Aberdeen is the county seat, on Jan. 4 and 5. Weill issued a 64-page order on Feb. 26, ordering that a new election be held. No date was set. According to the ruling: Of the 66 absentee ballots that Weill found contained irregularities, 50 were wrongly accepted or wrongly rejected.  That included 35 that were accepted but should have been rejected and 15 that were rejected ""seemingly arbitrarily,"" in that they appeared to have the same types of errors as the 35.  There were also irregularities in 16 of the 19 ""challenged"" ballots, all of which were absentee ballots, and they should have been rejected.  In many cases that had irregularities, a voter signed an absentee ballot application saying the reason for requesting an absentee ballot was that he or she was age 65 or over, or would be out of town on election day; but the witness part of the application indicated the reason was that the voter was disabled.  There were also other errors cited in the ruling, such as applications that did not state any reason for requesting the absentee ballot. Weill also issued an arrest warrant for Dallas Jones, saying ""it distinctly appeared"" she helped people vote absentee illegally ""and conspired with unknown others to accomplish same.""  The order noted that Jones initially testified that she was called by Ald. Lady Garth to Garth’s home to correct her father’s absentee ballot paperwork, and while there notarized ""about 30-something ballots."" But later, Jones testified that she had only handled the ballot of Garth’s father in Garth’s home. Jones also testified that she went to the homes of some voters, but either didn’t witness or didn’t recall if she witnessed them signing their absentee ballot applications. Lou Ela Hoskins C. Stephens, another woman who notarized absentee ballot paperwork, testified that she witnessed the signatures of each person whose paperwork she notarized, and that each of them are family members, but that she couldn’t remember the names of which family members they were. There is ""significant evidence of fraud"" by both women and the ""unnamed co-conspirators with whom they coordinated their efforts,"" Weill wrote. Garth became Aberdeen’s acting mayor after Howard pleaded guilty on Feb. 1 to embezzlement by a public official, which resulted in his removal from office. The State Auditor’s Office charged Howard in October 2019 with claiming reimbursements from taxpayer funds for trips he never took. A headline widely shared on Facebook stated: ""Massive 78% of mail-in ballots proved fraudulent, judge orders election do-over."" It wasn’t the election you might have been thinking about. A judge ordered a new election for an aldermanic seat in a small Mississippi city after ruling that 78% of the 84 absentee ballots cast for that seat contained irregularities. The judge also found ""significant evidence of fraud"" on the part of two people who notarized paperwork for absentee ballots and ordered one arrested.

NC elections board leader downplays rule changes
","In the 2020 general election, North Carolina voters were given more time to return absentee ballots than previously allowed under state law. The changes were controversial among some legislators, who inquired about them in a legislative committee meeting on Feb. 25. Karen Brinson Bell, the state election board’s director, attended the meeting to speak about future elections.  ""How many of these lawsuits that you’re settling change state law?"" a legislator asked in a video of the exchange.  Bell responded: ""I think we may have a disagreement as to whether state law was actually changed by the settlement or not.  ""If I take the perspective, and the board takes the perspective that they did not change state law, which is where we are, then we just abided by the settlement rules,"" she concluded. Conservatives in government and media quickly challenged Bell’s description of the events, raising a two-part question:  Did North Carolina’s election laws change for the 2020 election? And if so, was it the state elections board that changed them? To be clear, PolitiFact is not weighing in on whether the changes were good or bad, or whether they were constitutional or not — a source of legislative debate.  We’re here to review whether there were effective changes in the law.  Someone who heard Bell’s comments may think the elections board followed absentee ballot rules set by state lawmakers. That’s not the case. In a legal settlement, the state elections board enacted changes to absentee ballot rules that had been set in general statutes. Democracy North Carolina and the North Carolina Alliance for Retired Americans, left-leaning voting rights advocacy groups, sued the state elections board seeking voting rule changes that would help reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. While the lawsuits raised several issues, the most controversial to come out of the settlement were: How long after Election Day would the board accept mail-in absentee ballots? Would absentee voters need someone to sign their ballot as a witness? Entering 2020, state law required mail-in absentee ballots to be signed by two witnesses and arrive no later than three days after Election Day to be counted. The GOP-led legislature later passed (and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed) a law allowing mail-in ballots to be signed by a single witness during the 2020 election. After the lawsuit was settled, however, voters would have different rules for the 2020 election. Absentee ballots would be accepted up to nine days after Election Day, rather than three. Absentee ballots would still require a witness signature. However, voters who mailed an absentee ballot without the signature could rectify the situation by mailing an affidavit, signed only by themselves, to support the ballot’s veracity. Out of the 5.5 million ballots counted in last year’s election, the board says roughly 2,000 civilian absentee ballots arrived in those extra days between Nov. 7 and Nov. 12. (State law already allowed military and overseas ballots to be accepted if received nine days after the election.) The elections board, in a statement through spokesman Pat Gannon, argued that the distinction between laws and rules is key. While absentee ballot rules are outlined in state law, the board says state law also grants Bell and the board emergency powers.  The board compared the change in rules to an extension in voting hours at a polling site, a common occurrence when disruptions delay voting operations. ""That’s not a change to the law. It’s following the law to temporarily change a process to ensure that people can vote, despite the obstacles,"" the board said through Gannon.  J. Michael Bitzer, chair of the politics department at Catawba College, said he found the comparison to be ""a bit of a stretch."" State law specifically says the board is allowed to extend voting hours if polling operations are interrupted. When considering changes for the 2020 election, the Republican legislative majority made it clear the witness requirement was important. Legislators also specifically rejected a proposal to further lengthen the absentee ballot arrival deadline during negotiations on the bill. So, while the legal settlement didn’t amend North Carolina’s laws for the long term, the voting rules effectively deviated from specific laws. ""Whether the BOE was authorized to make the changes, whether the changes were made for good reason, and whether the changes were temporary or permanent does not negate the fact that changes were made,"" Greg Wallace, a constitutional law professor at Campbell University’s Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law, told PolitiFact. ""An authorized, reasonable, and temporary change is still a change."" Now we’ll address the other question at-hand: What role did the state elections board play in those rules changing? After months of litigation, the elections board announced on Sept. 22 that it had agreed to a settlement with the plaintiffs to move forward with the aforementioned absentee rule changes and asked the courts to approve the agreement in a joint motion. While awaiting the court’s blessing, the state board sent county boards new guidance that reflected the settlement details. Though Republican legislative leaders are mentioned alongside the elections board as defendants in the lawsuit, they said they weren’t involved in the settlement negotiations and didn’t agree with them. The board had two Republican members who voted for the agreement, then they later resigned saying they didn’t understand the terms of the deal. Republicans are quick to point out the deal was struck between a majority-Democratic elections board, plaintiffs represented by prominent Democratic elections lawyer Marc Elias, and Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein, whose office defended the settlement terms in court. It’s fair to say the board is one of four major players, along with the plaintiffs, attorney general and the courts.  The legal battle went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene in the case after a 5-3 vote. Republicans have pointed out that a couple of federal judges admonished the state board for its settlement.  In an Oct. 14 order, U.S. District Judge William Osteen said he believed the board’s changes could result in unequal treatment of voters. However, he said legal precedent restricts court intervention in cases with fast-approaching elections. North Carolina began issuing absentee ballots to voters on Sept. 4. Gannon, the board spokesman, pointed out that North Carolina’s appellate courts declined to overrule the conclusions from the state court judge presiding over the case at issue. The state court judge, Gannon added, ruled that the settlement was in compliance with state law. Still, without the board’s vote, the rules wouldn’t have changed at all.  ""The SBE bears sole responsibility for the settlement on the defendant side because it was the only entity that could give the plaintiffs the relief they sought,"" said Wallace, the law professor. Bell said the North Carolina elections board ""did not change state law"" as it pertained to the 2020 election. The board says it was within its legal powers to strike a deal implementing absentee ballot rules that deviated from specific laws set in general statutes. Regardless of who has the power, the election rules were effectively changed, and the board played a major role. Bell’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Pence falsely says if HR 1 passes, millions of people in US illegally will be registered to vote
","Former Vice President Mike Pence attacked the Democrats’ bill to expand voting rights in a recent op-ed, saying H.R. 1 would open the door to more votes cast by people who live in the U.S. without permission. Pence wrote that he shared concerns about the ""integrity of the 2020 election"" — although dozens of courts have upheld the results for President Joe Biden, without finding evidence of voter fraud. He lamented that Democrats in Congress were seeking to brazenly ""nationalize"" elections with H.R. 1, which passed the House March 3. ""The bill would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots, early voting, same-day voter registration, online voter registration, and automatic voter registration for any individual listed in state and federal government databases, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles and welfare offices, ensuring duplicate registrations and that millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote,"" he wrote in The Daily Signal, a publication of the conservative Heritage Foundation where Pence is a fellow. In this fact-check, we wanted to review Pence’s statement that H.R. 1 would result in registering millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally or other ineligible noncitizens. (We rated his claim about ""universal mail-in ballots"" False.) Our reporting found that Pence used flawed logic to make his claim, and he ignored steps offered in H.R. 1 to ensure legal registrations by eligible citizens. Voters would continue to attest to their eligibility, including citizenship, when they register to vote. The penalties for a noncitizen who votes or registers to vote can include deportation, incarceration or fines. ""This is the law in the United States and in every state, and H.R. 1 does nothing to alter that,"" said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research executive director and founder. ""These laws have been very successful in minimizing noncitizens on the lists, and ensuring that only eligible citizens are registered and voting.""  H.R. 1 does not change federal law, which states that only eligible citizens can vote in federal elections. The goal of the legislation is to make it easier for eligible citizens to register. While some noncitizens have ended up on voter registration lists, often in error, voting by noncitizens is statistically rare. For example, Pennsylvania officials a few years ago said they found potentially 544 ballots cast by noncitizens in elections dating back to 2000 — out of 93 million ballots cast. That worked out to about 1 out of every 172,000 ballots. When we contacted the Heritage Foundation to ask for Pence’s evidence, a spokesperson pointed to provisions about automatic voter registration in the bill. They said that under H.R. 1, government agencies would forward information about people who wanted to register to election officials without knowing their citizenship status. But experts on election law dismissed Pence’s warning that ""millions"" of ineligible immigrants would be immediately added to the voter rolls. ""Nothing in H.R. 1’s provisions results in undocumented immigrants being ‘quickly registered to vote,’"" said Matthew Weil, an election expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Under the bill, a person interacting with a government office — such as the motor-vehicles department or public-assistance agency — would have their information forwarded to election officials for registration purposes unless they ""opt out."" Some states already offer the opt-out process for voter registration, and others require applicants to opt in. This section of H.R. 1 explicitly states that the purpose is to enable governments ""to register all eligible citizens to vote."" It goes on to say that government offices are to share voter-registration information only with eligible citizens. If the agency doesn’t know a person’s citizenship status, it would would direct them to a registration form where they would attest to their citizenship, as required by the National Voter Registration Act. It’s still up to a local election agency to determine whether the applicant is eligible to register to vote. Many of the government agencies that would be involved in the process already verify citizenship and would be able to filter out noncitizens, said Danielle Lang, a voting expert at the Campaign Legal Center.   ""All of these voter registration options are already available in many states — both red and blue — and there is no evidence that they lead to significant numbers of noncitizens becoming registered to vote,"" Lang said. The Heritage Foundation spokesperson pointed to another provision in H.R. 1, which states that ineligible immigrants who are registered in error can’t be prosecuted or face adverse consequences related to their immigration status. But a person could still face prosecution if they lied during registration about their citizenship status, Lang said. Pence said H.R. 1 would mean ""that millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote.""  The bill does not permit voting by noncitizens in U.S. elections, whether they’re in the country legally or not. Pence was referring to a provision that would require automatic voter registration for people using services at government agencies. But that section says government agencies would pass along a person’s information for voter registration only if they are citizens. People would still be attesting that they are eligible to vote, with penalties for lying, and it would still be up to election officials to verify eligibility. The goal of the bill is to register eligible citizens. Pence’s warning that ""millions"" of ineligible noncitizens would be quickly added to the rolls is unsupported. We rate this statement False.

No, HR 1 would not allow the Boston Marathon bomber to vote from prison
","Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk falsely claimed that the sweeping voting and elections bill House Democrats passed would put a ballot in the Boston Marathon bomber’s hands. ""They should really rename this bill to the ‘Boston bomber bill,’"" Kirk said March 4 on his radio show. ""Because this bill would allow the Boston bomber to have a right to vote.""  That’s inaccurate. The For the People Act, or H.R. 1, combines proposals for voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections.  The bill passed the House on March 3, and it is expected to face Republican opposition in the Senate. It comes as GOP-led statehouses across the country are pushing voting restrictions based in part on false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. The proposed legislation would restore federal voting rights for felons only once they’ve been released from incarceration. The text of the bill specifically says a citizen who has been convicted of a crime should be allowed to vote ""unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election."" Kirk’s claim refers to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who with his brother set off two pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon in 2013, killing three people and injuring hundreds.   Visitors pause at a makeshift memorial in Boston's Copley Square for victims of the Boston Marathon bombings, April 27, 2013. (AP) Tsarnaev is serving a life sentence at a maximum-security facility in Colorado, after a federal appeals court threw out the death penalty in a decision that has since been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. As long as he’s in prison on the felony conviction, he would not be allowed to vote. ""Under H.R. 1, rights restoration is effective upon leaving prison,"" said Danielle Lang, co-director of voting rights and redistricting at the Campaign Legal Center, which supports the bill.  A spokesperson for Kirk acknowledged the error and told PolitiFact that Kirk misread a show note sent from one of his producers during the broadcast. ""While H.R. 1 does vastly expand the voting rights for convicted felons who have been released from prison, if passed, it would not provide current inmates the right to vote,"" the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that some progressives, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have advocated for allowing inmates to vote. In 18 states, including Massachusetts and Colorado, felons lose their voting rights while they are incarcerated but have them automatically restored upon release, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 19 more states, felons regain voting rights after completing parole or probation, and sometimes after paying outstanding fines or fees.  In Maine, Vermont and Washington, D.C, felons never lose the right to vote.  ""Massachusetts citizens who are incarcerated for a felony conviction are not able to register to vote or vote,"" said Debra O’Malley, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Francis Galvin. ""Upon release from incarceration in a correctional facility, these citizens may register to vote again and vote as any other citizen would."" The text of H.R. 1 appears to align with the Massachusetts Constitution, so there would be no changes to felon voting rights in the state if it became law, O’Malley said. Kirk said H.R. 1 ""would allow the Boston bomber to have a right to vote."" That’s wrong. The proposed legislation would restore federal voting rights for felons only once they’ve completed their sentence and been released from incarceration. Tsarnaev, the convicted bomber, is serving a life sentence in prison.  In Massachusetts and several other states, voting rights for felons are already restored when they’re released.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EA8540>],/factchecks/2021/mar/05/charlie-kirk/no-hr-1-would-not-allow-boston-marathon-bomber-vot/

Legalization could generate $166 million in revenue that could help fund rural schools and programs for communities that have been disproportionately affected by past marijuana laws, Evers said when he announced the plan.  Wisconsin is one of just 14 states that has not legalized marijuana in some form. Fifteen states have legalized recreational marijuana over the past few years, including neighboring Illinois and Michigan, and Minnesota lawmakers have introduced a bill that would do the same.  Public support of the idea is also growing in Wisconsin. A 2019 Marquette University Law School poll found 59% of Wisconsin voters backed legalization for recreational purposes, and 83% backed it for medicinal purposes.  Still, Republican leaders of the Legislature’s budget committee wasted little time in shooting down the proposal. Though Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, said he believed it was ""too big"" to be inserted into the state budget, Sen Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, worried about health effects of the drug on kids who choose to use it.  We rated Kapenga's claim linking youth marijuana use and psychological disorders True. But Agard jumped in to make another point:  ""Youth usage of marijuana has actually gone down in states that have fully legalized,"" she tweeted back.  It’s an important claim, because those opposed to legalization often claim that the move will cause a dramatic uptick in teens smoking pot. But is it correct?  Let’s take a look.  Along with her statement, Agard tweeted a link to an analysis on marijuana laws and teen use of the drug from JAMA Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Medical Association.  The analysis, published July 8, 2019, pooled data from each state’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey from 1993 to 2017 to examine the association between legalization and teen marijuana use.  Averaging the survey data from seven states that passed recreational marijuana laws from 2012 to 2017 — Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Washington — researchers found an 8% decrease in the likelihood of youth marijuana use and a 9% decrease in the likelihood of frequent marijuana use among youth after such laws were passed. ""We interpreted our results as consistent with the argument that it is more difficult for teens to obtain marijuana as drug dealers are replaced by licensed dispensaries that require proof of age,"" study author D. Mark Anderson, an associate professor of economics at Montana State University, told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email.  In some states, recreational sales did not begin until a few years after legalization, so the researchers repeated their analysis based on those dates and got similar results, Anderson said.  A caveat of the analysis is that it uses an average — and when looking at states’ raw data from the survey, results are more mixed.  For example, in Colorado, there have been no significant changes in current marijuana use among high school students since 2005, according to its Healthy Kids Colorado Survey data. In 2013, a year after the state legalized the drug, 19.7% of high school students had used marijuana in the past 30 days; in 2019, 20.6% had.  Alaska’s state survey also reported no significant changes in current youth marijuana use since the drug was legalized in 2015 and sales began in 2016.  And in Oregon, which legalized in 2014, current marjiuana use fell among 8th graders after recreational sales began, but rose among 11th graders, data from the state’s 2017 youth survey found. In the 2019 survey, current marijuana use had risen among 8th graders but fallen among 11th graders. It’s also important to note that the Youth Risk Behavior Survey is just one type of study. Though one set of Washington state data, from the Washington Healthy Youth Survey, found that marijuana use in that state did decrease among the state’s 8th and 10th graders after legalization for recreational purposes in 2012, other studies cited in the JAMA analysis did not reach the same conclusion. For instance, a study using data from the Monitoring the Future survey, which assesses drug and alcohol use among youth across the U.S., found a statistically significant increase in marijuana use among 10th graders in Washington after legalization for recreational use.  Some say the Monitoring the Future data has too much year-to-year volatility to encapsulate marijuana policy changes — but it’s clear that more review will be needed to fully understand the effects of recreational marijuana laws on youth use.  The full effects of marijuana legalization won’t be seen until a generation after national legalization, which still has not happened yet, Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-director of RAND’s Drug Policy Research Center, told PolitiFact Illinois about a similar claim from an Illinois state representative.  Agard said youth marijuana use has declined in states that have fully legalized the drug for both medicinal and recreational purposes.  The JAMA analysis she cited did bear that out, although it has its caveats — when looking at individual states’ data, some that legalized the drug years ago have not seen any meaningful change in youth use. Meanwhile, at least one study found the reverse — an increase in use. Experts say it will be many years before what Agard claimed can be said with certainty.  We rate her claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC0F80>],/factchecks/2021/mar/05/melissa-agard/wisconsin-democratic-lawmaker-overstates-youth-mar/

Fact-checking claims that Biden called troops ‘stupid bastards’ in resurfaced video
","A clip from an old video of then-Vice President Joe Biden speaking to U.S troops is circulating on social media with the accusation that Biden disrespected service members in the room when he called them ""stupid bastards"" when they didn’t clap for a comment he made. Biden said it, but the clip only shows a snippet of his 30-minute speech, and more context is needed. Shared by an Instagram page called ""freedomguards,"" the clip shows Biden standing at a podium at the Al-Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates in March 2016. In the few seconds shown in the post, Biden says: ""I have incredibly good judgment. One, I married Jill. And two, I appointed Johnson to the academy. I just want you to know that. Clap for that, you stupid bastards."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden’s presidential campaign confirmed that he jokingly called the troops in the audience ""stupid bastards"" and a ""dull bunch,"" but said his remarks were made in jest as a way to draw applause for Lt. Karen Johnson. ""Vice President Biden was jokingly encouraging the audience to clap for an airwoman on the stage, and a number of service members can be seen laughing and smiling at the comment,"" Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for Biden’s campaign, told PolitiFact. ""Seconds before, he praised them for 'the incredible sacrifices [they] make for our country.’ He thanked them for their patriotism and courage throughout, and closed his remarks by saying, 'you’re the finest generation of warriors the world has ever, ever known' — receiving an enthusiastic ovation."" Other video of the event shows some of the service members, who are standing behind Biden and his wife, Jill, smiling after he makes the remark.  Biden spent the majority of the speech praising the servicemembers, saying he was honored to be there, and called them warriors and said people don’t understand the ""incredible sacrifices"" they make for the country. Here is a more complete look at what he said before, and after the remark, according to White House archives: ""Hello! (Applause.) It’s great to see you all. Jill and I are really honored to be here. I’ve been doing this job for a while, and everywhere I go I see warriors like all of you before me and behind me here. Excuse my back, folks. ""I’ve been in and out of the Balkans 25 times; in and out of Iraq 26 times; in and out of Afghanistan about 10 or 12 times. And I have one regret every time I’m with you all — and I mean this sincerely — is the folks back home can't see you; can't see you in place. Don't get to fly on the mission with you. Don't understand — they appreciate, but they don't fully understand the incredible sacrifices you make for our country. ""And I want you to know notwithstanding what you may hear about me, I have incredibly good judgment. One, I married Jill. And two, I appointed Johnson to the academy. I just want you to know that. Clap for that, you stupid bastards. (Applause.) Come on, man. Man, you are a dull bunch. Must be slow here, man. I don't know.   ""Look, in full disclosure, Lieutenant Johnson, she came to see me in 2008 and I appointed her — back in the days of the Senate.  And I had the great privilege of nominating her to the Air Force Academy. And I’m so proud to see how her career has advanced. ""I also want to thank very much Brigadier General Orcutt for welcoming me and my family here today. And we know you all — the temp ops here is pretty high, and you got better things to do than come and see Jill and me. But we never pass up an opportunity wherever we are around the world to try to see our warriors."" Biden also spoke about his son Beau’s military service, and closed by telling the troops that they are ""the greatest generation of warriors."" Biden’s trip to the Middle East, and his speech that day, were covered by news organizations at the time, and no mention of the comment was made in those reports.  The Air Force also issued a news release on Biden’s visit to the base, and said that the vice president ""stressed again his opinion of the men and women serving their country before taking time to shake hands and personally greet members of the audience."" Clips highlighting Biden’s comments have been on YouTube since at least 2017, but only recently gained traction online after they were reshared by pro-Trump accounts. The post comes weeks after an article by The Atlantic reported that President Donald Trump called those killed in combat ""losers"" and ""suckers."" Trump denied that he made the comments. A clip from an old video of Joe Biden is being shared on social media with the claim that he was disrespecting soldiers while speaking to U.S troops. In the 14-second clip, Biden calls those in the audience ""stupid bastards"" when they didn’t clap for a comment he made. Biden did call those he was addressing ""stupid bastards,"" but in full context of the 30-minute speech, the comment appears to have been made in jest to generate applause for a female lieutenant he was referencing. He repeatedly complimented the troops and spoke about his late son Beau, who served as a major in the Delaware Army National Guard. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

GOP claim that Dems omitted ‘under God’ from pledge at DNC misleads
","A month after the back-to-back national political conventions, the state Republican Party of Wisconsin still has a two-word bone to pick with Democrats. ""At the Democratic convention, the Pledge of Allegiance was read with the words 'under God' removed,"" the Republican Party of Wisconsin claimed in a campaign mailer that landed, at least for some voters, in mailboxes on Sept. 17, 2020.  Milwaukee, of course, was selected for the 2020 Democratic National Convention, but the event was transformed into an almost entirely virtual affair due to the coronavirus pandemic. So, most convention speeches were made from a variety of remote locations across the United States.  We watched the DNC each night (the RNC, too), and each night this is what we heard: ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."" So, what gives? Is the state GOP right about Democrats omitting ""under God"" at its event? When asked to back up the claim, state GOP spokesman Alec Zimmerman pointed PolitiFact to footage of the Aug. 18, 2020 LGBTQ Caucus meeting from the virtually virtual DNC.  In addition to the main sessions each night, political conventions include a host of additional meetings -- from state delegations, to caucuses focused on specific topics. There were at least 30 of these during the DNC. In an email, Zimmerman wrote of the LGBTQ Caucus meeting: ""The person reciting the pledge takes an extra long pause during the spot where ‘under God’ is normally mentioned, as to acknowledge what she’s doing. All of this was done under the banner of the DNC during the Democrat convention, as is made clear by the header atop the video."" The video, which is posted on YouTube, shows a person introduced as ""Dr. Richmond"" reciting the pledge. Richmond pauses with a head nod at the point in the pledge where ""under God"" is usually said. An Aug. 26, 2020 item from Reuters noted that ""under God"" was also omitted at the Muslim Delegates and Allies Assembly meeting.  This is not the first time the claim has come up. Even President Donald Trump tweeted about it on Aug. 22, 2020.  Our colleagues at PolitiFact National examined a similar claim from former Republican U.S. Senate candidate Peggy Hubbard of Illinois, who claimed in an Aug. 20, 2020 Facebook post:  ""The DNC omitted ‘one nation under God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance.""  As noted by PolitiFact National: Some Democratic caucus members omitted ""one nation under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance during DNC meetings. But the line was not excluded from any of the convention’s primetime televised spots. On each night of the DNC, ""under God"" was included in the Pledge of Allegiance. Hubbard’s claim was rated Mostly False. Philip Shulman, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, criticized Republicans for highlighting the issue, saying: ""Donald Trump and Wisconsin Republicans know they can’t run on the issues, so instead they are desperately lying to Wisconsinites.""  The Wisconsin Republican Party in a mailer sent to voters said ""the Pledge of Allegiance was read with the words 'under God' removed"" at the Democratic National Convention.  There is some truth here, in that this happened at two of the 30 or so caucus and council meetings. But that’s not the impression left by the GOP mailer. Videos from the convention show that ""under God"" was included on all four nights of the main event, which were livestreamed and carried by many TV stations. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4D4E40>],/factchecks/2020/sep/28/republican-party-wisconsin/gop-claim-dems-omitted-god-pledge-dnc-misleads/
"['Economy', 'Illinois', 'Coronavirus', 'Richard Durbin']","
No, U.S. economy not worst in world by ‘a factor of three’
","Following last month’s Democratic National Convention, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said Democrats would better handle the coronavirus and the nation’s economy if they take control of the Senate next year. ""We have a worse economy than any other country in the world that’s going through COVID-19 by a factor of three,"" Durbin said on the ""Connected to Chicago"" podcast hosted by WLS-AM’s Bill Cameron. While the U.S. economy has been struggling in the aftermath of shutdowns caused by the pandemic, the Aug. 23 claim drew a very stark comparison between the U.S. and the rest of the world that we had never heard. So we decided to check it out. Asked repeatedly to provide records, studies or any other support to back up the claim, Durbin’s staff did not respond. So we turned to experts and myriad data collected by economists to compare the U.S. economy to other countries. Experts we interviewed agreed the most effective measure is gross domestic product, or GDP. ""I don’t think it’s true that our economy is worse than any other country by a factor of three,"" said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University public policy professor who has studied the effects of COVID-19 on the economy. One publication experts commonly use for such comparisons is Our World in Data, a nonprofit based at Oxford University, which compiles and republishes statistics collected worldwide. On Sept. 1, Our World in Data published an examination of the health and economic impacts of the pandemic among 38 countries based on available GDP for the second quarter, which ended June 30. In it, the U.S. ranked above 24 other countries in a comparison to the same period in 2019. Among the two dozen countries doing worse than the U.S were the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Canada and Mexico, according to the study. Peru experienced the worst economic decline at 30% for the second quarter. The U.S sustained a GDP decline of 9.5%, the report said. Since Durbin made his claim about the U.S. having the worst economy during a discussion about unemployment, we decided to check that indicator to see whether the senator might have meant the U.S. jobless rate was three times worse than anywhere else in the world. In June, Holzer published a report with the Brookings Institution examining how COVID-19 had affected health and employment in 25 wealthy nations. He found the increase in unemployment during the first months of the pandemic was larger in the U.S. than in any of the other countries he reviewed. From January to April, data in his report shows, the U.S. unemployment rate quadrupled to 14.7%. That doesn’t mean the jobless rate here was several times worse than any other nation’s, or even increased at triple the rate of all other countries. For instance, Canada’s unemployment rate jumped to 13% in April, more than double where it stood in January. While the U.S. experienced a somewhat sharper increase, it was not worse by a factor of three, as Durbin stated. We did find an assertion similar to Durbin’s made at the Democratic convention by former president Bill Clinton. ""Donald Trump says we’re leading the world,"" Clinton declared. ""Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple."" PolitiFact found Clinton’s claim about the unemployment rate to be Mostly True.  Holzer, who served under Clinton as chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor, said if Durbin was attempting to repeat Clinton’s claim, ""he mangled it."" Durbin said, ""We have a worse economy than any other country in the world that’s going through COVID-19 by a factor of three."" As of August, when Durbin made his remarks, available data for the second quarter showed U.S. GDP declined by 9.5% relative to the same period last year, better than two dozen other countries around the world. And while other economic indicators such as unemployment rates showed the U.S. economy suffered staggering losses, they were not worse by a factor of three, according to published data and experts. We rate Durbin’s claim False. FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

Amy Coney Barrett’s ‘Kingdom of God’ comments ripped out of context
","A sarcastic post traveling around social media warns that Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett has the same kind of views on separation of church and state as al-Qaeda or ISIS. ""BREAKING: Al Qaeda & ISIS just issued a statement saying their end goal is to end separation of church and state & build a ‘Kingdom of God’ in the United States,"" the post says. ""Oh, my bad, that was Amy Coney Barrett, the judge at the top of Trump’s list to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"" it concludes. The posts were created by commentator Bryan Dawson when Barrett was on Trump’s short list of potential nominees and continued to spread after Trump officially made her his pick on Sept. 26, 2020. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So did Barrett issue a statement saying she wanted to end separation of church and state and build a kingdom of God? No. The posts invent her position on the separation of church and state, misconstrue her comments on a ""Kingdom of God"" and make a dubious comparison with Islamic terror groups. Let’s review the evidence.  We found nothing to suggest that Barrett wants to end the separation of church and state. We found no statements from her saying that. And when she was confirmed in 2017 to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, we found no concerns expressed by senators, either Democratic or Republican, that she sought that. (Most of the questions Democrats directed at her were how she would handle court precedents like Roe vs. Wade.) Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, asked Barrett during the 2017 hearings if it was ever proper for a judge to put her religious views above applying the law. Barrett replied: ""It's never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they derive from faith or anywhere else on the law."" Later in the hearing, responding to a question from Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., Barrett said, ""If you're asking whether I take my faith seriously and I'm a faithful Catholic, I am, although I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge."" Barrett did use the phrase ""Kingdom of God"" twice in a 2006 commencement address at Notre Dame Law School, and many media accounts of Barrett’s career and biography have noted the phrase. Barrett is a longtime law professor at Notre Dame, one of the best-known Catholic universities in the country. In the address, a transcript of which is online, Barrett spoke about what made Notre Dame Law School graduates special, noting their training in both academics and ethics. But many other law schools train their students in academics and ethics, she noted. ""I’m just going to identify one way in which I hope that you, as graduates of Notre Dame, will fulfill the promise of being a different kind of lawyer. And that is this: that you will always keep in mind that your legal career is but a means to an end, and as Father Jenkins told you this morning, that end is building the kingdom of God. You know the same law, are charged with maintaining the same ethical standards, and will be entering the same kinds of legal jobs as your peers across the country. But if you can keep in mind that your fundamental purpose in life is not to be a lawyer, but to know, love, and serve God, you truly will be a different kind of lawyer."" Barrett went on to advise graduates to pray, tithe and stay active in the Catholic faith. On the last point, she used the phrase again: ""Finally, when you arrive at your new jobs in your new cities, seek out friends with whom you can share your faith. For the past three years, you have lived within the Notre Dame Law School community. While we are a community engaged in the enterprise of legal education and scholarship, we are also a community engaged in the enterprise of bringing about the kingdom of God. We are a community characterized by our love and concern for one another. I hope that you have enjoyed living here these last three years. I also hope that living at Notre Dame has given you a thirst for this kind of community. Don’t just look back on your time here with nostalgia. When you get where you’re going, carry Notre Dame with you. Deliberately choose a parish or church that has an active community life and commit yourself deeply to the relationships you find there. It’s only when you’re an independent operator that your career takes over. When your life is placed firmly within a web of relationships, it is much easier to keep your career in its proper place."" Overall, Barrett’s use of the phrase ""kingdom of God"" was placed in a general context of Christian belief and a sentiment of love and concern for others.  By contrast, al-Qaeda and ISIS are terrorist groups known for murders, assassinations, ambushes, kidnappings and suicide bombings in the Middle East, as well as parts of Asia, Africa and around the world. Internet posts claim that like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, Amy Barrett has said her ""end goal is to end the separation of church and state & build a ‘Kingdom of God’ in the United States.""  Barrett has not advocated for ending the separation of church and state. During public questioning for confirmation as a circuit court judge in 2017, she said judges’ personal views should not affect their official duties. Her comments about the Kingdom of God were made during a commencement address at a Catholic institution where she made general comments about living a Christian life.  Overall, we rate this post False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A48AA80>],/factchecks/2020/sep/27/instagram-posts/amy-coney-barretts-kingdom-god-comments-ripped-out/

Graph on US abortion rate during different presidents based on real data, but needs more information
","While Republicans are typically considered anti-abortion, the rate of abortions under Democratic presidential administrations has actually fallen more precipitously, a Facebook post claims. The post argues the difference relates to the Democrats’ approach of making abortions unnecessary by providing contraception, compared with the Republican approach to make the procedure less available.  A graphic shows steep falls under Clinton and Obama administrations. Text above the graph reads, ""For anyone who opposes Trump but hesitates to vote Democrat because of the abortion issue, here’s some food for thought: ""Neither party wants to see abortions increase. The difference is in strategy: the Republicans approach of ‘Make it illegal’ vs. the Democrats approach of ‘Make it unnecessary.’ Which is more effective? The numbers speak for themselves."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The graph, which cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as its source, shows a declining abortion rate in the U.S. starting in the Reagan administration through the end of Obama administration. (It doesn’t show data from the Trump years.) It shows the rate of abortions declining marginally under Republican presidents and more dramatically under Democrats. In analyzing the post, we found two issues. First, states voluntarily report abortion data to the CDC, and which states report data varies wildly from year to year. For instance, California hasn’t reported abortion data in more than two decades. Second, experts say the post oversimplifies the reasoning behind the decline and overstates the role the occupant of the White House plays. Since 1969, the CDC has attempted to collected nationwide data to document the number of legal abortions, the abortion ratio (abortions versus live births), and the abortion rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44).  But the CDC data isn’t complete because not all abortions are counted.   The latest CDC abortion report, from 2016, used data from health agencies of 48 reporting areas (New York City and 47 states). But it did not include California, the District of Columbia, Maryland and New Hampshire — about 14% of the country’s population. That makes comparisons over time periods — or in this case presidential administrations — challenging.  Overall, the CDC says that the known number of abortions increased rapidly in 1973, after Roe vs. Wade, and reached their highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing ""at a slow yet steady pace.""   The CDC says the decline temporarily slowed between 2006-08, before resuming.  According to the Facebook graphic, the abortion rate (per 1,000 women ages 15-44) declined 4% in the Reagan administration, and another 4% in George H. W. Bush’s four-year presidency. Then, it plummeted by 30% during President Bill Clinton’s two terms, and slowed once again during President George W. Bush’s two terms, with only a 3% drop.  The last large decrease, the chart shows, came in the Obama years with a 26% decline. The most recent CDC abortion surveillance report is from 2016. The percentage decreases generally line up with the available CDC data we reviewed. Though, that data isn’t perfect.  From 1973 through 1997, the CDC compiled the data from 52 reporting areas in the United States: the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. But that changed in 1998 (states send in the data voluntarily). That year, the CDC received abortion data from 48 reporting areas, instead, excluding Alaska, California, New Hampshire and Oklahoma.  States have continued to swap in and out over the ensueing years, but it’s notable that California, the most populous state, has remained constant and hasn’t submitted any abortion data since it stopped in 1998. ""I think it is an oversimplification to say there is an association between the abortion rate and the political party occupying the White House,"" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.  ""Many of the policies that might affect the abortion rate vary at the state level. These include things like whether there has been an expansion of programs, including Medicaid, to provide contraception for people living on low incomes, or alternatively, policies that might make it more difficult for clinicians to provide abortion care."" Nearly all abortion challenges have, indeed, come at the state level. The federal outliers are the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the federal government from covering the costs of abortions except in very rare cases, and the 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which prohibits a form of late termination of pregnancy. But by and large, federal lawmakers have had trouble passing abortion restriction laws. The Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, compiles abortion data every three years and surveys hospitals, abortion clinics and health departments.  In 2017, the organization reported that the U.S. abortion rate had decreased to record low levels, dropping to 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44, the lowest rate recorded since abortion was legalized in 1973. The decline may be due to fewer women becoming pregnant and increased access to contraception rather than by laws restricting abortions, said Elizabeth Nash, the institute’s senior state policy manager. ""Between 2011 and 2017, the abortion decline appears to be driven by fewer people becoming pregnant in the first place, as both abortions and births declined. If abortion restrictions were the main driver across the board, we’d expect the birth rate to increase,"" Nash said. ""There are a lot of potential factors at play, including increased access to affordable contraception (due to the Affordable Care Act among other policies that make it easier to afford contraception), new methods of contraception, and changing pregnancy desires and attitudes."" A Facebook post shares a graph on U.S. abortion rates and says the larger declines during recent Democratic presidential administrations is due to the party’s approach of making abortions unnecessary, rather than the Repbulican party’s approach of making them illegal. The graphs cites CDC data, but health department reporting on abortions has fluctuated so much over the years that making broad comparisons can prove challenging. Not every state has reported its abortion data for every year. Moreover, experts said tying the abortion rate to the occupant of the White House alone is an oversimplification of a variety of factors that are at play. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097190140>],/factchecks/2020/sep/25/facebook-posts/graph-us-abortion-rate-during-different-presidents/

""Kamala Harris was picked to be Joe Biden’s VP 42 days ago,"" said the Sept. 23 post. ""There are 41 days until the election. She has not formally taken questions from the press a single time."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim appears to have originated with NBC News reporter Deepa Shivaram, who tweeted a day earlier that ""the senator has not once formally taken questions from the press.""  The tweet racked up thousands of likes and retweets and was shared by a number of news reporters. Eric Trump and other allies of President Donald Trump also picked it up. And it made the jump to Instagram when D’Souza shared it to his more than 900,000 followers. But Harris hasn’t shunned the media, as D’Souza’s Instagram post suggests. The California senator sat down for her first interview as a vice presidential candidate with the 19th News on Aug. 14, three days after Biden announced her as his running mate. Since then, Harris has done interviews with national organizations such as People, ABC News, NBC, Univision, BET and CNN. She also interviewed with the Grio, a site targeting African American readers, and she appeared on Showtime’s late-night talk show, ""Desus and Mero."" On Sept. 21, two days before D’Souza’s post, Harris spoke with Urban Radio Networks reporter and CNN political analyst April Ryan and joined radio host Russ Parr for his show. She is slated to appear Sept. 28 on MSNBC’s ""The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell."" Harris has also interviewed with a number of local news outlets. The outlets PolitiFact identified include: three TV stations and two radio stations serving south Florida; a TV station in Charlotte, N.C.; two TV stations in Milwaukee; a TV station in the San Francisco Bay Area; two TV stations in Phoenix; a TV station in Las Vegas; two TV stations in Philadelphia; a TV station in Detroit; and a TV station serving the Flint and Tri-Cities region of Michigan. When a reporter asked Biden why they hadn’t ""seen her out very much"" during a Sept. 4 press conference, Biden said Harris has been busy campaigning on his behalf. ""She’s been on the road,"" Biden said. ""She’s out herself. The role is that, just like when Barack and I campaigned, we try to cover as much territory as we could, and both of us out campaigning."" Shivaram, the NBC News reporter, clarified her original point in a second tweet, which was posted in response to a question and received significantly fewer shares. She said Harris has, in fact, done interviews with both national networks and local outlets in states she’s visited.  What Harris hasn’t had, Shivaram wrote, is an informal briefing where reporters covering her campaign stops can ask questions, aside from a ""few shouted questions."" ""Just to be clear, she's taken questions,"" Shivaram tweeted in response to another reporter’s retweet. ""But it's us shouting them out as we're moving in and out of rooms, or as she's walking in and out of events. Nothing more established than that."" D’Souza did not respond to a request for comment. An Instagram post says Harris ""has not formally taken questions from the press a single time"" since Biden named her as his vice presidential pick. That’s inaccurate. Harris has made numerous media appearances and interviews since the Aug. 11 announcement.

","President Donald Trump, a former beauty pageant owner, has come under fire for his behavior around contestants.

Trump first answers, ""I never comment on things like that."" After more than two minutes of back and forth, Trump says: ""Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that I’ll go backstage before a show, and everyone's getting dressed, and ready and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it.

No, Biden didn’t say his people would commit violence if he loses the election
","In late August, social media posts shared the inaccurate claim that Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris said she wants riots to continue even after the presidential election.

John James is lone Senate candidate facing tight race who is mum on Supreme Court vote
","The Michigan Democratic Party is criticizing Republican Senate candidate John James for his murky statements on filling the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death. In a campaign statement, James bemoaned partisan feuds over Supreme Court nominations. ""We need to get back to those times where people from both political parties worked together,"" he wrote in a campaign email. ""As your senator I will fairly and honestly evaluate every Supreme Court nominee, regardless of which political party nominates."" But James’ email did not weigh in on the question that’s currently dividing lawmakers and congressional candidates, on mostly partisan lines: whether the Senate should promptly consider and vote on President Donald Trump’s nominee to fill Ginsburg’s seat or wait until after the general election. In 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, arguing that the next president should fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Antonin Scalia’s death. Republicans are now planning to move forward to consider and vote on Trump’s nominee under similar circumstances. McConnell says the fact that the White House and the Senate are controlled by the same party justifies this course. The Michigan Democratic Party says James stands out among Senate candidates in competitive races for not making his preference clear. ""James is the only Senate candidate in a battleground state who has refused to take a position,"" the Michigan Democratic Party claims. Trump has said he'll announce his Supreme Court nominee Saturday. We looked through the public statements from candidates in a dozen competitive Senate races and found this statement to be accurate. James’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment. According to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report which evaluates national elections, there are 12 competitive Senate races: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia (where two seats are in play), Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and South Carolina. The leading Democratic candidates in each of those races have criticized their opponents or the Republican Party for moving forward with a vote on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee before the general election. In South Carolina, Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison hasn’t taken a position on the vote, but assailed his Republican opponent, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, for reversing his position from 2016. Georgia Democrat Matt Lieberman has also not taken a position on the vote but is not seen as a competitive candidate in the state's special eleciton, and is facing calls to drop out. Raphael Warnock is the leading Democratic candidate in that contest. In Michigan, incumbent Democratic Sen. Gary Peters argued on the Senate floor this week that the Senate should wait until after the next president is inaugurated to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. ""Jamming this Supreme Court nomination through now will, without question, further divide our country and disregard the fact that the American people are now voting — or soon will be in many states,"" Peters said. Among Republicans, Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the only Republican candidate facing a competitive race who favors waiting until after the election to consider filling Ginsburg’s seat. We found public statements in favor of a vote now from Republican Sens. Martha McSally, Steve Daines, Cory Gardner, Joni Ernst, Thom Tillis, Graham, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and from GOP candidates Roger Marshall, Doug Collins and Tommy Tuberville. James, meanwhile, criticized Peters for taking a partisan position on Supreme Court nominations and promised to evaluate any Supreme Court nominee in a nonpartisan manner. ""It shouldn’t matter which political party is in the White House, and I will have the same standard whether it’s a Republican or Democrat,"" he wrote in a campaign email. James did not state what that standard will be. James has not said whether the Supreme Court vacancy should be filled before the general election. The Michigan Democratic Party claimed that ""James is the only Senate candidate in a battleground state who has refused to take a position"" on whether the Senate should promptly vote on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. Among the competitive Senate races identified by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, every Republican Senate candidate, except James, has publicly indicated their position on whether to consider Trump’s Supreme Court nominee before the election. Meanwhile, every competitive Democratic candidate has criticized members of the Republican Party for changing their position on considering a Supreme Court nominee in an election year, and all but Harrison have stated their opposition to voting on Trump’s nominee before the election.

What social media posts get wrong about Amy Coney Barrett’s religious beliefs
","A few days before Judge Amy Coney Barrett met with President Trump at the White House, posts on Facebook mischaracterized her religious convictions and claimed she has made racist and homophobic statements.  Barrett, a Catholic conservative judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal in Chicago, is on the shortlist of names that Trump could nominate for the Supreme Court. The seat opened when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on Sept. 18.  Some claims on Facebook offered false takes on her record. ""Amy Barret said gays have a right to be discriminated against because they are against Gods wishes and won't be allowed. Heaven,"" one Facebook user wrote, misspelling her last name and omitting punctuation.   ""Amy Barret says white people are Gods chosen ones. Minorities must submit to them and that's Gods plan. Obedience,"" reads another post from the same user.  To be clear: Barrett never said either of these things. These Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A review of her judicial opinions, public statements and academic writing hasn’t produced any quotes along these lines. Barrett clerked for late Justice Antonin Scalia before joining the faculty of Notre Dame Law School, where she taught for 15 years. Trump nominated her to the appellate court in 2017.  Barrett has a limited judicial record compared with other Supreme Court nominees that Trump is reportedly considering. Timothy R. Johnson, a professor of political science and law at the University of Minnesota, told PolitiFact that Barrett’s relatively sparse paper trail makes it difficult to predict how she’ll rule if nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court. Barrett has described herself as a devout Catholic. A liberal group on Instagram warning against her potential nomination pointed out her involvement in a Christian group called People of Praise. The New York Times reported that the group supports gender roles where husbands have authority over their wives.  Democratic senators have pointed to an article she co-wrote early in her career as reason for concern that she would not work with impartiality. The article argued that Catholic judges should have the right to recuse themselves from cases that conflict with their personal beliefs, such as those involving the death penalty.  During her confirmation hearing for the appeals court, Barrett pushed back, saying that she ""would never impose my own personal convictions upon the law."" Barrett’s supporters have said the controversy over her religious beliefs is a form of anti-Catholic bias, pointing out that other members of the court are Catholics.  Barrett never said that ""gays have a right to be discriminated against."" But LGBTQ rights and abortion rights organizations have criticized her past appointment. In 2017, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights organization that focuses on LGBTQ communities, penned an open letter to U.S. senators opposing Barrett’s appointment to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  Lambda Legal took issue with a letter that Barrett had signed that defined marriage as the ""indissoluble commitment between a man and a woman,"" and a talk that she gave at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal organization that opposes LGBTQ rights.  Supporters of abortion rights are concerned about Barrett’s abortion views. In a 2013 interview, Barrett said that she believes that life begins at conception. In an article, she wrote that the Catholic Church’s views on prohibiting abortion are ""absolute"" because they ""take away innocent life."" She has ruled against abortion rights in the two abortion cases that she has heard on the bench. Finally, the post claims Barrett has white supremacist views. We found no evidence of that in a review of Barret’s record.  Facebook posts claim that Barrett said that ""gays have a right to be discriminated against because they are against Gods wishes"" and that ""white people are Gods chosen ones."" Barrett has never said anything along these lines.  We rate these posts False. ​",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CF2EC0>],/factchecks/2020/sep/25/facebook-posts/what-social-media-posts-get-wrong-about-amy-coney-/

Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins lobs false ‘defund police’ attack on Sara Gideon
","Some top Republicans who have alleged that top Democrats want to defund the police have fared poorly on our Truth-O-Meter. We rated False President Donald Trump’s claim that Joe Biden wanted to defund the police. And an attack by U.S. Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., against her Democratic challenger, Mark Kelly, caught Pants on Fire. Now comes a more targeted attack in another pivotal Nov. 3 race, the Senate contest in Maine pitting Republican Sen. Susan Collins against Democrat Sara Gideon.  Collins alleges in an ad that Gideon ""voted to defund"" the police in the Maine town of Freeport ""and gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run."" Both parts of this defund claim fail, too: Collins cherry-picked a Gideon vote for consolidating Freeport’s police dispatch services with a neighboring town’s, resulting in savings to Freeport. Gideon didn’t give money to the nonprofit for which she served as a board member. Unrelated to the dispatch issue, she joined in a town council vote to forgive part of a loan to the nonprofit. Collins has been a senator since 1997. Gideon has served in Maine’s state House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016. She served as a Freeport Town Council member from 2009 to 2013.  Many news accounts say the race is one that could determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. The Cook Political Report has rated the race a tossup. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. Police departments generally allocate most of their budgets to salaries, and what’s left over is used for equipment, training and community-oriented programs. In the movement to defund police, some activists want to eliminate police departments entirely, while others want to reexamine the functions of police departments and redirect some of their funding to other community services. But the Collins ad misused the term ""defund"" to describe a budget move that’s not related to that movement at all. A vote to save money on policing isn’t necessarily defunding the police. Gideon has stated — at a debate, in a clip used by the ad itself — that, like Biden, she does not support defunding the police. Gideon was part of a 5-2 majority on the Freeport Town Council that voted in May 2010 to fully consolidate police dispatch services with another town, Brunswick, saving an estimated $73,750 in Freeport’s 2011 budget.  Brunswick was already handling the dispatch for Freeport’s 911 calls; the 2010 vote added non-emergency dispatch. The vote didn’t change the number of police officers on the streets. Gideon’s campaign cited minutes showing Gideon voted for annual town budgets that raised police funding. The 2013 town budget provided $192,000 more in police funding — totaling the general police, special enforcement and police dispatch accounts — than the 2010 budget, which was in place when she took office. The point being: Freeport police budgets increased — not decreased — while Gideon was a member of the town council. To back the second part of the claim in the ad, Collins’ campaign charges that Gideon, ""after taking funding from the police department,"" voted four months later to provide about $70,000 in aid to Freeport Community Services, a nonprofit for which she was a board member. Gideon helped with projects but was not involved in the day-to-day operations, which were managed by an executive director, a Gideon campaign spokeswoman said. Gideon, who noted at the meeting that she was on the board, joined with the majority of the town council in September 2010 in a 4-0 vote, with one abstention. The vote was to forgive part of a loan that had been given to Freeport Community Services. The meeting minutes indicate that in approving the vote, the town would forgive $65,000 in debt if the nonprofit raised $65,000. The aid to the nonprofit was unrelated to the discussion of police budgets. Sen. Collins says in an ad that Gideon ""voted to defund"" the police in Freeport, Maine, ""and gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run."" Gideon voted to consolidate Freeport dispatch services with another town, saving money. But she actually voted for higher police budgets as a town council member. So the Collins ad misuses the term ""defund"" to describe moves that are unrelated to the ""defund police"" movement.  The claim that Gideon gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run is even more spurious. Her vote to aid a nonprofit she served on the board of involved a forgiven loan and was unrelated to the police. The proposal passed the council 4-0. We rate Collins’ statement False.

Two autopsies found George Floyd’s death was a homicide
","A blog post being shared on Facebook has a headline that contradicts reality in the killing of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck on May 25.   ""Coroner saying George Floyd died of drug overdose, not police brutality,"" the Aug. 27 post says. As evidence, it cites comments from Andrew Baker, the chief medical examiner in Hennepin County, who performed an autopsy on Floyd. But Baker didn’t say that Floyd died of a drug overdose. The medical examiner’s office ruled that the manner of Floyd’s death was homicide.  The cause of death, according to the medical examiner, was ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.""

Baker also said: ""I am not saying this killed him."" Chauvin’s lawyer is asking the judge to drop the charges in the case against the ex-police officer, arguing that Floyd died from a drug overdose and not because Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s neck.  But the results of the two autopsies in this case don’t support that.  One, requested by Floyd’s family, and conducted by two doctors also found that Floyd’s death was a homicide, though it concluded that they thought he died of asphyxia — or suffocation — not cardiopulmonary arrest as the county medical examiner concluded.  We rate this blog post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097833780>],/factchecks/2020/sep/25/blog-posting/two-autopsies-found-george-floyds-death-was-homici/

How many adults get flu shots each year?
","Health officials are doubling down on calls for people to get flu shots this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic to reduce the burden on healthcare workers already battling COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends an annual flu vaccine to ward off seasonal influenza viruses, which tend to peak during fall and winter. U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, a Republican from North Texas, encouraged his Twitter followers to get vaccinated for the flu, sharing a statistic about how many people have gotten flu shots each year. ""Did you know: in the last 10 years less than half of adults in the US received a flu shot?"" he wrote. ""This flu season I hope you will consider getting your flu vaccination, despite all of the social distancing measures that are in place around the country."" Burgess' his claim about the number of adults who have gotten flu shots is on the money. He did not return a request for comment seeking additional information about his remark. CDC data shows higher rates for certain groups Estimates from the CDC show that, since 2010, less than half of all adults in the U.S. got a flu shot each year during flu season. The percentage of vaccinated adults each year has fluctuated, reaching a high of 43.6% in 2014 and a low of 37.1% in 2017, the most recent year with available data. ""Depending on the specific age groups, some are vaccinated more than others,"" said Dr. Pedro Piedra, a professor of molecular virology, microbiology and pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine. ""Older adults generally have high vaccination coverage compared to the general public. Likewise for young children under 5 years of age, you’ll see vaccination coverage that is generally much better than that of the general healthy adult."" Vaccination coverage among adults over 65 has ranged from a high of 66.7% in 2014 to a low of 59.6% in 2017, staying above the 50% mark for the past 10 years. The age group with the lowest percentage receiving flu shots is those between 18 and 49. Vaccination coverage for this group ranged from a high of 33.6% in 2016 to a low of 26.9% in 2017. For children, vaccination rates are higher — nearly 70% of children under 4 were vaccinated for the flu each of the past 10 years. For all children 17 or younger, an average of 56.6% received a flu shot for each of the past 10 years. Why is the rate so low? Part of the reason more older adults and younger children get flu shots is because they tend to be in doctors’ offices at higher frequencies than younger adults, which puts them in front of physicians who encourage them to get vaccinated. ""Adults aren’t like kids; it’s not like you go to the doctor every three months or every six months,"" said Dr. Jewel Mullen, associate dean for health equity at the University of Texas’ Dell Medical School. ""At best, maybe some go once a year. So those opportunities are missed."" Mullen said the reasons that vaccine numbers are so low are dependent on several factors including a combination of misinformation about influenza infections, the vaccine and how frequently shots are necessary. Cost can also be a factor, Mullen said. Flu shots are generally free with most medical insurance, but some plans require copays and the cost of a flu shot without insurance can range from $40 to $70, or more for high-dose vaccines. Ideally, Piedra said roughly 80% of all people would get flu shots each year. ""Not only would that offer greater direct protection, but you’d have greater indirect protection,"" he said. ""Direct protection is if you receive a vaccine, you receive a direct benefit of the vaccine. Indirect means those who have not been vaccinated, but they receive an indirect benefit when they are surrounded by those who have been vaccinated. This reduces the risk that the virus will be released and transmitted through that community."" For Mullen, there isn’t a perfect number, but the goal is clear: ""as many as possible."" ""The other reality right now is that we’re talking about concerns for what this upcoming flu season is going to be in the context of a pandemic that we still do not have under control,"" she said. ""We already know that many of the populations and people at risk for severe disease from COVID 19 are the same ones at risk for severe disease from influenza, so we’re layering risk and vulnerability on top of one another, which gets me back to saying as many, as many as possible."" Our ruling Burgess said ""in the last 10 years less than half of adults in the US received a flu shot."" Estimates on flu vaccination coverage show that, since 2010, less than half of adults each year get a flu shot. That rate is higher among older adults and children.

Although they confirmed the wedding occurred, they declined to provide any more details about what they described as a ""private event,"" to the Louisville Courier Journal.  However, there is no evidence that Cameron’s new wife is also McConnell’s granddaughter or related at all. A spokesperson for McConnell confirmed that Cameron’s wife was not the senator’s granddaughter, nor was she related to McConnell in any way. The spokesperson also pointed to a tweet from a reporter who has covered McConnell for some time. Phillip M. Bailey, a Kentucky-based political reporter, debunked the post’s claim in a tweet at the end of July before the couple was married but after they were engaged. ""I'll say this once and only once because this is so not the issue at hand, but is becoming somewhat of an actual distraction for some folks on the left who either keep asking or telling me. @DanielCameronAG is NOT engaged to @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell's granddaughter,"" he tweeted. McConnell attended Cameron’s wedding, but there is no evidence he was related to the bride as the post suggests. We rate this claim False. Update (Sept. 25, 2020): This post has been updated to also refute claims that Cameron married McConnell's niece. The rating is unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096750B40>],/factchecks/2020/sep/25/facebook-posts/no-kentucky-attorney-general-daniel-cameron-did-no/

Yes, Republicans could end Evers’ state of emergency anytime
","The latest state of emergency declared by Gov. Tony Evers — his third since the start of the coronavirus pandemic — elicited the expected reaction from Republicans. The latest order extended the state’s mask mandate, which was set to expire Sept. 30, for an additional two months. An avalanche of GOP news releases and social media posts condemned Evers, a Democrat, calling the order ""illegal,"" ""unconstitutional,"" an ""overreach"" and a ""power grab."" Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester,  called it ""rule by fiat"" and said there would ""undoubtedly be additional court challenges"" — on top of the court challenges to previous orders. But one Wisconsin Democrat says Vos has no reason to wait on court challenges. ""Whenever you see a WI Republican bemoan the Governor's mask mandate, remember these 2 things,"" state Sen. Chris Larson of Milwaukee said Sept. 23, 2020 on Twitter. ""1) They have the power to overturn the order by joint resolution and they refuse to do it. 2) They sued to have control over our #COVID19 response months ago, and have done nothing."" We’re focusing on the first point. It’s an overlooked element of the partisan showdown over Wisconsin’s coronavirus response. And Larson is exactly right. Republicans could end Evers’ order any time, if they got a majority vote in the chambers they control. Let’s review what's going on. State law first gave the governor authority to declare a state of emergency in 1951, though that was related only to acts of war. The circumstances in which an emergency may be declared and the governor’s powers in that scenario have evolved since, including the addition of public health emergencies in 2002. The only prior public health emergency in state history came in 2009, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle issued Executive Order #280 in response to H1N1 (swine flu), according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau.  The section of statute Evers relied on for his three orders isn’t a long one, so here’s the whole thing. We’ve bolded the key element at the end: Declaration by governor. The governor may issue an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the state or any portion of the state if he or she determines that an emergency resulting from a disaster or the imminent threat of a disaster exists. If the governor determines that a public health emergency exists, he or she may issue an executive order declaring a state of emergency related to public health for the state or any portion of the state and may designate the department of health services as the lead state agency to respond to that emergency. If the governor determines that the emergency is related to computer or telecommunication systems, he or she may designate the department of administration as the lead agency to respond to that emergency. A state of emergency shall not exceed 60 days, unless the state of emergency is extended by joint resolution of the legislature. A copy of the executive order shall be filed with the secretary of state. The executive order may be revoked at the discretion of either the governor by executive order or the legislature by joint resolution. So, revoking the order is a pretty straightforward process. And one way to do it is a joint resolution approved by both houses. What’s more, unlike traditional legislation it is not subject to the governor’s veto — a simple majority is enough. Republicans hold a commanding majority in both houses. The advantage is 18-13 in the Senate and 63-34 in the Assembly (with two vacant seats in each chamber). Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said back in July that Senate Republicans had the votes and ""stand ready"" to overturn the first emergency declaration and mask mandate. That put the onus on Vos, who said in his Sept. 22, 2020, statement, ""No one branch of government can rule outside the letter of the law and go unchecked, even during a pandemic."" But Vos has not taken action to be that check. It’s unclear whether Assembly Republicans are fractured on the issue, or if other political considerations are at play — such as not wanting to put members on record with a vote in the midst of a volatile election year. A Vos spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. State Sen. Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, even issued a statement criticizing the inaction of Vos and others in his party, saying Vos ""has enabled the continuing illegal conduct of Governor Evers in issuing repeated emergency declarations and a failed statewide mask mandate.""  Larson said in a tweet that the Republicans who control the Legislature ""have the power to overturn the order by joint resolution and they refuse to do it."" That’s correct. Republicans have the majority in both houses and the power under state statute. Whatever the reason, they have not acted to end the governor’s state of emergency and accompanying mask mandate. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809757E140>],/factchecks/2020/sep/25/chris-larson/yes-republicans-could-end-evers-state-emergency-an/

Fact-checking Trump’s claim that Biden would ‘immediately’ eliminate fracking and mining in Pa.
","President Donald Trump warned supporters at a rally in Pittsburgh this week that if Joe Biden wins the presidency, the future of the natural gas and coal industries looks bleak.  Trump said Biden’s plan for net-zero emissions ""would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in Pennsylvania.""  Here’s what Trump said: ""Biden reiterated his pledge to require net-zero carbon emissions. That’s basically saying, do you know what that is? There’ll be no more oil, there’ll be no more gas, there’ll be no more nothing, there’ll be no more industry, there’ll be no more country. That’s what it’s saying really. And that would instantly shut down fracking and mining immediately in Pennsylvania, sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you.""  We wondered whether the president accurately characterized Biden’s net-zero emissions plan.  Trump is right that Biden wants to shift toward clean energy, but he’s got the timeline wrong. Biden wants the country to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels over the next 15 years, not right away like Trump said.  Net-zero emissions is what scientists and many world leaders agree is needed to stop climate change from spiraling out of control. The term describes the process of substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and then offsetting what can’t be eliminated through activities like forest restoration.  In July, Biden released a sweeping $2 trillion plan to tackle climate change that he said would set the United States on ""an irreversible path"" to net-zero emissions by 2050. Twenty countries and regions around the world have adopted similar targets.  To achieve that goal, Biden wants to create a pollution-free power sector by 2035; increase energy efficiency by upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes; and shift major cities toward public transportation.  The first plank in that plan, creating a pollution-free power sector by 2035, would require phasing out coal in western Pennsylvania over the next 15 years. The plan does not, however, call for ending hydraulic fracturing — the controversial drilling technique known as fracking — instantly, or at all.  We’ve examined Biden’s position on fracking several times now, so we know he hasn’t called for banning the practice.  He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land, but would allow existing fracking operations to continue. The Biden campaign has also noted previously that 90% of fracking today takes place on private land.  Biden’s position on fracking became muddled earlier this year when he misspoke during a March debate with Bernie Sanders, who was then his last opponent standing in the Democratic primary. Here’s an excerpt of their exchange: ""I’m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,"" Sanders said. ""I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet — no ifs, buts, and maybes about it."" ""So am I,"" Biden replied. ""Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that,"" Sanders said. ""No more — no new fracking,"" Biden said. Biden seemed to be saying he wanted to ban fracking — a sharp departure from his official position. And the former vice president’s opponents pounced. Republican operatives quickly cut a short video of Biden’s remarks to use as a cudgel in races against moderate House Democrats, the Washington Post reported.  The Biden campaign retracted his remarks the night of the debate, but that hasn’t stopped conservative media outlets or the Trump campaign from inaccurately claiming that Biden supports a total ban on fracking. Trump said Biden’s net-zero emissions plan would shut down the fracking and coal mining industries ""instantly"" and ""immediately."" Biden’s plan calls for a gradual transition to clean energy. We rate this statement False",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D96A40>],/factchecks/2020/sep/25/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-biden-would-immediately/
