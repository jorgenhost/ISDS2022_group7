George Will says all federal spending is ultimately ""discretionary""
","Members of Congress are actively working to cut the federal budget and bring down spending. But they’re steering clear of the politically difficult, big-ticket items such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt and national defense.

""It's not being debated because they say we're only going to debate discretionary spending. We should ban that word,"" said conservative commentator George F. Will on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

""It's all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid,"" Will said.

We thought Will’s statement was a provocative and interesting way to frame the debate. But was it true? We decided to check it out.

We’ll begin with a brief lesson on the terms Congress uses to describe the federal budget.

Discretionary spending means government spending that Congress sets every year through a process known as appropriations. It includes spending for most federal agencies, such as transportation and health. It includes foreign aid and defense spending. And it includes most grant programs administered by the federal government.

Non-discretionary spending, on the other hand, is spending that is controlled by legislation that sets eligibility criteria or spending formulas. It includes entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in which you are legally entitled to benefits as long as you meet certain criteria. It also typically includes programs for which individuals automatically qualify, such as farm subsidies or military benefits. Sometimes non-discretionary spending is called mandatory spending or direct spending.

We ran Will’s comments by four experts on the federal budget. They all said that Will was essentially correct, that non-discretionary spending can be changed at any time by passing new legislation that changes the particular program.

A recent example of this is the health care law supported by President Obama and Democrats in Congress. The law made many changes to Medicare, to reduce its spending, in order to offer subsidies for health care insurance to the uninsured.

""There is no constitutional roadblock to Congress changing any spending at any time. In that sense, all spending is discretionary,"" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The reasons members of Congress are now so focused on discretionary spending is because it’s more politically difficult to change programs that affect benefits for so many voters.

""But you can’t stabilize the debt by focusing on only 12 percent of the budget,"" Goldwein added. ""Trying to do so is going to make the cuts far more painful than what would be necessary if we were to look more broadly.""

Both Medicare and Social Security were on the table in previous years when the budget needed adjustment, said the experts we consulted on both sides of the political aisle. Jim Horney of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that ""every major deficit reduction plan in the last 20 years has made significant changes to Medicare."" Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation pointed out that Social Security was changed significantly in 1983 in a deal between Democrats in Congress and President Ronald Reagan.

Interest on the federal debt is a required payment unless the government is willing to default, a highly unlikely scenario. There are a few other contractually obligated payments the government has to make, typically for insurance programs such as mortgage insurance, flood insurance, and federal deposit insurance. But those payments are relatively small.

""I would add that even interest on the debt is in some way discretionary, because levels of debt can be changed by decisions to tax and spend and not run budget deficits,"" said Josh Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that wants to eliminate deficits.

Will said that federal spending is ""all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid."" Will is making a broad statement here and leaves out a few details. But he’s largely correct, and we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/15/george-will/george-will-says-all-federal-spending-ultimately-d/

Rep. Marcia Fudge says some of the largest corporations pay no taxes
","
Early this month, Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights appeared on C-SPAN’s ""Washington Journal,"" public affairs television program where viewers phoned in to ask her questions.

A caller who identified himself as James, an Akron small-business owner, discussed some of the tax write-offs he uses as a small businessman, and said larger businesses ""game the system"" by writing off things like parties, food and clothes.

Fudge agreed with him, calling for an overhaul of corporate tax policy, saying: ""There are corporations in this nation, some of the biggest corporations in this nation, who do not pay taxes.""

""It is not that they are cheating,"" Fudge continued. ""It is not that they are doing something wrong. We have given them tools.""

We thought examining Fudge’s tax claim would be worthwhile, since representatives of some of the nation’s biggest companies, such as Cincinnati’s Procter & Gamble, argue that Congress should be cutting business taxes.

In January testimony on behalf of the Business Roundtable, P&G CEO Robert A. McDonald told the House Ways and Means Committee that too-high corporate taxes are costing American jobs and making U.S. companies less competitive in the global marketplace.

Are some large U.S. businesses not paying taxes, as Fudge claims?

To back up her assertion, Fudge’s office cites media reports about particular companies – like General Electric and Bank of America -- that did not pay 2009 taxes as well as a July 2008 report from Congress’ Government Accountability Office that showed it’s relatively common for big companies to pay no taxes.

Between 1998 to 2005, GAO found that about 72 percent of large foreign controlled companies and 55 percent of large U.S. controlled companies reported zero tax liability for at least one year. About 57 percent of foreign controlled large companies and 42 percent of U.S. large companies paid no taxes in two or more years, and a third of the foreign companies and one quarter of their U.S. counterparts paid no taxes for at least four of those years. Just 45 percent of large U.S. companies and 28 percent of foreign companies reported a tax liability for each of the eight years. The report defined large companies as those with at least $250 million in assets, or at least $50 million in receipts

When GAO factored smaller companies into the mix, it found a higher overall proportion who didn’t pay taxes. Throughout the eight years the study examined, the overall percentage of non-tax-paying foreign and U.S. controlled companies never fell beneath 60 percent annually.
The report said that corporations may not pay U.S. income taxes for a variety of reasons, including current-year operating losses, tax credits, and multinational corporations shifting income to lower tax jurisdictions.

""Some corporations could have zero income before deducting expenses and others could have zero net income after deducting expenses, both of which could result in no tax liability,"" the report said.

After the GAO report was released, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Economist Martin Regalia released a statement that stressed the difference between companies not having a tax liability and shirking taxes that are owed.

""The GAO report doesn’t say that businesses aren’t paying taxes they owe,"" Regalia’s statement said. ""Rather, it says that some corporations did not have tax liabilities — in other words, they did not owe taxes. So how do corporations avoid having tax liabilities? They don’t make any profits. You can have many billions of dollars in revenue and still have R&D, labor-related and other expenses that are larger than your revenues — and therefore no ‘income’ to tax.

""In sum, the idea that there is a large pool of corporations not paying taxes that they legally owe is just incorrect,"" Regalia concluded.

The nation’s big business representatives don’t dispute the report’s findings, even as they stress it should not be misconstrued to mean businesses are evading taxes they owe. During her television appearance, Fudge stressed that the businesses who don’t pay taxes aren’t cheating or doing anything wrong.

Our research finds solid ground beneath her claim that some large U.S. companies don’t pay taxes. That’s why we rate her statement as True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/15/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-some-largest-corporations-pa/

Barack Obama says Gulf oil production hit record level in 2010
","
In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of higher prices at the pump.
   
""We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas, ""he said. ""Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn’t match up with reality,""

In this item, we’ll check the second bit of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn’t ""shut down"" oil production -- that ""oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high.""

As we did in our other fact-checks of the president’s press conference comments, we turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said ""oil production,"" we will only look at oil, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products, and since he said, ""federal waters,"" we will ignore production from state waters.

The agency’s data goes back to 1981. Here are the annual figures for Gulf production in barrels per day.

1981: 719,000
1982: 786,000
1983: 876,000
1984: 956,000
1985: 941,000
1986: 960,000
1987: 892,000
1988: 818,000
1989: 764,000
1990: 739,000
1991: 799,000
1992: 822,000
1993: 825,000
1994: 860,000
1995: 943,000
1996: 1,021,000
1997: 1,129,000
1998: 1,228,000
1999: 1,354,000
2000: 1,430,000
2001: 1,536,000
2002: 1,556,000
2003: 1,559,000
2004: 1,453,000
2005: 1,282,000
2006: 1,299,000
2007: 1,277,000
2008: 1,152,000
2009: 1,559,000
2010: 1,640,000 (estimate)

So the president is right -- 2010 was the highest ever. But some critics say that isn’t the whole story.

After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began in April  2010, the federal government allowed existing wells in the Gulf to continue production but imposed a moratorium on new drilling. While that moratorium has now been lifted, it slowed production, as output began to decrease at old wells and new ones were not on line yet to pick up the slack. Critics say the administration has slow-walked new applications -- a perception Obama challenged  at the press conference by arguing that his administration is simply demanding ""common-sense standards like proving that companies can actually contain an underwater spill.""

We won’t assess whether the permit approval rate is slower than it ought to be, but the oil-production numbers do tell a story.

In May 2010, production in the Gulf peaked and then continued to decline for the rest of the year. And the Energy Information Agency expects this decline to continue for at least two years more -- by about 240,000 barrels per day in 2011 and by an additional 200,000 barrels per day in 2012.

""Since there is a lag time from the time an exploration permit is approved to the time of actual production, and since only a handful of permits for new wells have been granted since April of 2010, it is likely that Gulf of Mexico production will continue to be hit hard in 2012 and beyond,"" wrote Kyle Isakower, the vice president of regulatory and economic policy at the American Petroleum Institute, in a recent blog post.

In an interview with PolitiFact, Isakower added that ""while the administration is correct"" in its statistics, EIA found that ""Gulf production peaked in May of 2010, due in large part to permits awarded three or more years earlier, and has been decreasing ever since. This matters because markets don’t look backward, they look forward.""

We think that’s a fair point. Obama is indeed correct about the record-high levels of Gulf oil production in 2010. However, he ignores a downward trend that began in 2010 and that is projected to fall further over at least the next two years. We think it’s problematic to use the record-setting statistic to buttress the notion that Gulf oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate Obama’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-gulf-oil-production-hit-record-l/

Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003
","

""We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas,"" he said. ""Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn’t match up with reality,""

In this item, we’ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn’t ""shut down"" oil production -- that ""last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.""
   
We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said ""oil production,"" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.
   
Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:
   
2003: 2,073,453,000
2004: 1,983,302,000
2005: 1,890,106,000
2006: 1,862,259,000
2007: 1,848,450,000
2008: 1,811,817,000
2009: 1,956,596,000
2010: 2,011,856,000
   
So, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we’ll note a couple of caveats.
   
First, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.
   
The second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.
   
Domestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.
   
So Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we’re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline.

The RNC said unions raised $400 million for Obama in 2008
","
An ad from the Republican National Committee says that unions that supported President Barack Obama should stop fighting a budget deal in Wisconsin.

""Obama and the union bosses are standing in the way of economic reform,"" the ad says, adding ""Stop Obama and his union bosses today.""

Onscreen, the ad shows the words, ""2008: Unions Spent $400 Million to Elect Obama.""

There’s no doubt that unions strongly supported Obama over Republican John McCain in the last election. But was it to the tune of $400 million? We decided to check it out.

The ad cited Politico and the Wall Street Journal as its sources, so that’s where we went first. Both reported in March 2008 that liberal groups said they hoped to raise $400 million to spend in 2008. About $300 million would come from unions, and the rest from non-union advocacy groups, including MoveOn.org, ACORN and Emily’s List.

So the part attributed to unions was $300 million, not $400 million. We also noticed that both the Wall Street Journal and Politico repeated the number in other news stories without attributing the information to a specific source. So we started looking around for evidence of whether the unions had succeeded at raising the hundreds of millions they said they would in March 2008. Keep in mind, the most detailed reports mentioned the number as a goal, not an amount that had already been raised.

Our attempts at independent confirmation were difficult, because unions do not have to report all of their campaign spending to the Federal Election Commission, according to independent campaign finance experts. The unions do have to report direct contributions to candidates and parties and some of their independent expenditures. But they do not have to report internal communications to membership, and they don’t have to report get-out-the-vote efforts, even if the efforts are focused on heavily Democratic areas.

We contacted the staff at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks campaign spending. They told us that it would be impossible to account for all union spending during the 2008 cycle; the law doesn’t require that level of disclosure.

But in the data required to be reported, the center found $75 million in direct contributions from unions and union members to candidates and parties, of which over $68 million went to Democrats. It also found $86 million in outside spending by labor in the 2008 cycle, which largely benefited Democrats. It also identified an additional $52.7 million in spending from labor groups  in 527 organizations, tax exempt organizations that seek to influence elections. Add it up, and you get $206.7 million.

The $400 million discussed in March might have been aspirational and not actually achieved, said Eric S. Heberlig, a political scientist who studies the labor movement at the University of  North Carolina Charlotte. ""The pressure to empty their coffers to help Obama out was less when they saw he was easily able to raise that amount of money elsewhere,"" he said.

Indeed, Obama raised an unprecedented amount of cash on his own. Public disclosures showed he raised $745 million, compared with John McCain’s $368 million.

The RNC said the unions ""spent $400 million to elect Obama."" We do want to acknowledge that independent publications have reported that number to be the case. But when we looked into the sources for that number, we found that it was the unions themselves discussing what they hoped to raise in the 2008 election. Furthermore, the reports said they wanted to raise $300 million, not $400 million, and it was a goal, not something they had yet achieved. When we looked at the public disclosures after the election, we found the unions reported $206.7 million in spending for all Democrats. It's clear that the unions raised additional money for get-out-the-vote activities, but we don't know how much more -- nor does the RNC. Finally, all that money went to support Obama and other Democrats, not just Obama alone. In short, we don't see the evidence to support that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama. So we rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2011/mar/15/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-said-unions-raised-400-million-obama-2008/

President Obama says that for the first time in more than a decade, oil imports accounted for less than half of what the U.S. consumed
","
As gas prices once again climb, President Obama took some time during a press conference on March 11, 2011, to defend his energy policy.

Despite a temporary ban on new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico following the massive Deepwater Horizon spill last summer, Obama said, ""we’re producing more oil, and we’re importing less.""

""For the first time in more than a decade,"" Obama said, ""imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed.""

In a separate item, we took a look at Obama's claim about the production side of the equation, specifically that, ""Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.""
In this item, we'll focus on imports, and whether, as Obama said, that for the first time in over a decade, ""imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed.""

We turned first to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics.

There are two main ways to measure this statistic, and we'll begin with the way that supports Obama's comment.

The EIA uses a ""net imports"" figure to measure U.S. dependence on foreign oil. This figure compares the amount of oil produced in the U.S. with the amount of oil consumed in the U.S. Using that measure, the U.S. produced an amount equal to 50.7 percent of what it consumed. Using the same measure, imports fell to 49.3 percent of what the U.S. consumed in 2010 (as a yearly average); down from 51.5 percent in 2009.

The net import percentage hasn't been that low since 1997, when it was 49.3 percent. It peaked in 2005 at 60.3 percent and has steadily decreased every year since.

So by that measure, Obama's figures are correct.

But the fact is that the U.S. doesn't use all of the oil it produces. Some of it is exported. Ultimately, the oil goes where suppliers can make the most profit on it, EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan said.

Looking strictly at the petroleum consumed by the U.S. last year, 61.2 percent of it was imported, according to EIA data. That percentage has been declining for years, but it is nonetheless much higher than the ""less than half"" figure cited by Obama.

Incidentally, many may find the sources of imported oil surprising. Slightly over half comes from the Western Hemisphere. The largest share of imports came from Canada (23 percent);  followed by Venezuela (11 percent), Saudi Arabia, (10 percent), Mexico (9 percent) and Nigeria (8.3 percent). In 2009, 17 percent of the U.S.'s oil imports came from the Persian Gulf.

But again, Obama's statistic depends on the way you calculate it. By a mainstream measure of ""dependence on foreign oil,"" the U.S. produced domestically a quantity of petroleum that was slightly more than half the amount it consumed. But strictly speaking, imports made up 61 percent of the oil actually consumed in the U.S. last year. And so we rate Obama's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/15/barack-obama/president-obama-says-first-time-more-decade-oil-im/

Crossroads GPS says unionized government workers are paid 42 percent more than non-union workers
","
Republicans fighting the opinion battle over their push to weaken government unions often have sought to contrast the compensation of public-sector workers with that of America’s private workforce.

Now they are spotlighting public vs. public.

As in unionized government workers vs. non-union ones.

In a $750,000 national cable TV ad blitz, Crossroads GPS, a conservative issues advocacy group affiliated with Republican strategist Karl Rove, portrays government unions as self-serving bullies collecting mandatory dues to influence liberals such as President Barack Obama.

Against a backdrop of newspaper headlines on the Wisconsin fight over union rights, the 60-second ad asks why Democrats are ""shutting down state capitols"" with protests.

The ad’s answer: ""to protect a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers.""

That’s an eye-popping number.

As the intense protests continue over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s successful push to limit collective bargaining in the public sector, we decided to check it out.

For support for the number, Crossroads GPS spokesman Jonathan Collegio cited a Cato Institute bulletin from March 2010. The bulletin from Cato, a libertarian think tank, explicitly calls on states to ban collective bargaining in the public sector.

""Collective bargaining is a misguided labor policy because it violates civil liberties and gives unions excessive power to block needed reforms,"" Chris Edwards, the institute’s director of tax policy studies, wrote in the bulletin.

That quote leaves no doubt about where Edwards is coming from.

Let’s turn to some of his numbers.

He presents 2009 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and concludes that ""unionized public sector workers have much higher average wages and benefits than non-unionized public sector workers.""

Specifically, Edwards wrote that union members have a 31 percent advantage in wages and a 68 percent advantage in benefits.

An accompanying table of statistics combines the wage and benefits advantage into one number: total compensation.

Total compensation is 42 percent higher for the union workers, Edwards concluded.

The same figure -- 42 percent -- is cited in the Crossroads ad.

Case closed?

Not exactly. As Collegio, the spokesman for the group, notes, the ad pulls a hard number directly from the study. But there are some problems.

First, the ad says the system ""pays"" union workers a 42 percent premium. It makes no mention of benefits, even though the Cato report combines the two to get the 42 percent gap.

That confuses the comparison right from the start.

That point -- ""pay"" vs. ""total compensation"" -- didn’t bother Edwards.

But the use of the 42 percent number did.

It troubles us, too.

Edwards says the number  is taken out of context and the more accurate total compensation gap is lower, perhaps by a considerable amount.

Let’s home in on part of the equation, wages. The study showed a 31 percent gap favoring union members by that measure. But that number, based on raw government data, has not been adjusted to make the comparison across states more valid.

Edwards noted the study concludes that part of the union-nonunion gap stems from general labor market variations across states.

""States with generally higher wages tend to be more unionized,"" the study says. ""Analyses that hold constant such cross-state differences find that public-sector unions increase average pay levels by roughly 10 percent.""

That’s a far cry from 31 percent.

And the 31 percent was critical in arriving at the 42 percent.

How far off is the 42 percent figure?

Edwards said it’s impossible to say. While wages have been studied effectively, he said, studies on benefits are rare, partly because benefits vary so much from place to place.

We found another study by a libertarian think tank that supports Edwards’ contention that a much lower wage number is more accurate.

The Freedom Foundation, based in Washington state, published a study in 2010 that put the gap at 11 percent to 12 percent for state and local government workers, union vs. non-union. Freedom Foundation, which supports Walker’s union move in a petition drive on its website, compared comparable employees, and controlled for state effects, demographics, experience, education, marital status and occupation.

Meanwhile, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers found an even smaller wage gap of about 5 percent.

Economists Keith Bender and John Heywood collaborated on an April 2010 study on compensation. Bender, a public sector labor expert, told us that a large body of research has put the figure around 5 percent.

So, whatever the true figure, it would substantially reduce the 42 percent used in the ad.

Let’s take a final look at a related point.

Edwards also took issue with wording in the ad that might lead some viewers to think that the ad is comparing government workers to private employees -- not public union workers with public non-union workers.

Let’s take a look back at the ad’s language (italics added): ""a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers.""

Would some readers or listeners think Edwards is comparing public to private because the ad fails to modify that second ""workers"" with the prefix ""government?""

We suppose they could -- and critics have said it could be a tactic to pit private workers against government workers. But the entire context of the ad is public sector.

Let’s review.

Crossroads GPS, a conservative group seeking to illustrate the cost of public sector unions says unionized government workers are paid 42 percent more than non-union workers. The study it cites for backup does contain that figure, but the number is misleading because it is not adjusted for important differences between states. Even the author of the study makes this point.

There is a gap of some size. So, the ad contains an element of truth in highlighting a pay gap, but uses an inflated number. That rates a Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/15/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-unionized-government-workers-a/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal says HOPE overhaul still good for students
","
Gov. Nathan Deal made an interesting claim during a defense of his plan to overhaul the popular HOPE college scholarship program.

""Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college,"" Deal said in a recent radio interview.

We wondered about that, particularly as the governor is expected to sign a bill Tuesday that will make significant changes to HOPE in an effort to keep the scholarship program on solid financial footing. The program is funded through Georgia Lottery proceeds, and revenue is flat. The state spent nearly $150 million out of $1 billion reserves to cover HOPE in the 2010 fiscal year, and if no changes are made, it will need to spend more than $500 million from reserves for this fiscal year and next, according to a recent article by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Laura Diamond.

Georgia Senate Democrats proposed an alternative plan that would give a full scholarship to high-achieving students whose families earn up to $140,000 a year. That plan would increase deposits to education programs by 2 percent. Democrats argued the GOP’s HOPE proposal would be unfair to poor and rural students. The Republican-led Senate voted against the alternative plan.

""HOPE will be the richest program because the HOPE scholarship will only be available for the richest people,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Brown of Macon said in a statement. ""These changes will help the students who need HOPE the least and hurt the students who need it the most.""

Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said with the changes in the plan the governor supports, Georgia would have a projected $507 million for HOPE scholarships and grants and $54 million for private college awards during the next school year.

For the past 40 years, the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs has kept track of how much money each state awards in post-secondary education scholarships and grants. The association is made up of state college funding officials from all 50 states. Other organizations, such as the College Board, the post-secondary educational program that administers the SAT exam, suggested we reach out to NASSGAP to get the best data on this subject.

Georgia awarded nearly $567 million in total grant aid during the 2008-09 school year, ranking fourth in the nation behind California, New York and Florida, according to the association. Divide that total by the number of students enrolled in undergraduate programs, and Georgia ranked only behind South Carolina, the most recent report found. Georgia handed out an estimated average of $1,712 to each undergraduate student. South Carolina awarded $1,916 per student.

California, Florida and New York have far more undergraduate students than Georgia, while South Carolina had only half the number of students that Georgia had in undergraduate programs. California awarded $537 per undergraduate student. Florida and New York awarded $924 and $1,015, respectively, per undergraduate student.

Frank Ballmann, the federal liaison for NASSGAP, said many states are facing the same sorts of financial challenges that Deal and many state leaders say necessitates the funding changes to HOPE. But even with those changes to HOPE, Ballmann believes Georgia will remain one of the leaders nationally in terms of the amount of money per student it gives out for scholarships and grants.

""Generally speaking, Georgia is still doing very well,"" Ballmann said. ""I think even with the cuts Georgia is going to be in the top five. Depending on what the other states do, Georgia may remain No. 2.""

The numbers here seem clear on this one. Georgia is one of the top five states in terms of awarding grants and scholarships. NASSGAP’s Ballmann believes that won’t change. Being in the top five certainly qualifies it as ""one of the richest,"" as the governor said. We rate Deal’s claim as True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/15/nathan-deal/deal-says-hope-revamp-still-good-students/

Gun lobbyist says doctors play politics with gun question
","
One of the more intriguing subplots so far during the 2011 Florida legislative session has been a fight between two powerful Tallahassee special interests -- the gun lobby and doctors.

The bills at issue are SB 432 and its companion HB 155. The measures, being pushed by gun interests, would prohibit doctors from asking their patients, or their patients' families, if they keep a gun at home. An original version of the bill made it a felony punishable with up to a $5 million fine for asking whether a patient owned a firearm. An amended version lowered the penalty to a non-criminal violation with a $500 fine (which could grow if the doctor willfully broke the law or was a repeat offender).

The American Academy of Pediatrics currently encourages physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offers advice to avoid preventable accidents. The long list of recommendations includes mainly innocuous tips like ""Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children,"" and ""NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag."" But physicians also are told to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play.

Previously, we've looked into a claim by state Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, that part of the reasoning behind the bill he sponsored is to keep gun ownership information from being recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law. We rated that claim False, noting that the federal health care law specifically prohibits doctors and insurance companies from collecting gun information.

Marion Hammer, a longtime lobbyist for the Unified Sportsmen of Florida and a former president of the National Rifle Association, offered another reason to support the gun legislation. Doctors are playing politics in the exam room by asking a question they don't need to know the answer to.

""Doctors are pushing gun-ban politics on their patients,"" Hammer told a Senate committee on Feb. 22, 2011. Hammer made similar comments to a House committee on March 8, as well as in this e-mail to gun-rights supporters. ""They have been pushing a gun-ban agenda and have been bringing their gun-ban politics into examining rooms.

""The American Academy of Pediatrics supports banning guns,"" she said. ""It's blatant, and it's there on their website. All you have to do is log on and see it.""

So log on to the academy's website we did, at www.aap.org.

Sure enough, we quickly found a long list of policy statements, including a policy paper called ""Firearm-Related Injuries Affecting the Pediatric Population."" The academy says its policy on firearm-related injuries was first set in 1992 and reaffirmed in 2004.

The policy paper says that in 1997, 32,436 firearm-related deaths occurred in the United States, and 4,223 of the victims were children and teenagers under 20. The paper also says that in 1997, 306 children and teens under 20 were killed by firearms as a result of unintentional firearm-related injuries.

The academy then makes several recommendations to reduce firearm-related injuries.

The first recommendation is that ""the most effective measure to prevent firearm-related injuries to children and adolescents is the absence of guns from homes and communities,"" the academy writes. ""Firearm regulation, to include bans of handguns and assault weapons, is the most effective way to reduce firearm-related injuries.""

Other recommendations include urging pediatricians to inform parents about the danger of guns, advocating for trigger locks and other safety mechanisms, and supporting the development of nonviolent, gun-free television programs and video games.

The policy paper clearly supports banning handguns and assault weapons, but it does not explicitly advocate a complete ban on guns, which likely would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It addresses legal concerns by saying the federal government could ban ""whole categories of firearms.""

The academy notably also supported Chicago's handgun ban in a case that came before the U.S. Supreme Court. ""The best way to truly protect children from firearm injuries is to get guns out of their homes, their neighborhoods and where they play,"" said AAP President Judith S. Palfrey. ""If we don't, too many children will continue to be hurt or die needlessly.""

And Hammer pointed us toward another position statement that she said had been on a second AAP website, www.healthychildren.org. ""The most effective way to prevent firearm-related injury to children is to keep guns out of homes and communities. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports gun-control legislation. We believe that handguns, deadly air guns and assault weapons should be banned.""

That statement appears to have been replaced on the website. The statement on ""where we stand"" now reads: ""The safest home for a child is a home without a gun. However, if a gun is present in the home of a child, the gun should be stored unloaded and locked, with the ammunition locked separately, so that a child cannot access the gun.""

Interestingly, some gun-control groups have realized the use of the word ""ban"" is a red flag and have tried to avoid it. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, says it is not a ""gun-ban"" organization and that ""a safer America can be achieved without banning guns."" Brady does say certain types of guns, such as military-style assault weapons like Uzis and AK-47s, should be ""out of bounds for private ownership.""

Debbie Linchesky, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, referred comment on the issue to Louis St. Petery, a Leon County pediatrician and member of the academy's Florida chapter.

St. Petery said Hammer is distorting the position of doctors.

""It's certainly a mischaracterization of where we are on things,"" St. Petery said. ""Forty percent of folks in this country own guns. We (my family) own a gun.

""It's not that we feel that guns need to be eliminated from the face of the Earth, which is what Ms. Hammer would suggest,"" he said.

St. Petery said doctors aren't pushing a political agenda; rather, they're trying to keep children safe. If doctors know someone owns a pool, they want to use their limited time with a patient discussing pool safety. If doctors know someone owns a gun, they want to discuss gun safety, he said.

""We are trying to do the best job we can to protect children,"" St. Petery said. ""We feel that's our job, prevention is what it's about.""

That brings us back to Hammer's claim. In making her case to support a bill that would make it illegal for doctors to ask patients about guns, Hammer says doctors -- particularly pediatricians -- are bringing politics into the exam rooms. We cannot make a judgment on that, but we can assess her claim that the American Academy of Pediatrics ""supports banning guns.""

We found no evidence that the academy supports an outright ban on all guns. But the academy does say that ""firearm regulation, to include bans of handguns and assault weapons, is the most effective way to reduce firearm-related injuries."" It also voiced support for Chicago's handgun-ban law. We think Hammer could have been slightly more clear in making her case to the Legislature. We rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/14/marion-hammer/gun-lobbyist-says-doctors-play-politics-gun-questi/

Ohio coal industry says Obama promised to bankrupt coal-fired power plant builders
","It’s 2008 all over again, based on a claim that recently surfaced from Ohio’s coal industry. That was the year Barack Obama won the presidency. Ten months earlier, the candidate -- a Democratic senator from Illinois who was campaigning for the presidential nomination -- did a wide-ranging, videotaped interview with the San Francisco Chronicle’s editorial board that included his prescription for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Before the campaign would end, his political opponents, including Sarah Palin, discovered the interview on the newspaper’s website and tried to use it against Obama in coal-rich states like Ohio. Maybe you’ve forgotten about it. The coal industry, in a long battle against proposals to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing coal use, has not.

Mike Carey, president of the Ohio Coal Association, brought up Obama’s statement anew when he testified March 1 to a House subcommittee on energy and power, in advance of a proposed House Republican bill that would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

""We absolutely must oppose the new effort by the Obama administration to eliminate coal through the new proposed plant emissions and greenhouse gas regulations,"" Carey said. ""In 2008, President Obama said, ‘If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that’s being emitted.’ ""

Later in his testimony, Carey added, ""Remember what President Obama promised; they will bankrupt anyone who plans to build a coal facility.""

Did Obama really promise that?

It’s a question that matters in states that employ coal miners and rely on coal-fired electricity, especially as the U.S. EPA under Obama prepares to restrict carbon emissions.

During a break in the House hearing, we asked Carey for his source for the quote. Then we
went back to the original San Francisco Chronicle interview in its entirety, transcribed the parts in which Obama discussed coal, and examined the context of Obama’s remarks.

Obama at the time had proposed an aggressive plan to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by attaching a price for emissions. The allowable level of emissions would ratchet down yearly, Obama said, with money raised from this system getting invested in cleaner technologies. This would not only create incentives for reducing carbon emissions, he said, but it would also expand the use of wind and solar power, bio-fuels and, potentially, ""clean coal,"" in which carbon emissions could be captured and sequestered in a way that might do no harm. Such clean coal research is ongoing, with vigorous debate as to whether it will someday be applied on a commercial scale.

Obama made clear in the interview that he was not suggesting an end to coal use. Too much of the country already uses it in existing power plants and factories. In a portion of the interview his critics failed to note, he said:

""This notion of no coal, I think, is an illusion, because the fact of the matter is that right now, we are getting a lot of our energy from coal, and China is building a coal-fired plant once a week. So what we have to do then is we have to figure out how can we use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon.  And how can we sequester that carbon and capture it? If we can't, then we're going to still be working on alternatives.""

But Obama also made clear that he wanted to transition away from building new coal-fired plants, saying that the price on emissions for building one -- using old technology -- would be prohibitive under his plan.

Carey said in his testimony that the Obama administration ""promised"" a ""war on coal,"" which is a claim we believe goes too far. The Obama administration has unquestionably angered the coal industry with rules or proposals affecting air quality standards, coal ash, renewable energy and the issuance of permits needed for coal mining -- all mentioned by Carey in his testimony. But Obama never declared war, and environmentalists and many others have a very different take on this so-called assault.

Yet Obama said exactly what Carey quoted him as saying on a point that is especially current, considering the EPA’s new rules, announced this year. To repeat the then-candidate’s statement: ""If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that's being emitted.""

Why, then, aren’t we rating Carey’s claim True?

Two reasons: ""President Obama"" did not make the statement. Obama the U.S. senator and candidate for president did. And that leads to the second reason.

Carey suggests that Obama is carrying out the threat he made in 2008, but the new rules from the EPA are different from the cap-and-trade proposal Obama had in 2008. Candidate Obama’s methods were to be more aggressive. In fact, the EPA has shown some flexibility, agreeing to phase in carbon restrictions on new or expanded plants based on their size. The agency also announced on the same day as Carey testified that it will delay its deadlines for businesses that must report their emissions.

Carey quoted Obama accurately but not fully, and the regulations and methods that Obama’s EPA wants -- backed by a U.S. Supreme Court decision saying the agency has to regulate greenhouse gas emissions -- are not the same as the candidate proposed.

The quote is right, but given the need for clarification or additional information, we rate Carey’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/14/ohio-coal-association/ohio-coal-industry-says-obama-promised-bankrupt-co/

Fred Upton says pending bill to block EPA curbs of greenhouse gases will 'stop rising gas prices'
","
To hear Reps. Fred Upton and Ed Whitfield talk about their new energy bill, you'd think it will prevent gas prices from increasing before your next fill-up.

Upton, the Michigan Republican who chairs the influential Energy and Commerce Committee, and Ed Whitfield, the Kentucky Republican who heads the Energy and Power subcommittee, recently argued in a letter to fellow lawmakers that one way to stop rising gas prices would be to pass the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011 (H.R. 910).

The bill grows out of longstanding frustration by industry groups and lawmakers who believe that Environmental Protection Agency regulations unnecessarily burden many companies.

The measure -- which Whitfield’s subcommittee approved on March 10, 2011, and which now heads to the full committee -- would prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases for the purpose of addressing climate change.

Here’s a portion of what Upton and Whitfield wrote to their colleagues in the March 8, 2011, letter, which is headlined, ""Concerned About High Gas Prices? Cosponsor H.R. 910 and Make a Difference Today!""

""Whether through greenhouse gas regulation, permit delays, or permanent moratoriums, the White House takes every opportunity to decrease access to safe and secure sources of oil and natural gas,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""Gasoline prices have climbed dramatically over the past three months. American consumers deal with this hardship every day, and as this poll indicates, the majority of respondents do not see the pain subsiding anytime soon.  Americans also understand the realities of supply and demand as it relates to oil prices. Unfortunately the White House does not. ...

""H.R. 910, the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, is the first in this legislative series to stop rising gas prices by halting EPA’s Clean Air Act greenhouse gas regulations. As one small refiner testifying before the Committee on Energy and Commerce put it: ‘EPA’s proposed [greenhouse gas] regulations for both refinery expansions and existing facilities will likely have a devastating effect on … all of our nation’s fuels producers….  If small refiners are forced out of business, competition will suffer and American motorists, truckers and farmers will be increasingly reliant on foreign refiners to supply our nation’s gasoline and diesel fuel.’

""We … have taken the first steps in attempting to restrain this regulatory overreach that will restrict oil supplies and cause gasoline prices to rise.""

But can the bill really stop gas prices from going up, as the letter says?

We’ll look at two key questions. Could the proposed EPA regulations on oil refineries actually increase prices at the pump? And when would the impact of the regulations be felt?

As to the first question, experts had different opinions.

The oil industry argues that regulations imposing new costs on refiners could force U.S. refineries to charge more. (The proposed regulations are supposed to shield smaller operations from regulatory impacts, but experts said that a significant proportion of U.S. refineries would indeed be affected.)

""It’s Economics 101,"" said John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute. ""The refinery business is a very low-margin business. They have no margin for error and face tough competition internationally.""

Others argue the refining industry could adapt to new regulations.

""Looking at past public claims when the Clean Air Act was passed would show that U.S. refining capacity still managed to increase over time, despite the high expense refiners had to put out to comply with the Clean Air act,"" said Amy Myers Jaffe, a fellow in energy studies at Rice University.

""So one might imagine, depending on the details on how carbon regulation would be implemented, U.S. industry could likely similarly adjust,"" Jaffe said. ""It depends on the specifics of how a policy is implemented. There are no doubt some small refineries in the United States that might be really inefficient, so maybe some of them would close if they had to increase their costs substantially, but tiny, uncompetitive, regional refineries are not the main thing that makes the US refining and marketing industry ‘competitive.’""

Indeed, while a shift to overseas refiners could have negative consequences for the nation -- it could weaken the United States’ industrial base, threaten U.S. jobs and pose problems for national security -- it’s not a foregone conclusion that prices at the pump would rise. If U.S. refiners become less competitive and more oil is instead imported from overseas refiners, it will be because the cost of refining overseas becomes more competitive. That’s the essence of a free market.

And even if the cost of refining did go up, the cost of gasoline is volatile and affected by many factors such as global demand and supply disruptions. So there's no certainty that a bump in refining costs would necessarily translate into higher prices at the pump.

As for the second question -- when any impact might be felt -- the rules wouldn't take affect for months or years.

The EPA won't even propose the first-ever greenhouse-gas standards for refineries until December 2011 and doesn't plan to issue final standards until November 2012. Those standards would govern emissions for new and significantly overhauled refineries. Rules for existing refineries are expected to be unveiled in July 2011.

Based on the past history of EPA regulations, the new rules aren't likely to take effect until a few years after that, experts said.

So, if the bill were to pass, it would prevent EPA regulations that would otherwise take effect in 2013, 2014 or 2015. That’s a long way away.

Another factor: the regulations targeted by the House bill are new ones. So if the House bill passes, it would essentially protect the status quo -- not take any explicit action to stop price hikes.

So where does this leave us?

While Upton and Whitfield's letter is carefully worded, it frames the argument for the bill in the context of today’s trend of rising gasoline prices. Yet the impact of the bill -- if there is an one -- would be years away. And there's no proof that the law would actually stop gas prices from rising. The added regulations now being planned may hamper U.S. refiners, but the international free market could just as easily end up keeping refining costs low. And it’s hardly assured that any changes in refining costs -- up or down -- will influence gasoline prices, which are subject to a wide array of influenes. We find their claim False.",/factchecks/2011/mar/14/fred-upton/fred-upton-says-pending-bill-block-epa-curbs-green/

Sen. Bernie Sanders says Americans now work the longest hours of any people around the world
","
It was Friday, and frankly, it had been a long week. So when a Twitter follower asked us to check a claim from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, that Americans work longer hours than any other people in the world, we were inclined to agree.

But as a March 10, 2011, column from the New York Times' David Brooks so eloquently pointed out, Americans often perceive themselves as better than they are.

So we thought we'd better check.

Sanders made his comment on C-SPAN's Washington Journal program on March 8, 2011, in response to a caller who said federal programs like welfare have taken away Americans' incentive to work. Sanders responded that while there are certainly people out there who exploit the system, ""I think the number of those people is much overrated.""

""We are the hardest working people in the world,"" Sanders said. ""A few years ago, we had the dubious distinction, I think, of surpassing the Japanese in terms of the number of hours our people worked. We now work the longest hours of any people around the world.""

We asked Sanders' office for backup and they forwarded us a press release from the International Labour Organization, a London-based United Nations agency that oversees international labor standards. The release ran under the headline, ""Americans work longest hours among industrialized countries, Japanese second longest.""

According to the story, ""US workers put in the longest hours on the job in industrialized nations, clocking up nearly 2,000 hours per capita in 1997, the equivalent of almost two working weeks more than their counterparts in Japan where annual hours worked have been gradually declining since 1980, according to a new statistical study of global labour trends published by the International Labour Office.""

This fact-check seemed like a slam dunk until we checked out the date of the press release: Sept. 6, 1999. And it was based on 1997 data.

We contacted the International Labour Office for more recent statistics. They provided a spreadsheet of the latest available data, from 2008, which shows the U.S ranked eighth (out of 28) when it comes to the annual number of hours actually worked per person.

Who worked longer?

Topping the list was Greece, where people logged an average of 2,120 hours. Also working longer hours: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Mexico, Iceland and Italy.

The U.S., where people worked an average of 1,792 hours, did nudge out Japan, where people worked an average of 1771 hours. That has been consistently true for more than a decade.

We also checked with the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, which tracks these kinds of statistics as well. Their report showed a nearly identical number of hours worked by Americans in 2008,  1,796. But in the OECD report, which tracked more countries, the U.S. ranked 12th (out of 35). In addition to the ILO list of countries working more hours, the OECD listed Korea, the Russian Federation, Estonia and Israel.

According to the OECD report, Americans worked about 32 more hours a year than the average for all OECD countries.

And they worked slightly longer than workers in Japan.

A spokesman in Sanders' office stressed the fact that Sanders was correct about the U.S. surpassing Japan in the number of hours worked. And Sanders is correct about that. But we were more interested in the idea that Americans now work longer hours than any other people in the world.

The data shows Americans work longer hours than the average for industrialized nations. But the number of hours worked by Americans has been gradually declining (though only slightly) over the last decade. And according to the ILO, we no longer work the longest hours. In fact, that hasn't been true for over a decade. And according to OECD statistics, the U.S. hasn't even cracked the Top 10 in over a decade.

There's another caveat. The lists don't include most developing nations.

According to a 2003 ILO report, ""In all developing Asian economies where data were available, people historically worked more than in industrialized economies. This is a typical sign for developing economies as they often compensate for the lack of technology and capital with people working longer hours.""

In other words, in addition to those countries listed earlier, there are many more developing countries where people work more hours than Americans.

Sanders said ""We now work the longest hours of any people around the world."" That may have been true when compared to other industrialized nations in 1997. But it's not true now, and it's not true when you consider any country, as Sanders said. We rule his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/mar/14/bernie-sanders/sen-bernie-sanders-says-americans-now-work-longest/

Explaining the graduation gap between African-American and white males
","
One of the attacks against SB 736 -- the controversial teacher tenure and merit pay proposal that passed the state Senate on March 10, 2011 -- is that the bill is attempting to make sweeping changes to an education system that doesn't need it.

Florida's education system, after all, was just ranked fifth in the nation by Education Week.

But state Sen. Stephen Wise, R-Jacksonville, SB 736's prime sponsor, said the ranking shouldn't stop the state from pursuing major education reforms.

""We're doing a great job. Yeah, we're fifth in the country,"" Wise said in passionate comments on the Senate floor shortly before the bill passed 26-12. ""We're doing a great job. We've got great graduation rates.

""That's if you get there,"" he said. ""The dirty little secret we don't talk about is, where are the black boys? It's awful, it's absolutely pathetic what the graduation rate is for African-American boys. ... We have seven of the 10 worst school districts in America on graduation of black boys. We've kept it a secret.""

PolitiFact Florida wanted to pull back the curtain on Wise's claim.

Wise told us the figure came from a 2010 report released by the Massachusetts-based Schott Foundation for Public Education. The report attempted to calculate the percentage at which African-American males are graduating high school compared to other students. The foundation examined 2007-08 data from 59 large school districts across the country with African-American student populations of at least 10,000. 
Michael Holzman, a research consultant for the Schott Foundation, told the St. Petersburg Times he simply divided the number of standard diplomas awarded in 2008 by the number of students who entered high school four years earlier. The calculation does not include people who obtained a GED. 
The Schott Foundation then compared the performance of black males to white males.

Nationwide, 47 percent of black males graduated high school compared with 78 percent of white males.

In Florida just 37 percent of black males graduated compared with 57 percent of white males.

Going district-by-district, Florida results appeared even worse, the Schott Foundation found.

The three lowest African-American graduation rates among the 59 districts examined were all in Florida -- Pinellas County graduated 21 percent of its African-American students, Palm Beach County 22 percent and Duval County 23 percent.

A fourth Florida district, Miami-Dade, had the seventh-lowest graduation rate, according to the Schott analysis.

The other low-performing districts are from outside Florida -- Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Charleston County in South Carolina and Jefferson Parish in Louisiana.

That's four out of 10, more than any other state, but not the seven of 10 Wise claimed on the Senate floor.

For the record, Pinellas officials criticized the Schott report, saying that the formula it used was oversimplified, and, among other shortcomings, did not account for students who transferred away from the district. Pinellas school officials said the rate for black male graduations was 47.3 percent in 2008 and rose to 57.5 percent in 2009 after also including students who move into GED or adult education courses.

That's an additional caveat to Wise's claim that Florida is home to seven of the 10 worst school districts in America when it comes to graduation rates for African-American males.

In judging his statement, however, let's remember the context. Wise was attempting to show that problems remain with Florida's public education system by highlighting the poor track record some Florida school districts have when it comes to graduating African-American males. He said specifically that seven of the 10 worst school districts are in Florida. It turns out he got the number wrong, and some districts have criticized the specific study and its findings.

But the Schott study, at the least, is an apples-to-apples comparison of school district performance. Maybe Pinellas' graduation rate number should be higher. But in that case, so should Cleveland's. And so on. 
""'No matter what it is, it's terrible,"" Wise said.

Wise's number is a bit shaky, but we're giving him credit for his point. To us, that rates Half True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/14/steve-wise/explaining-graduation-gap-between-african-american/

This comparison differs from most, though. Reilly refers to an actual statement from Hitler that deportations in the 1930s were part of a ""military operation."" For this fact-check, we looked back at the policies of Germany’s Third Reich, and specifically whether Hitler or his inner circle had publicly characterized forced deportations in the 1930s as a military operation. Nazi Germany’s anti-Semitic policies To begin, we reached out to Reilly’s office to see where the alderman found the source he used for the tweet. A staffer told us on background that it’s a well-known fact that soldiers aided with the deportation of Jews and that the military, known as the Wehrmacht, guarded concentration camps. The staffer said the information came from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) website. We turned to the museum in order to see whether Hitler actually called the deportation of Jews a ""military operation."" Anti-Semitism grew in the early-to-mid-1930s as the Nazi Party became more powerful. With the help of the Gestapo, the Sutrmabteilungen (Stormtroopers) and the Schutzstaffel (more commonly known as the SS), Hitler’s Germany restricted Jews from having many basic human rights. According to the museum, for six years, Nazi-inspired legislation restricted Jews from entering certain parts of town and stripped them of any meaningful employment. In 1939, many German Jews were being deported to concentration camps. According to the museum website, the deportations were spurred through the Nisko, or Lublin plan, which were Jewish ""reservations"" in what was then a German-occupied area of Poland. Adolf Eichmann of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) coordinated the transfer of roughly 3,500 Jews through the Lublin plan. There were other instances of deportations in the 1930s. The USHMM website notes Germans also were deported three days after the official start of WWII if they spoke out against the war. This was enacted by Reinhard Heydrich, commander of the Security Service. However, there is no record on the USHMM website of Hitler publicly announcing his intentions for deportations or of him describing them as military operations. While Hitler often spoke about his goals regarding racial purity, he never actually tied them to his military pursuits, publicly or otherwise. According to the USHMM, it still is unknown when exactly, during 1941, Hitler officially authorized the Final Solution, the name given to the Nazi Plan to exterminate the Jews. In fact, there still is no trace of a written order from Hitler ordering the deportation of Jews. This kind of internal secrecy was common in Nazi Germany. The website Holocaust Denial on Trial, a joint project of Emory University and Emory’s Tam Institute for Jewish Studies, cites Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, as saying, ""We will never speak of it publicly … I mean the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish race…This is a page of glory in our history which has never been written and is never to be written."" Evidence of Hitler publicly connecting his military plans to the deportation is lacking, though Reilly’s tweet indicates otherwise.    The Trump comparison In the CNN story Reilly retweeted, Trump called his deportation plan a military operation. When asked to clarify, the White House told CNN the president meant ""military"" as an adjective. But Reilly’s conflation of German deportations in the 1930s and Trump’s plan is an inaccurate premise on its face, said Johannes Evelein, a professor of language and cultural studies at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. Reilly’s comparison of Hitler’s deportation raises more differences than similarities, Evelein said. ""What we are seeing with Trump’s plan is the deportation of immigrants who came here illegally and being returned back to their original country,"" Evelein said. ""In Hitler’s Germany, actual German citizens were being deported. Trump’s plan is more of a question of who is illegal and who’s not, rather than Hitler’s plan, which gauged which citizens were pure and which ones weren’t."" Evelein says as a general rule he hesitates to compare any figure to Hitler. ""I have seen a lot of these comparisons and I understand where they are coming from, but I tend to stay away from the comparison,"" Evelein said. ""I feel others should, too, unless people have the time to develop the point and zero in on a very specific element. It’s very easy to write a tweet and be done."" He even considers these kinds of comparisons ""dangerous,"" especially when done in a short format like Twitter. ""There are limits to how much you can explain yourself,"" Evelein said. ""Given the limited amount of text (on Twitter), it invites a kind of glibness. Oftentimes, it’s provocative. Politically, it seems unwise to do that precisely because you cannot explain yourself."" Our ruling A recent tweet from Chicago Ald. Brendan Reilly compared a quote from President Trump to the military aspirations of Adolf Hitler. Trump was quoted as saying his deportation plan is a military operation. Reilly responded in a tweet saying, ""I seem to recall a guy in mid-1930s Germany who said the same thing."" After reviewing sources from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Holocaust Denial on Trial website, we could not find any record of Hitler expressly calling his deportation of Jews a military operation. The Nazis were known for keeping their plans secret, and while Hitler spurred the majority of the anti-Semitic rhetoric in Nazi Germany, there are no records expressly describing deportations in the 1930s as a military operation. Information from Trinity College’s Professor Evelein and the Hamburg Institute for Social Research revealed the German army did have a hand in carrying out the deportation of Jews. Finally, as Evelein pointed out, there are many differences between Trump’s deportation plan and the plan Hitler carried out, including the criteria for deportation and in the case of European Jews, torture and execution. Reilly’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores many important facts. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2017/mar/23/brendan-reilly/chicago-alderman-misses-mark-comparing-donald-trum/

GOP Obamacare replacement cuts aid for lower-income people, makes more higher-income people eligible
","Two days before a showdown in the U.S. House of Representatives, with House Speaker Paul Ryan lobbying his colleagues hard to vote yes, a fellow Wisconsin Republican dumped on the GOP plan to replace Obamacare. ""I’ve got a lot of problems with the House bill as it’s written right now,"" U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said March 21, 2017 at a WisPolitics event in Washington, D.C. -- highlighting concerns over whether a top priority for Ryan and President Donald Trump can pass. Afterward, Johnson complained to a reporter about what he sees as a paradox: The replacement, he said, would reduce subsidies that help lower-income people buy health insurance, but also ""expand the entitlement"" by giving subsidies to higher-income people ""that Obamacare never helped."" Let’s see if Johnson’s right. Note: We’re fact checking Johnson’s claim based on the original GOP legislation, not on any changes that might have been made after his statement. The expected House vote on March 23, 2017 was postponed a few hours after this fact check was posted. Tax credits Johnson’s claim alludes to what are known as refundable tax credits that help people who buy their own health insurance. How they work: If a person has a federal tax bill of $2,500 and receives a $1,000 tax credit, the tax bill is reduced to $1,500. A refundable tax credit means that if the amount of the tax credit is greater than the amount of taxes owed, the taxpayer receives a refund for the difference. Both Obamacare and the GOP plan, referred to by Democrats as ""Trumpcare,"" offer the credits. But, as Johnson indicated, they take different approaches. Obamacare: Tax credits are based on a person’s income and the cost of health insurance in the area where they live. The subsidies are available to people whose income is between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (in 2017, 400 percent is about $47,000 per year for an individual). The subsidies are larger for people with lower incomes and for those who live in areas where health care costs are higher. GOP plan: The credits vary by age -- people in their 20s would get $2,000 a year, with credits rising to $4,000 for people in their 60s. The eligibility extends to individuals who earn up to $75,000 a year -- a significantly higher income than under Obamacare. So, what’s the upshot? The effect on people An expert nonprofit organization in health care, the Kaiser Family Foundation, summarizes the differences this way: Under the GOP plan, lower-income people generally will get reduced tax credits compared to Obamacare -- especially those who are older and live in areas where health care costs more. Meanwhile, more people with higher incomes would become eligible for tax credits. Here are the average tax credits for a 40-year-old, according to Kaiser: Annual income in 2020 Obamacare tax credits GOP plan tax credits $20,000 $4,143 $3,000 $40,000* $1,021 $3,000 $75,000 0 $3,000 $100,000 0 $500 (In Milwaukee, the estimate is that the credit would be $1,280 with Obamacare and $3,000 with the GOP plan.) Our rating Johnson says the GOP’s Obamacare replacement would reduce subsidies that help lower-income people buy health insurance, but also ""expand the entitlement"" by giving subsidies to higher-income people ""that Obamacare never helped."" The Republican plan does offer subsidies, known as refundable tax credits, that are smaller for lower-income people than they are under Obamacare. And it does offer the credits to people with higher incomes than Obamacare does. We rate Johnson’s statement True.   Other fact checks on the GOP replacement for Obamacare: Mark Pocan: Gives $600 billion in tax breaks ""the wealthiest"" -- Half True Tammy Baldwin: Will let insurance executives ""make millions off your health care"" -- Mostly False Paul Ryan: Will lower premiums, report ""confirms"" -- Half True  ",/factchecks/2017/mar/23/ron-johnson/gop-obamacare-replacement-cuts-aid-lower-income-pe/

Discussing health care, Mike Pence is wrong about how car insurance works
","During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines. The idea is not new, but it’s never been fully enacted. Currently, health insurance is regulated state by state. Some Republicans have long argued that such state-by-state regulation, including minimum requirements for health insurance plans, has kept the price of premiums high. They argue that a more unfettered, free-market approach -- where insurers compete to sell identical policies anywhere, regardless of what the purchaser’s state requires -- would drive down the cost of coverage for consumers. Critics counter that effectively getting rid of state regulation of insurance coverage within their borders would weaken consumer protections and promote a ""race to the bottom"" in the quality of coverage. (Here are some articles that discuss the pluses and minuses of the approach.) A provision to do what Trump promised didn’t make it into the American Health Care Act, the House Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. However, Trump reiterated his support for the proposal in future legislation -- and his allies have kept up the rhetoric. During a March 19 appearance at the Church by the Glades in Coral Springs, Fla., Vice President Mike Pence said, ""Under President Trump’s leadership ... we're going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines -- the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance."" Pence made a similar remark eight days earlier while visiting Kentucky. And on March 14, White House spokesman Sean Spicer reiterated the theme at his daily briefing. ""Who could be against allowing insurance to be sold over state lines?"" Spicer said. ""It’s something that you can do (for) your car insurance."" One PolitiFact reader wrote to ask whether the comparison of health insurance and car insurance was accurate, so we decided to take a look. We found that their analogy is flawed. Contrary to what Pence and Spicer said, the rules governing the sale of car insurance are much the same as how health insurance is sold today -- not how the Trump administration wants it to be sold tomorrow. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Currently, states have laws that set minimum standards for both health insurance and car insurance. For instance, when you buy car insurance, you may be required to pay for policies with a minimum level of liability coverage, medical coverage, property damage coverage and coverage for other drivers in an accident who are uninsured or underinsured. (Here’s an interactive tool from Geico to see the particular requirements in your state.) So it’s common for consumers to buy an auto insurance policy online from an out-of-state vendor -- just as they can buy a health insurance policy from a vendor whose headquarters are out of state. The key factor, though, is that for both types of insurance, that out-of-state vendor has to tailor the plan it sells you to the laws of your state. Today, if you live in Maryland, you can purchase an auto policy from Progressive, which is based in Ohio. But the policy you buy from Progressive must adhere to the minimum requirements of your home state, Maryland. It can’t simply sell you a one-state-fits-all policy. That’s effectively the same setup as it is for health insurance. If you are living in Maryland but decide to buy a health insurance policy from Aetna -- a company headquartered in Connecticut -- that plan must conform to Maryland’s minimum requirements. In reality, then, Pence got it backwards. What the Trump administration wants to do would make buying health insurance unlike the way you buy car insurance today -- not more like it, as Pence had said. ""Auto insurance is regulated by the states, which have different laws and regulations,"" said Roger Feldman, a professor of health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. ""It doesn't matter from whom I buy my policy -- all auto insurers that sell policies in Minnesota must live by the Minnesota laws."" Feldman called the formulation by Pence and Spicer a ""false analogy."" Lynne McChristian, executive director of the Center for Risk Management, Education and Research at Florida State University, agreed. In fact, she said, ""if you buy your health policy today and move from one state to another, when you notify the insurer of the change of address, the policy changes according to the requirements of the new state of residence -- just like auto insurance would."" Our ruling Pence said that Trump’s proposal to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as ""the way you buy car insurance"" today. Experts say this analogy is deeply flawed. Contrary to what Pence suggested, today’s rules for car insurance are not a free-market, borderless nirvana. Car insurance is just as regulated, on a state-by-state basis, as health insurance is. So using today’s car-insurance system as a model for the administration’s vision of cross-border health-insurance sales is wrong. Making the change Trump wants would actually make the rules for health insurance and car insurance different -- not the same.

Former ‘First Grandma’ Marian Robinson caught up in another fake news hoax
","Former First Grandma Marian Robinson just can’t catch a break from fake news. First Michelle Obama’s mother was wrongly accused in fake stories of drawing a federal pension for taking care of grandchildren Sasha and Malia. Now she’s the victim of a new round of false reports that claim she’s being charged with a crime for doing so since former President Barack Obama left office. ""Obama’s mother-in-law charged with larceny and fraud,"" reads the headline on several Internet posts that started appearing on or after March 16, 2017. The posts all read roughly the same, claiming that Robinson was charged ""for accepting money from the federal government under false pretenses."" The story stokes reader ire by admonishing Robinson for attempting to take money she didn’t deserve. ""While it may not have been her idea to ask for a $160K pension for being the Obama daughters’ ‘caretaker,’ she was the one who filled out the paperwork and signed her name,"" the posts read. Several of these links were flagged by Facebook users for being potentially fake, as part of the social media company’s efforts to prune fake news from readers’ news feeds. The various links that repurpose the same post have been shared on Facebook at least 17,000 times. We know this particular claim is fake, because it comes from a website that makes up its content. It was originally posted on March 16 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. These kinds of posts end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without attribution about its origin. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t indicate this or any other story is fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" Moreover, the whole idea that Robinson was at all eligible for a federal pension for being a caretaker of the former first family’s children is entirely wrong. Robinson was a former bank secretary and stay-at-home mother to Michelle Obama and her brother Craig. She did move into the White House in 2009, and has helped raise her granddaughters. But she didn’t draw a salary and wasn’t on any kind of government payroll for doing that. Since she was never a federal employee, she doesn’t qualify for any government pension. The post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org is building on a claim from October 2016 that originated on BostonTribune.com. That website said Robinson was allowed to collect the $160,000 pension once the Obamas left the White House. Despite the story being shared on several other fake news sites, there’s no actual pension for Robinson to collect. We rated that statement Pants On Fire! TheLastLineOfDefense.org report appears to acknowledge there is no pension for the first grandma (or at least not a legal one). Instead, the post unleashes outrage over Robinson’s alleged attempt to collect money not owed to her.

Sean Spicer’s False claim that Paul Manafort played a minor role in the Trump campaign
","Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to distance the White House from President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has come under intense scrutiny recently for alleged ties to the Russian government. Manfort’s name was mentioned more than two dozen times in a Monday hearing before the House Intelligence committee on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and exclusive reporting today by the Associated Press alleges Manafort worked to advance Kremlin interests years before his involvement in the Trump campaign. ""Obviously there’s been discussion of Paul Manafort, who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time,"" Spicer said in a March 20 White House press briefing, responding to a reporter’s question about references to Manafort during the hearing.   That struck us as wrong, and Spicer seemed to walk back his comments in a subsequent press conference -- while still downplaying Manafort’s role. ""I know I commented on this the other day and clearly, I should have been more precise with respect to Paul's role, so let me clarify this and kind of go through the facts,"" Spicer said. Given the White House's continued efforts to distance itself from Manafort, we decided to review the facts ourselves around his involvement in the Trump campaign. Manafort’s early role in the Trump campaign In March 2016, then-candidate Trump tapped Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention. In a press release announcing the hiring, Trump praised Manafort as ""a great asset and an important addition"" in consolidating the support Trump won during the primary season. ""Paul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party,"" Trump said in a statement that highlighted Manafort’s extensive political experience in ""dozens of international political campaigns."" About a week later, Trump expanded Manafort’s portfolio to include all functions related to the nomination process, as well as additional roles coordinating outreach efforts and establishing a new office in Washington, D.C. ""I am organizing these responsibilities under someone who has done this job successfully in many campaigns,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Paul is a well-respected expert in this regard and we are pleased to have him join the efforts to Make America Great Again."" Manafort also began appearing on national television to represent the campaign. Manafort’s April 24 appearance on Fox News Sunday was posted on the Trump campaign’s official website, for example. (The post has since been removed, but can be seen here.) In his Sunday show interview, Manafort defended Trump’s campaign style and evolving strategy, and went on offense against then-Sen.

House GOP health care bill would cause 14 million to lose insurance next year, says Chris Murphy
","Democrats continue to hammer Republicans over a health care overhaul that’s projected to set in motion steep drops in insurance enrollment nationwide. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., in a press conference said the ""biggest headline"" from an analysis of the House bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was that 24 million fewer Americans would be insured by 2026 under the plan, with a big drop off starting next year. ""In 2018, right off the bat, right in year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage,"" Murphy said in a March 16 press conference. ""This is because of the cuts to Medicaid, which will result in states dramatically curtailing Medicaid eligibility, but also because lots of Americans who today have private health care through these exchanges won't be able to afford that coverage, as well as people who will come off employer-sponsored care."" We decided to fact-check Murphy's claim about the bill, formally called the American Health Care Act, that 14 million Americans would lose coverage. Murphy accurately identified several of the drivers behind the projected rise in the uninsured rate. But he left out that some of the reduced enrollment would result from the repeal of a deeply unpopular provision in the Affordable Care Act—the individual mandate that requires most Americans to get coverage or pay a penalty. 14 million fewer Americans insured next year  The CBO report places the anticipated 14 million newly uninsured people into several categories. It projects 5 million fewer people will be covered under Medicaid; 2 million fewer people will be covered through their employer, and 6 million fewer will obtain coverage on the individual market, either through private insurers or exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Murphy accurately characterizes the CBO’s findings on reduced enrollment due to Medicaid. In addition to the 5 million fewer people expected to be covered under Medicaid next year, the CBO projects 14 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid by 2026 as states that would likely expand Medicaid under Obamacare chose not to do so under the Republican proposal. The senator also fairly states the CBO’s conclusion on employer-based insurance. Beyond the roughly 2 million fewer people to get coverage through their employer in 2018, the Republican proposal is estimated to lead to roughly 7 million fewer people enrolled in employer-based insurance by 2026. But Murphy didn’t mention that some of these people would voluntarily drop their insurance. The House Republican health care overhaul would repeal the individual mandate penalty, and according to the CBO, this would be the single biggest driver of raising the uninsured rate by 14 million next year. ""Most of that increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate,"" the CBO report reads. ""Some of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums"" (emphasis ours). The CBO could not provide specific figures on how many people would opt out of coverage based solely on the removal of penalties, so it’s difficult to quantify. But there’s reason to think the figure would be significant. A RAND study from 2014 found that repealing the individual mandate would cause a sharp reduction in enrollment—with roughly one in five people in the individual market dropping coverage—while adding only relatively small increases to insurance premiums. Some conditions have changed since the study was published, but these findings seem to suggest millions of people would opt out of coverage if the penalties associated with the individual mandate were eliminated. Suffice it to say that while those people would no longer have coverage, they didn't technically lose it, as Murphy said, so much as voluntarily forgo coverage. And omitting this group as a driver of the projected rise in next year’s projected uninsured rate does not tell the whole story behind the 14 million figure. Keep in mind, the people required to buy insurance helped keep rates reasonable for people who are sick or had pre-existing conditions. Insurance markets set up under Obamacare have depended on a group of younger, healthier people blending into a diverse pool with older, sicker people. This arrangement led to a system where ""young and healthy enrollees without large subsidies effectively cross-subsidize older, less healthy enrollees when they are required to purchase insurance or pay a penalty,"" according to a December CBO report. Our ruling Based on the CBO's analysis of the House Republican health care bill, Murphy said, ""In year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage."" It is the CBO's estimate that 14 million more Americans would be off the health insurance rolls in the year following the bill’s passage. But Murphy overlooked that some of next year's newly uninsured population never wanted insurance to begin with and only got coverage under Obamacare to avoid tax penalties. This is particularly true of the people who ""lose"" coverage during the first year -- many of them are people dropping coverage because there is no longer a penalty.

Trump says illegal immigration at southern border is down 61 percent since Election Day
","President Donald Trump told supporters in Kentucky to focus on their basketball team and let him take care of the rest, such as securing the borders and kicking out immigrants in the country illegally. ""We will build, that's right, a great, great border wall … And we will stop the drugs that are pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and plenty of others. We're going to stop the drugs,"" Trump said March 20. ""A lot of them are coming in from the southern border. Since the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the southern border by 61 percent, think of that, 61 percent, and we haven't started."" Trump has boasted about a 40 percent decline in illegal immigration in his first month in office. We rated that Mostly True. He is now extending the comparison to November to show even more significant cuts. Border patrol apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border declined 60 percent from November 2016 to February 2017, but immigration experts caution against assuming that declines have been a sole result of Trump’s policies. Border apprehension data The Department of Homeland Security on March 8 released illegal border crossing data that show that in the month of the presidential election, November 2016, border patrol made 47,210 apprehensions. In February 2017, there were 18,762 apprehensions, a 60 percent decline. Total southwest border apprehensions declined about 63 percent from November 2016 to February 2017. DHS defined total apprehensions as those made by border patrol between ports of entry and inadmissibility at ports of entry determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Field Operations. We asked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol for apprehension data from Election Day to the day before Trump’s Kentucky speech, but the agency said it provides statistics by month, not by specific dates and timeframes. It’s worth noting that this past fall there was an unseasonal increase of unauthorized border crossings, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. People rushed to the border before Trump took over and implemented new policies, he said. ""After that rush to the border, it’s natural to expect a decline,"" Wilson said. ""What we cannot still answer is whether this is a temporary or permanent decline."" DHS Secretary John Kelly in a March 8 statement said illegal crossings typically rise between March and May. While Trump’s rhetoric against illegal immigration has played a role in recent apprehension decreases, apprehension levels are typically lower in the winter months and on-the-ground changes in response to policies can take longer, experts have told us. ""It is almost always necessary to look at trends over a longer period, usually at least six months, to get a better sense of changes,"" said Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. ""It seems likely that the numbers of border crossers will go back up again before long given that the human rights situation in Central America is still incredibly problematic, and Central American asylum seekers are one of the main sources of migration in recent years."" Other factors worth considering, according to Gilman are that Mexico may have stepped up its enforcement efforts so that migrants don’t reach the U.S.-Mexico border, and that smugglers may be waiting to decide on new routes for bringing people across the border Our ruling Trump said, ""Since the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the Southern border by 61 percent."" While U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not provide border apprehension statistics for specific dates, monthly data show a 60 percent decline from the month of the presidential election, November 2016, to February 2017. Experts said other factors should be considered in the decline and that it’s too early to tell whether low apprehensions will become the new norm or if they will increase in coming months, as they typically do.

Mostly True: Leahy claim on immigrant investment through EB-5 program
","Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy has called out an immigrant investor program as flawed and running counter to its intended purposes. ""The EB-5 program … was designed to bring jobs to underserved rural and urban communities. And for some time it did just that. But the program has strayed from these goals. It's a magnet for fraud. Security violations are common,"" Leahy said as a witness during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. ""And the incentives that Congress created to promote investment in distressed areas had become obsolete due to economic gerrymandering."" The Vermont senator offered some figures to back his claims. ""Only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas … Less than 10 percent invest in true high-unemployment areas. Almost every other EB-5 project uses gerrymandering to qualify as distressed,"" Leahy said March 8. Is that so? His comments reflect a sample of EB-5 petitions filed. EB-5 immigrant investor program The EB-5 program — whose name derives from the employment-based visa granted to participants — was created by Congress in 1990 as a tool to attract foreigners and to stimulate the U.S. economy through jobs and investment. Initially, immigrants invested directly into new projects. But in 1992, Congress expanded EB-5 by creating the Immigrant Investor Program (also referred to as Regional Center Program). It allotted EB-5 visas for individuals who would invest in certain commercial projects associated with regional centers approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency that administers the program. Through EB-5, investors, their spouses, and unmarried children under 21 years old become eligible for green cards if they create or keep 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers and if their investment is at least $1 million, or alternatively $500,000 if it is in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) in the United States. TEAs are defined as rural areas or those that have unemployment of at least 150 percent the national average rate. (More details on TEA classifications are available here.) USCIS told PolitiFact it does not have hard numbers on investments and jobs created through EB-5 but pointed us to a Commerce Department analysis of 562 active projects during fiscal years 2012 and 2013. During that two-year period, there was an estimated investment of nearly $5.8 billion by more than 11,000 immigrant investors, and the projects were expected to create about 174,000 jobs, according to the January 2017 report. (Investment on those projects from sources other than EB-5 was about $10.9 billion.) Government Accountability Office report Still, several reports have found shortcomings in the investor program, including cases of fraud and lax oversight. The senator’s office referred us to a September 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office. The report, produced at the request of the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, analyzed investment in TEAs, how those areas were classified and how high-unemployment TEAs were drawn to meet the required unemployment rate. GAO studied a random sample of 200 of the 6,652 investor petitions filed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Those petitions had not been decided on at the time GAO began its analysis. Among the report’s findings: • Almost all EB-5 petitioners elected to invest in a project located in a TEA, thus qualifying for the minimum required investment of $500,000. • 3 percent elected to invest in rural TEAs. • 97 percent elected to invest in high unemployment TEAs, yet 90 percent (of the 97 percent) combined census areas in order to meet the required unemployment rate. The other 10 percent (of 97 percent), used the unemployment rate of a single census tract, census block group, or county. In other words, 9.7 percent of all EB-5 petitioners elected to invest in an area that on its own met the TEA criteria. What experts say We asked experts who have researched the EB-5 program to help us evaluate Leahy’s assessment. They said data is scarce and limited, and that GAO’s estimates are the best available. Leahy’s reliance on the GAO report ""is fair and reasonable,"" said Gary Friedland, a scholar-in-residence at New York University Stern School of Business, who along with colleague Jeanne Calderon, has testified on their findings about the program before Senate and House committees. ""USCIS is not transparent and does not publicly release data about projects, TEA status of projects or individual petitions,"" Friedland said. ""Similarly, industry (regional centers and developers) is not transparent and very protective of information about projects that utilize EB-5 capital."" Unlike conventional investors seeking a risk adjusted rate of return, immigrants invest in EB-5 primarily — if not exclusively — to qualify for the investor visa and accept a very low rate of interest on their investment, Friedland said. As a result, they prefer to minimize their investment on EB-5 projects and seek projects that allow them to qualify for the lower-investment amount permitted for a TEA project, he said. Motivated to promote economic development, states have lenient rules to enable projects to qualify as TEA locations, and USCIS does not impose guidelines, Friedland said. ""This has resulted in TEA gerrymandering where the applicant (regional center) is able to artificially expand the area for which the high unemployment rate is to be tested to include remote census tracts with exceptionally high unemployment rates that do not reflect the economic condition of the tract in which the project is located,"" Friedland said. ""The states allow the census tracts to be connected in any direction and to form unnatural shapes."" Friedland and Calderon have databases of large scale real estate projects that have raised or proposed to raise substantial amounts of EB-5 capital. ""Virtually all of the large-scale projects in Manhattan are located south of Central Park, and generally these projects qualify as TEA locations by taking advantage of the gerrymandering permitted by the state,"" Friedland said. GAO’s analysis also shows that most TEAs are constructed by combining census areas, said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at Urban Institute. ""Few base it on a single small geographic area,"" she said. And while GAO's analysis is useful, Singer notes that the sample is indicative only of that specific period of time. (A footnote in GAO's report said petitions from the fourth quarter may not be representative of petitions submitted in other quarters.) ""Without data from a longer period of time, there is no way to gauge how representative these trends are — say for the last 10 years, or the lifetime of the program,"" Singer said. Regarding Leahy’s claim that only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas, that’s ""likely close to correct,"" said Lazaro Zamora, senior policy analyst at Bipartisan Policy Center. The majority of regional centers are still mostly focused on real-estate development and other investment projects that gravitate toward metropolitan areas, Zamora said. ""At the end of the day, this is a program that tries to attract investment, and rural areas typically have a harder time attracting it,"" Zamora said, though there have been projects that benefitted rural communities, such as a hospital that opened in a rural Arizona town with the help of EB-5 investment. Our ruling Leahy said, ""Only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas … Less than 10 percent invest in true high-unemployment areas. Almost every other EB-5 project uses gerrymandering to qualify as distressed."" Leahy based his claims on a 2016 Government Accountability Office report that analyzed a sample of EB-5 petitions filed in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. Experts say only limited data is available on EB-5 investments but that GAO’s findings are reasonable. GAO’s report reflects a snapshot and estimates of the petitions in one quarter. The program has been around for more than 20 years. We rate Leahy’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/21/patrick-leahy/leahy-eb-5-visas/

Only the wealthiest would get $600 billion in tax breaks from 'Trumpcare' replacement for Obamacare?
","U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who helped put himself through college by working as a magician, has continued his performing since joining Congress. In the March 20, 2017 episode of ""Magic Mondays,"" his regular video feature, the Wisconsin Democrat appeared to make part of a playing card move from his closed hand into an assistant’s hand. The purpose of the trick was to attack the Republican replacement for Obamacare, which is championed by U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, supported by President Donald Trump and up for a House vote on March 23, 2017. Under ""Trumpcare,"" as Pocan calls the proposal, ""$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country.""   That figure has made headlines. But Pocan’s claim, while partially on target, suffers from saying that all the money would go to ""the wealthiest."" Previous claims Recent claims about what is formally known as the American Health Care Act -- including two portraying it as a sop to the rich -- have gotten mixed reviews on the Truth-O-Meter. Mostly False: A claim from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat who previously held Pocan’s seat, that ""TrumpCare"" would let insurance executives ""personally make millions off your health care."" One provision pegged at $400 million over 10 years is a tax break for corporations, not executives, and there’s no way to know how much of it would be turned into compensation for executives. Mostly True: A claim by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that the GOP legislation gives ""$275 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people earning $250,000 a year or more."" The savings over 10 years is projected to benefit the top 4.4 percent. Half True: Ryan’s claim that the legislation ""will lower premiums."" For people who buy health insurance on their own, premiums are expected to be higher than Obamacare in 2018 and 2019, but lower than Obamacare after that. The $600 billion It’s important to remember that the claims in those fact checks, along with the one by Pocan, were made about the original GOP replacement proposal -- prior to tweaks made in the days leading up to the expected House vote. The widely reported $600 billion in tax breaks comes from a solid source: estimates made by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, which is staffed by independent professionals. That’s the value over 10 years (2017 through 2026) of repealing nearly all the taxes contained in Obamacare and making other tax changes. To evaluate Pocan’s characterization of the $600 billion, we relied on analyses done by two expert nonprofit organizations -- the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Tax Policy Center. Here’s our breakdown: $275 billion to high-income earners by repealing two taxes:   $158 billion: A 3.8 percent tax applied to capital gains, dividend and interest income for families with $250,000 or more in income ($200,000 for singles). $117 billion: Medicare surtax -- a 0.9 percent tax hike on wage income in excess of $250,000 a year for couples ($200,000 for singles). It’s arguable whether households earning $250,000 per year are ""the wealthiest,"" but they are clearly on the high end of the income scale. According to the Tax Policy Center: About 90 percent of the benefit from repealing the investment tax would go to the top 1 percent of earners, who make $700,000 or more. And more than 99 percent of people would get no benefit from repeal of the Medicare surtax, while those in the top 1 percent would get three-quarters of the benefit—an average tax cut of $7,300. The rest of the $600 billion can be broken into two categories. $190 billion to businesses by repealing three taxes: $145 billion: A tax on health insurance companies based on their market share. $25 billion: Annual fee paid by prescription drugmakers and importers. $20 billion: A 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device makers and importers. Both Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center and Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told us these are a mixed bag. Repealing the taxes helps shareholders of those corporations, who tend to be wealthier; but they would also help a broad swath of people through lower prices. $122 billion to a variety of individuals through tax changes: $49 billion: Postponing the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans actually helps middle-income taxpayers, the Tax Policy Center says. $35 billion: Allowing more tax deductions for medical expenses -- starting at 7.5 percent of income, rather than 10 percent. This tends to help middle- and upper-income people, given that the rich are well insured and the poor don’t pay income taxes. $19 billion: Repealing a cap of $2,500 on the pre-tax dollars workers could put into flexible spending accounts annually. Poorer people can’t afford to put more than $2,500 aside for medical expenses, but this change benefits middle-income folks as well as the wealthiest. $19 billion: Increasing, to $6,550 for an individual and $13,100 for couples, the amount that could be put annually into a Health Savings Account. Similar impact as the pre-tax change. Our rating Pocan says that under ""Trumpcare,"" the Republican replacement for Obamacare, ""$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country.""    Not all of the $600 billion in tax breaks (over 10 years) would go to the wealthiest Americans. But nearly half -- $275 billion -- would almost exclusively benefit only people on the highest end of the income scale. And the wealthiest, along with middle- and lower-income Americans, would benefit from the remainder of the tax breaks.

WH budget chief wrongly claims afterschool programs don't work
","White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney triggered a storm of complaints when he defended elimination of a large federal after-school program. When asked in a press conference about the impact on students in Pennsylvania, Mulvaney couched his answer as pertaining to ""after-school programs generally."" ""They're supposed to be educational programs, right,"" he said March 16. ""That's what they're supposed to do, they're supposed to help kids who can't -- who don't get fed at home, get fed so that they do better at school. Guess what? There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually doing that. There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually helping results, helping kids do better at school."" President Donald Trump’s budget zeros out the $1.2 billion for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program that helps fund after-school and summer programs in disadvantaged communities around the country. We wondered what the research shows. Is there evidence programs like this help academically? The answer is a qualified yes. Improvements in test scores can be modest, and results vary from place to place. Also, as you might expect, the kids who actually come every day do better than those who don’t. California commissioned the UCLA Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing to do a detailed analysis of that state’s program. The center’s 2012 report found that among high school students ""participation had a slightly positive but minor effect on English language arts and math California Standards Test scores."" How minor? Students who took advantage of the afterschool program on average had scores a few points higher than a control group (matched according to a number of characteristics). Researchers called the results statistically significant but ""substantively weak."" For younger children, from kindergarten through eighth grade, the center’s research found the program boosted test scores only for the students who came regularly. For those who rarely showed up, there was no benefit. Deborah La Torre, a research associate at the UCLA center, told us food is an incidental part of these programs, and she called Mulvaney’s description ""muddled."" In California, the kids must get a ""healthy snack."" ""None of the programs just provide food,"" La Torre said. ""That’s not what they are about. They are mandated to provide specific academic programs in math and English, to help with homework and offer other programs such as art or physical fitness."" The Texas Education Agency also brought in an outside group to assess its federally funded afterschool program. Similarly to the California study, researchers found ""program participation was associated with higher Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills scores in reading/English language arts and mathematics."" But the benefits in Texas also mirrored California in that they were ""primarily in the small to moderate range."" Mulvaney’s focus on food puzzled other experts in this field, including Ken Springer at Southern Methodist University’s School of Education. ""Mr. Mulvaney's phrase ‘doing better in school’ leads somewhat narrowly to the question of whether better nutrition fosters better grades and test scores,"" Springer told us. ""It does, but when we focus specifically on better nutrition provided by afterschool programs, there's evidence that these programs can have other benefits, such as positively impacting students' knowledge about nutrition as well as their eating habits."" Springer said, and we confirmed, that there are many studies that affirm the educational benefits of feeding children from low-income families breakfast and lunch. Education researchers also emphasize that test scores alone are not the only measure of impact. Reduced absenteeism and better odds of moving up to the next grade are also linked to afterschool programs. We made several requests for information from the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. We did not hear back. Our ruling Mulvaney said that there is no evidence that federally funded afterschool programs that feed students help kids do better in school. Two studies from two of the largest states, California and Texas, found modest but positive impacts on test scores. They also found other gains, such as better attendance at school and better odds of moving up to the next grade. Mulvaney made a strong assertion that there is no evidence of gains.

Fact-check: Sen. Perdue touts US power program for Africa
","President Donald Trump’s budget outline is just the starting point for debate, but the cuts he’s seeking in foreign aid are among the deepest for any government activity. Under his plan, overall spending for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) would fall by about 28 percent. Congress controls the purse strings, of course, and in the Senate, David Perdue, R- Ga., likes at least one foreign assistance program. ""USAID put $8 billion up and attracted more than $45 billion in a public-private partnership called Power Africa,"" Perdue told NBC News on March 1 (before the budget outline was released). Perdue cited Power Africa as an example of how well the public-private approach could work to finance infrastructure in America. Power Africa is the signature development project of President Barack Obama. Unveiled in 2013, the goal is to double access to power in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030. With America playing the role of cheerleader and financier, Obama hoped to leverage money from private firms and other governments to build new power plants, transmission lines and small solar power generators to reach millions of people. Perdue used the example of Power Africa to buttress the value of public-private partnerships in the context of funding infrastructure construction in America. Our focus is simply on whether Power Africa racked up the numbers that he offered. It sort of did, and it sort of didn’t. The difference lies in the gap between money promised versus money committed to specific projects. Perdue’s office pointed to the exit memo of Obama’s USAID administrator Gayle Smith. She wrote, ""The United States’ initial $7 billion commitment has mobilized more than $54 billion in commitments from the public and private sectors, including more than $40 billion in commitments from private sector partners."" So give or take a few billion, Perdue’s statement was in line with Smith’s summary. Both the U.S. and the private sector amounts were less than he said, but in the ballpark. The real question is, what is a ""commitment?"" Todd Moss, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington who specializes in Africa and energy development, told us a commitment is a fairly open-ended term. ""A commitment is a pledge from the United States that they will spend money in a certain area,"" Moss said. ""It doesn't mean the money will be appropriated, and even if it is appropriated, that will be spent."" And the same holds true on the other side. ""These are funds private companies say they will invest, but they might not,"" Moss said. ""These are high-risk commercial ventures. I would be shocked if everything that gets talked about happens. The fact that they are trying to do new things in difficult places is the whole point of the program."" Setting ""commitments"" aside, a more demanding measure looks at the actual dollars the United States has tied up in projects that are moving forward. The USAID press office provided harder numbers. The total the United States has spent, loaned or guaranteed so far is about $2.8 billion. That money helped get $14 billion worth of projects underway. How does that compare to Perdue’s figures? He said $8 billion leveraged $45 billion, or a ratio of about 1 to 5.6. The current ratio ($2.8 billion to $14 billion) is about 1 to 5. Not quite as good but fairly close. These numbers only reveal so much. The American role can vary a lot, Moss said. In some cases, a bit of technical guidance is the linch pin. In others, multi-million dollar loans and loan guarantees are key. The influence of the United States across all projects can be tough to generalize. To take just one example, construction of a $900 million 450 MW plant in Nigeria got underway in early 2016 with backing from ""20 international banks and equity funders."" A $58 million loan from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation was part of the package. (It’s worth noting that most loans are repaid, so over time, American taxpayers get that money back.) Moss said Power Africa can’t take full credit for every power plant but he does think it can take some. ""When you look at the number of actors who have jumped in, and are now working on energy deals, that would be a heck of a coincidence,"" Moss said. ""They (USAID) deserve credit for motivating a lot of investment in the energy sector."" Our ruling Perdue said the USAID Power Africa program put $8 billion up and attracted more than $45 billion in outside money. Perdue’s figures represent commitments, not hard money spent. USAID reported $7 billion committed and $54 billion promised from all other sources, with over $40 billion of that coming from the private sector. Actual expenditures are at about the same ratio, however, and experts generally say the Power Africa program is creating investment in Africa’s energy sector. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/21/david-perdue/sen-perdue-touts-us-power-program-africa/

Does Airbnb decrease housing values, as Miami Beach mayor says?
","Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine went on a Facebook rant against Airbnb after a conservative publication criticized city officials for supporting fines against the short-term rental company. Airbnb posted the article by Sunshine State News on social media. Levine, a potential Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, fired back in the comments. Levine wrote that Miami Beach commissioners aren’t the only opponents of Airbnb, which allows property owners to rent out houses and apartments, or a bedroom, to visitors across the world. The city generally bans short-term rentals except in limited multi-family areas. He said officials in New York, San Francisco and Miami also don’t support Airbnb. Why? ""Because it destroys neighborhoods, buildings, decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing!!!!!"" he wrote in a March 2 Facebook comment. We decided to tackle two of Levine’s attacks: that Airbnb decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing. (By workforce housing, Levine was referring to homes for people who earn 60 to 120 percent of an area’s median income.) Airbnb does remove some units from the regular supply of rentals; however, it’s questionable about whether that can be defined as ""workforce housing"" since many units are in expensive areas. The evidence that Levine presented does not show that Airbnb decreases real estate values. Several factors influence housing costs, even in areas with Airbnb and where rents are rising. Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate analyst, said it’s premature to make broad claims about the impact of Airbnb because it hasn’t been around for long and only represents a slice of the residential market. ""It's still too soon to really have data for a long enough period of time to make these types of assumptions or assertions,"" he said. Some real estate experts said that Airbnb is the latest scapegoat for the lack of available affordable rentals — a problem that predated the home-sharing company. Levine’s evidence largely anecdotal Definitive, independent analysis about the impact of Airbnb is generally lacking. Most of the research we found focused on one city, or ones that were already plagued by housing crunches. For example, a San Francisco official said that ""illegitimate rentals"" took out 1,900 long-term housing units off the market, but it isn’t clear how many of those were affordable for people earning median incomes or less. Levine sent us multiple articles about the impact of Airbnb on housing  — some of the articles were anecdotal, speculative or general news reports about Airbnb’s growth in Miami Beach. We will focus on the evidence he sent that included studies based on data. A 2015 study by the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, an advocacy group for working families, concluded Airbnb was exacerbating the lack of affordable rental units in Los Angeles. The group also did a 2014 study that found rents were growing faster in Los Angeles neighborhoods with the highest Airbnb listing density. Roy Samaan, the author of the studies, told PolitiFact that he couldn’t definitively say that Airbnb was the cause of rents increasing. Several factors influence rental costs. There was a strong correlation, he said, between rising rents and increased Airbnb listings when the vacancy rate was really low. Since Airbnb doesn’t make its booking information fully public, it’s difficult to fully assess the impact. Another piece of evidence Levine cited stemmed from a report commissioned by affordable housing activists in New York City. It concluded that short-term rentals are reducing the vacancy rate, which causes increases in rental prices. The study zeroed in on a subset of about 8,000 Airbnb listings in New York City and concluded if those units were put back on the regular market, the vacancy rate would rise from the current 3.4-3.6 percent to 4 percent. Richard K. Green, a real estate professor at the University of Southern California, told PolitiFact those 8,000 units would be absorbed quickly in a rental market of more than 2.2 million units. ""I am skeptical that the local vacancy rates would move as much as the authors of the New York study would suggest,"" he said. Airbnb fires back It did not come as a surprise when Airbnb argued through its own packet of articles and studies that its listings don’t hurt real estate values or supply. Again, we will focus on the citations based on data. A FiveThirtyEight analysis concluded that ""Airbnb’s impact is probably still small in most cities,"" although it could grow. The statistics-based news website used Airbnb booking and revenue data to examine how many units Airbnb could be taking off the rental market nationwide. Stockton Williams, executive director of the Terwilliger Center for Housing at the Urban Land Institute, told FiveThirtyEight that the Airbnb units don’t add up to much as a percentage of total rental units in big cities in the United States. Other factors, such as the increasing demand for urban living, have played a much larger role in driving up prices in big cities, he said. ""There is a considerable amount of anecdotal evidence that they may be occurring in a relatively small number of individual neighborhoods and properties — and therefore quite real to affected residents and owners,"" Williams told us. Murray Cox, owner of Inside Airbnb, a website that analyzes data about Airbnb listings, told Business Insider that Airbnb can’t entirely be blamed for housing issues in cities that were already expensive. Cox told PolitiFact the research reflects a mixed bag: Some homes have been removed from the housing supply, but the additional revenue for property owners can increase the property value for owners. Airbnb rentals that become ""party houses"" could reduce neighboring values, but Cox said he hadn’t seen detailed analysis about that. Additional real estate experts argued that short-term rentals, while displacing long-term renters, could increase cash flow for owners and therefore increase their property value. Green, the real estate professor at the University of Southern California, said that focusing on Airbnb doesn’t get to the heart of the matter — ""that cities are making it more and more difficult to build housing."" Our ruling Levine says Airbnb ""decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing."" Some research and news articles have argued that Airbnb has decreased the rental supply and therefore is driving up prices, but it’s questionable whether all of those units can be described as ""workforce housing"" in already expensive areas with a lack of affordable housing. Levine did not point to evidence proving that Airbnb has decreased real estate values. It’s too soon to fully assess the impact of Airbnb on housing markets, and that’s difficult to do when it only represents a small fraction of the housing supply in any city or region. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/mar/20/philip-levine/does-airbnb-decrease-housing-values-and-increase-w/

Devin Nunes oversimplifies timeline of Obama 'reset' with Russia
","In his opening statement at a closely watched hearing about possible Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., criticized United States policy toward Russia under President Barack Obama. ""In recent years, committee members have issued repeated and forceful pleas for stronger actions against Russian belligerence, but the Obama administration was committed to the notion, against all evidence, that we could reset relations with Putin,"" Nunes said. This description of the Obama administration’s position struck us as one-sided, so we took a closer look. We asked Nunes's office for comment, but didn't hear back.  We concluded it’s misleading for Nunes to have ignored at least three years of the Obama administration in which the reset policy was dead, replaced by a much tougher line on Moscow. How the reset came about In March 2009, about two months after Obama was sworn in, his administration initiated a new policy toward Russia called the ""reset."" The official kickoff came in Geneva on March 6, 2009, when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov a red button. The new policy came less than a year after conflict flared in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two regions of Georgia, an independent country that was previously part of the Soviet Union. Obama’s foreign policy team had decided that the United States had a window of opportunity to find common ground on certain issues with Russia, given that Dmitry Medvedev had replaced Vladimir Putin as president in mid 2008. The administration -- and some outside observers -- credit the reset with some achievements, at least initially. During the period when the reset was U.S. policy, the two nations signed a nuclear-arms treaty; reached an agreement to allow U.S. troops and weapons destined for Afghanistan to be sent through Russian territory rather than Pakistan; collaborated on tough United Nations sanctions against Iran; achieved Russian membership in the World Trade Organization; and agreed that Russia would not use a U.N. Security Council veto to block a bombing campaign in Libya by the United States and its European allies. As time went on, though, the reset drew increasing criticism. In 2011, former chess champion and human-rights activist Garry Kasparov criticized both Obama and Putin, telling the Daily Beast that the reset was ""a disaster."" And Douglas J. Feith, who served as undersecretary of defense for policy during the George W. Bush administration, co-wrote an article in Foreign Policy that called the reset ""a head-shaking disappointment."" The reset peters out The era of cooperation began to come apart in 2012 -- not coincidentally, the year Putin returned to the presidency after Medvedev’s term. Large street protests in his 2012 presidential campaign ""had unnerved Mr. Putin, and he accused Mrs. Clinton of instigating them,"" the New York Times reported. ""White House officials had hoped the hostile talk was just for domestic campaign purposes, but even after Mr. Putin formally won re-election, he kept it up."" Relations worsened further in 2013, when Russia took in Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who had leaked a large trove of sensitive intelligence. The last straw, however, came in 2014 with Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. A popular revolution overthrew pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine, another former Soviet republic that became independent after the end of the Cold War. Russia responded by applying military pressure in pro-Russian regions of Ukraine and eventually annexing Crimea. In addition to strongly condemning Russia’s actions, the United States worked with its European allies to impose a series of escalating sanctions on Moscow starting on March 6, 2014. The sanctions ""inflicted real costs on Russia,"" said Dan Nexon, a Georgetown University foreign service professor. Emma Ashford, a research fellow with expertise on Russia at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that while the reset was ""dying"" between 2012 and 2014, the sanctions were a turning point. ""By 2014, with turmoil in Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Crimea, there was no longer any real attempt to seek the reset,"" she said. ""In fact, the Obama administration pursued a strong sanctions policy against Russia, and contributed troops to bolster NATO forces in Eastern Europe."" Other experts agreed. ""Certainly by March 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, there was no evidence of any ongoing Obama administration commitment to the reset,"" added Susan H. Allen, a foreign policy specialist at George Mason University. ""The U.S. condemnation of the annexation of Crimea was clear and unequivocal."" ""By 2014, I don't know how anyone could credibly argue that U.S. policy was the reset policy,"" added Richard Nephew, a research scholar at Columbia University. Our ruling Nunes said, ""In recent years ... the Obama administration was committed to the notion, against all evidence, that we could reset relations with Putin."" Nunes’ summary of U.S. policy toward Russia is at best incomplete. The Obama administration did pursue a reset policy, and kept it up arguably as late as 2014. But observers agree that the policy was dead no later than early 2014, when Russia intervened in Ukraine, and was already in question for two years before that.

Trump's False tweet that NSA, FBI said 'Russia did not influence electoral process'
","FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers stand by the conclusion that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election in President Donald Trump’s favor, they both said at a March 20 congressional hearing. But that’s not what Trump heard. ""The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process,"" Trump tweeted from the official White House account, @POTUS. The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. pic.twitter.com/d9HqkxYBt5 His tweet included a 51-second video clip of the hearing, which lasted more than five hours. The video clip shows Comey and Rogers confirming they have no evidence indicating that Russia altered vote tallies on Election Day in swing states like Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.  But vote tallying is only one aspect of the electoral process, and it’s not the only aspect of the campaign that Comey and Rogers talked about. Comey and Rogers said they believe Russia meddled in the race leading up to Election Day, chiefly by cyber-infiltrating the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. Contrary to Trump’s tweet, they also said the intelligence community did not assess whether Russia’s actions actually had a measurable impact on the election outcome or public opinion. Because Trump sent out his tweet before the hearing ended, Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., was able to ask Comey and Rogers about it. ""We’ve offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it’s never something that we’ve looked at,"" Comey said. But there’s no question from their testimony that Rogers and Comey believe that Russia wanted to influence the election: • Comey officially confirmed the FBI is still investigating Russia’s involvement in the election, saying, ""I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts."" • Comey and Rogers both said ""yes"" when Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, asked: ""Both your agencies agree with the assessment that the Russians' goal was to undermine the public faith in U.S. democratic process. Is that still your assessments?"" • Comey and Rogers both said ""yes"" when Conaway asked them if they still agreed with the intelligence community’s January conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to harm former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and, by extension, help Trump. ""I don't know for sure (when we made that judgment), but I think that was a fairly easy judgment for the community,"" Comey said. ""Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much, that the flipside of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much."" •  Comey said Russia’s interference stood out because it was so ""noisy,"" possibly in an attempt to cause panic among the American public. ""They were unusually loud in their intervention,"" he said. ""It’s almost as if they didn’t care that we knew what they were doing or that they wanted us to see what they were doing."" We reached out to the White House for comment but didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said, ""The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process."" Rogers and Comey never said this — not in the video clip Trump shared, nor at any point in the five-hour hearing. Rather, they said they believe Russia interfered in the presidential election, in an attempt to help Trump and undermine the democratic process. They said they don’t know one way or the other if that interference actually did affect public opinion or the outcome of the election.

Rep. Vicky Hartzler underestimated the lack of high-speed internet in Missouri
","In the face of President Donald Trump’s push to spend $1 trillion on revitalizing infrastructure around the country, many lawmakers have been making their case to secure some of the proposed funds.  Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, published a news release on Feb. 14 highlighting a letter she and 70 other congressional representatives signed asking Trump to include funding in his infrastructure investments to expand access to high-speed internet. ""Roughly one-fourth of rural Missourians are unable to purchase high-speed internet which puts them at a disadvantage in everything from education to entertainment to health care,"" Hartzler said in the release. In a tweet from the next day, she expanded the spectrum of her assertion and said, ""Roughly one-fifth of Missourians are unable to purchase/access high-speed internet."" In an era of unceasing digitalization, access to the internet is only becoming a greater daily necessity. We wanted to fact check her numbers. An outdated report We reached out to Hartzler’s spokesman, Kyle Buckles, to find the source of this information. Buckles provided us with the Eighth Broadband Progress Report compiled by the Federal Communications Commission and released on Aug. 14, 2012. The report was also included in the news release, via hyperlink.   According to these 2012 numbers, Hartzler’s statement about rural residents is correct: some 24.2 percent of Missourians living in rural areas don't have access to high-speed internet. However, in her tweet she noted that one-fifth of all Missourians don’t have access to high-speed internet. This figure is inaccurate, according to the 2012 report, which says that 7.5 percent of the total state population doesn't have access to high-speed internet. The problem gets worse, though. The 2012 report provided by Buckles used an outdated benchmark internet speed. Measured in megabits per second, or mbps, the speed of an internet connection is a measurement of data transfer. The first number refers to the download speed, which is how fast your connection can retrieve data from the server, and the second number refers to the upload speed, which is how fast you can deliver data to the server. The benchmark number for high-speed internet used by the old FCC report is 4mbps/1mbps. The 2016 FCC Broadband Progress Report has a benchmark of 25mbps/3mbps. The raised benchmark has drastically reframed the picture of access to high-speed internet in Missouri. Faster internet According to the 2016 report, 1,257,622 Missourians — or one-fifth of the state population — don’t have access to high-speed internet. (This is the same figure that Hartzler cited in her tweet, which leads us to believe that she gathered the data for her tweet from the most updated FCC report.) Additionally, 61 percent, or 1,053,213 Missourians, who live in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet. That is a drastic increase from the 25 percent Hartzler cited in her release.  It should also be noted that of those without access to high-speed internet, roughly 84 percent live in rural areas. Missouri ranks behind the national figures in both the percentage of the total population that lacks access to high-speed internet, 10 percent, and the percentage of rural the population without access, 39 percent. The importance of high-speed Which brings us to the question: why does having high-speed internet matter? Heather Shoenberger, an assistant professor at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication who formerly worked on the Missouri Broadband Project, put it simply: ""Just think of all of the things you use internet for."" In addition to the rapid potential that continues to be unlocked by the internet and the internet of things, Shoenberger pointed to more mundane tasks like applying for a job. ""You can’t get online to Monster(.com) and put your information in,"" she said. ""My parents actually have a small company and they often post to (job) boards that people supposedly have access to, (but) they’ve had some ads that have had zero response. And it’s not a result of the fact that people don’t need jobs in that area, because they most certainly do."" She continued, ""Everything we do almost is connected online now; almost everything is in the cloud and if you’re not part of that, you’re really sort of part of a group of people who are kept in the dark from a lot of information that’s out there. Anything from political information, to jobs, to the ability to search for a better price online, to compare car prices, to know if your car is a lemon."" But Shoenberger also said she wasn’t sure that expanding broadband infrastructure was the right solution, partly because of how much of Missouri’s farmland would have to be torn up to lay the broadband fiber, and partly because of the price. ""Having access, that’s great, but then you have to have it at a price that people can pay for,"" she said. ""And I’m not certain that they can. I’m not certain that people in many of our communities can even afford a computer. ""I think most people in these more poor communities are using cellphones for all of their internet accessing needs. That may be the best way of attacking the issues: just making the cellphone service really topnotch,"" she said. Our ruling Hartzler said that one-fourth of Missourians who live in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet, but her numbers were based on an outdated FCC report from 2012 that used a much slower benchmark speed for internet. According to the most recent 2016 Broadband Progress Report from the FCC, which uses a benchmark speed of 25mbps/3mbps for high-speed internet, nearly 61 percent of Missourians living in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet. Hartzler’s point is definitely correct, but her numbers are out of date and incorrect, which exacerbates the problem even more.

Did CBO exist in 1964? No
","House Republicans have been moving on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. One of the big controversies surrounding the repeal concerns how many people will lose health insurance coverage.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently issued a forecast that 24 million fewer people would have coverage by 2024. Repeal supporters, though, have focused on how difficult it is to estimate a concrete number involving the replacement for Obamacare. Former U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia made that case on CNN on March 12. ""Well, a CBO in 2010 said that 24 million people would be covered by exchanges by now under Obamacare. That number is 10 million. They were 14 million people off,"" Kingston said. ""I remember years ago looking at the CBO report that in 1964, it was predicted that Medicare would cost $9 billion 10 years later. And I think it was already over $100 billion at that point."" Kingston claimed that he saw a 1964 CBO report that got Medicare wrong, but there’s a major flaw in this statement: The CBO wasn’t formed until 1974.   According to the agency’s own history, the CBO began operating on Feb. 24, 1975, with Alice Rivlin appointed as the first director. Its mission was and is to provide carefully researched, independent budget and economic information to Congress. The CBO was created by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which was sparked by conflict between the legislative and executive branches. Back then, members of Congress objected to President Richard Nixon’s threats of impoundment. In this case, Nixon had refused to spend money on projects he opposed, even though Congress had appropriated the money. The 1974 law affirmed Congress’ constitutional control over the budget by establishing new procedures for controlling impoundments. The law also created new legislative institutions to implement the new congressional budget process: the House and Senate Budget Committees to oversee execution of the budget process, and the Congressional Budget Office to provide the budget committees and Congress with objective, impartial information about budgetary and economic issues. So Kingston was wrong about the CBO. In response to our questions, Kingston acknowledged the error but said he was thinking of a different source. He provided a 2009 article from the Washington Times about the U.S. health plans having a history of cost overruns. ""In 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee estimated that the hospital insurance program of Medicare - the federal health care program for the elderly and disabled - would cost $9 billion by 1990. The actual cost that year was $67 billion,"" the article said.   A 1965 New York Times article explained the new Medicare plan. The new version would include doctors’ fees and drugs, as well as hospitalization. The Washington Post Fact Checker has looked in depth at the old estimates about Medicare. It found that Medicare’s costs were underestimated back in the 1960s, but that nominal dollar figures aren't the best way to look at the program, due to inflation in the 1970s.  Our ruling Kingston said, ""I remember years ago looking at a CBO report that in 1964 predicted that Medicare would cost $9 billion 10 years later. And I think it was already over $100 billion.""  But the CBO wasn't established until 1974. There were estimates, but they were actually made by the House Ways and Means Committee. Comparing the original figures to today is more complicated than just citing the numbers. And the sources for the figures -- the CBO vs. a House committee -- are very different.  When we asked about the misstatement, Kingston acknowledged the error.
