Vermont's former education secretary says governor's pushing statewide vouchers. He’s not.
","When Rebecca Holcombe stepped down as education secretary in March 2018, she went quietly despite apparent rifts with Gov. Phil Scott. When she announced last week that she was running to take Scott’s job, she came out swinging.  ""I joined Gov. Scott’s administration because I took him at his word that he was serious about working to make Vermont more affordable and more equitable. I resigned when I realized that was just talk,"" Holcombe said in a statement announcing her run for governor in 2020.  ""We need to create opportunity for every Vermonter to make our communities stronger,"" she added, ""but unfortunately, Gov. Scott is pushing for a statewide voucher program that would take millions from our public schools and funnel it to private schools that mostly serve privileged families. I simply couldn’t sit quietly by while our governor was pushing policies that left so many Vermonters behind."" It’s no secret that Scott’s positions on education funding are unpopular with Democrats and much of the education community. His proposal to increase staff-to-student ratio in schools — in part by having teachers take on classes outside their expertise — was derided as soon as it arrived in the Statehouse near the end of the 2018 legislative session.  But Holcombe’s claim that Scott is ""pushing for a statewide voucher program"" seemed to open a new line of attack against the governor — one that was sure to strike a nerve with those worried about how Scott’s small-government philosophy will guide his education plans. Such a change would revolutionize the relationship between Vermont communities and their schools. It would essentially create a free market for education, giving parents and guardians an annual voucher and letting them send their children to the school of their choice — independent or public — as opposed to the one in their district.  Seven Days and the Rutland Herald have already looked into Holcombe’s attention-grabbing claim, which is still posted on her campaign website. We decided the first shot fired in the 2020 gubernatorial race was worth putting to the Politifact test.  Holcombe declined to be interviewed on the record about her claim, but sent an emailed statement defending her statement. ""As the Secretary of Education, I spoke weekly with the heads of Gov. Scott’s administration and they made clear that their priority was protecting and expanding private school vouchers, including to schools that don't serve all students,"" she said in an emailed statement Tuesday.  Holcombe also pointed to a memo from her successor as education secretary, Dan French, ""detailing their proposal to create a single statewide school district and statewide voucher program by expanding school choice to non-sectarian independent schools in every part of the state.""  That memo, titled ""Designing Our Future: A Blueprint for Transforming Vermont’s Education System,"" was provided to VTDigger in December and then discussed openly before the State Board of Education in March. According to the memo itself, it was developed with participation from the governor’s office and his cabinet, including the secretaries of Commerce and Community Development, Digital Services and Human Services, the commissioner of Labor. It says in part: ""The system would consist of a single statewide school district. Students would have statewide school choice among all the public schools, technical centers, and non-sectarian independent schools approved by the Agency."" However, the preface to the memo also says: ""This document represents the work of a visioning exercise conducted within the Vermont Agency of Education to begin to imagine the design of a modern education system."" Responding to questions from state board members in March, French said the memo was intended as a starting place for discussion about the future of Vermont schools, rather than a final policy proposal.  French said the two most controversial ideas laid out in his memo — a statewide voucher system and a single statewide school district — were not final answers but rather an effort to spark new ideas to address systemic challenges.  The secretary said he was looking for ways ""to stimulate a conversation and interest in the future around our policy design."" French said Vermont needed to come up with a more efficient way to manage it’s schools, both for cost control and to achieve better student outcomes. ""My conclusion is the system is overly complex, especially when considering the scale of the system, meaning the number of school districts and the number of students,"" he said. ""Complexity is the chief cause of our inefficiency."" One logical solution to the problem of complexity, French said, was a single school district. And in order to give parents maximum flexibility in this system, he added, expanding vouchers would break down barriers within the system.  ""That’s where I come to the school choice idea, it’s not as a philosophy, it’s if we had fewer barriers there’s more flexibility,"" he explained.  ""But the idea would be, well, if you don’t like that conclusion, let’s go back and have a serious conversation about design elements."" So does French’s memo, combined with his appearance at the state board, amount to the Scott administration ""pushing"" a statewide voucher program? Without knowing more about internal conversations that Holcombe may have been a part of, it’s hard to say. But French’s tepid presentation before the board, speaking about a memo explicitly described as a conversation starter, does not amount to the administration pushing policy.  Speaking on Vermont Public Radio on the same week the Blueprint was leaked publicly, Scott said he gave French ""great credit"" for bringing new ideas to the table. But he also suggested such a radical transformation was not the works. ""I don’t think we’re ready for anything like that at this point,"" he said of the single school-district idea. Ethan Latour, a spokesperson for Scott, said in an email this week that the governor supports the expansion of vouchers if that decision is made at the local level.  ""The Governor supports school choice and thinks it’s a valuable tool for parents,"" Latour wrote. ""If the electorate of a school district or supervisory union feels similarly about choice among the schools within its boundaries – and to be clear these are public schools in most cases – the Governor would support those local decisions."" Latour added that the governor would like to see districts that have merged under Act 46 offer school choice to families within those new, sometimes multischool, districts. ""This option, encouraged by current law, increases options for children and parents and helps local education districts preserve and expand academic programs,"" he said.  So it’s clear that Scott does support expanding school choice, though not necessarily on a statewide scale. His usual spokesperson, Rebecca Kelley (who was on vacation this week), clarified earlier this month that the governor ""has not proposed or pursued a statewide voucher program."" Holcome said ""Gov. Scott is pushing for a statewide voucher program that would take millions from our public schools and funnel it to private schools that mostly serve privileged families."" The former education secretary relies on a memo and State Board Meeting in which Scott’s education secretary describes his vision for a statewide voucher program — in both cases with a clearly stated caveat that his proposal is meant to provoke a further conversation.  It’s possible that Scott would like the state to move toward the type of system described in French’s memo, but he hasn’t publicly advocated for it.  Without knowing what Holcombe heard behind closed doors during her time in Scott’s administration, we don’t know whether her statement accurately conveys the administration’s intentions. And Scott is open about his support for expanding vouchers – if communities themselves support the change.   However, there is no publicly available evidence to support Holcombe’s claim that the governor is pushing for a statewide voucher program. In fact, he has said explicitly that he doesn’t support such a major change. We rate this claim mostly false. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097919740>],/factchecks/2019/jul/25/rebecca-holcombe/vermonts-former-education-secretary-says-governors/
"['Border Security', 'Texas', 'Steve McCraw']","
How much has crime gone down at the Texas-Mexico border?
","As Texas lawmakers condemned federal officials for ""not doing their job"" at the U.S.-Mexico border during a July hearing, the state’s top public safety official said state investment at the border has helped cut down on crime. Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said more resources are still needed at the border, but crime has gone down in these communities in recent years. ""I can tell you this, the crime right now, the crime rate on the border — according to the FBI, as it is reported by local officials through the Uniform Crime Reporting Act — is safer than anywhere else in Texas,"" he said. ""Since 2014, when we began operations and now 2018, there was a 25% decrease in crime across the board."" It is well established that, as McCraw said, crime rates tend to be lower in communities along the border than in other parts of the state (or the country). So for this fact-check, we’re looking at the second part of his comment. Have border communities in Texas seen a 25% reduction in crime since 2014? Establishing the parameters of McCraw’s claim Texas DPS spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger provided an image with statistics about crime across the state and in five counties along the Texas-Mexico border. The image cited the Crime in Texas Online Portal, a public-facing database that shows data about crime reported to the state agency from local law enforcement divisions across the state. The same information is collected through the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which McCraw cited in his testimony. This data includes violent crime like murder and rape, as well as property crime like arson or burglary. A quick note about these figures: The FBI stresses that data published through this program should not be used to rank different locations or to evaluate the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies on crime, because ""there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place."" The data provided by Cesinger highlighted the five southernmost Texas counties that border Mexico, just one section of the state’s roughly 1,300-mile border with Mexico. Cesinger did not return a request for comment seeking more information about why McCraw zeroed in on these counties when making his claim. There are 14 counties in Texas that border Mexico, including the five cited by DPS: Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, Webb and Zapata counties. Brewster, El Paso, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Kinney, Maverick, Presidio, Terrell and Val Verde counties also sit along the Texas-Mexico border. Another wrinkle here: DPS has historically defined the border in terms of its statewide regional divisions. Two of the six regions include the 14 counties along the border, so the agency often considers both regions part of the border — all 64 counties. This definition of the border is the broadest. Some counties included are as far as 200 miles from the border. DPS has counted crime statistics from the entire region in fact-sheets on border security activity and in testimony before state lawmakers in the past. McCraw referred to ""the border"" when making his claim. It turns out, according to Cesinger, he was referring to just five counties. We decided to check his claim against three geographic areas: the five southernmost border counties, the 14 counties along the Texas-Mexico border and the 64 counties in DPS’s border region. What do the numbers say? We looked at the same crime figures as DPS to assess this claim, but we also zeroed in on violent crime data, which are commonly used to assess the safety of a particular area. Violent crime figures, which include assault, rape, murder and robbery, are included in the count of overall crime. From 2014 to 2018, the state of Texas as a whole saw a 12.2% reduction in total crime, from about 3,379.7 offenses per 100,000 total population to 2,787.9 offenses. At the same time, violent crime increased by 9.9%. All three border regions we considered also saw a reduction of total crime and violent crime during this time period. We also looked at overall criminal offense data starting in 2010, to get a sense of trends before 2014. From 2010 until 2011, crime in all three border areas increased. Between 2011 and 2013, it stayed relatively level. Starting in 2013, a year before DPS initiated a ""border surge"" operation, crime in all three areas started to decline. The overall decrease in crime was larger in all three areas from 2013 to 2018 than it was from 2014 to 2018. Our ruling McCraw said that between 2014 and 2018, there has been a 25% reduction in crime in communities on the Texas-Mexico border. We looked at three different definitions of the border to test McCraw’s claim. Crime in all three areas declined by about 25% during this time period. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

No evidence Chelsea Clinton is married to George Soros’ nephew

Clinton retweeted Barr — Barr’s tweet has since been deleted — and said: ""Good morning Roseanne - my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soros’s nephews are lovely people. I’m just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world. Have a great day!"" Open Society Foundations is a philanthropic organization founded by Soros.

 Facebook post on immigration misuses an old Trump 'animals' quote
","Amid comparisons of migrant detention centers and concentration camps, some social media users are trying to connect President Donald Trump to Nazis. Using photos of Trump and Adolf Hitler, one Facebook post published on July 22 attributes similar quotes to each man. ""Jews aren’t people, they’re rats,"" the post says Hitler said. It claims Trump, meanwhile, said, ""Immigrants aren’t people, they’re animals.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So were two other posts published on Facebook on July 22.  One claims Hitler said, ""Jews are not people; they are animals,"" while Trump said, ""Undocumented immigrants are not people; they are animals.""  Another features Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister under Hitler in Nazi Germany. ""These are not humans, but animals,"" the post says Goebbels said about those quarantined a Jewish ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland. The post then attributes to Trump this statement allegedly said about asylum-seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2019: ""These aren’t people. These are animals."" What did Trump actually say? He called gang members ""animals,"" not all immigrants.  Here’s what actually happened back in May 2018.  California officials had gathered at the White House for a roundtable on immigration policy Margaret Mims, the sheriff of Fresno County in California, mentioned MS-13 gang members, who are known for committing brutal crimes. California laws made it difficult for her to share information with federal authorities about dangerous criminals like MS-13 gang members, she said. Trump said: ""We have a lot of people coming into our country, or trying to come in — and we’re stopping a lot of them — but we’re taking people out of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before. And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It’s crazy.""  Trump drew fire for the comment, including from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who tweeted: ""Immigrants are not ‘animals.’ The president’s statement was deeply offensive and racist. Immigrants are our family and friends and they make significant contributions to our country.""  But others pointed out that Trump was referencing MS-13 gang members; he wasn’t calling all immigrants ""animals."" The White House later issued a press release titled, ""What you need to know about the violent animals of MS-13"" that described members of the gang as ""animals"" 10 times.  Trump also told a reporter who asked him about the remark that he was referring to ""the MS-13 gangs that are coming in,"" according to the New York Times. When Trump’s comment was more recently used in a misleading tweet alleging Trump called asylum seekers ""animals"" — and shared by Democratic presidential candidates and liberal pundits — we rated the claim False.  Our ruling The Facebook post said that Trump said, ""Immigrants aren’t people, they’re animals."" Word-for-word, that’s wrong. During a roundtable on immigration policy, Trump said: ""These aren’t people. These are animals."" But context matters. Trump was responding to a sheriff who said California laws made it difficult for her to share information with federal authorities about dangerous criminals like MS-13 gang members. Trump also later said that he was referring to gang members.  Trump was criticized for his word-choice, and some interpreted his remarks as a slur directed at all undocumented immigrants.

","Between websites with disclaimers, made-up author names and mocking subsections, satirical articles can usually be spotted from a mile away.

No, the first American president wasn’t a black man named John Hanson
","A story making the rounds on Facebook is challenging what Americans know about the first president of their country. Liberty Writers Africa, a website that publishes articles about African history and culture, ran a story April 3 with the headline: ""The First American President Was A Black Man — Not George Washington."" The article’s lead graphic shows a seated black man next to a $2 bill, on which one person is circled. ""George Washington, as many don’t know, was not the first President of the United States,"" the article claims. ""The first President of the United States was one John Hanson, and he was a black man. Or it can be said that he had African genes."" The article includes several embedded photos of the $2 bill that highlight a darker figure, purportedly Hanson. As children, most Americans are taught that Washington was the first U.S. president. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, and we looked into it. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No surprise here: Liberty Writers Africa’s article doesn’t check out. Evidence from the Library of Congress shows that Washington was the first official president of the U.S. That’s not to say the website completely made somebody up. There are actually two men named John Hanson who were important to early U.S. history — but the article mixes them up, and neither was president. PolitiFact reached out to Liberty Writers Africa for the source of their claim through the website, but we haven’t heard back. We’ll update this article if we do. The claim in question had already been debunked by other fact-checkers, including Snopes and History.com. The former published its fact-check way back in 2001. But we still wanted to take a closer look at the lives of both John Hansons — and figure out who’s pictured on the back of the $2 bill. The first notable John Hanson we could find in American history lived from either 1715  or 1721 until 1783 — official sources disagree on his date of birth. A white man from Maryland, Hanson served as a member of the Continental Congress from 1780-1782. He was a signer of the Articles of Confederation when it was ratified in 1781 by the original 13 states. The document served as a precursor for the U.S. Constitution, which was first drafted in 1787. (Painting by Johan Hesselius circa 1770) In accordance with the Articles of Confederation, Hanson was elected the president of the Continental Congress on Nov. 5, 1781. Another seven ""presidents"" followed in subsequent years. The Articles of Confederation were replaced in 1789 by the current U.S. Constitution.  Some have argued that Hanson was the first president of the U.S. Seymour Wemyss Smith’s 1932 biography titled ""John Hanson, Our first president,"" is unequivocal on this point: ""John Hanson was undeniably the First President after we were a free people..."" he begins in his preface.  But this misconstrues the modern meaning of the word ""president."" Prior to the ratification of the Constitution, ""the presidency did not exist as an executive position separate from Congress,"" History.com wrote in its article about Hanson. Moreover, Hanson wasn’t the first person to hold the office of a president under the Articles of Confederation. Samuel Huntington was the president of the Continental Congress from 1779 until 1781, when the Articles were ratified. Hanson was the first president to serve a one-year term in office under the Articles. The white John Hanson was president of the Continental Congress after the Articles of Confederation were ratified. But who was the other John Hanson? A black man associated with the American Colonization Society, Hanson was a former slave who migrated to Liberia in the mid-1800s. The ACS was formed in 1817 ""to send free African-Americans to Africa as an alternative to emancipation in the United States.""  (Photo by Augustus Washington, circa 1856) Hanson arrived in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1827. He became a merchant and later a politician, serving two terms in the newly created Liberian Senate. He died in 1860 — without ever having served in office in the U.S. So there were two John Hansons important to American history — one black, one white. Neither was the first president of the U.S.  But who is the person who appears to be darker than the rest pictured on the back of the $2 bill? To answer that, we have to go back to 1786.  That’s the year that John Trumbull, an American artist famous for his depictions of U.S. history, started working on a painting that depicts the presentation of the first draft of the Declaration of Independence to the Second Continental Congress. There are 47 portraits in Trumbull’s painting, all painted from life or ""life portraits."" The work was placed in the Capitol rotunda in 1826. Trumbull’s piece was the basis for the art on the back of the $2 bill Americans use today. The vignette was added in 1976 and includes only 42 portraits due to size constraints.  That’s not the only difference. Side-by-side comparisons show that the seated man appears to be darker on the back of the $2 bill than in Trumbull’s original painting.  (Illustration by Daniel Funke) But based on his outline and the pose he’s in, it’s safe to say that it’s the same person in both renderings. It’s possible the darker shade could have something to do with the way the bill was printed in monochrome. According to the government’s key to the painting, the man pictured is Robert Morris, a wealthy financier known as the ""financier of the American Revolution."" He served in the Continental Congress and, later, the Senate. He also signed the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution before dying in 1806. A story from Liberty Writers Africa claims that the first president of the United States was a black man named John Hanson. As evidence, it cites photos of a purported African American on the back of the $2 bill. Government documents show that there were two John Hansons — one white, one black. The former was the first president of the Continental Congress, while the latter was a senator in Liberia. Neither was the first modern president of the U.S. The dark man pictured the back of the $2 bill is Robert Morris, a Founding Father. Liberty Writers Africa’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809675AE80>],/factchecks/2019/jul/25/blog-posting/no-first-american-president-wasnt-black-man-named-/

Have Trump judicial nominees refused to say Brown vs. Board was properly decided?
","President Donald Trump’s attacks against four Democratic congresswomen of color resulted in condemnation from the Democrat-led House and a wave of commentary on the Sunday shows. Roland Martin, a journalist and news show host, said on ABC’s ""This Week"" that the president’s rhetoric can be linked to a ""broader issue"" with the Republican Party and its policies.  ""When you have Republicans who are advancing federal judges who won't even say that Brown vs. Board of Education was properly decided … you have a party that is driving policies at supporting these sort of racist appeals,"" Martin said July 21 in a panel discussion. We wondered if Republicans really have advanced federal judges who haven’t signaled clear support for Brown vs. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision that ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. Martin is right, but he leaves out the context of the judicial nominees’ refusals to comment. Martin pointed to the Twitter accounts of three civil rights activists who have been tracking the statements — or lack thereof — by Trump judicial nominees on Brown vs. Board. ""We’ve covered this for months,"" he said, citing articles from Slate, Mother Jones, ABC News, the Washington Post, NPR and USA Today as further evidence in support of his claim. According to those reports and a list compiled by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a nonprofit legislative advocacy group, more than 20 currently pending Trump nominees declined to state unequivocally that they believed the case was correctly decided during hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The first was Wendy Vitter, whom the Senate confirmed as a federal district judge in Louisiana in May, without a single Democratic vote. ""I don’t mean to be coy, but I think I get into a difficult, difficult area when I start commenting on Supreme Court decisions — which are correctly decided and which I may disagree with,"" Vitter said during her confirmation hearing in April 2018.  Pressed further, she said, ""Again, I’ll respectfully not comment on what could be my boss’s ruling, the Supreme Court. I would be bound by it, and if I start commenting on, ‘I agree with this case,’ or ‘don’t agree with this case,’ I think we get into a slippery slope."" Other then-nominees such as Judges Andrew Oldham and Neomi Rao followed her lead (and were confirmed without any Democratic votes). Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Ct., who frequently asks Trump nominees about Brown vs. Board, asked Oldham and Rao multiple times if they think the case was ""correctly decided."" Both said it would be inappropriate for a lower court nominee to take a stance on any particular Supreme Court decision.  ""Even the most universally accepted court case is outside the bounds of a federal judge to comment on,"" Oldham said, refusing more than once to offer his two cents. Rao also danced around Blumenthal’s repeated questions, saying the case was ""a really important precedent of the Supreme Court,"" but adding, ""As a judicial nominee, I think it’s not appropriate for me to comment on the correctness of particular precedents."" It’s worth noting that Vitter, Oldham, Rao and other nominees who dodged the question did not say they believed Brown vs. Board was ruled incorrectly.  Some Trump nominees have said they would not weigh in on any established Supreme Court precedent. Others, such as Ada Brown, who has yet to be confirmed, have cited a judicial canon that says judges ""should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court."" It’s also possible some have feared that voicing an opinion on Brown vs. Board would open them up to similar lines of questioning about other major Supreme Court rulings, such as Roe vs. Wade, which established a legal right to abortion. Whatever the reason, it’s still true, as Martin claimed, that they stopped short of ""say(ing) that Brown vs. Board of Education was properly decided."" However, Buzzfeed News reported in June that some of Trump’s more recent nominees have endorsed Brown vs. Board in their hearings. According to that report, five of the six nominees at a May 22 hearing said the decision, or the legal reasoning behind it, was correct. Several current Supreme Court justices have also stated their support for Brown vs. Board during confirmation hearings.  Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. endorsed the decision, and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh called it ""inspirational"" and ""the single greatest moment in Supreme Court history,"" according to the Washington Post. Justice Neil Gorsuch, on the other hand, resisted questions about specific Supreme Court precedents during his confirmation hearing. But even he ultimately told Blumenthal, ""We’re on the same page on Brown vs. Board of Education, senator. It’s a great and important decision."" For what it’s worth, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen also avoided giving a clear answer on whether he believes the case was properly decided during his own nomination hearing. He was confirmed by the Senate, again without a single Democratic vote, in May.  Martin said Republicans ""are advancing federal judges who won't even say that Brown vs. Board of Education was properly decided."" A number of Trump judicial nominees have refused to give clear answers when asked if they thought Brown vs. Board of Education — the decision that ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional — was correctly decided. It’s important to note they haven't said it was wrongly decided; rather, they have refused to comment on Supreme Court precedents.  Those nominees have been advanced largely along party lines. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F32100>],/factchecks/2019/jul/25/roland-martin/have-trump-judicial-nominees-refused-comment-brown/

","Megan Rapinoe, a forward on the U.S. women’s national team that won the World Cup this summer, drew the ire of some Americans — including the president — after she said she wouldn’t visit the White House. Now, she’s under scrutiny for disrespecting the flag.   ""This is Kelley O’Hara,"" began a July 8 Facebook post with a photo of one of Rapinoe’s teammates. ""She is the women’s soccer player who rushed to rescue the American flag after it was thrown down on the field and stomped on by her idiot teammates. Kelli Ohara (sic) is the true face of real feminism. Lets (sic) make HER famous instead of the square jawed haters with the bad dye jobs dissing the flag for attention.""  The reference to bad dye jobs is an apparent dig at Rapinoe, whose blonde hair was purple during the World Cup matches. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Your video assistant referees at PolitiFact are here to help sift fact from fiction.  The post echoes a tweet from former Navy SEAL Jonathan Gilliam, who on July 7 posted a video clip of Rapinoe and players Allie Long and Alex Morgan celebrating after their World Cup win. (You can watch the clip here.) ""You should be disturbed by this unpatriotic narcissistic behavior,"" he wrote. ""@mPinoe is neither a hero or a role model. I rewound and watched the entire celebration on the field. Rapinoe didn’t want anything to do with an #Americanflag before she stomped it. @repulsive"" You should be disturbed by this unpatriotic narcissistic behavior. @mPinoe is neither a hero or a role model. I rewound and watched the entire celebration on the field. Rapinoe didn’t want anything to do with an #Americanflag before she stomped it. #repulsive pic.twitter.com/Kevbe7jJYt When the clip begins, Long is holding the trophy in one hand and an American flag in the other. She hands the trophy to Rapinoe and then drops the flag as she, Rapinoe and Morgan begin what looks like a choreographed move that ends with them throwing their hands in the air. Rapinoe’s foot appears to come into contact with the flag as the players start shuffling forward but O’Hara darts into the frame and Long picks the flag back up and hands it to her. The incident received some news coverage, including from Fox News, which reported that ""Long came under fire for briefly dropping the American flag during her celebration with Golden Boot winner and outspoken Trump critic Megan Rapinoe."" Fox doesn’t say that any of the players stomped on the flag. And here, we think words matter. While it’s true that Long dropped the flag on the ground for a few seconds during the team’s celebration, to say that players stomped on it suggests something more sinister than what took place.  But more than that, it doesn’t appear that anyone even stepped on the flag. After Rapinoe takes a step forward, Long is able to pick it up. In the Facebook post’s comments, some Facebook users cheered O’Hara on. But others were skeptical of how the account had framed what happened on the field after the U.S. team beat the Netherlands 2-0.  ""Thank you for picking up our flag,"" one man said. ""I watched that video a couple times. I never saw any of those girls step on the flag. Kelley got it before they could. I won’t pretend to see something to make liberals look bad. I don’t have too (sic). They do enough obvious stuff.""

No, a Trump supporter wasn’t mocking a dead migrant child
","In June, a photograph of the bodies of a Salvadoran migrant and his nearly 2-year-old daughter who drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande river spread on social media amid debates over migration to the United States.  Not long after, another image was shared online. In this photo, a woman is holding an illustration of the father and daughter’s bodies below the word ""caution"" on a yellow sign. She’s smiling and sitting among others, including people standing behind her and aiming their cameras at something out of the frame. Some social media users quickly jumped to a partisan conclusion. ""A Trump supporter at his rally today,"" reads a July 4 Facebook post with the photo. ""Mocking a dead child. This is what human garbage looks like.""  This post, which was shared more than 4,000 times by July 24, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because while the photo is authentic, the Facebook post mischaracterizes what’s happening. The woman was saddened by the drowning of the father and daughter and in an interview with a reporter that was later posted on Twitter, she explains why she’s holding the sign. Though it’s hard to hear everything she says in the video due to background noise, it’s clear she’s not mocking a dead child. Here’s what we know.  The woman was at President Donald Trump’s Fourth of July event on the National Mall. Her photo was taken and shared on Twitter by Alejandro Alvarez, a journalist and photographer with the Washington, D.C., radio station WTOP. Alvarez was covering the president’s ""Salute to America"" event and his reporting included both Trump supporters and protesters. Among the images he tweeted that day was one of a group posing in front of an inflatable diapered baby meant to look like Trump. Alvarez also shared the photo of the woman with the caution sign. He explained the image like this text: ""Shocked by an image of a father and daughter dead on the Rio Grande, Jill from Boulder, CO shows me a dark(er) twist on border-region safety signs warning of immigrants crossing roads."" He’s referring to real immigrant crossing signs that have been used to warn drivers to watch for migrants running across the road. His tweet suggests that the woman’s sign is a commentary on immigration policies. At the least, we know she’s not mocking a dead child.  But social media users recast the image and rallied to try to identify the woman they claimed was a Trump supporter making light of migrant deaths. MintPress News reporter Alex Rubinstein, who interviewed the woman that day, tweeted screenshots of some of those reactions on Twitter, including one user who said: ""Let’s identify and shame this heartless woman who thinks the death of a toddler and her father is some kind of joke.""  Rubinstein also tweeted the video interview he had with the woman.  ""This woman’s sign has generated a bit of controversy on the internet today, so I decided to post my interview with her from earlier,"" Rubinstein wrote. ""She tells the story of the father and his 2-year-old from El Salvador who drowned trying to make it to the U.S. ‘It makes me really sad,’ she said.""  Rubinstein asks the woman about the sign, and she explains what happened to the father and daughter — how they drowned trying to come to the United States — and how her sign was inspired by the road signs showing migrants crossing the road.  ""And now we’ve got them literally drowning,"" she says, adding that they’re immigrating to try to find a better life. When Rubinstein asks her why that’s an important message for the Fourth of July, the woman says: ""America is made up of immigrants."" Unless you’re Native American, she says, you’re descended from immigrants. The Fourth should be a celebration of ""us coming over,"" she says. She goes on to say that she’s sad ""by what’s going on"" and mentions ""the children in the cages,"" a reference to the detention of migrant children at the border.    Rubinstein went on to tweet that people were trying to dox the woman because of her sign. But, he said, ""I’m not sure how anyone can interpret it as an endorsement of Trump’s border policies - just on its face - but the least they could do is take some time to look into the matter before trying to ruin her life.""  He tweeted again later: ""There’s a huge Twitter mob trying to doxx this woman. Agree with the sign or not, it’s clear that she is AGAINST Trump’s border policies. If you see people trying to doxx her, please correct the record by posting my interview in reply.""   Our ruling This Facebook post claims that the woman in the picture is a Trump supporter ""mocking a dead child."" We don’t know the woman’s political affiliation. But it’s clear from reporting and her own words that she is not mocking a dead migrant child. Rather, she talks about how she’s saddened by what’s happening at the border, and how we should celebrate the United States as a country of immigrants.

Facebook post on deaths of 6 people from Ferguson stretches what’s known
","The 2014 riots in Ferguson, Mo., began the day after 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by policeman Darren Wilson. The shooting sparked a national debate about the relationship between law enforcement and African-Americans and the use of deadly force. Ferguson is in the social media spotlight nearly five years later, as people connected to the protests have been found dead.  One Facebook post, shared more than 3,500 times, cries foul play, saying that the deaths of ""six of the most prominent activists"" was no coincidence as they were all found ""burned to death in their cars,"" implying that they were victims of a larger conspiracy theory.  The full post reads:  ""I need people to wake up and realise that SIX of the most prominent activists during the Ferguson riots have all been found burned to death in their cars. There are no coincidences here. It’s systemic.""  The July 15 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what we found: Some people involved in the Ferguson protests, or connected to people who were, have died since 2014. But they were not all found burned to death in their cars as the post claims. The other cases were ruled as suicides, an accidental drowning and a fentanyl overdose. Let’s break this down. DeAndre Joshua On Nov. 24, 2014, the morning after a grand jury declined to indict Wilson, 20-year-old DeAndre Joshua was found dead, reportedly inside a burned car after being shot in the head. The timing, as well as Joshua reportedly being close friends with Dorian Johnson, who was with Michael Brown on the day of the shooting, led many to speculate if the events were connected. But Joshua’s family dispelled rumors that he was a ""key witness"" in Brown’s case, saying in a New York Times article ""he had known nothing about Mr. Brown’s death and never testified before the grand jury."" Shawn Gray Shawn Gray, a 23-year-old who went missing the same week Joshua died, was later found drowned in the River Des Peres. The city’s medical examiner later ruled that the cause of death was an accidental drowning, with alcohol poisoning as a major contributing factor, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported. There were unproven rumors that Gray, like Joshua, was killed after testifying in front of a grand jury in the Brown case. But Gray’s family also dismissed those rumors, saying he had no connection to the case.  Neither Joshua nor Gray were ""prominent activists."" It’s important to note that even if both men had testified, their deaths came after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson. Darren Seals In September 2016, 29-year-old Darren Seals suffered a similar death to Joshua: his body was found inside a burning car after having been shot. Seals was a prominent figure in the protests and is seen in a video comforting Brown’s mother after the grand jury’s decision. At the time of Seals’ death, St. Louis County police acknowledged the similarities of the tragedies and told outlets ""anything’s a possibility"" and that detectives are ""always going to look into different avenues, or if it’s the same kind of motive.""   Sgt. Benjamin Granda, a St. Louis County Police Department spokesman, confirmed to PolitiFact that the agency investigated both homicides. ""There is no information that exists that would indicate they are related in any way,"" Granda wrote in an email. ""Gunshot wounds were identified as the cause of death of both victims. Both investigations remain ongoing. We always remind people to please contact the St. Louis County Police Department at (636)529-8210 to speak to investigators regarding the incident.""  Of the three remaining deaths, two have been ruled as suicides and one an overdose. If you or someone you know needs emotional support, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 1-800-273-8255 Edward Crawford Jr.  Edward Crawford Jr., 27, was featured in a famous photograph from Ferguson throwing a gas canister back at police. Police determined that he died by suicide in May 2017. Danye Jones In October 2018, 24-year-old Danye Jones was found dead in the yard of his St. Louis home. It was ruled a suicide. Jones’ mother, Melissa McKinnies, who was an active Ferguson demonstrator, said in a TV interview she thought it was foul play. Bassem Masri The latest death happened in November 2018 when Bassem Masri, a 31-year-old Palestinian-American who livestreamed videos of the Ferguson protests, was found unresponsive on a bus. Toxicology results showed he died of a fentanyl overdose. A seventh man who died in February 2016 has sometimes been included in this theory. Ferguson protestor and Black Lives Matter activist MarShawn McCarrell II, 23, of Columbus, Ohio, reportedly died by suicide involving a gun outside of the Ohio statehouse. A news investigation’s findings ""This American Life,"" a weekly public radio program produced in collaboration with Chicago Public Media, aired a segment on the conspiracy theory in March 2019. Writer Jelani Cobb traveled to Ferguson to speak with the community and found people pondered ""all kinds of possible culprits … from white supremicists to local and federal law enforcement, to armed militia members"" to explain the deaths. Cobb went over some ways in which the theory doesn’t quite hold up: ""St. Louis proper has one of the most alarming homicide rates in the country. In 2017, it was the most alarming, having the highest murder rate, according to an analysis of FBI data. By comparison, Chicago was No. 9. So, lots of people get shot in St. Louis."" A viral Facebook post says six ""of the most prominent activists during the Ferguson riots have all been found burned to death in their cars. There are no coincidences here. It’s systemic.""  Multiple people directly and indirectly connected to the Ferguson protests have died in the nearly five years since Brown’s death, but not all were involved in the Brown case, as unproven rumors claimed. They were also not all discovered ""burned to death in their cars."" Suicide, accidental drowning and drug overdose were also listed as official causes of death. This claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809718EB80>],/factchecks/2019/jul/25/facebook-posts/facebook-post-deaths-6-people-ferguson-stretches-w/

A look at whether Robert Mueller broke the rules for special counsels
","Texas Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe delivered a sharp rebuke to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s handling of obstruction of justice in his report. During Mueller’s testimony on Capitol Hill July 24, Ratcliffe said the entire section went beyond the rules for special counsels and broke with the presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  ""You wrote 180 pages about ... potential crimes that were not charged or decided,"" Ratcliffe said. ""Now respectfully, by doing that you managed to violate the most sacred of traditions of prosecutors not offering extra prosecutorial analysis about potential crimes that are not charged."" Ratcliffe emphasized, ""You didn’t follow the special counsel regulations. It clearly says write a confidential report about decisions reached. Nowhere in here does it say write a report about decisions that were not reached."" But experts say Mueller followed the rules to the letter. ""Ratcliffe is making a pretty strained reading of the DOJ regulations,"" said University of St. Thomas law professor Mark Osler.  Federal regulations say, ""At the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.""  ""It clearly includes declinations, which is taking no action,"" Osler said. Ratcliffe also erred about the need to avoid ""extra prosecutorial analysis about potential crimes that are not charged,"" said Ric Simmons at Ohio State University College of Law. ""Mueller was offering evidence that could be used if the attorney general did in fact decide to charge him,"" Simmons said. ""Not only is that not barred, it is precisely the kind of evidence that Mueller would be expected to bring to give proper advice to the attorney general."" Doubling down on that, Saikrishna Prakash, professor at the University of Virginia, said ""nothing in the American legal system precludes a prosecutor from commenting upon a case she investigated."" Ratcliffe confuses the content of the report with the publication of it. Mueller was required to give a full report to Attorney General William Barr. It was Barr’s decision to release any portion of it, not Mueller’s. If Ratcliffe has an issue, it is with Barr, though we should note there was immense public pressure on Barr to release the report. Ratcliffe said Mueller overstepped the rules for prosecutors by writing about potential crimes that were not charged. This is wrong. Federal regulations specifically require special prosecutors to explain their decisions not to prosecute. That explanation goes to the attorney general, who then decides what to make public. We found no legal scholar who agreed with Ratcliffe. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097793040>],/factchecks/2019/jul/24/john-ratcliffe/look-whether-robert-mueller-broke-rules-special-co/

Facebook post compares votes by Rand Paul, Ilhan Omar on Sept. 11 victim compensation fund
","Over the past few weeks, misinformation and personal attacks targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., have made headlines.  Most notably, President Donald Trump said that Omar, a U.S. citizen who immigrated as a Somali refugee, said that al-Qaida was ""wonderful."" PolitiFact rated Trump’s statement False — he twisted her words.  On Facebook, some users are pushing back against the notion that Omar has downplayed attacks by terrorist groups. A photo published on Facebook July 21 claims that Omar ""voted yes to provide further funding for the 9/11 First Responders Victims Fund,"" while Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky ""voted no."" ""Who hates America again?"" reads the photo, which includes headshots of both politicians and was shared hundreds of times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, so we wanted to check it out. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) PolitiFact reached out to the Facebook user who shared the photo asking for their source. We’ll update this story if we hear back. Congress created the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund in 2001 to pay the people and relatives harmed or killed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The original program operated until 2004. The fund was revived between 2011 and 2016 with the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. In December 2015, President Barack Obama signed a bill that extended the fund until 2020. For the past several months, lawmakers have been deciding whether to extend the fund through 2090 — and Paul has come under attack for his action on the bill. A quick Google search for the Victim Compensation Fund surfaced several recent articles about how Paul blocked the Senate from extending the fund July 17. The House passed the bill July 12. We checked footage from the session. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., asked the Senate to pass the bill without debate, and Paul objected.  ""It has long been my feeling that we need to address our massive debt in this country,"" he said. ""Therefore any spending that we are approaching, any new program that's going to have the longevity of 70, 80 years, should be offset by cutting spending that’s less valuable. We need to, at the very least, have this debate."" The senator’s objection delayed a vote on the bill to July 23. Rand’s move didn’t technically constitute a vote — he was objecting to Gillibrand’s motion to pass the bill without debate and put it on the unanimous consent docket. It would be more accurate to say he stalled the bill’s passage, even if that did effectively kill the legislation for the time being. The Facebook post was shared before the Senate took its full vote. On July 23, Rand and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, were the two senators who voted against the bill. Both proposed amendments; Rand’s would have required offsets for money spent on the fund, and Lee’s would have restricted the extension to 10 years. Both were defeated in roll call votes. As for Omar, we checked the voting record and found that the congresswoman voted in favor of the bill July 12. A Facebook photo claims Omar ""voted yes"" to pass a bill extending the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund while Sen. Rand Paul ""voted no."" The congressional voting record shows that Omar did vote for the measure in the House. At the time the photo was published, Paul objected to a motion to pass the bill in the Senate without debate. The move did not technically constitute a nay vote, but it did effectively halt the legislation. Later, he did officially vote against the bill — he was one of two Republican votes against it.

Bill Stanley errs in boast about Va. concealed gun permit holders
","State Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, recently offered an eye-popping statistic about Virgnians with concealed-carry permits for guns. ""How many people with a concealed-carry permit have committed a crime in Virginia? Do you know the answer to that?"" Stanley asked during a July 9 interview on The John Fredericks Show, a conservative radio broadcast.  ""The answer is zero,"" Stanley said. , Knowing that Virginia has issued hundreds of thousands of concealed-carry permits, we decided to fact-check Stanley’s claim.  Stanley, an ardent defender of gun rights, made the claim hours before the General Assembly held a special session July 9  to consider gun control measures proposed by Gov. Ralph Northam in response to a May 31 mass shooting at the Virginia Beach Civic Center that killed 12 and the gunman. Republicans adjourned the session in 90 minutes without considering any bills. Northam didn’t propose restricting concealed-carry laws. Stanley brought up the subject to make a point that legal gun owners are a law-abiding group and shouldn’t be saddled with new gun control measures. Concealed carry Virginia, with few exceptions, allows people 18 or older to openly carry firearms. But carrying a concealed weapon requires a circuit court permit. To get a permit, a gun owner must be at least 21 and ""demonstrate competence"" with a handgun by meeting criteria for firearm training. The applicant also must pass a background check. Permits are issued for five years. There were 642,396 Virginians with concealed-carry permits at the end of June, according to the Virginia State Police. The state police also keeps statistics on Virginia crime. But they don’t collect data on crimes by concealed-carry permit holders, according to Corinne Geller, public relations director for the state police. We also asked Philip Van Cleave, president of the pro-gun Virginia Citizens Defense League, if he knew of any statistics about crimes committed by concelealed-carry permit holders arrested in Virginia. His didn’t.  There is a way, however, to drill closer to Stanley’s claim of ""zero"" by looking at another data set kept by the state police: the number of concealed-carry permits revoked each year. State law lists a number of reasons for rescinding a concealed weapon permit. Some involve mental issues. Permits are also taken away from people dishonorably discharged from the military. But most of the reasons are for breaking laws. They include: The numbers During the 2019 fiscal year - ending June 30 - state police records show 464 concealed carry permits were revoked. In fiscal 2018, 583 were rescinded. Since fiscal 2010, 7,330 permits were taken away - an average of 733 a year.   The state police, as we’ve noted, don’t record reasons for the revocations. But for Stanley’s claim to be true, none of the reasons for these thousands of revocations would involve crime.  Stanley told us he misspoke on radio and meant to say that none of the gunmen in Virginia mass shootings - including Virginia and Virginia Tech in 2007 - had concealed carry permits. ""I didn’t mean that  permit holders haven’t committed petty or serious crimes, but I guess I did,"" he said. In Virginia and across the country, many gun supporters say that permit holders are far more law abiding than the general public. They point to Texas, which keeps the most comprehensive records among the 50 states that allow concealed-carry. Almost 1.4 million Texans had permits at the end of 2018, according to records from the state’s Department of Public Safety. That’s 4.7 percent of the population, or 1 of 22 people.  In comparison, 41,180 people were convicted of felonies in Texas last year, but only 163 of them had concealed-carry permits. That’s .004 percent of felony convictions, or 1 of every 250. Although statistics don’t exist to make a similar comparison in Virginia, it can be said that less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the state’s concealed carriers had their permits revoked last fiscal year, or fewer than 1 of every 1,000. Ruling Stanley said concealed-carry permit holders have committed ""zero"" crimes in Virginia.  The state police don’t keep such records. Van Cleave, one of the most knowledgeable defenders of guns in Virginia, says he’s unaware such statistics exist. Evidence from Texas, which keeps the most comprehensive data, shows its permit holders are far more law abiding than the general public. Even so, 163 Texas permit holders were convicted of felonies last year. We credit Stanley for acknowledging he misspoke, but we have to rate his original radio statement. It was False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4CBBC0>],/factchecks/2019/jul/24/bill-stanley/theres-no-proof-bill-stanleys-claim-about-va-conce/

Can the fentanyl seized by officials at U.S. borders kill every American seven times over?
","The United States is experiencing a major influx of a synthetic opioid called fentanyl, and the drug is being blamed for a surge in deaths.  Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that of the more than 100,000 people who died from drug overdoses in the U.S. between May 2020 and April 2021, almost two-thirds were linked to fentanyl or similar synthetic opioids. In an April 1 press release, U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., raised the alarm about fentanyl being smuggled into the United States. ""In Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21), 11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized by Customs and Border Protection, which is enough to kill every American nearly seven times over,"" Tenney said.  Tenney argued that the Biden administration should back off its intention to terminate Title 42, a public health order that has been in place since March 2020 that allows officials to expel migrants at U.S. land borders to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. (On April 26, the administration said it would abide by a judge’s order to keep Title 42 in place for now.)  We won’t offer a view on whether extending Title 42 would reduce the prevalence of fentanyl in the United States. However, we decided to take a closer look at Tenney’s statement about fentanyl and how deadly it is. Tenney’s office did not respond to requests for comment. On the scale of fentanyl confiscations, Tenney correctly cited the data. U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures show that 11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized nationwide during fiscal year 2021, just as Tenney said. This represented an increase of 134% over the previous fiscal year. Most of it was seized at the southwest border at official ports of entry. But could it really kill every American nearly seven times over? There’s little question that fentanyl is a deadly substance. It’s up to 50 times more powerful than heroin, and up to 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the CDC. Many overdoses are occurring because ""drug dealers have been mixing fentanyl with other drugs including heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine"" due to its low cost and potency, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. This heightens the risk of a fatal dose. Experts say that two milligrams is a widely accepted lethal dose for fentanyl.  To vet Tenney’s math, we reached out to Lewis S. Nelson, a professor and chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and director of its division of medical toxicology.  Tenney’s numbers, Nelson said, are basically on target.  Nelson said that 11,201 pounds amounts to 5,080,688 grams, or 5,080,688,000 milligrams. If 2 milligrams is a lethal dose, then the amount seized would equal 2,540,344,000 lethal doses. The projected U.S. population for 2022 is roughly 332.4 million, so the amount seized would be enough to kill every American 7.64 times over, which is close to what Tenney said. There’s one caveat: There is some variation in the lethal dose for body size and tolerance from past exposure.  In 2019, in looking at a similar claim, PolitiFact West Virginia interviewed Timothy J. Pifer, the director of the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory and a specialist on fentanyl and its lethality. He said that some bigger individuals with higher levels of past exposure might only die with a 3-milligram dose, rather than 2 milligrams. In addition, Pifer said, how pure the fentanyl is can make a difference in its lethality.  In all, these variations could change the math on the margins. Still, simply taking the statement as a way to understand the scope of the fentanyl being seized, Tenney’s calculations are reasonable. Tenney said that in 2021, ""11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized by Customs and Border Protection, which is enough to kill every American nearly seven times over."" She is correct that 11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized nationwide in 2021, and she’s essentially accurate about how deadly that supply could be. Using a standard fatal dose of 2 milligrams, the amount seized in 2021 would have been enough to kill every American 7.64 times over. The fatal dose could vary depending on body size, past exposure to fentanyl, and purity, possibly affecting the calculation on the margins. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809702FD00>],/factchecks/2022/apr/27/claudia-tenney/can-fentanyl-seized-border-kill-every-american-sev/

Johnson benefited from tax cut, but it's not a loophole
","As a two-term incumbent, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has a record to run on – and to run against. In addition to Democratic contenders, a series of opposition groups are mining that record to make the case against Johnson. Into that fray comes Opportunity Wisconsin, which describes itself as representing Wisconsin residents in the fight for economic equity.  The group launched a TV ad in February that opens with the words ""Dereliction of Duty"" on the screen, and features a man identified only as ""William B."" a U.S. Air Force veteran. Speaking to the camera, the man lays out a three-part claim, complete with footnotes on the screen: ""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office."" It appears as a simple string of interconnected facts, all based on past reporting. But it comes with its own series of caveats and asterisks that muddy the truth of the claim. Let’s start with the first part of the claim – the ""tax loophole"" – and rewind back to 2017.  That's when former President Donald Trump proposed a tax overhaul that included a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a repeal of the requirement that all U.S. citizens have health insurance.  To get the measure through the Senate, Trump needed the full support of Republicans, but Johnson announced he would not back the measure.  Johnson insisted that the measure include a tax break for so-called ""pass-through"" companies – those that pass all their income on to the owners or investors. Companies structured this way (often small, family owned businesses) are not subject to corporate income tax. In the end, the provision was added to the package, and it passed the Senate with Johnson’s support. To be sure, Johnson’s family-owned business fell into that pass-through category, as did those of many key supporters.  Nevertheless, Opportunity Wisconsin missteps when it calls the change a ""loophole"" – the change was well-publicized at the time. And the group mischaracterizes the situation when it suggests the primary beneficiary was Johnson and his family. Indeed, of the 26 million businesses in the nation in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, according to a May 15, 2017 article published by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. But, even that asterisk warrants a footnote. A ProPublica investigation, published Aug. 11, 2021, found ""that Johnson’s last-minute maneuver benefited two families more than almost any others in the country — both worth billions and both among the senator’s biggest donors."" The article noted: ""Dick and Liz Uihlein of packaging giant Uline, along with roofing magnate Diane Hendricks, together had contributed around $20 million to groups backing Johnson’s 2016 reelection campaign."" Finally, in a recording obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, in which Johnson addressed a group of donors on April 8, 2022 in Medford, Johnson acknowledged that he and others benefitted, framing it this way:   ""Now, did my business benefit? Sure. Did some of my donor businesses? Sure. When you give tax relief to everybody, everybody benefits.""  This part of the claim, on the sale of the business, is the most straightforward. Johnson’s family-run company – Pacur LLC, an Oshkosh-based plastics company – was created by Johnson along with his brother-in-law in 1979. Johnson was CEO of Pacur LLC until he was elected to the Senate in 2010.  He sold his interest in the company to Gryphon Investors in 2020 for between $5 million and $20 million, according to federal disclosure reports, which only provide a range. He acknowledged he was in talks about a deal to sell as late as 2018 – so, after the tax measure passed the Senate. The $5 million cited by Opportunity Wisconsin is on the low-end of the range. The actual sale price is unknown, as Johnson is not required to disclose it. For the final part of the statement – on Johnson’s wealth doubling – Opportunity Wisconsin said it based its calculations of Johnson’s wealth on the methodology used by OpenSecrets, the Congressional Integrity Project and NBC News. Here’s how we broke down those numbers: When Johnson was elected in November 2010, his financial disclosure forms showed assets of between $17,062,029 and $76,836,000. The midpoint of that range is $46,949,015.  In 2011, when Johnson took office, his disclosures showed assets (with no liabilities) totaling between $8,767,016 and $38,743,000. The midpoint of that range is $23,755,008. So, a lot depends on the starting point.  Fast forward to his 2020 disclosure. In it Johnson’s net worth totalled between $16,951,012 and $79,117,002, with a midpoint of $48,034,007. This means Johnson more than doubled his wealth. The disclosure forms only provide a range, so precise figures cannot be obtained. But, in any case, Johnson does not dispute it. Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: ""When I got elected, I took all my marketable securities (and) I turned them into cash. I’ve just been sitting on cash. The reason my wealth doubled is I finally sold my business. I cashed out on that. … I sat on cash, I'm still sitting on cash."" Johnson also noted that since he took office, that Standard & Poors 500 Index nearly quadrupled. ""I knew during the COVID recession, this is a really good time to invest (in) the stock market. I didn't,"" he said. ""I should have increased my wealth 3.8 times.""  Opportunity Wisconsin claimed ""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office."" The change benefitted his business – but also applied to tens of millions of other businesses. And it was hardly a loophole, if it was widely discussed publicly. He did sell his company for at least $5 million, but the doubling of wealth deserves more context: In that period, the S&P Index nearly quadrupled. So, the overall claim is a mixed bag – it’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition for Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280967331C0>],/factchecks/2022/apr/27/opportunity-wisconsin/johnson-benefitted-tax-cut-its-not-loophole/

Sadly, the queen did not knight Ruben, the influencer cat from Exeter
","The picture looks too good to be true: Queen Elizabeth II is shown placing a sword on the shoulder of a black cat, who appears to bow his little head in respect. ""Congratulations to Ruben, knighted by the Queen,"" says the caption. Ruben is an influencer cat from Exeter who is famous for wandering around the city. According to his website, he has been retrieved from more than 40 different addresses, including hospitals, care homes, schools, and private residences. The black cat has more than 15,000 followers on Facebook and the claim that he was knighted at Buckingham Palace was shared on his profile on April 1.

Viral videos falsely claiming Ukraine’s Zelenskyy uses cocaine are altered
","Two different manipulated videos targeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy online were deceptively edited to make it look like he is an avid cocaine user. The first video digitally added a white, powdered substance on Zelenskyy’s desk during a video call with billionaire Elon Musk. The second video spliced together clips from an interview Zelenskyy gave in 2019 to give the false impression that he was endorsing taking cocaine. Versions of both videos ricocheted across social media, spreading in different languages on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, TikTok and Telegram.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video purporting to show cocaine on Zelenskyy’s desk first took off among pro-Russian Telegram channels, according to reports. It also cropped up on Facebook and other platforms.   But the viral video was altered. The video took an authentic, 13-second clip that Zelenskyy posted to Instagram on March 5 and added a white substance — along with a credit card laid beside it.  The original video, which was also published online by news organizations such as the Guardian and the BBC, does not show the white substance or credit card on Zelenskyy’s desk. It shows Zelenskyy inviting Musk, whose aerospace company SpaceX delivered internet service equipment to Ukraine, to visit the country after the war with Russia.   Pro-Russian accounts are currently sharing a video (left) that has a big ol' pile of cocaine digitally added to smear Zelensky. The original video (right), sans cocaine, can be found here https://t.co/cChEsa7Sbj pic.twitter.com/JAfGsiEIDj The second deceptively edited video, which was falsely billed as showing Zelenskyy signaling his approval for cocaine, circulated separately across many of the same platforms. ""Video emerges of Ukraine’s President Zelensky allegedly praising cocaine,"" said one English-language tweet sharing the video on April 19. The video stitched together clips from a January 2019 interview Zelenskyy gave to Ukrayinska Pravda, an online news outlet in Ukraine.  The English subtitles attached to the viral video falsely claim that Zelenskyy, asked if he uses cocaine, responded: ""Awesome! Awesome! Energy man number one. Seriously! This is energy for the whole day. At 7 a.m. I got up … And I do snort drugs. This is the mode. I live in it.""  But in the original interview, after Zelenskyy was asked about an apparent rumor that he used cocaine, he denied doing so. According to English translations of his answers, Zelenskyy said he does not use drugs and later quipped that he is addicted to coffee.  The Associated Press offered one translation of Zelenskyy’s responses: ""Great! Great! No, I’m sitting on something white, but it is a chair. It’s not cocaine. I don’t use drugs."" Later, he said, ""I breathe coffee, because I am very addicted to coffee. I really like coffee, it’s true."" In another part of the interview, Zelenskyy walked through his morning routine, describing his 7 a.m. wake-up to take his dog outside and exercise. The altered video rearranged the words of Zelenskyy’s denial to leave viewers with the distorted impression that Zelenskyy admitted to regularly using cocaine.  In 2019, Ukrayinska Pravda wrote a follow-up report saying that Zelenskyy had denied using drugs.  Two videos claimed to show Zelenskyy either using or admitting to using cocaine. The first video purports to show a white powder on Zelenskyy’s desk as he placed a video call to Musk. But the video was doctored to include the substance, which is not in the original. The second video appears to show Zelenskyy talking about using cocaine regularly, but the video was deceptively edited to reorder Zelenskyy’s words. In reality, Zelenskyy denied using drugs.

Ad misleads North Carolina about McCrory's textbook commission
","A conservative education group is attacking Republican U.S. Senate candidate Pat McCrory, claiming that while McCrory was North Carolina’s governor, he orchestrated the teaching of critical race theory in the state’s classrooms. ""As governor, Pat McCrory put liberals in charge of the state textbook commission, appointing a Democrat majority,"" the narrator says in an ad paid for by School Freedom Fund, a political action committee tied to Club for Growth Action. ""His commission mandated textbooks written by radical, woke professors pushing critical race theory, teaching our kids to hate America."" Club for Growth Action has spent millions of dollars attacking McCrory and boosting U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Budd, McCrory and former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker are the top GOP candidates hoping to replace Sen. Richard Burr, who will retire at the end of his term this year.  McCrory campaign spokesman Jordan Shaw said the School Freedom Fund ad is ""one of the most disgustingly false ads in recent memory"" because it misrepresents how textbook commission members are appointed and how their recommendations reach classrooms. He said that ""CRT wasn’t an issue at the time, and (McCrory) is on record multiple times as being strongly opposed to CRT being taught in our schools."" McCrory’s campaign is calling on Budd and his supporters to publicly rebuke the ad. Yet, the claim about McCrory is spreading. North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who has endorsed Budd, made a similar claim in an ad for Club for Growth saying: ""Pat put liberals in charge of state textbooks."" The ad misleads on several fronts. McCrory did appoint Democrats to the state’s textbook commission, but the claim glaringly omits significant context: State law requires the governor to appoint someone nominated by the state education superintendent — who is elected separately from the governor. During McCrory’s time as governor, the superintendent was a Democrat. The ad also overstates the role of the North Carolina Textbook Commission. It doesn’t ""mandate"" textbooks. It reviews and approves books that can be used in the classroom. Ultimately, local school districts and schools have final say over which books are read as part of a curriculum. Let’s go through the claims in the ad. The ad says McCrory ""put liberals in charge of the state textbook commission, appointing a Democrat majority."" When we reached out to the School Freedom Fund to support this claim, Club for Growth spokesman Joe Kildea cited a 2014 blog post by the conservative John Locke Foundation. Its education expert reported that McCrory had appointed 22 new people to the textbook commission: 11 Democrats and four Republicans. For more specific records, PolitiFact North Carolina has reached out to the boards and commissions division of the governor’s office, but hasn’t heard back. McCrory hasn’t refuted the party affiliations of the people he appointed to the textbook commission. He has pointed out, however, that state law requires the governor to appoint textbook commission members who are nominated by the state superintendent of public instruction, an elected position. During the entirety of McCrory’s tenure, that position was held by June Atkinson, a Democrat who was elected three times to the seat before losing to a Republican in 2016. State law requires the textbook commission to be a mixture of teachers, school administrators, and parents from each of the three levels of grade school: elementary, middle and high school. The governor is allowed to reject the superintendent’s nominee, according to Blair Rhoades, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. ""What the governor can’t do is approve someone who has not been recommended by the superintendent,"" Rhoades said. In other words, McCrory could only appoint someone who had been nominated by Atkinson. The ad says the commission ""mandated textbooks written by radical woke professors pushing critical race theory, teaching our kids to hate America."" This distorts how textbooks are approved for public schools.  The state textbook commission doesn’t ""mandate"" books be read in North Carolina classrooms, as the ad says. North Carolina has at least one board of education in each county, and state law gives those boards discretion over which books are used in the classroom. Here’s how the process works:  The textbook commission reviews potential textbooks for grade school students.  The state education board considers the commission’s recommendations and then votes on whether to approve a textbook for use in North Carolina’s public schools. Local school boards then create their class curriculums by selecting textbooks from a list of options approved by the state board. As for critical race theory, the ad leaves out details about its origins and exaggerates how it’s typically taught. CRT is a broad set of ideas about systemic bias and privilege that has roots in legal academia. However, it’s often mischaracterized by conservative politicians who fear that its teachings might lead students to a more liberal worldview. Although CRT has been around since at least the 1970s, it was elevated in public discourse in 2019 after the New York Times’ 1619 Project, which is critical of school portrayals of slavery and offers lesson plans for teaching about it in school.  The 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minnesota police officer who was filmed kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd died inspired months of racial justice demonstrations across the country and stoked widespread national conversation about the role systemic racism plays in modern lives and throughout history. Then-President Trump denounced CRT in a September 2020 memo to federal agencies, describing it as ""divisive, anti-American propaganda. McCrory left office in 2016.  Contrary to the claims by Trump and the School Freedom Fund ad, education experts say the theory doesn’t explicitly teach students ""to hate America"" or make them feel guilty.  Several quotes that appear on-screen during the ad are from a writer for National Review, a conservative outlet that’s critical of CRT. The ad also features footage of a professor saying the constitution is ""soaked in slavery."" The audio is from Rebecca Edwards, a history professor at Vassar College in New York who co-authored a textbook flagged by the School Freedom Fund. The quote comes from a podcast Edwards recorded in January 2021. The School Freedom Fund ad says Pat McCrory ""put liberals in charge"" of the North Carolina Textbook Commission, which ""mandated textbooks."" McCrory appointed registered Democrats, but did so because state law limits his options to people nominated by the state education superintendent — an office controlled by an elected Democrat throughout his tenure. The Textbook Commission doesn’t ""mandate"" textbooks. Its role requires it to place textbooks on a menu of approved reading materials for local school boards to choose from.  The ad contains an element of truth but ignores other critical facts about the state’s education laws that would give voters a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809749E240>],/factchecks/2022/apr/26/school-freedom-fund/ad-misleads-north-carolina-about-mccrorys-textbook/

David Perdue distorts facts in Georgia agreement on absentee ballot signatures
","In the GOP primary race for Georgia’s governor, former Sen. David Perdue has a message he wants voters to carry with them when they decide whether Gov. Brian Kemp should progress in his bid to retain the state’s top seat: Kemp ""caved"" to Democrats during the 2020 presidential election in an election-stealing move that sealed the fate of President Donald Trump’s loss in Georgia. It’s an assertion built on two falsehoods. The first, that Trump’s election was stolen. And the second, that a settlement reached in a lawsuit related to the state’s absentee ballot system somehow threw the results in Joe Biden’s favor as Kemp looked on approvingly. ""When they passed that consent decree, it invalidated all voter ID law"" and ""allowed fraudulent ballots to be accepted into the race,"" Perdue said, addressing Kemp during an April 24  primary debate. ""Absolutely that’s what the consent decree did and you allowed it to happen."" That’s not what happened. And Perdue’s characterization of what he inaccurately termed a ""consent decree"" gets a lot of facts wrong. Here we explain the lawsuit settlement at the center of Perdue’s accusations — themes that have also been repeated by Trump, who has characterized the agreement as ""horrible,"" a ""disaster"" and ""more poorly negotiated"" than the Iran nuclear deal.  Perdue’s campaign did not respond to our queries. The primary is May 24. The winner will face Democrat Stacey Abrams in November. In 2018, Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to Kemp, who was Secretary of State at the time. Simultaneously, a Republican won a congressional race by just 0.14% in Gwinnett County, which rejected more absentee ballots than any other county in Georgia.   In November 2019, spurred by those midterm election results, the Democratic Party of Georgia and national Democratic groups filed a federal lawsuit against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and election officials in Gwinnett. The main point of the lawsuit was to challenge election officials’ procedures for notifying voters when their absentee ballots were rejected due to missing or mismatched signatures. Though a state law required election officials to ""promptly"" notify voters of missing or mismatched signatures, it didn’t include specific timeframes. That meant that each county set its own rules for how long it could take to notify voters of their problematic ballots and each had its own plan for how it should attempt to contact the voters about the issue.  The Democrats’ suit also challenged the design of the ballot envelope in Gwinnett County. As it was, instructions were printed in a small font size on the envelope. The lawsuit argued that the small type resulted in many Gwinnett voters not realizing their signatures were required. In March 2020, Raffensperger and the Democrats reached what was called a ""compromise settlement agreement and release"" — not a consent decree — in the lawsuit. A settlement agreement is a resolution signed by the parties without a court order, while a consent decree is entered as a court order enforceable by a judge. The State Election Board agreed to new notification rules for rejected absentee ballots. Officials agreed to notify voters by mail, and if available, by telephone and email, within three business days of receiving the ballot and to give them an opportunity to fix it.  State officials also agreed to issue an official bulletin to local election officials about signature matching procedures. The bulletin indicated that if an election official finds a signature mismatch, the official has to seek review from two other election officials.  Gwinnett officials agreed to a more clear ballot design. The settlement doesn’t appear to have had any significant impact on absentee ballot rejections in the November 2020 election. The signature match ballot rejection rate increased slightly from 0.18% in 2018 to 0.2% in 2020, according to the Secretary of State. We found no evidence that the settlement opened up the door to fraudulent ballots. ​​The presidential election results in Georgia were counted three times, and each showed Biden won. Republican statewide election officials said that they found no evidence of systematic voter fraud.  Perdue said during the debate that the agreement ""invalidated all voter ID law"" but the settlement made zero mention of voter identification law.  It would be possible for voters to hear Perdue’s statement and assume Georgia has no voter ID law, but that would be wrong. Georgia law requires photo identification when voting in person or absentee. In 2021, a new state law took effect adding ID rules for absentee voting. During the debate, while speaking about the agreement, Perdue said that Kemp ""allowed it to happen"" and suggested he should have called a special legislative session. Kemp countered ""I had nothing to do with"" it and that under state law ""the reason I affirmed the certification of the election is because the law says ‘I shall.’ It doesn’t say ‘I may.’"" Kemp’s campaign spokesperson Tate Mitchell told us that Kemp played no role in the settlement between Raffensperger and the Democratic Party of Georgia. Kemp was not a plaintiff in the lawsuit and the settlement agreement makes no mention of Kemp’s name.  Perdue said that a consent decree approved by Kemp ""invalidated all voter ID law"" and ""allowed fraudulent ballots to be accepted into the race."" Perdue’s statements are rife with inaccuracies.  There was no consent decree, which would have been overseen by a judge. Instead, there was a settlement agreement involving state and Gwinnett County election officials and state and national Democratic groups. Kemp had no role in the matter. The agreement spelled out that when an absentee ballot is rejected for a missing or mismatched signature, election officials have three days to contact the voter by mail, and if possible, by telephone and email. It also said that in the event of a signature mismatch, an election official has to  seek the review of two other officials. The agreement said nothing about voter ID law and we found no evidence that it opened the door to the counting of fraudulent ballots.  We rate this statement Pants on Fire!  RELATED: Georgia’s David Perdue said elections were stolen from him and Trump.

Twelve were either ruled accidental, or no foul play was suspected. One was at a vacant building that once housed a meat plant. In five others, the fires are either still under investigation or investigators have not publicly announced any cause found — intentional or otherwise. • A fire destroyed the headquarters of Azure Standard, a distributor of organic food in Dufur, Oregon. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, the company said in a press release on April 19. It said a few product lines may be affected, but the impact on operations should be ""limited and temporary."" • A fire destroyed a Taylor Farms Processing Facility in Salinas, California, on April 13. The company produces and distributes wholesale salad products and will now shift production to its Arizona facility. The company’s CEO told KSBW Action News that it plans to rebuild the facility and that the fire was likely the result of a welding accident.  • An April 12 fire destroyed the East Conway Beef & Pork butcher shop and slaughterhouse in Conway, New Hampshire. The cause of the blaze is still under investigation as of April 22, according to the New Hampshire State Fire Marshal’s office. • A fire that destroyed the Penobscot McCrum potato processing plant in Belfast, Maine, on March 24 was accidental, the Associated Press reported. Officials believe it started in a large deep-frying machine, according to the Portland Press-Herald. • A March 16 fire caused extensive damage to a new production line dedicated to Hot Pockets at a Nestle plant in Jonesboro, Arkansas. But that fire was not the result of foul play or anything suspicious, but rather a welding accident, Jonesboro Fire Chief Kevin Miller said. • A propane boiler explosion caused a fire that destroyed the Shearer's Foods potato chip plant in northeast Oregon on Feb. 22. It’s not clear if the company will rebuild there, but its website said that it has 12 production plants. • A fire destroyed a building that used to be the home of the Bonanza Meat Co. in El Paso, Texas, on Feb. 15. The building had been vacant for several years, according to a local CBS affiliate. • A fire destroyed part of the Wisconsin River Meats site in Mauston on Feb. 3. The business serves as a meat processor for farmers, livestock producers and hunters in the region, and also has a retail shop. The cause of that blaze was construction-related, David Mauer, the company’s vice president and owner, told PolitiFact. The company was fulfilling pickup orders at its warehouse three days later and opened a new storefront on April 21. • An explosion and fire damaged the Cargill-Nutrena plant in Lecompte, Louisiana, on Jan. 13. Cargill-Nutrena did not return a request for comment and it’s not clear if the site, which produces animal feed, had to halt production. • A fire did extensive damage to a poultry processing plant in Hamilton, Ontario, on Jan. 6, according to CHCH-TV. The cause of the blaze wasn’t clear from news reports. We reached out to Hamilton fire officials for comment but have not heard back. • A food processing plant in San Antonio, Texas, suffered about $100,000 in smoke damage, mostly to food, after a cooler was found on fire on Dec. 13, 2021, according to KSAT-12 news. • A Nov. 29, 2021, fire at the Maid-Rite Steak Company meat processing plant in Scott Township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, was determined by fire officials to be an accident, according to Fox56 News. The plant was left inoperable and some products that were only produced there are no longer available, the company, which has other plants, said on its website. • A fire at the JVS USA beef processing plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, on Sept, 12, 2021, only halted production for one day. The cause of the fire was determined to be from a heater near the roof in the rendering area of the plant, according to Drovers, a beef industry trade publication. • A fire temporarily closed Patak Meat Products in Cobb County, Georgia, on Aug. 23, 2021. No foul play was suspected, officials said. The company said on Facebook in March that it is still rebuilding, but is open for business. • A fire broke out at Tyson's River Valley Ingredients rendering plant, which produces animal feed, in Hanceville, Alabama, on July 31, 2021. That blaze appeared to start with grease and animal by-products, the town’s mayor told the Cullman Tribune. Tyson announced on April 18, 2022, that it is building a new $208 million plant near the one lost in the blaze. • A fire that damaged a Kellogg’s plant in Memphis, Tennessee, on July 25, 2021, was accidentally sparked when a malfunctioning conveyer belt sparked a blaze in a rice drying machine, fire officials said. We reached out to Kellogg’s to find the effect on production at the plant, but did not receive a response. • A fire at the Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Monmouth, Illinois, on April 30, 2021, caused ""not a lot of damage"" to the building, according to a local news report. A spokesperson for the Illinois State Fire Marshal said the fire was accidental and no foul play was suspected. He also said the office has not noticed any trends in fires at meat packing sites in the state. • A Jan. 11, 2021, fire destroyed the Deli Star meat processing plant in Fayetteville, Illinois. No foul play was suspected in that fire, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. A replacement facility is set to open in 2022. A Facebook post alleges that fires at 18 food processing plants in the past six months are the result of an intentional attempt to ""starve"" Americans. But of the 18 fires listed, 12 were ruled accidental, two are still officially under investigation, and no official cause has been announced on three others. One was in Canada. One was at a vacant building. And 12 happened in the past six months. There is no evidence that any of the fires were intentional. There also is no evidence that these fires have resulted in a food shortage crisis in the U.S. that could lead to starvation. We rate this claim False. UPDATE, April 28, 2022: This story has been updated with additional information on the Smithfield Foods fire, which was determined to be accidental. The rating is unchanged. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097199B80>],/factchecks/2022/apr/26/facebook-posts/no-food-plant-fires-arent-attempt-create-food-shor/

Social media posts twist facts about hepatitis outbreak in kids, Johnson & Johnson vaccines
","An outbreak of acute hepatitis with unknown origin has sickened dozens of children, most in Europe and North America. Now some on social media are falsely portraying its spread as a side effect of COVID-19 vaccines. An Instagram post on April 22 shares a screenshot of a tweet that suggests the hepatitis outbreaks are related to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It reads, ""Until proper long term safety studies are done, it is every healthcare providers (sic) duty to assume it is related."" The tweet reads, ""Kids are getting hepatitis. It’s being caused be (sic) an adenovirus. J&J had an adenovirus vector. Couldn’t possibly be related.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) At least one child has died and 17 have received liver transplants among the 169 cases in 11 countries involving children ages one month to 16 years old as of April 23. The vast majority of the cases are in the United Kingdom, according to the World Health Organization. It said adenovirus is a possible cause for the outbreak, but that investigations are ongoing. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can be caused by viruses, among other things, according to the CDC. Adenoviruses are common viruses that can cause a range of cold-like symptoms, the CDC said. It was detected in at least 74 of the hepatitis cases, the WHO said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an emergency alert on April 21 because of an outbreak involving nine children in Alabama. The agency urged doctors to test for adenovirus infection in hepatitis cases and report them. The CDC did not respond to a request for comment. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a viral vector vaccine that uses an adenovirus, but it cannot replicate and make you sick, according to the Mayo Clinic. What’s more, it has not been administered to children — the vaccine is only approved for people 18 and older.  Further, claims of a connection to any COVID-19 vaccines are not supported, the WHO said, because ""the vast majority of affected children did not receive COVID-19 vaccination."" The UK Health Security Agency also said there is no link to a COVID-19 vaccine because none of the confirmed cases in the UK are known to be in patients who have been vaccinated. Most of the hepatitis cases there involve children under 5, they said. No vaccines have yet been approved for children under 5.  An Instagram post alleges that a recent outbreak of hepatitis in children is related to the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Health officials at the WHO and in the UK said there is no connection to any vaccine because most of the cases involved children who aren’t vaccinated. The J&J vaccine is not approved for anyone under 18, and children under 5 are not eligible for any available COVID-19 vaccine.

Viral claim distorts Finnish law on child sex abuse
","A post shared on Instagram makes an alarming claim about what’s legal in Finland. ""Finnish Court rules sex with children is permitted,"" states a screenshot of a headline. Text below that adds: ""Finland’s Supreme Court has ruled that sex with children as young as 10 is not ‘rape’ if you come from a culture where sexual relations between adults and kids is ‘normal’."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isn’t true. Sex with children is not legal or ""permitted"" in Finland.   The age of consent in the country is 16 years old. Children age 15 or younger in Finland are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity may result in charges of statutory rape or the equivalent local law.  While the claim is wrong, it stems from a real and controversial 2018 court ruling that led Finland to eventually strengthen its child rape laws. Finland's Supreme Court ruled against an appeal to increase the punishment of a man who received a three-year ""absolute"" prison sentence from a lower court for aggravated sexual abuse of a 10-year-old girl.  In Finland, aggravated sexual abuse of a child carries a one- to 10-year prison sentence. The appeal sought to increase the man’s charge to aggravated rape, which carries a sentence of two to 10 years in prison.  At the time, an aggravated rape charge only applied to cases where violence was involved. In its dismissal, the court determined that the case had not been established that the sexual intercourse ""had taken place through violence or that the child had been in a state of fear or other helplessness."" But the court judgment sparked backlash across the country, with many arguing that there is no way a child could know or be in control of what might be happening in such a situation.  In 2019, after thousands signed a petition calling for sexual offense legislation to be revamped, Finland announced it was strengthening its laws to ensure that sex without consent or with children is always punishable as rape. An Instagram post claimed a Finnish court ruled that sex with children is permitted. This isn’t true. It’s illegal for adults to have sexual relations with children under 16 in Finland. A 2018 court ruling about what qualifies as rape prompted Finland to update and strengthen its child sex abuse laws. The country has never ruled that sex with children is legal.  We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097049200>],/factchecks/2022/apr/26/instagram-posts/viral-claim-distorts-finnish-law-child-sex-abuse/

Health care systems for detained migrants, veterans are not an apples-to-apples comparison
","Texas land commissioner candidate Tim Westley recently compared health screenings for immigrants to medical appointment wait times for veterans. Westley, a former teacher who faces state Sen. Dawn Buckingham, R-Lakeway, in the May 24 Republican runoff, tweeted a TikTok clip from a March 30 interview where he made the comparison. He said, ""When we talk about illegal immigration, and we have illegal immigrants that have to be seen within 24 hours, while veterans are seen within months. And here's the catch ... not only are they seen within 24 hours — it's mandatory that they're seen within 24 hours — the funding that they're being seen with falls under the Department of Veterans Affairs."" When asked for his sources, Westley wrote he knows about veterans' wait times from personal experience. Westley said in the interview he served in the U.S. Army and the Texas National Guard. His campaign sent links and excerpts from a Department of Veterans Affairs FAQ and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Health Service Corps website page. He also credited a source he declined to name for his claim about immigrants detained by ICE. The care systems for immigrants in ICE custody and for veterans are run by different federal departments and Westley was relying on two different metrics in making his comparison: he was referring to standards of care for immigrants, which aren't always followed, and access to care for veterans. The border and veterans are two issues that have dominated the campaign for land commissioner. The Texas General Land Office owns land near the border and current commissioner George P. Bush authorized the construction of a border wall on state-owned land. The office also houses the Texas Veterans Land Board, which oversees loans for veterans, land sales, veterans nursing homes, and cemeteries. However, veterans' health care is a federal service provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Westley's campaign pointed to an ICE Health Service Corps standard requiring initial health screenings to be administered within 12 hours and health assessments within 14 days. The agency website indicates this initial health screening means basic health tests, such as a COVID-19 test, taking vital signs, and tuberculosis infection screening. The health assessment includes a physical examination with vision screening and mental health screening questions. The campaign specifically pointed to a paragraph on the website: ""Detainees identified as high-risk during the intake process are triaged to a higher level of care immediately. If at any time a patient verbalizes an issue such as, 'I feel very bad' or 'I don’t have the medicine I need' a nurse or mid-level practitioner contacts a higher level medical provider, usually a physician, so that the patient is seen within 24 hours."" There are some additional standards for migrants to be seen by a health professional within a certain period of time, according to the 2019 National Detention Standards for ICE. These pertain to mental illness and disabilities, health assessments for minors, triaging a request for medical services, and mental health referrals for victims of sexual abuse or abusers. But these are all internal directives set by the agency, not a statute or regulation, said attorney Briana Perez with the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, which provides legal services for migrants in detention centers. Perez said these standards are often not followed, and there is little legal recourse for when medical services are not provided. ""What I can say, high level, is that everyday we interact with clients who are suffering in detention and not getting appropriate care,"" Perez said. Perez said the group often sees clients with serious, treatable health conditions that can be detected, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, but they are not receiving medical attention and wait for long periods after requesting to see a doctor. Perez said her clients often have told her that health professionals are just giving them pain pills for their conditions. Some migrants have been told by health professionals to wait until they are released to get care elsewhere, which can be as much as several months, Perez said. ""The problems are exacerbated for individuals who speak a language other than English or Spanish because of language barriers and lack of access to interpreters to express health concerns,"" Perez said. New York-based organization Human Rights Watch in 2017 and 2018 reviewed and reported on cases in which people in ICE custody did not receive adequate medical care and died. In 2020, a whistleblower alleged inadequate medical care and unnecessary gynecological surgeries at Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia. In 2021, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would no longer use that detention center. Federal government reports in 2020 and 2021 found instances of inadequate medical care, and in one Arizona detention center an understaffed medical unit took an average of over three days to respond to detainee sick call requests. Comparing the health systems for veterans and migrants in ICE detention centers is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Nationally, veterans referred to care at Veterans Affairs health care locations are seen by a medical professional in approximately 40 days on average in 2021, said Kevin Griffith, professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. They are generally seen faster within the VA system versus referral from a private provider and wait times vary depending on the service and location. Veterans in Texas wait an average of 38 days for referrals, Griffith said. This is slightly longer than the private sector's average wait time in Texas of 36 days. ""There's certainly variation both geographically and within specialty,"" Griffith said. ""There's certain specialties that are seen faster, or a VA medical center might have a greater capacity. One thing that has come up frequently in our research is that the wait times between the VA and the private sector are well correlated. So, areas that tend to have a longer VA wait time tend to just be medically underserved areas in general."" Wait times for new patients at veterans affairs primary care facilities vary. As of April 6, the wait time for the Corpus Christi VA Clinic was an average of 30 days and the Austin VA Clinic an average of 20 days, according to Veterans Affairs' website. But the average wait time for an optometry appointment for new patients at the Austin VA clinic is 106 days. Law requires the department to have internal policies for wait times of 20 days for primary care and 28 days for specialty care. ""Unfortunately, these standards are arbitrarily set. Many veterans, actually most, do not get seen within that time period. But it's perhaps because the standard is a bit of a reach, because the private sector isn't even close to meeting those wait times either,"" Griffith said. Westley pointed to a paragraph on an ICE document that defined the role of a Veterans Affairs center in ICE detention health services. The document indicates the VA Financial Services Center provides financial services to federal customers, and the center has an agreement with ICE to provide medical claims processing services that are in turn reimbursed by the Department of Homeland Security. A Veterans Affairs public affairs representative from the Dallas office wrote that the Financial Services Center provides services for a fee and does not receive annual appropriations from Congress. DHS ""pays for"" its medical care by providing funding to the Financial Services Center. Texas land commissioner candidate Tim Westley said, ""When we talk about illegal immigration, and we have illegal immigrants that have to be seen within 24 hours, while veterans are seen within months."" In follow-up emails, Westley specified he was referring to health screenings administered by ICE and the triaging system. Immigrants in ICE custody do not have quick access to medical care, though the agency's goal is to identify potential health issues by administering health screenings within 12 hours and health assessments within two weeks. Veterans wait an average of just over a month for referrals to medical professionals, though some may wait longer depending on the service they need and geography. Detention facility health services and veterans' medical services are dissimilar and unrelated, and comparing the two is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  We rated this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971B9D00>],/factchecks/2022/apr/25/tim-westley/health-care-systems-detained-migrants-veterans-are/

Video shows Norwegian military practice shot, not Russian warship exploding
","Widespread videos claiming to show the explosion that sank the Moskva, the premier Russian Black Sea warship, continue to rack up views across social media, even though the videos show the wrong ship. One such video was uploaded to TikTok on April 14, the same day the missile cruiser sank. Russia and Ukraine offered differing explanations: Ukraine claimed that it took out the ship with missiles, a position supported by U.S. officials, while Russia blamed a fire on board and only recently acknowledged casualties. The TikTok video has since amassed more than 16.5 million views. Other versions of the same video, with similar captions falsely claiming it shows the Moskva, also appeared on other platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.  ""Russian warship ‘Moscow’ went to hell,"" one tweet said. ""Very fast!"" The footage seen in the viral videos predates the Russian war on Ukraine by almost a decade. Researchers and fact-checkers at Bellingcat, Reuters, Snopes and other organizations quickly identified the original source of the footage.

The Norwegian Navy blasted one of its own decommissioned ships with a missile as part of a military exercise meant to test out new weaponry. The same video was published online in 2013 by CNN, Military.com, and South West News Service, a British news agency.

Commemorative Zelenskyy coins created by private gift shop, not Biden White House
","Social media users are falsely claiming that the Biden White House created special coins honoring Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""The White House presented commemorative coins dedicated to Vladimir Zelensky,"" said one April 17 Facebook post, using an alternative spelling for Zelenskyy’s name. The post shared images of two different coins with Zelenskyy’s face on them. ""The US Presidential Administration dedicated two commemorative coins in the ‘Historical Moments’ series to Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,"" said another post on Twitter sharing the same images. The posts and others like them were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Despite what the posts suggest, the commemorative coins were created by a private company, not President Joe Biden’s White House. But there is a reason for the confusion: the private store responsible for the coins is called the White House Gift Shop. PolitiFact previously fact-checked false internet rumors that former President Donald Trump was selling coronavirus-themed coins for profit when, in reality, the coins had been created by the same private gift shop. Reverse image searches revealed that the two Zelenskyy coins were selling for $100 each on the White House Gift Shop’s website, and were advertised several times on Twitter. One of the coins is marketed as honoring Zelenskyy. The other recognizes an address he gave Congress. The online store says on its ""about us"" page that it was connected to the White House decades ago, when it would provide flowers to the family of fallen White House police officers and gifts to retiring officers. But Anthony Giannini, the shop’s CEO who took over the shop years ago during the Obama administration, said that the store is now fully privatized.  In a statement to PolitiFact, Giannini refuted the ""propaganda that President Biden is behind the Ukraine Heroes coin that I designed, which, of course, is not the case."" The Associated Press reported that the shop used to have a physical location in Washington but now runs its business online with a distribution center in Rochester, Michigan. Both ""White House Gift Shop"" and ""White House Gift Shop, Est. 1946,"" are trademarked by Giannini Strategic Enterprises, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s records.  The nonprofit White House Historical Association — which runs two retail shops located near the White House in Washington, including one at the White House Visitor Center — confirmed to PolitiFact that its stores are not selling the commemorative Zelenskyy coins. There is no mention of the coins on the White House’s official government website, either.

Social media posts misrepresent safety of Bath & Body Works products during pregnancy
","It can feel nerve-racking to navigate the world while pregnant. There are loads of rules and recommendations on what you can and can’t consume, activities you can and cannot do. So when social media posts pop up that claim popular products like fragrance mists or lotions can cause fertility issues, it’s easy to panic. But is it warranted? ""Did you know that Bath & Body Works products are actually not recommended to use while pregnant?"" one April 18 post shared on Facebook begins. ""Neither did I because I never thought to read their safety data sheets. Straight from their safety data sheet it reads and I quote, ‘suspected of damaging fertility or the unborn child’ and, ‘may cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure.’"" The post links to a safety data document for the company’s Winter Candy Apple home fragrance refill. ""The products that have been … glorified FOR YEARS because ‘they smell good’ or, ‘they have the best candles’ have a warning label that could harm an unborn child, a woman’s hormones AND their organs?"" the user asked. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It appears to be a spin-off of claims about the company’s products that first appeared on TikTok in January. The document does include warnings about skin irritation, infertility and organ damage, but these types of disclosures aren’t new or limited to Bath & Body Works, and they aren’t aimed at typical consumer use.  To sell products in certain states, home fragrance companies are required to put these types of disclosures on their websites.  But the safety warnings are not intended for consumers, Bath & Body Works told PolitiFact. They are meant for large manufacturers and first responders in case they come into contact with large vats of a chemical or product.  ""Every Bath & Body Works product undergoes extensive review to ensure safety. Safety Data Sheets, like the one in the social media post, do not reflect the safety of products when used as directed,"" the company said in an emailed statement to PolitiFact. ""Bath & Body Works posts these sheets to assist manufacturing companies and emergency personnel who need to know how to handle, store or dispose of large quantities of chemicals in industrial and manufacturing settings.  ""As with any product a customer may use during pregnancy, we encourage them to consult a doctor if they have specific questions,"" the company added.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists told PolitiFact that it has no official recommendation about pregnant women not using Bath & Body Works products.  Dr. Christopher M. Zahn, the organization’s chief of clinical practice and interim chief of health equity and quality, called the claim false and lamented how medical misinformation like this can create unnecessary fear and confusion. ""Just because information is online or on social media doesn’t mean that it is true, or based on any reliable medical evidence,"" Zahn said. ""It is a sad reality that some people intentionally disseminate false information or simply decide to share unproven medical allegations without confirming the truth.""  A Facebook post claims that Bath & Body Works products are not recommended to use while pregnant and points to warnings of infertility and organ failure. Although the warnings do appear in a company safety data document, there is no official recommendation for pregnant women to not use Bath & Body Works products.
