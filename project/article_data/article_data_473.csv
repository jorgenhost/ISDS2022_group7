Health Choices Commissioner does not decide your health benefits
","It may be the longest chain e-mail we've ever received. A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: ""Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services."" Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our  extended analysis  to find out why. One of the claims that is just plain wrong says this: ""Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None."" To explain this one, we will start with an explanation of the overall bill, which was unveiled July 14, 2009. The bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance. People who get health insurance through work satisfy this requirement right off the bat. People who don't get insurance through work or another group will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees. The reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer, can't refuse people for pre-existing conditions, and must offer basic levels of service. ""This is designed to protect consumers from plans that have outrageous cost-sharing or really limited benefits,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform. Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides  point-by-point analyses  of the plans on its Web site. The exchange is meant to ensure that people are ""actually getting coverage and not a junk policy,"" Tolbert added. A key point here is that employer-provided insurance is already subject to this kind of regulation. Employer-provided insurance has to meet certain requirements to win its tax-exempt status. That's why, if you get insurance through work, you're not asked about pre-existing conditions, and you pay the same rate as all of your co-workers. The bill says that a Health Choices commissioner will run the exchange, and that he or she will make sure that insurers are offering basic benefits and adhering to the regulations. Individuals then choose their own plan from offerings on the exchange. The health commissioner does not ""decide health benefits for you."" To the extent that insurance plans have to meet basic requirements, those instructions are ultimately coming from Congress. The commissioner executes the rules. The chain e-mail mentions page 42, which is part of Section 142. That section outlines the duties of the Health Choices commissioner and explains that the commissioner should seek insurers to offer different types of insurance, including basic, enhanced and premium. Again, individuals will be able to choose among competing insurers that are regulated via the exchange. The e-mail is adamant that the Health Choices commissioner ""will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None."" That is not what the bill says. The bill envisions an exchange with several different plans, and people choosing their own plan. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB8D7C0>],/factchecks/2009/jul/30/chain-email/health-choices-commissioner-does-not-decide-your-h/

Glenn Beck claims science czar John Holdren proposed forced abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population
","As evidence that the country is closer to socialist than capitalist these days, radio and talk show host Glenn Beck recently made this claim about John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: ""I mean, we've got czars now,"" Beck said during his July 22, 2009, program. ""Czars like John Holdren, who has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population."" Political figures like Holdren, who are little-known by most Americans, make easy targets. And Beck's biting quick hit on Holdren provides a healthy enough dose of outrage on which to hang his argument. But is it true? Beck's allegation has its roots in a book Holdren co-authored with Paul and Annie Ehrlich more than three decades ago called  Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment  . Conservative bloggers have quoted the book extensively, and often out of context, to make the point that Holdren has advocated positions such as the ones Beck stated. We obtained the book to see exactly what Holdren, then a young man, wrote (or co-wrote). The book is just over 1,000 pages, and it clearly makes that case that an explosion in population presented a grave crisis. Although it is a textbook, the authors don't shy away from presenting a point of view. As the preface states, ""We have tried throughout the book to state clearly where we stand on various matters of controversy."" In a section on ""Involuntary Fertility Control,"" Holdren and the other authors discuss various ""coercive"" means of population control — including putting sterilants in the drinking water. But they stop well short of advocating such measures. Here's a few excerpts: ""The third approach to population limitation is that of involuntary fertility control. Several coercive proposals deserve discussion, mainly because some countries may ultimately have to resort to them unless current trends in birth rates are rapidly reversed by other means. ...

""Adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods is a suggestion that seems to horrify people more than most proposals for involuntary fertility control. Indeed, this would pose some very difficult political, legal, and social questions, to say nothing of the technical problems. No such sterilant exists today, nor does one appear to be under development. To be acceptable, such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff requirements: it must be uniformly effective, despite widely varying doses received by individuals, and despite varying degrees of fertility and sensitivity among individuals; it must be free of dangerous or unpleasant side effects; and it must have no effect on members of the opposite sex, children, old people, pets, or livestock. ...

""Again, there is no sign of such an agent on the horizon. And the risk of serious, unforeseen side effects would, in our opinion, militate against the use of any such agent, even though this plan has the advantage of avoiding the need for socioeconomic pressures that might tend to discriminate against particular groups or penalize children.""

Later, the authors conclude, ""Most of the population control measures beyond family planning discussed above have never been tried. Some are as yet technically impossible and others are and probably will remain unacceptable to most societies (although, of course, the potential effectiveness of those least acceptable measures may be great).

""Compulsory control of family size is an unpalatable idea, but the alternatives may be much more horrifying. As those alternatives become clearer to an increasing number of people in the 1980s, they may begin demanding such control. A far better choice, in our view, is to expand the use of milder methods of influencing family size preferences, while redoubling efforts to ensure that the means of birth control, including abortion and sterilization, are accessible to every human being on Earth within the shortest possible time. If effective action is taken promptly against population growth, perhaps the need for the more extreme involuntary or repressive measures can be averted in most countries."" And here's the part that some have interpreted as Holdren advocating for forced abortions. ""To date, there has been no serious attempt in Western countries to use laws to control excessive population growth, although there exists ample authority under which population growth could be regulated. For example, under the United States Constitution, effective population-control programs could be enacted under the clauses that empower Congress to appropriate funds to provide for the general welfare and to regulate commerce, or under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such laws constitutionally could be very broad. Indeed, it has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society. Few today consider the situation in the United States serious enough to justify compulsion, however."" This comes in a section discussing population law. The authors argue that compulsory abortions could potentially be allowed under U.S. law ""if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society."" Again, that's a far cry from advocating or proposing such a position. In the book, the authors certainly advocate making abortions readily accessible for women who want to get them. But they never advocate forced abortions. Big difference. In response to the comments from Beck and others, Holdren's office issued this statement: ""The quotations used to suggest that Dr. Holdren supports coercive approaches to limiting population growth were taken from a 1977 college textbook on environmental science and policy, of which he was the third author.  The quoted material was from a section of the book that described different possible approaches to limiting population growth and then concluded that the authors’ own preference was to employ the noncoercive approaches before the environmental and social impacts of overpopulation led desperate societies to employ coercive ones.  Dr. Holdren has never been an advocate of compulsory abortions or other repressive means of population limitation."" Holdren's office also provided a statement from Annie and Paul Ehrlich, the co-authors: ""We have been shocked at the serious mischaracterization of our views and those of John Holdren in blog posts based on misreadings of our jointly-authored 1000-page 1977 textbook, ECOSCIENCE.  We were not then,  never have been, and are not now 'advocates' of the Draconian measures for population limitation described — but not recommended — in the book's 60-plus small-type pages cataloging the full spectrum of population policies that, at the time, had either been tried in some country or analyzed by some commentator. Under questioning by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., during his Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he ""no longer thinks it's productive to focus on optimum population for the United States. ... I think the key thing today is that we need to work to improve the conditions that all of our citizens face economically, environmentally, and in other respects. And we need to aim for something that I have for years been calling 'sustainable prosperity.'"" Vitter continued with his line of question, asking directly, ""Do you think determining optimal population is a proper role of government?""

Said Holdren: ""No, senator, I do not. ... I think the proper role of government is to develop and deploy the policies with respect to economy, environment, security, that will ensure the well-being of the citizens we have."" But with regard to Beck's claim that Holdren ""has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population,"" the text of the book clearly does not support that. We think a thorough reading shows that these were ideas presented as approaches that had been discussed. They were not posed as suggestions or proposals. In fact, the authors make clear that they did not support coercive means of population control. Certainly, nowhere in the book do the authors advocate for forced abortions. Some have argued that Holdren's view of the imminent and grave global dangers posed by overpopulation should provide pause, given Holdren's current view that global warming now presents imminent and grave global dangers. That's a matter for reasoned debate.    But in seeking to score points for a political argument, Beck seriously mischaracterizes Holdren's positions. Holdren didn't advocate those ideas then. And, when asked at a Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he did not support them now. We think it's irresponsible to pluck a few lines from a 1,000-page, 30-year-old textbook, and then present them out of context to dismiss Holdren's long and distinguished career. And we rate Beck's claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8E5E00>],/factchecks/2009/jul/29/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-claims-science-czar-john-holdren-propos/

Claims the Senate voted to give undocumented workers Social Security benefits
","
You asked, so we're delivering.


For nearly six months, loyal PolitiFact readers have encouraged us to look into a chain email about undocumented immigrants getting Social Security benefits.


The e-mail has come in several forms, but most often goes as follows:


""It does not matter if you personally like or dislike Obama. It is already impossible to live on Social Security alone. If the government gives benefits to illegal aliens who have never contributed, where does that leave those of us who have paid into Social Security all our working lives? Please sign this petition and flood President Obama's e-mail box with e-mails that tell him that, even if the House passes this bill, he needs to veto it. ... The Senate voted this week to allow illegal aliens access to Social Security benefits.""


Typically, the text is followed by hundreds of signatures asking President Barack Obama to veto said bill.


The e-mails provide no bill number, no bill name and — oddly — they all insist that the Senate ""voted this week"" on the legislation. Yet, we've been getting the same petition for months.


Digging back through our own archives we found the first version of this e-mail was sent on Feb. 13, 2009, a Friday. As with the many that have followed, the e-mail claimed the Senate had just voted on the bill, so we went back to the

Congressional Record

to see what the Senate had been debating that week, and we found that the stimulus was on the chamber's agenda.

 

At first we thought the e-mail might have something to do with the stimulus package, but upon further investigation, we found that the claim goes back as far as 2006, as our friends at FactCheck.org have pointed out. (Then, the claim was used against senators who voted against an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Act that would have blocked Social Security benefits to legal immigrants who paid taxes before they obtained the right to work.)

 

But back to 2009. We ran a search in Thomas, the Library of Congress's bill database, and found no such legislation. And just to be sure we hadn't missed anything, we contacted several groups that typically weigh in on the immigration debate to see if they'd heard otherwise.

 

The answer from all corners was a resounding ""no.""

 

""We're not aware of any such bill,"" said Ira Mehlman, communication director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates for stronger border security and stricter immigration laws.

 

""This garbage has been floating around since 2006"" when Congress was debating the immigration bill, said Jon Blazer, who is an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. ""First it was George Bush, and they just changed the name to Obama.""

 

Like most chain e-mails, it seems this letter has morphed through a Web-based game of telephone. What started as a specious campaign attack back in 2006 has hung around as a rumor under the new administration. We've been getting this e-mail for six months, and every time, it exclaims that the Senate voted ""this week"" on such a bill. Unless our senators are trapped in a time warp, debating and passing the same bill every week, such a claim is impossible. It's Pants on Fire for this chain e-mail!

Arianna Huffington calls drug imprisonment rates for blacks disproportionate
","In another example of how the arrest of African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. has driven pundits to talk about issues of race and crime, Arianna Huffington, the founder of the liberal Huffington Post news Web site, offered some statistics about race, drug use and incarceration during a July 26, 2009, roundtable on ABC’s  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  . Huffington said, ""It is really stunning that only 15 percent of the total drug population — drug offending population is African-American. And yet you have 74 percent of them who wind up in jail."" A staffer for Huffington clarified her point: African-Americans make up 15 percent of drug users, but 74 percent of drug offenders sentenced to prison. Her comment echoed longstanding calls by critics of U.S. drug policy and criminal sentencing guidelines. These critics have argued that blacks are unfairly targeted by U.S. drug laws as well as the ways those laws are enforced. So we decided to dig into Huffington’s numbers to see if they were correct.

An aide to Huffington said her numbers came from a 2006 ACLU report, ""Cracks in the System: Twenty Years of the Unjust Federal Crack Cocaine Law,"" and she did indeed report the numbers correctly from that study. The ACLU, in turn, footnoted those numbers to a fact sheet posted by a group called the Interfaith Drug Policy Initiative. When we checked that group’s Web site, however, we could not find any further footnoting for the statistics. So we decided to look at the raw federal data ourselves.

To determine whether blacks account for 15 percent of drug users, we first turned to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. That study is considered the most reliable in the field, though experts say it probably undercounts harder-core addicts who cannot be reached by survey takers. Among other things, the study quantifies the rates of illicit drug use by different racial and ethnic groups. The drugs studied include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and inhalants, as well as the nonmedical use of prescription drugs. The numbers do not include tobacco or alcohol.

According to the survey, 9.7 percent of blacks, 8.1 percent of whites and 7.6 percent of Hispanics reported using illicit drugs within the prior month. To convert these figures into something comparable to what Huffington said, we cross-referenced these drug-use rates to the current populations of each ethnic group, according to the Census Bureau. Our calculations showed that 70 percent of drug users are white, 14 percent are black and 13 percent are Hispanic. On this fact, then, Huffington was very, very close.

She wasn’t as accurate, however, on the second half of her assertion, that 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison are black.

To verify her number, we turned to ""Prisoners in 2007,"" a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which is the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. That report offered estimated figures for offenders sentenced to state prison for drug violations: 113,500 blacks, 72,300 whites and 51,100 Hispanics. On a percentage basis, this means that 29 percent of inmates for drug offenses were white, 20 percent were Hispanic and 45 percent were black — well under the 74 percent level asserted by Huffington.

In the federal system, the percentages are lower still for African-Americans. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, for fiscal year 2008, there were 25,273 federal sentences for drug offenses. Of that number, African-American prisoners didn’t even account for the highest percentage among the three biggest groups. Hispanics led with 40 percent, followed by blacks at 31 percent and whites at 25 percent.

One drug policy expert we contacted, Beau Kilmer of the RAND Corp., said our calculations were sound, though he added that Huffington’s comparison of drug use and incarceration has some logical holes. ""We have to realize most drug use is marijuana, and that’s not the reason why people are going to prison — it’s the harder drugs,"" Kilmer said.
   
Ultimately, Huffington was right about one number and quite a bit off with the other. However, even at the much lower rates of incarceration we found, black Americans — who account for about 13 percent of the U.S. population — are still imprisoned for drug offenses at wildly disproportionate rates. So we rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCBEC80>],/factchecks/2009/jul/28/arianna-huffington/arianna-huffington-calls-drug-imprisonment-rates-b/

Bill Bennett understates his point on black murder victims
","Ever since the arrest of black Harvard University scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., and the comments about the controversy by President Barack Obama, pundits have analyzed and reanalyzed what the incident says about crime and race in America.

On the July 26, 2009, edition of CNN’s  State of the Union with John King  , conservative commentator Bill Bennett urged that the Gates case not obscure larger social realities about crime.

""Well, I guess they are going to have a beer at the White House, the president has backed off from his ridiculous statement at the press conference. And, of course, Sgt. Crowley [the arresting officer, who is white] has shown himself to be an exemplary police officer. I hope if we get to so-called teachable moments and underlying issues, we'll get to some real problems. There obviously are wayward cops, not in this case, but let's talk about the fact that young black men in this country grow up 75 percent of the them without fathers. And if we talk about crime in America, let's remember that 4 percent of American citizens are black males, but they are 35 percent of murder victims. This doesn't come from the police. These are big and serious problems and I think this whole issue has obscured those more serious problems because of the ego of a Harvard professor.""

The issue of single parenthood is a good one to investigate further, but for now we'll look at the second part of his assertion — that ""4 percent of American citizens are black males, but they are 35 percent of murder victims.""

On the first part of this claim, Bennett underestimated the black male percentage of the U.S. population by roughly one-third. The Census Bureau’s latest population estimate for the entire country, covering 2008, is 304,059,724. We determined the number of black men in America by taking the 2008 population estimate for African-Americans as a whole and multiplying that number by .477. (For various actuarial reasons, the Census Bureau found that 47.7 percent of African-Americans were male and 52.3 percent were female in 2007.) This left us with 18,631,063, or 6.1 percent of the U.S. population — a number notably higher than Bennett’s estimate.

(Because Bennett specifically mentioned ""American citizens,"" we also tried an alternative calculation, subtracting from the total U.S. population the 11.6 million undocumented Americans estimated by the Department of Homeland Security. Calculated this way, the result is 6.4 percent, making little difference in the result.)

On the more important statistic of murder victimization rates, Bennett actually understated his own point.

According to Crime in the United States, a statistical survey published annually by the FBI, 6,223 black men were murdered nationally in 2007 out of 14,831 total murder victims, or 42 percent. The percentages for the two prior years were consistent — 42 percent in 2006 and 41 percent in 2005.

So, Bennett got the numbers wrong on both ends of his assertions, and not by insignificant amounts. But on the general point — that black men are murdered at disproportionately high rates — he is unquestionably correct. For this reason, we give his statement a rating of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBE81C0>],/factchecks/2009/jul/28/bill-bennett/black-men-are-4-percent-americans-35-percent-murde/

'Birthers' claim Gibbs lied when he said Obama's birth certificate is posted on the Internet
","
Update: We first posted this item on July 1, 2009. Since then, the Birther movement has only gained more national exposure, including discussion on numerous political television and radio programs. That prompted Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, to issue this statement on July 27, 2009:  
""I, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of the Hawai'i State Department of Health, have seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawai'i State Department of Health verifying Barrack Hussein Obama was born in Hawai'i and is a natural-born American citizen. I have nothing further to add to this statement or my original statement issued in October 2008, over eight months ago.""  
For more information on the announcement, as well as background on the Obama birth certificate issue, check out  this article  from the  Honolulu Advertiser  , posted July 28, 2009.  
Back on June 27, 2008, PolitiFact published a story we hoped would put the whole Obama birth certificate controversy to rest. It ran under the now laughable headline,  ""Obama's birth certificate: Final chapter."" 

Oh, how naive we were.

More than a year later, the debate continues to rage on the Internet among the ""Birthers"" movement, people who doubt that President Barack Obama is a natural-born citizen of the United States and is therefore ineligible to serve as president. Or at least, they say, Obama has yet to sufficiently prove things one way or the other.

The conservative WorldNetDaily.com Web site is the conductor of the Birther train. On the site, you can donate money to rent billboard space that asks ""Where's the Birth Certificate?"" They've got a petition demanding the president produce his original birth certificate — now signed, they say, by 400,000 people. From the site, you can buy ""Where's the Birth Certificate?"" yard signs and bumper stickers. The site has recently run stories about a man whose attempts to sell a purported Obama birth certificate from Kenya on eBay have been repeatedly shut down.

And on May 28, WorldNetDaily.com correspondent Lester Kinsolving pressed the issue all the way to the White House, squeezing in a couple questions at the end of  a daily press briefing  with White House spokesman Robert Gibbs.

Here's how the exchange went:

Kinsolving: ""One question concerning what the president said in his speech on Thursday, and I quote, 'I ran for president promising transparency, and I meant what I said. This is why, whenever possible, we will make information available to the American people so they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.' End of quote. Do you remember that statement?""

Gibbs: ""I can confirm he said that.""

Kinsolving: ""Good. In consideration of this very good promise of transparency, why can't the president respond to the petitioned requests of 400,000 American citizens by releasing a certified copy of his long form birth certificate listing hospital and physician?""

Gibbs: ""Are you looking for the president's birth certificate?""

Kinsolving: ""Yes.""

Gibbs: ""It's on the Internet, Lester.""

Kinsolving: ""No, no, no — the long form listing his hospital and physician.""

Gibbs: ""Lester ... This question in many ways continues to astound me. The state of Hawaii provided a copy, with a seal, of the president's birth. I know there are apparently at least 400,000 people that continue to doubt the existence of and the certification by the state of Hawaii of the president's birth there, but it's on the Internet because we put it on the Internet for each of those 400,000 to download. I certainly hope by the fourth year of our administration that we'll have dealt with this burgeoning birth controversy.""

WorldNetDaily.com, through an owner, the Western Center for Journalism, responded with an ad in the conservative publication  Human Events  that called Gibbs' response arrogant, factually incorrect, lies.

Moreover, the ad said, ""members of the liberal elitist media ... instead of pressing Gibbs on his outrageous statements ... openly laughed.""

The ad is right about that; journalists could clearly be heard chuckling at Kinsolving's questions.

The question here is, did Gibbs lie?

Some background: On June 13, 2008, after months of hounding by the media and wild Internet speculation that Obama was actually born in either Indonesia or Kenya, the Obama campaign finally released a copy of Obama's ""Certification of Birth"" from Hawaii and posted it on the Internet. The document states that Barack Hussein Obama II was born on Aug. 4, 1961, at 7:24 p.m. in Honolulu, Hawaii, to parents Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Hussein Obama.

End of story? Hardly. If anything, it merely intensified the debate. Numerous critics arose on the Internet claiming the document was a fraud. It was the wrong color. It was missing an embossed seal. There was no crease from it being folded and mailed.

Our friends from  FactCheck.org  went to Chicago, held the document in their questioning hands and examined it closely. Their conclusion: It's legit.

On Oct. 31, 2008, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, issued this statement: ""There have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama’s official birth certificate. State law prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record.

""Therefore I, as director of health for the state of Hawaii, along with the registrar of Vital Statistics who has statutory authority to oversee and maintain these type of vital records, have personally seen and verified that the Hawaii State Department of Health has Sen. Obama's original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.

""No state official, including Gov. Linda Lingle, has ever instructed that this vital record be handled in a manner different from any other vital record in the possession of the state of Hawaii.""

Even the governor of Hawaii, Linda Lingle, a Republican who at the time was stumping for John McCain, said it was on the up-and-up.

Over? No way.

All that proved, the birthers concluded, was that there is, in fact, an original birth certificate, and that the public hasn't seen it. The new argument goes like this: Obama never published his ""Birth Certificate"" (a ""Certificate of Live Birth"") on the Internet; what he posted was a ""Certification of Live Birth,"" what WorldNetDaily describes as ""a 'short-form' document that is generated on-the-spot and based on what is contained in a computer database at the time it was printed out.""

Some on the Internet speculate that the original ""long form"" — which might include the hospital where he was born as well as the attending physician — might show Obama was foreign-born and ineligible to be president, but that that wouldn't show up on the ""short form.""

Moreover, WorldNetDaily claims even the state of Hawaii doesn't accept ""Certification of Live Birth"" as proof that an individual was physically born in Hawaii.

They point to a policy from the Hawaii Department of Home Lands, which stated on its Web site:

""In order to process your application, DHHL utilizes information that is found only on the original Certificate of Live Birth, which is either black or green. This is a more complete record of your birth than the Certification of Live Birth (a computer-generated printout). Submitting the original Certificate of Live Birth will save you time and money since the computer-generated Certification requires additional verification by DHHL.""

That's actually a misnomer, said Lloyd Yonenaka, a spokesman for DHLL. In order to be eligible for their program, you must prove that your ancestry is at least 50 percent native Hawaiian. And when he says native, he means indigenous. They don't even care if you were born in Hawaii. They use birth certificates as a starting point to look into a person's ancestry. Very different.

Here's what the DHLL site says now: ""The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands accepts both Certificates of Live Birth (original birth certificate) and Certifications of Live Birth because they are official government records documenting an individual’s birth. The Certificate of Live Birth generally has more information which is useful for genealogical purposes as compared to the Certification of Live Birth which is a computer-generated printout that provides specific details of a person’s birth. Although original birth certificates (Certificates of Live Birth) are preferred for their greater detail, the State Department of Health (DOH) no longer issues Certificates of Live Birth. When a request is made for a copy of a birth certificate, the DOH issues a Certification of Live Birth.""

When we spoke to a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Health, she said too much was being made of the difference between the so-called ""long"" and ""short"" forms.

""They're just words,"" said spokeswoman Janice Okubo. ""That (what was posted on the Internet) is considered a birth certificate from the state of Hawaii.""

""There's only one form of birth certificate,"" she said, and it's been the same since the 1980s. Birth certificates evolve over the decades, she said, and there are no doubt differences between the way birth certificates looked when Obama was born and now.

""When you request a birth certificate, the one you get looks exactly like the one posted on his site,"" she said. ""That's the birth certificate.""

As for the theory that Obama's original birth certificate might show he was foreign-born, Okubo said the ""Certification of Live Birth"" would say so. Obama's does not. Again, it says he was born in Honolulu.

We have one more thing. We talked to reporter Will Hoover, who wrote a well-researched story for the  Honolulu Advertiser  on Nov. 9, 2008, about Obama's childhood years in the the Aloha State. It ran under the headline ""Obama Slept Here.""

In researching the story, he went to the microfilm archives and found the birth announcement for Obama. Actually, he found two of them, one in his  Honululu Advertiser on Aug. 13  , 1961, and in the  Honolulu Star-Bulletin the next day. They both said the same thing: ""Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama, 6085 Kalanianaole Highway, son, Aug. 4.""

But here's the thing. Newspaper officials he checked with confirmed those notices came from the state Department of Health.

""That's not the kind of stuff a family member calls in and says, 'Hey, can you put this in?'"" Hoover explained.

Take a second and think about that. In order to phony those notices up, it would have required the complicity of the state Health Department and two independent newspapers — on the off chance this unnamed child might want to one day be president of the United States.

In Honolulu, the Obama tour buses take you by the old Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital, now called Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children. Federal laws prohibit hospital officials from confirming that he was born there, but Hoover said it's common knowledge among locals.

So back to the claim that Gibbs lied about posting Obama's birth certificate on the Internet. WorldNetDaily is correct that the Obama campaign didn't post his original birth certificate on the Internet. But their suggestion that there is some significant difference between the two documents is wrong. They both prove the same thing. Maybe the original would identify the hospital where Obama was born, but that's irrelevant. The issue is what city, and therefore country, was he born. The document posted by the campaign proves Obama was born in Honolulu, according to Health Department officials. And that's really the central issue here.

The Health Department says the ""Certification of Live Birth"" is Hawaii's version of a birth certificate. Calling it by other names — Certificate of Live Birth, Certification of Live Birth — is just semantics. WorldNetDaily may be right that the original birth certificate wasn't posted, but if Hawaii says the the document Obama posted can rightly be called Obama's birth certificate, how is Gibbs lying? We harbor no delusions that anything we say here will slow the persistent drumbeat of the birthers, but we rule this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB118600>],/factchecks/2009/jul/28/worldnetdaily/birthers-claim-gibbs-lied-when-he-said-obamas-birt/

Obama says there is widespread support for health care reform
","
In his recent speech, President Barack Obama said the time is ripe for health care reform because most health care professionals support a new plan.


""The default position is inertia,"" he said during his July 22, 2009, speech on health care when asked why he was so eager to pass health care reform before the end of the summer. ""Because doing something always creates some people who are unhappy... And the fact that we have made so much progress where we've got doctors, nurses, hospitals, even the pharmaceutical industry, AARP, saying that this makes sense to do, I think means that the stars are aligned and we need to take advantage of that.""


Obama was talking about some key industry endorsements he picked up for a health care overhaul. In early May, the hospitals, insurers and the drug industry pledged to save $2 trillion in health care spending over 10 years. That victory was followed by a July 8 announcement that hospitals would contribute $155 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings to cover health care cost reform. 


So, at first blush it seems that Obama is right that the stars are aligned for health care reform. However, we found that some storm clouds are overshadowing Obama’s starry sky.


First, it's important to note that there’s a big difference between supporting a health care overhaul generally and supporting the legislation being considered by the House and the Senate. Nearly all industry sectors believe our health care system needs an overhaul. But they disagree on what to change.


Those divisions are best illustrated by industry support or opposition to the House and Senate health care bills. Among many other things, both bills would create a government-run insurance option and would require that most employers extend some sort of health insurance to their employees. People would be required to have some form of coverage, and insurers would not be able to deny coverage because of a person’s medical history.


The House bill would tax the wealthiest people to help pay for the legislation, while the Senate hasn't unveiled how it will pay for the overhaul.


The American Medical Association — a coalition of doctors and medical societies — endorsed the House bill, because the ""legislation includes a broad range of provisions that are key to effective, comprehensive health system reform."" However, several of AMA's members, including the Texas Medical Association, have not endorsed the bill because it includes a government-run health insurance option.


Another sticking point is an administration proposal that would create an independent group of medical experts to look for inefficiencies in the Medicare system to save money. The American Hospital Association says the plan will hit rural and teaching hospitals hardest because they get extra Medicare payments to help cover their relatively high cost of doing business.


AARP supports the House bill, but believes the Senate bill still needs some work. Specifically, the organization, which represents people over 50, is concerned the bill would prevent some less costly generic drugs from entering the market fast enough.


The leading pharmaceutical industry trade group, PhRMA, does not support the House bill, but says the Senate bill ""marks an important step toward achieving comprehensive health care reform."" And the American Nurses Asssociation supports the House bill, but has no clear position on the Senate bill.


Those are a lot of details to keep track of, so we've provided you with a handy guide

here

. But back to Obama's claim. He's correct that most in the health care industry support some sort of reform, but when we're talking about the overhauls that have been put to paper — specifically, the House and Senate bills — there is quite a bit of disagreement among hospitals, nurses, Medicare patients, doctors and the drug industry over which plan is best; industry support isn't as rock-solid as Obama would make it seem. As a result, we give him a Mostly True.

Obama claims 14,000 lose health insurance every day
","
In his nationally televised news conference on July 22, 2009, President Barack Obama cited a dramatic statistic to emphasize the need for health care reform. He said, “If we don't act, 14,000 Americans will continue to lose their health insurance every single day.”

 

The White House told us the number came from a report published by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and authored by researchers James Kvaal and Ben Furnas. A chart in the report was headlined, “14,000 People Became Uninsured Every Day in December and January.”

 

We wondered about the methodology and whether the December and January numbers were out of date. We couldn't reach the authors of the study (one has since joined the White House staff). But we tracked down Urban Institute health care scholar John Holahan, whose work was cited in the Center for American Progress study.

 

Holahan was the co-author, with A. Bowen Garrett, of the January 2009 study, “Rising Unemployment, Medicaid and the Uninsured,” published by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. That study provided the underpinning for the Center for American Progress report by estimating how many people can expect to lose their insurance when the national unemployment rate goes up.

 

Holahan and his co-author, using a baseline of 4.6 percent unemployment in 2007, calculated that 2.6 million people would lose coverage if the unemployment rate climbed to 7 percent; 3.7 million if it went to to 8 percent; 4.8 million at 9 percent; and 5.8 million at 10 percent.  The estimates took into account people who lost their jobs but then switched to a spouse’s plan or extended their coverage through COBRA, the federal law that guarantees people who lose their job can still get continued health coverage.

 

Applying Holahan's calculations to the actual rise in unemployment from November 2008 to June 2009, we came up with 3.2 million people losing health coverage, or an average of 15,238 per day, so it is close to the 14,000 Obama cited.

 

We asked other health care experts about Holahan’s work, and they uniformly agreed that he is a respected researcher. Only one complicating factor emerged, when we spoke with Edmund F. Haislmaier of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He noted that Holahan’s paper was written before passage of the federal stimulus package, which contains provisions subsidizing 65 percent of COBRA costs for the unemployed. If these new subsidies end up boosting the use of COBRA — the data hasn't been compiled yet — then it could reduce the number of newly uninsured Americans from the levels that Holahan had predicted and that Obama cited.

 

Obama was very close to Holohan's calculations — in fact he was slightly low. But as Haislmaier pointed out, the stimulus COBRA provisions could reduce the numbers because more people will still be covered. We can't be sure until the data is in. So in the meantime, we find Obama’s claim Mostly True.

McCaughey claims end-of-life counseling will be required for Medicare patients
","
Republicans have found many reasons to oppose the Democrats' health care proposal, but this is one of the oddest. 


Betsy McCaughey, chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and former lieutenant governor of New York state, says the bill goes too far to encourage senior citizens to end their lives.
 
On the radio show of former Sen. Fred Thompson on July 16, 2009, McCaughey said ""Congress would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner.""


She said those sessions would help the elderly learn how to ""decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest or in your family's best interest and cut your life short.""


Her point has caught on with conservative pundits. On his July 21 show, Rush Limbaugh said the following:


""Mandatory counseling for all seniors at a minimum of every five years, more often if the seasoned citizen is sick or in a nursing home. ... That's an invasion of the right to privacy. We can't have counseling for mothers who are thinking of terminating their pregnancy, but we can go in there and counsel people about to die.""


McCaughey is no stranger to the health care debate. In 1994, she wrote a scathing review of the Clinton administration's health care plan in the

New Republic,

a left-leaning magazine, arguing that the proposal would lead to rationing of treatment and would prevent patients from choosing health insurance. Republicans seized on the key points of ""No Exit,"" forcing the Clintons to issue a response to the article.


She jumped back into the fray earlier this year while Congress was debating a $787 billion stimulus package. In a Feb. 9 Bloomberg op-ed column, McCaughey criticized the bill for including a plan to monitor health treatments to see which are most cost effective. The elderly, she said, would be denied treatment as a result.


Now the Democratic health care bill is in her sights.


In her chat with Thompson, McCaughey said the language can be found on page 425 of the health care bill, so we started there. Indeed, Sec. 1233 of the bill, labeled ""Advance Care Planning Consultation"" details how the bill would, for the first time, require Medicare to cover the cost of end-of-life counseling sessions.


According to the bill, ""such consultation shall include the following: An explanation by the practitioner of advance care planning, including key questions and considerations, important steps, and suggested people to talk to; an explanation by the practitioner of advance directives, including living wills and durable powers of attorney, and their uses; an explanation by the practitioner of the role and responsibilities of a health care proxy.""


Medicare will cover one session every five years, the legislation states. If a patient becomes very ill in the interim, Medicare will cover additional sessions.


Jon Keyserling, general counsel and vice president of public policy for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, which supports the provision, said the bill doesn't encourage seniors to end their lives, it just allows some important counseling for decisions that take time and consideration.


""These are very serious conversations,"" he said. ""It needs to be an informative conversation from the medical side and it needs to be thought about carefully by the patient and their families.""


In no way would these sessions be designed to encourage patients to end their lives, said Jim Dau, national spokeman for AARP, a group that represents people over 50 that has lobbied in support of the advanced planning provision.


McCaughey's comments are ""not just wrong, they are cruel,"" said Dau. ""We want to make sure people are making the right decision. If some one wants to take every life-saving measure, that's their call. Others will decide it's not worth going through this trauma just for themselves and their families, and that's their decision, too.""


Both Keyserling and Dau were particularly troubled that McCaughey insisted — three times, to be exact — that the sessions would be mandatory, which they are not.


For his part, Keyserling said he and outside counsel read the language carefully to make sure that was not the case.


""Neither of us can come to the conclusion that it's mandatory."" he said. ""This new consultation is just like all in Medicare: it's voluntary.""


""The only thing mandatory is that Medicare will have to pay for the counseling,"" said Dau.
 
For our ruling on this one, there's really no gray area here. McCaughey incorrectly states that the bill would require Medicare patients to have these counseling sessions and she is suggesting that the government is somehow trying to interfere with a very personal decision. And her claim that the sessions would ""tell [seniors] how to end their life sooner"" is an outright distortion. Rather, the sessions are an option for elderly patients who want to learn more about living wills, health care proxies and other forms of end-of-life planning. McCaughey isn't just wrong, she's spreading a ridiculous falsehood. That's a Pants on Fire.

One health insurance company turned a profit, but not a record
","
President Barack Obama has often argued that health insurance companies need more competition, and he's proposed a public option for health insurance to provide it.
 
""There have been reports just over the last couple of days of insurance companies making record profits, right now,"" Obama said during a prime-time news conference. ""At a time when everybody's getting hammered, they're making record profits, and premiums are going up. What's the constraint on that? ... Well, part of the way is to make sure that there's some competition out there.""
 
We wanted to know if he was correct that insurance companies are making record profits during one of the worst economic recessions on record.
 
It seems likely that Obama was referring to the latest earnings report from UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest publicly traded health insurance companies. The day before Obama's news conference, UnitedHealth had announced unexpectedly robust profits that prompted the company to revise its annual earnings guidance upwards.
 
There are many ways to look at a company's earnings, but Obama said ""profits,"" so we looked at net income, which is revenue minus expenses. For the quarter, UnitedHealth earned $859 million. But that's not a record for quarterly net income. During the same period in 2007, for example, its net income was $1.23 billion.
 
We reviewed the income statements of the other largest publicly traded health insurance companies — WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna, Humana and Coventry Health Care — and found similar trends. Generally speaking, profits were  higher during 2007 and 2006, before the economy began its slide. So Obama's modifier ""record"" does not appear to be correct.
 
Of these companies, only UnitedHealth has announced its second quarter earnings. Coventry Health Care is set to announce earnings on July 28; Aetna and WellPoint on July 29; Cigna on July 30 and Humana on Aug. 3.
 
Still, UnitedHealth did make healthy profits, and we asked Steve Shubitz, a health care financial analyst with the investment firm Edward Jones, about it.
 
""The profits are still significant, there's no question about that. But the reality is they're losing a lot of customers in this economy,"" Shubitz said.
 
When companies lay off workers and the workers lose their health insurance, the insurance companies lose customers, and that's why UnitedHealth has seen declining enrollments, he added.
 
If UnitedHealth only offered insurance to companies, ""they would not have had a very good quarter because of the numbers of customers they've lost,"" Shubitz said. But UnitedHealth has diversified, and its business with the government health programs Medicare Advantage and Medicaid performed well, as did divisions that handle pharmaceuticals and health information technology.
 
Shubitz added that the stock prices for health insurance companies are not as high as one might expect, because of impending efforts at health reform.
 
""There are so many different possibilities of what can happen,"" said Shubitz, who also follows WellPoint and Aetna and has ""hold"" recommendations on all three. ""A lot of this uncertainty is already priced into these stocks.""
 
Getting back to our ruling, we wonder if Obama was simply remembering a story he'd read in the paper that day and puffed it up a bit. One health insurance company did report

unexpected

profits. But it's not clear yet whether others will. And the profits UnitedHealth reported were not ""record profits."" We find his statement False.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Steny Hoyer']","
Rep. Steny Hoyer claims there were more job losses in Bush's last three months than last three under Obama
","  In a spirited exchange on the House floor the other day, Republican Rep. Mike Pence used a popular GOP talking point about the economic stimulus package. “Where are the jobs?” he asked.   Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, responded by saying job losses were worse under President George W. Bush.   “We have lost 200,000 less jobs per month than Bush lost in his last three months in office, over the last three months.” His syntax was a bit spotty, but the point was clear — that the scale of job losses was greater during the end of the Bush administration than it has been over the past few months under President Barack Obama. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government agency that keeps employment data, to sort this out. When we asked how the bureau would go about checking Hoyer's math, Gary Steinberg, a BLS press officer, told us to look at the monthly changes in seasonally adjusted, nonfarm payrolls. First we compiled the numbers for Bush's last three months. Between October and November, 597,000 jobs were lost; between November and December, 681,000 were lost; and between December and January, 741,000 were lost. For the most recent three months under Obama: 519,000 jobs were lost between March and April, 322,000 from April to May, and 467,000 May to June.   There are two ways to look at these numbers. While Hoyer’s language leaves some room for interpretation about what he meant, the most reasonable measurement may be to average the three months for each president and then compare the result. Calculated this way, the average job losses under Bush’s three months were 673,000, versus 436,000 for Obama. Subtract Obama’s number from Bush’s and you find that Obama had, on average, 237,000 fewer monthly job losses — meaning that Hoyer was correct. In fact, he understated the difference.   Another way to look at it would be to see if any single month-to-month comparison netted a difference smaller than 200,000. Looking at all nine possible month-to-month comparisons, it turns out that six of the nine comparisons, or two-thirds, match or exceed Hoyer’s benchmark difference of 200,000. So by this measure, Hoyer isn’t perfect, but he’s right more often than he’s not.   We used the above methodology to calculate the numbers after we spoke with two economists — Gary Burtless, an economist with the moderate-to-liberal Brookings Institution and a former economist with the Labor Department, and Anna Turner, a research assistant with the liberal Economic Policy Institute. They agreed with the BLS spokesman about using the change in nonfarm payrolls.   But there is another way to slice and dice BLS’ statistics. When we asked the Employment Policies Institute, a think tank funded by businesses, how it would sift the numbers, a spokeswoman suggested looking at month-to-month changes in unemployment, rather than employment. The employment figures come from a payroll survey of 400,000 work sites, whereas unemployment figures come from a survey of 60,000 households.   Lo and behold, using this measurement dramatically changes the outcome.     The monthly increases in unemployment during Bush’s final three months were 255,000 from October to November, 632,000 from November to December, and 508,000 from December to January. Averaged out, that’s an increase of 465,000 unemployed Americans per month under Bush.   By contrast, under Obama, the nation lost 563,000 jobs between March and April, 787,000 between April and May and 218,000 between May and June. On average, the changes in unemployment were 523,000 per month under Obama — a number that’s actually higher than what it was under Bush. So using these figures, Hoyer would be wrong.   We asked a cross-section of economists whether one measure was inherently better than the other. On this question, the conservatives and liberals we spoke to agreed: Charting employment by using the payroll survey, as Hoyer appears to have done, is indeed the economist's preferred way of doing it.   “Using payroll employment is the way to go — looking at unemployment levels is messy because the labor force is always changing,” said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute. “A general rule of thumb: Look at payroll employment changes, or unemployment rate changes.”   J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation agreed. “If you’re not employed, you get into various issues of why you’re not employed,” he said. “Did you retire? Are you leaving because you’re discouraged about finding a job?” By contrast, he said, “if you’re employed, you’re employed.”        So Hoyer’s figures mostly hold up under scrutiny. He's right if you calculate an average, but he's only right six of nine times when you look at the monthly changes. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB4C3C0>],/factchecks/2009/jul/23/steny-hoyer/rep-steny-hoyer-claims-there-were-more-job-losses-/

Private health insurance not banned on page 16 of the House bill
","
We got several e-mails from readers asking if new health care legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives bans private health insurance for individuals. We tracked the statement back to its source, an editorial from

Investor's Business Daily.

 
""It didn't take long to run into an 'uh-oh' moment when reading the House's 'health care for all Americans' bill,"" the editorial says. ""Right there on Page 16 is a provision making individual private medical insurance illegal.""
 
The editorial continues, ""Under the Orwellian header of 'Protecting The Choice To Keep Current Coverage,' the 'Limitation On New Enrollment' section of the bill clearly states: 'Except as provided in this paragraph, the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day' of the year the legislation becomes law.""
 
The editorial, published July 15, 2009, adds, ""So we can all keep our coverage, just as promised — with, of course, exceptions: Those who currently have private individual coverage won't be able to change it. Nor will those who leave a company to work for themselves be free to buy individual plans from private carriers.""
 
Since then, the allegation about Page 16 has been repeated in many blogs and by at least one member of Congress.
 
We read the section of the bill to which

Investor's Business Daily

referred, as well as a summary of the legislation provided by the House Ways and Means committee. While the quotation is correct, it's taken out of context.
 
Individual private health insurance means coverage that someone buys on his or her own from a private company. In other words, it's for people who can't get coverage through work or some other group, and the rates tend to be much higher.
 
Under the House bill, companies that offer insurance to individuals will do it through an exchange, where the government sets minimum standards for coverage. The new regulations require insurance companies to accept people even if they have previously existing conditions and to provide a minimum level of benefits, among other things.
 
To be sure we were reading the bill correctly, we turned to an independent health care analyst at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation has analyzed the major health care proposals, including those of the Republicans, providing

point-by-point analysis

.
 
Jennifer Tolbert, the foundation's principal policy analyst, told us that Page 16 doesn't outlaw private insurance. ""There will be individual policies available, but people will buy those policies through the national health insurance exchange,"" she said.
 
The House bill allows for existing policies to be grandfathered in, so that people who currently have individual health insurance policies will not lose coverage. The line the editorial refers to is a clause that says the health insurance companies cannot enroll new people into the old plans.
 
The

IDB

editorial has caught the attention of some of the bill's most direct supporters. Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who is guiding the legislation through Congress, wrote a letter to the publication saying the editorial was ""factually incorrect and highly misleading.""
 
The conservative Heritage Foundation also said the editorial misread the legislation, writing on its Foundry blog, ""So

IDB

is wrong: individual health insurance will not be outlawed."" Heritage believes that the new regulations will be so onerous as to drive private insurance out of business ""which is effectively the same thing."" But that is a substantially different argument than what the editorial said.
 
President Barack Obama had the chance to personally quash the

IDB

editorial himself when asked about it in a conference call with left-leaning bloggers. He said he wasn't familiar with the provision, before reiterating his general commitment to not forcing people out of health insurance that they like. (Impress your friends at parties by referring to the proper section on page 16 of the bill: It's Section 102.)
 
In response to Waxman's letter,

Investor's Business Daily

says it's sticking to its guns. In a follow-up editorial, it said that private insurance offered on the exchange will be too regulated to be considered true private insurance, hence its original editorial is correct that the bill bans private insurance. This seems like a creative way of covering up a factual error, though. Many private companies are highly regulated but are still considered to be private. 
 
The original editorial said, ""Right there on Page 16 is a provision making individual private medical insurance illegal."" That's not what the legislation says. When the error was pointed out, a subsequent editorial said it was still true. For perpetuating misinformation and then standing by it in the face of facts, we rate the

House Republicans say the government will take old wood stoves
","House Republicans are playing truth-squad with the cap-and-trade bill.
 
Every day they post one claim about the bill on their  Web site  in an effort to demonstrate why cap-and-trade, which is intended to slow climate change by limiting carbon dioxide emissions, is bad for consumers. Most Republicans oppose the bill.
 
""Daily Truth"" No. 14, which deals with a government program on wood stoves, caught our eye: ""The government is going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so.  The Democrats’ national energy tax is just more government intrusion and more taxpayer dollars used for government-imposed mandates.""
 
From the sound of this claim, it seems like the government would demand all wood stoves be replaced (we imagine packs of bureaucrats knocking down doors and tearing wood stoves out of walls). We wondered whether the cap-and-trade bill really contains such a requirement.
 
Indeed, the bill does set aside about $20 million to replace old wood or pellet stoves — specifically, stoves manufactured before July 1, 1990 — with newer, more efficient models. The money would help consumers pay for the upgrade. They would receive a 30 percent tax credit for costs incurred, up to $1,500.

As it does with most appliances, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets efficiency standards for wood stoves, and to get the tax credit, consumers would have to buy one that bears the ""EPA certified"" label. Supporters of the stove swap initiative say it could help reduce air pollution. According to the EPA, certified stoves emit about three-fourths less pollution than do older models. In some parts of the United States, consumers have already taken advantage of a pilot program encouraging people to buy new stoves, and the bill simply expands that to stove owners throughout the country.
 
Republicans have it partly right about how the program would work. It would use taxpayer money to help consumers upgrade their older, dirtier stoves. And to get the rebate, consumers would have to buy an EPA-approved stove. However, the government is not forcing them to replace the stoves. 

""This is not a mandatory program,"" said Paul Heintz, communications director for Rep. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who helped come up with the plan. ""Those who own stoves that are either not certified by the EPA or were built before 1990 simply have the opportunity to take advantage of this program. They are under no obligation to do so.""

So Republicans are right that taxpayer money is being used to subsidize upgraded stoves but they are distorting how the program works. The government is not ""going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves."" The government is merely offering an incentive to replace them. So we find the Republican claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECD01080>],/factchecks/2009/jul/22/house-republicans/house-republicans-say-government-will-take-old-woo/

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Peter King correct on federal funding of trip by New York imam
","
As the high-voltage battle over the ""Ground Zero Mosque"" was raging on Aug. 10, 2010, two Republican lawmakers -- Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and New York Rep. Peter King, the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee -- took aim at the State Department for allegedly footing the bill for foreign travel by the imam behind the proposed center in lower Manhattan.

""It is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""Abdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is –- a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it. The State Department’s selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administration’s policy and funding priorities.""

We're separately looking at other aspects of the controversy here, including some elements of what Ros Lehtinen and King said in their statement. But in this item, we wanted to look at the narrow question of whether the lawmakers were correct that ""U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East.""

At an Aug. 10, 2010, State Department briefing, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs P.J. Crowley confirmed that a program under the State Department's auspices -- the Bureau of International Information Programs -- is paying for Rauf's trip.

""Imam Faisal will be traveling to Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE on a U.S. government-sponsored trip to the Middle East,"" Crowley said. ""He will discuss Muslim life in America and religious tolerance. ... We have about 1,200 of these kinds of programs every year, of sending experts in all fields overseas. Last year we had 52 trips that were specifically focused on religious -- promoting religious tolerance. We will expect to have roughly the same number of  programs this year.""

On Aug. 18, 2010, Fox News and the Associated Press, citing the State Department, reported that Rauf will be paid $3,000 directly by the U.S. government and that the government will pay for his airfare, lodging and expenses. The total amount for sending Rauf overseas will be roughly $16,000.

Crowley noted that this will be Rauf's fourth trip overseas on the government's dime, including two of them under the administration of former President George W. Bush and one earlier this year.

""In 2007, he visited Bahrain, Morocco, the UAE and Qatar,"" Crowley said. ""And earlier this year, in January, he also visited Egypt. So we have a long-term relationship with him. You know, his work on tolerance and religious diversity is well-known and he brings a moderate perspective to foreign audiences on what it's like to be a practicing Muslim in the United States. And our discussions with him about taking this trip preceded the current debate in New York over the center.""

So Ros-Lehtinen is correct that the federal government (and, therefore, U.S. taxpayers) will be funding Rauf's trip to the Middle East.

Some commentators have gone a step further by saying the trip is tantamount to a fundraising jaunt for Rauf's center. The Washington Times' editorial page wrote that ""by funding the trip so soon after New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission gave the go-ahead to demolish the building on the proposed mosque site, the State Department is creating the appearance that the U.S. government is facilitating the construction of this shameful structure. It gives Mr. Rauf not only access but imprimatur to gather up foreign cash. And because Mr. Rauf  has refused to reveal how he plans to finance his costly venture, the American public is left with the impression it will be a wholly foreign enterprise.""

Crowley, in his Aug. 10 briefing, was asked about the fundraising issue. He knocked down the notion.

""It is something that we have talked to him about, and we have informed him about our prohibition against fundraising while on a speaking tour,"" Crowley said. ""We do not expect him to fundraise.""

We aren't rating this claim, because we don't believe it's provable either way that the trip will offer fundraising opportunities. On the one hand, the government has made clear that fundraising cannot take place during the trip. On the other hand, it's possible that the trip, indirectly, will raise Rauf's profile with people who hear him speak in Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE and, in the process, ease future fundraising for his planned center.

But while we're not taking sides on the fundraising question, we believe that the less-far-reaching statement by Ros-Lehtinen is accurate. U.S. taxpayers are indeed funding Rauf’s trip, as they have his prior two trips to the region. It's worth noting that the decision to sponsor his trip was made before the current controversy became the focus of media attention, and also that Rauf took his first State Department-funded trip during the Bush administration rather than Barack Obama. But none of those facts undercut the statement we checked by Ros-Lehtinen. We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD8E480>],/factchecks/2010/aug/19/ileana-ros-lehtinen/ileana-ros-lehtinen-peter-king-correct-federal-fun/

AFSCME accuses Republican Jim Renacci of supporting a 23 percent national sales tax
","
Rep. John Boccieri, a freshman Democrat from Alliance, is in the cross hairs.

The Republican Party wants to recapture the 16th Congressional District seat moderate Republican Ralph Regula held from 1973 until he retired in 2008. That’s when Boccieri, a Ohio legislator and Iraq War veteran, won the seat an open election.

Republicans and allied groups are buoyed by the anti-incumbent mood of the electorate and by Boccieri’s vote for health care reform, which they hope to exploit with voters. On top of that, Boccieri faces a well-financed Republican in Jim Renacci, a former Wadsworth mayor and CPA who co-owns a nursing home as well as car and motorcycle dealerships.

But a powerful union -- the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) -- has come to Boccieri’s defense, attacking Renacci in a television advertisement that hit the airwaves August 9. Recognizing the anti-tax mood benefiting Republicans, AFSCME wants a piece of the action, accusing Renacci of backing a massive tax hike.

""Jim Renacci supports a national sales tax of 23 percent,"" says the union ad, which includes comments from outraged citizens condemning the proposal.

The AFSCME ad cites a March 9 primary debate in the 16th District sponsored by Tea Party groups. Though not explained in the ad, the figure of 23 percent is a reference to what some Republicans call a Fair Tax, says Ricky Feller, deputy political director for AFSCME, which oversees the union’s independent political arm that is running ads in Ohio.

The Fair Tax proposal is federal sales tax on goods and services that – and this is crucial to the debate -- would replace a slew of other taxes, including federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, estate and gift taxes, business taxes and capital gains taxes. Legislation to create such a tax is introduced each year in Congress but goes nowhere.

The latest version of the legislation, introduced in 2009 by Rep John Linder, a Georgia Republican, would impose a national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services. It sets the sales tax rate at 23 percent in 2011.

Boiled down, critics say that Fair Tax proposal is not enforceable, won’t cover the revenue generated by the taxes it eliminates and the Fair Tax is regressive, that is, people earning lower incomes will pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes because they spend a larger portion of their paychecks than wealthy individuals. Proponents argue the Fair Tax plan would spur economic growth because people will have more money to spend and that will generate tax revenue. They say, lower income people would receive a ""rebate"" for taxes paid on basic necessities to help keep the system from becoming regressive.

The economics behind the Fair Tax proposal are complicated and the subject of books, on-line debates, and fact check articles. For those who want to wade into the weeds, check out FactCheck.org’s take, ""Unspinning the Fair Tax,"" published in May 31, 2007, or PolitiFact.com’s article, ""Adding up the Fair Tax,"" published in January 23, 2008.

What’s at issue in the AFSCME ad isn’t the economics of the Fair Tax proposal, rather: Did Renacci really say he favors a national sales tax increase of 23 percent.

AFSCME did not fulfill its promise to provide PolitiFact a transcript of Renacci’s comments or a link to the video of the debate on which the union based its ad, but cited Renacci’s campaign website to support its charge.

A video of the debate produced by the Tea Party organizers and available on YouTube shows Renacci at the May event responding to the question: ""What is the most effective tax system, flat tax, fair tax or the current tax system?

Renacci called the Fair Tax a consumption tax and used the two interchangeably. He said the Fair Tax ""is a good model. I think it is a fair model. The biggest problem with the consumption tax is implementing it. ... I am a firm believer in the fair tax, consumption tax. ... I would like to see a way to have that implemented in a simple fashion.""

But while the video shows Renacci likes a 23 percent national sales tax,  that’s not enough to make AFSCME’s ad completely accurate. It leaves out important information about Renacci’s record of rhetoric on the matter and how he couched his support during the debate.

As a supporter of the Fair Tax proposal, Renacci likes even more the idea of eliminating all other taxes. He’s been consistent in endorsing the Fair Tax plan with caveats: The plan must address the potential negative consequences of implementing it and the plan has to produce a net tax decrease, a point he’s made on his Web site from the beginning of his campaign.

""While I believe that a form of ""consumption tax"" or ""fair tax"" in lieu of a federal income tax is an idea worthy of further examination, I could only potentially support such a concept if the tax would serve as a replacement to the income tax, not an addition to it,"" he states.

We thought those details were important context for the issue. That’s why we rated AFSCME’s statement Half True.

"['Public Service', 'Florida', 'Holly Benson']","
Holly Benson claims most AGs don't go to court
","
The three Republican candidates for attorney general are all trying to distinguish their records based on their resumes. Holly Benson, whose last job was the head of a state agency, downplayed courtroom experience in a recent debate.

After one of her opponents, former prosecutor Pam Bondi, touted her own courtroom experience, Benson tried to portray logging hours in the courtroom as something that isn't necessary for an AG. Instead, Benson highlighted her own administrative experience overseeing the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation and then the state Agency for Health Care Administration.

""Yesterday I was talking to somebody from General McCollum's team who said 'I think the last time he was in court was the late '70s,' '' Benson said. ""So most AGs don't go to court and it's not a primary requirement of the job.""

That wasn't intended as a swipe at Attorney General Bill McCollum -- a fellow Republican who is now running for governor. Instead, Benson was trying to suggest that Bondi's courtroom experience isn't essential to the AG position.

But we wanted to check to see if Benson is right: do most AGs stay out of court?

We delved into the backgrounds of Florida's three most recent AGs.

Florida's current AG, McCollum, was elected to the job in 2006. AG spokeswoman Ryan Wiggins said McCollum hasn't been in the courtroom while AG. AG spokeswoman Sandi Copes declined to comment on whether the amount of courtroom experience matters for an AG.

She said she found no information that showed that McCollum's predecessor Charlie Crist was in court either while he held that post between 2002 and 2006. But Crist's spokesman in the governor's office, Sterling Ivey, said that Crist was in the courtroom while he was AG on a telecom case. He referred us to Chris Kise, then the solicitor general.

In Crist vs. Jaber, the case involved a challenge to a $350 million rate hike that the Public Service Commission had approved for Florida telecoms, Kise told us in an e-mail. The AG's office argued that the PSC did not follow the statutory mandate because the rates would not remain affordable. Crist argued the case before the Florida Supreme Court along with Deputy Solicitor General Lynn Hearn. Kise said he personally prepared Crist for the oral argument and ""he actually stood up and argued part of the case.""

We asked Kise his thoughts on AGs and courtroom experience. He said it helps to have a ""substantial legal background whether it be trial work or otherwise what I would call real lawyer background. It's an advantage because you understand more about the legal system and the challenges in representing clients. It provides a perspective. Is it essential? I guess its not essential.""

We also spoke to Bob Butterworth who served as AG between 1987 and 2002. He guessed that he was in the courtroom about 25 times.

""Many times I sat second chair for a couple of hearings or Supreme Court arguments, but I never handled (the case) myself because it took two, three solid weeks to get prepared,"" Butterworth said. ""It's very hard as the AG of a large state to do that. A number of AGs do it, but relatively few.""

Butterworth said though he never handled a jury trial as AG he did handle other matters: ""I handled motions. I would also handle a number of settlements that had to be approved by the court such as (the landmark tobacco lawsuit) where Gov. Lawton Chiles and I both represented to a court why we wanted to accept a settlement.""

Butterworth did not see extensive courtroom experience as essential to the job.

""Your job is primarily administration, basically being up front in the agency,"" he said. ""I do not see it as a negative for any person running for the office of AG to not have argued cases.""

To get a nationwide perspective on how often AGs go to court we spoke with Patrick Lynch, the attorney general of Rhode Island for about eight years and a past president of the National Association of Attorneys General. As AG, Lynch also handles criminal cases but we focused our discussion on his role that relates to more typical AG work. Lynch said it's more common to see a district attorney try cases than an AG.

Generally speaking, Lynch said AGs are seen in court when their office has a case before the U.S. Supreme Court or a higher court. But ""in the everyday drudgery of trying cases, going in front of the bar is more rare than not. It's too time consuming. You have too many other responsibilities.""

Lynch said that he will sometimes make appearances in court to show support for his attorneys -- for example he was in the courtroom for arguments in a high-profile lawsuit involving companies that manufactured lead paint but did not deliver these arguments himself. But Lynch could not recall himself delivering the opening or closing arguments or making an oral argument himself in court as the AG.

Since we're on the topic of experience, we asked all three Republican AG campaigns about their candidate's recent time in the courtroom.

Bondi worked for the state attorney's office in Hillsborough County for 18 years until she resigned in December to run for office, said Brett Doster, a campaign spokesman. She was in the courtroom throughout her tenure, he said. ""Two of her cases are on death row right now,"" said Doster, who said Bondi also handled ""any criminal issue you can imagine.""

Kottkamp, elected as Gov. Crist's lieutenant governor in 2006, ""did extensive trial and appeals work"" before he held his current position, according to campaign spokesman David Bishop. The last case he could recall in the courtroom was in 2005.

""It was while he was with the law firm Henderson, Franklin, Starnes & Holt. He represented Publix Super Markets. Case was in Florida 2nd DCA,'' Bishop wrote.

And now Benson.

Benson's campaign said that since she was a transactional lawyer -- a term that refers to business deals -- most of her legal experience was outside of the courtroom. She was the secretary for DBPR in 2007 and 2008 and secretary for AHCA 2008-2009. Before those administrative positions, she was a state representative between 2000 and 2007.

Benson worked as a municipal bond lawyer from 1996-2007 ""and while she occasionally had bond validation hearings in front of judges, she did not routinely appear in court,"" Bridges said in an e-mail.

""The main role for AG is to actually manage and run an agency -- not to try cases on a regular basis,"" Bridges said in an interview.

So where does that leave us?

Benson said that ""most AGs don't appear in court."" McCollum's AG office says he hasn't appeared in court and had no record of Crist appearing in court although we were able to find an example of a case in which Crist did appear. Butterworth said he might have gone to court 25 times in 16 years -- so less than twice a year. By looking at the three most recent examples in Florida, AGs rarely go to court -- but it does happen. So we give Benson a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA8C180>],/factchecks/2010/aug/19/holly-benson/benson-claims-mccollum-last-courtroom-70s/
"['Trade', 'Texas', 'Kevin Brady']","
Kevin Brady says more than 80 percent of trade deficit with nations without free-trade agreements with United States
","
U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, last month spoke in support of creating an Emergency Trade Deficit Commission, while noting his hopes for congressional ratification of trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. 
""The world has changed,"" Brady said on the House floor July 28. ""It’s not enough to simply buy American; we have to sell American, sell our products and goods and services throughout this world. And in fact, over 80 percent of our trade deficit today is with countries that are not trade agreement partners, that are not level playing fields for the United States; that’s why we push hard for those agreements."" 
The 80 percent figure jarred a reader who urged us to give it a once-over; happy to oblige. 
Some background: In June, the U.S. trade deficit reached nearly $50 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Exports in June totaled $150.5 billion, imports $200.3 billion. 
According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the United States has free-trade agreements — meaning neither country imposes trade restrictions such as tariffs — with 17 nations, which together account for 34 percent of U.S. imports and exports. The countries are Israel, Canada, Mexico, Jordan, Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Bahrain, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Oman and Peru. 
Through participation in the World Trade Organization, the United States has agreements permitting some restrictions with many nations. These include export powerhouses such as China, which from January through June 2010 was the leading exporter to the United States, with $161 billion in exported goods, according to the Census Bureau. China was followed in the exports-to-USA category by Canada, Mexico and Japan. 
And what of Brady's ""more than 80 percent"" breakout? Joe Kafchinski, a bureau statistician, said that from January through June, 13 percent of the nation’s trade deficit involved the countries that have free-trade agreements with the United States — meaning 87 percent of the deficit was with nations without such agreements. 
Next, we wondered about Brady's statement that those agreements serve to ""level the playing field"" with other countries, trade-wise — and thus reduce the U.S. trade deficit. 
The National Association of Manufacturers says free-trade agreements ease the export of American goods: ""Free trade agreements (FTAs) account for nearly one-half of U.S. manufactured goods exports,"" the association says on its website. ""They lower the price for consumer goods in the United States as well as the costs U.S. businesses pay for imported materials. Bilateral deals also open foreign markets to U.S. goods, increasing employment in those export sectors."" 
The manufacturers note that the Census Bureau ""reports that over the past two years, U.S. manufacturers had a $50 billion surplus with their counterparts in FTA partner countries. Conversely, in the same time period, the U.S. trade deficit in manufacturing goods with the rest of the world was an astounding $820 billion."" Put another way, the group says, 95 percent of the nation’s manufactured-goods’ deficit is with nations that do not have free-trade agreements with the United States. 
For labor's perspective, we contacted Jeff Vogt, global economic policy specialist for the AFL-CIO. Vogt said China’s 2001 entry into the WTO drove up the U.S. deficit with non-free-trade nations. Regardless of which countries account for the deficit, Vogt said, the imbalance is a problem because the domestic economy benefits more from exports than imports. 
Vogt shared a March 2010 report by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, which focuses on the economic needs of low- and middle-income Americans. The report says the U.S. trade deficit with China increased $186 billion between 2001 and 2008. 
""Rapidly growing imports of computer and electronic parts (including computers, parts, semiconductors, and audio-video equipment) accounted for more than 40 percent"" of the surge, the report says, with deficits in advanced technology products responsible for 27 percent of the U.S.-China deficit. Also, according to the report, the growth of the deficit contributed to the loss of 627,700 U.S. jobs in computer and electronic products, along with other hard-hit industrial sectors including apparel and accessories (150,200 jobs), miscellaneous manufac­tured goods (136,900) and fabricated metal products (108,700). 
But trade agreements are not all that's behind the deficit with China. The report says a major cause ""is currency manipulation. Unlike other currencies, the Chinese yuan does not fluctuate freely against the dollar,"" giving Chinese-made goods an artificial price advantage overseas. In June 2010, China’s central bank announced that it would allow the yuan to fluctuate more, but the value of the yuan has since increased less than 1 percent, according to a news report posted online this week by FinanceAsia. 
Robert Scott, an economist at the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute in Washington, cautioned against presuming that free-trade agreements benefit the United States, saying that depends in part on whether the other nation is as developed as the United States and has open markets. For instance, the U.S. runs a trade deficit with its free-trade neighbor Mexico, he said, dominated by a flow of manufacturing plants to the less-developed country. 
Free-trade agreements, Scott said, are ""designed to make the world safe for multinationals to outsource production forever."" And in a July 1 article on the institute's website that criticized the proposed trade agreement with South Korea as ""foolish,"" Scott wrote: ""History shows that such trade deals lead to rapidly growing trade deficits and job loss in the United States."" 
Clearly, there's a difference of opinion on whether free-trade agreements are a good thing vis-a-vis the growing U.S. trade deficit, as Brady asserts. 
But the key statistic in Brady’s statement stands up. In fact, he understates the share of our trade deficit with nations that don't have free-trade agreements with the U.S. We rate Brady's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD69D00>],/factchecks/2010/aug/19/kevin-brady/kevin-brady-says-more-80-percent-trade-deficit-nat/

Archambault says Rhode Island is ""at the top of the country for alcohol-related fatalities""
","
Law enforcement was one of the natural topics for Operation Clean Government's televised debate among the three Democratic candidates for attorney general.

At one point, one of the three, Stephen Archambault, talked about his four-point plan ""to correct the problems dealing with drunk driving,"" which calls for stiffer penalties for drivers with higher blood-alcohol levels or who are second offenders. The plan also proposes longer license suspensions, including a new type of suspension that would still allow offenders to drive to work.

Then Archambault recalled seeing statistics suggesting that 4 out of 10 fatal accidents in Rhode Island involved alcohol. ""We shouldn't be at the top of the country for alcohol-related fatalities,"" he said.

But is Rhode Island really the worst in the country for DWI fatalities? 

We asked the Archambault campaign for the source of its numbers. They referred us to a 2009 report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's National Center for Statistics and Analysis.

It turns out that Rhode Island is not number one, but we're up there.

For 2008, the latest year for which statistics are available, the state ranked 5th out of the 50 states when it came to motor vehicle fatalities in which a driver was at the legal limit of .08 or higher.

Thirty-eight percent of our 69 driving fatalities that year involved someone who was drunk. That's very close to the 4 out of 10 cited by Archambault. Only Hawaii (39 percent), Montana (40 percent), Wyoming (42 percent) and North Dakota (46 percent) had a worse record.

Apparently our ranking can bounce around. In 2007, Rhode Island was right at the national average of 32 percent, but that doesn't happen often. In 2005 we ranked 11th, and in 2006 we were 10th.

But in 2003 and 2004, we were ranked first in the nation in the percentage of fatalities related to alcohol.

Archambault isn't completely correct about our ranking, unless you go back several years. Yet it's clear he did give an accurate assessment of the scope of the problem.

We'll give him a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7B6500>],/factchecks/2010/aug/19/steve-archambault/archambault-says-rhode-island-top-country-alcohol-/

 DNC chairman says Republicans blocked move to cut the deficit
","
Republicans keep talking about cutting the deficit, but they blocked President Barack Obama's efforts to actually do something about it, Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on the Aug. 15, 2010, segment of CBS Face the Nation.

""The good news is, the president has said I'm going to do what the previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton, did. I'm going to get control of this deficit. And so he's cut domestic spending and -- and frozen discretionary spending. They're making strategic cuts to defense. He's got a deficit commission working that the Republicans tried to block.""

Kaine's statement made us wonder -- do Republicans talk the talk but refuse to walk the walk? We decided to look into it.

We quickly found that what happened isn't as straightforward as Kaine makes out.

It all began with a proposal to create the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action, co-sponsored by the top Democrat and the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H. It would have established an 18-member bipartisan commission to study the current and future fiscal condition of the federal government and make recommendations about how revenues and expenses can be brought into line. Those recommendations would be fast-tracked to the House and Senate floors under a special procedure.

We checked the Senate voting records, and found that the proposal was ultimately rejected by a vote of 53-46. Though a majority voted for the commission, the proposal required 60 votes to avoid the possibility of a filibuster and pass it. Of the 46 people who voted ""nay,"" 22 were Democrats. They were joined by 23 Republicans and Bernie Sanders, who is Independent. Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski was the only senator who did not cast a vote. She was absent for family reasons, but would have supported the proposal, her office told Politico.

Reasons for opposing the panel varied widely. Some Democratic lawmakers worried that the commission would recommend drastic cuts to entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. Republicans, on the other hand, feared steep tax increases and argued that the commission would not be focused enough on cutting spending. There were also concerns that the commission was infringing on Congress' territory. ""Bureaucrats do not enact great legislation. Senators do!"" said Max Baucus, the Democratic Senate Finance Committee chairman.

As noted by a Politico story on Jan. 26, 2010, ""The tepid support from Democratic leaders contributed to the loss, but more decisive was the number of Republicans switching under pressure from their party to block the measure."" Days before the vote, seven Republicans who had supported the measure withdrew their co-sponsorship and eventually voted against it.

""This vote on the deficit commission is like dozens of other votes this year where Republicans changed their support on a bill for purely political reasons. Had the seven Republicans who originally co-sponsored this bill voted for cloture, the deficit commission would have become law. And that is indisputable fact,"" Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said in an e-mail.

Gregg, however, maintained that the White House should have been able to muster up the seven votes that were needed for the measure to pass. ""Clearly, the White House has shown the ability to discipline their party in the Senate, and if they want to pass this, they should be able to … If they can get 60 for health care and 60 for pay-as-you-go limits, they can certainly get seven more votes.""

Then there was Sen. Brownback's proposal to create the Commission on Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies. The panel would have reviewed all federal programs to find those that are duplicative, ineffective, or have outlived their usefulness. The task force would focus exclusively on cutting spending, and would not consider raising taxes. The Senate failed to adopt the measure on Jan. 28, 2010, by a vote of 51-49. Again, 60 votes were required to ensure passage. Forty-five Democrats, three Republicans, and one Independent voted ""nay.""

The debate came to a close on Feb. 18, 2010, when President Obama took matters into his own hands and signed an executive order to create the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission, which meets once a month while Congress is in session, is to propose recommendations designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. The final report must be available no later than Dec. 1, 2010, and will require the approval of at least 14 of the Commission's 18 members. Unlike the several commissions proposed by members of Congress, however, lawmakers are not required to vote on any of the panel's recommendations.

Going back to the original claim. Kaine said that President Obama has a ""deficit commission working that the Republicans tried to block."" We found that several Republican lawmakers who originally supported the Bipartisan Task Force withdrew their co-sponsorship only days before the vote took place. Had they not done so, the proposal would have passed. At the same time, the Democratic leadership also failed to get all of its members in line -- 22 Democrats voted against the measure. Democrats also overwhelmingly voted down a Republican-backed panel that would have looked at ways to reduce the deficit through spending cuts. In all, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC986FC0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/18/tim-kaine/dnc-chairman-says-republicans-blocked-move-cut-def/

Rick Scott tries to tie Bill McCollum to arrested former GOP boss Jim Greer in new TV ad
","
The Rick Scott TV ads just keep coming.

Scott, who has poured $38 million into the Republican primary for governor, began airing a controversial new ad on Aug. 17, 2010, that links primary opponent Bill McCollum to ousted and arrested former Republican Party of Florida chairman Jim Greer.

The ad is called ""Secrecy."" Within 24 hours, two prominent Republicans asked that it be removed from the airwaves.

It opens with a jail mugshot of Greer, and says (correctly) that Greer has been arrested on charges of fraud and money laundering in connection with his time as state GOP chairman.

""And who backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities?"" a narrator asks. ""Bill McCollum.""

""As investigators closed in, McCollum said Greer's financial records should be kept secret, not open to the public.""

The narrator's statement comes with a typed-out McCollum quote from the Associated Press on Feb. 9, 2010. ""I don't think it's good for any party to have everything that's done inside the party open to the public and the press,"" the ad quotes McCollum as saying.

The ad then continues with Greer introducing McCollum on the day McCollum announced he was running for governor, and references a statement McCollum made in June 2010 that he didn't think the state should amend its public records laws so that all communications between state legislators would be public.

The ad concludes with Greer's mugshot next to a picture of McCollum framed to look like a jail mugshot. ""Bill McCollum: He wants to keep it all a secret.""

The 30-second spot, which is part of Scott's closing argument in a tight primary for governor, was quickly excoriated by current RPOF chairman John Thrasher and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who serves as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Both called the ad misleading and false, and asked that it be removed.

""The truth is that Bill McCollum's leadership is part of what led to the removal of Jim Greer,"" Barbour said in a statement. ""This ad distorts the facts and was clearly created without any knowledge of what actually took place. It has no place in this primary. We ask Mr. Scott to pull this ad and move forward in the primary in a constructive manner.""

More specifically, Barbour and Thrasher say that the Scott ad wrongly suggests McCollum was complicit in a cover-up when in fact he helped lead the charge to have Greer removed and investigated. The Scott campaign defends the ad as true, and says it won't be pulled.

PolitiFact Florida decided to sort out the difference of opinion by focusing on a pivotal line in the ad, that Bill McCollum ""backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities.""

Sorting through the RPOF finances 

A little background is in order.

The first allegations about improper spending at the state GOP came in late 2008, when newspapers reported that Greer charged personal expenses to the state party during a fundraiser. The $5,100 bill from the Breakers Hotel included using party money on spa treatments, seafood dinners and limousines. Greer said he would repay any personal expenses.

Questions escalated in August 2009, after court records were released showing that indicted former House Speaker Ray Sansom charged $173,000 on his Republican Party-issued credit card. Charged expenses included taking his family on a trip to Europe, making visits to Best Buy and spending thousands on flowers, clothing, meals and hotels. The release of the records prompted some Republicans to criticize Greer, who as party chairman was responsible for party finances.

Greer famously cut up a party American Express to help mollify critics. But soon thereafter, more party credit card statements were leaked to the press -- statements from Greer, former House Speaker and U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and RPOF executive director Delmar Johnson. The new statements led to even more questions about how the state GOP was spending its money and led some party leaders to call for Greer's ouster. In January 2010, Greer succumbed to the pressure and resigned.

When Thrasher took over as party chairman in February, he ordered an audit of RPOF finances to identify any potential wrongdoing. The audit didn't focus on credit card spending as much as a contract with a consulting company, formed by Greer and Johnson, to do work for the RPOF. The company, Victory Strategies, was paid a 10 percent commission on money raised for the party. The audit revealed that the company received $133,005 in fundraising commissions and another $66,250 for consulting services in 2009.

On March 15, Thrasher forwarded results of the audit to McCollum, who asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate.

On June 2, the FDLE announced Greer's arrest on one count of organized fraud, one count of money laundering and four counts of grand theft. According to the FDLE, Greer directed Johnson to open a bank account for Victory Strategies with Johnson as the only signatory on the account. This was done to conceal the flow of money to Greer. Between February and October 2009, the RPOF paid Victory Strategies a total of $199,254. Of that, Greer was paid $125,161 while keeping his ownership interest hidden. The FDLE said the payments were for many services that were never performed.

PolitiFact Florida previously has ruled on claims related to the scandal. On May 3, we decided that McCollum had committed a Full-Flop on saying he supported transparency in dealing with the RPOF financial scandal. Then on July 13, we rated a claim by Thrasher that McCollum helped to work remove Greer as the head of the state party as True.

McCollum's statements

In this case, the Scott claim is that McCollum backed Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities.

To us, that suggests McCollum was somehow complicit in Greer's scheme. There is no evidence of that, however. 
Rather, the Scott campaign says it's alleging that McCollum attempted to keep the scheme quiet.

According to party leaders and McCollum, the attorney general first learned about the Victory Strategies contract in January, weeks before it was revealed in the media. McCollum said that when he learned about the contract, he asked another party activist attorney if it was legal. He was told yes. (McCollum said he didn't initially know Greer was a beneficiary of the contract).

""It was on the face of it a perfectly legitimate contract,"" McCollum said in a interview on Feb. 9. ""Was it outrageous? Absolutely. Was it something that should have never been entered into? Yes.""

That same day, Feb. 9, reporters paraphrased McCollum as saying that internal party business didn't need to be made public and that releasing credit card statements for past card holders was a decision that should be left to the next chairman.

McCollum then provided the quote captured in Scott's ad. ""Right now the party matters are totally internal … I don't think it's good for any political party to be having everything that's done inside the party open to the public and the press. On the other hand I think it's very important for the party regulars … (to) all have a clear and confident understanding of what's been going on in terms of everything, credit cards and bank accounts, everything else. I think that's what's been missing, and I think that's what the next chairman will correct.""

Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell from the quote if McCollum was talking specifically about credit card statements, or about the Victory Strategies contract, or both.

Two days later in a campaign statement McCollum clarified his position. He said the Republican Party should conduct a private audit of its finances before he would ask for a public state investigation. ""I share the outrage over recent revelations of extravagant contracts and lavish spending,"" McCollum said. ""If audit findings suggest potential criminal activity, I will assist the State Executive Committee in directing these findings to the appropriate law enforcement investigatory agency. The old way of doing business at the Republican Party of Florida enabled an egregious and unforgivable violation of trust between Party leadership and our membership. Now it is time to clean up the mess. I support taking every measure possible to ensure we never again face the challenges before us today.""

And on Feb. 20, after Thrasher was elected chairman, McCollum called for a full internal forensic audit (as he said he would on Feb. 11), and urged that the results be released publicly (which he didn't say in the statement on the 11th). If any potential illegal activity surfaced during the audit, he said, it should be turned over to law enforcement. ""Credit cards should be a part of that. Everything should be,"" McCollum said.

McCollum's statements strike us as a man attempting to shield the Republican Party from bad PR, not someone attempting cover-up potential fraud. In the end, it appears he got bad legal advice from a former party lawyer. Yet, his comments starting on Feb. 11 were clear -- if wrongdoing is found by the party, it will be turned over to the authorities. A month later, McCollum did just that when he presented the RPOF audit findings to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

That also counters Scott's suggestion that McCollum and Greer were somehow holed up at their Tallahassee version of the Alamo surrounded by state investigators. It was McCollum who referred the matter to investigators. And as we've previously ruled, McCollum helped pressure Greer to resign.

Our ruling

You can argue that McCollum should have pressed for more transparency in handling the matter, and some have. And you can argue that McCollum was too slow to react to concerns over party spending, and some have. You can also argue that McCollum was too easily satisfied by the legal opinion of one person.

But that is not what is being alleged in the Scott ad.

It says that McCollum ""backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities."" There's no evidence that we find or that the Scott campaign provided that McCollum had any knowledge of Greer's Victory Strategies contract, or any evidence that McCollum attempted to stop a criminal investigation once an RPOF audit revealed potential fraud.

We rate Scott's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7CF9C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/18/rick-scott/rick-scott-tries-tie-bill-mccollum-arrested-former/

Kendrick Meek's new ad gets Warren Buffett-Jeff Greene context right
","
Far too often we at PolitiFact Florida get accused of being too hard on candidates. We're too literal, or we fail to forgive hyperbole, folks tell us. Or they say we don't understand how the political process works.

We don't think that's true, but regardless, we hear the argument.

So when a campaign takes a second shot at making a strong point that we had labeled Barely True, we think it's proper to give a fresh look to the latest effort. 
Back on July 30, 2010, we took Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Kendrick Meek to task for his TV ad, ""He's the Man,"" in which Meek criticized primary opponent Jeff Greene's background.

Specifically, Meek attacked Greene's trading in something called credit default swaps, a type of derivative that paid off when mortgage-backed securities failed. The long and short of Meek's argument is that Greene made hundreds of millions of dollars betting that people wouldn't be able to pay off their mortgages.

They couldn't. And so Greene won.

That prompted this admonition in Meek's ad: ""Warren Buffett called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' ""

After a thorough analysis, we rated Meek's claim False, noting that while Buffett did make the comment, Buffett wasn't talking about Greene specifically. (A earlier version of this item mistakenly said our the previous item on Greene was rated Barely True.) Moreover, Buffett made his statement three years before Greene even invested in credit default swaps. And Buffett coined the phrase to talk about derivatives in general, not specifically credit default swaps.

""There's no doubt Greene was heavily involved in buying credit default swaps, which are a type of derivative,"" we concluded in our analysis. ""And Buffett was exceptionally critical of derivatives. The problem with Meek's ad is that it gives the impression that Buffett criticized Greene personally, which he didn't do. By saying Buffett called Greene's scheme a bad idea, Meek personalizes a comment that had nothing to do with Greene.""

Our friends at Factcheck.org also found Meek's ad misleading.

Fast forward to Aug. 11, when Meek began airing a new ad, ""All Support,"" with the same Buffett line worded slightly differently.

The new ad says, ""Warren Buffett called credit default swaps financial weapons of mass destruction. And Greene was the first individual to use them.""

We decided to see if Meek's campaign has been listening.

Buffett runs Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company renowned for its savvy investment strategies, and he's No. 2 on the 2009 Forbes list of wealthiest Americans. Some folks call Buffett ""the Oracle of Omaha.""

It turns out he coined the phrase to describe derivatives back in 2003, when he published his annual letter to investors discussing his thoughts on the previous year's business. Buffett warned that it was difficult to truly evaluate the risks involved in speculative derivatives.

""Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices or currency values,"" Buffett wrote.

""The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen),"" he continued. ""At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years in the future, were put on the books. Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins to be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem -- at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.""

Buffett warned that speculative derivatives could become unforeseen catastrophes for some companies. ""Imagine, then, that a company is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their requirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous demand for cash collateral on the company. The need to meet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more downgrades. It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown,"" he wrote.

It turns out this is exactly what happened at some of the biggest financial firms in the country in 2008 -- five years after Buffett's warning.

Buffett was discussing derivatives in the context of Berkshire Hathaway's investment in a company called General Re Securities. Buffett said he attempted to sell without success. At the time he wrote the letter, he was trying to shut down the business, but was having problems resolving the many derivatives contracts General Re had on its books.

""We try to be alert to any sort of megacatastrophe risk, and that posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside,"" Buffett wrote. ""In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.""

Credit default swaps are a speculative derivative like Buffett was talking about, though we should note Buffett didn't specifically discuss credit default swaps in his comments.

Now, was Greene the first individual to use them?

According to Forbes, Greene is ""believed to be the first individual to do so."" Banks typically only let major hedge funds participate in credit default swaps, but Greene convinced banks to make the trades with him individually. (Banks thought the investment was too complicated for a single person.)

Wall Street Journal reporter Gregory Zuckerman, who wrote a book about credit default swaps, described Greene as among the first and most successful private investors to ever participate in the trade. ""He convinced people like Merrill Lynch to do the trade when they wouldn't do it for other individuals,"" Zuckerman said. ""Greene potentially is one of the only individuals in the country to have pulled this trade off.""

Zuckerman claims in his book that Greene was the first individual, not hedge fund, to participate in credit default swaps through Merrill Lynch.

Back to Meek's claim. He said, ""Warren Buffett called credit default swaps financial weapons of mass destruction. And Greene was the first individual to use them."" Buffett, in 2003 comments, described derivatives bought speculatively as financial weapons of mass destruction. That would include credit default swaps. And while people invested in credit default swaps before Greene through hedge funds, Greene is believed to be the first individual to do so on his own. Meek's new ad much more accurately describes the relationship between Buffett, Greene and his investments. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCD1480>],/factchecks/2010/aug/18/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meeks-new-ad-gets-warren-buffett-jeff-gre/
"['National', 'Social Security', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama claims Republican leaders plan to privatize Social Security
","
On the 75th anniversary of Franklin Roosevelt signing Social Security into law, President Barack Obama dusted off an old campaign attack during his weekly address, claiming that Republicans once again intend to privatize the program. 
We couldn't recall any members of the Republican leadership recently calling for such a drastic change, and so we decided to check out whether this was a legitimate issue or a trumped up scare tactic heading into the fall election season. 
Obama raised the issue in an address titled, ""Honoring Social Security, Not Privatizing It."" 
""One thing we can’t afford to do though is privatize Social Security – an ill-conceived idea that would add trillions of dollars to our budget deficit while tying your benefits to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market,"" Obama said. 
Obama noted that this was a debate dating to 2005 when then President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts. Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam (perhaps, in part, because Democrats then labeled the plan as ""privatization""), and it died without even being introduced as proposed legislation. 
""I’d have thought that debate would’ve been put to rest once and for all by the financial crisis we’ve just experienced,"" Obama said. ""I’d have thought, after being reminded how quickly the stock market can tumble, after seeing the wealth people worked a lifetime to earn wiped out in a matter of days, that no one would want to place bets with Social Security on Wall Street; that everyone would understand why we need to be prudent about investing the retirement money of tens of millions of Americans. 
""But some Republican leaders in Congress don’t seem to have learned any lessons from the past few years. They’re pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall."" 
If this all sounds familiar, you may recall that during the presidential campaign, Obama accused Sen. John McCain of wanting to revitalize Bush's plan to ""privatize"" Social Security. We ruled that claim Barely True. 
So why reintroduce the attack now? White House officials pointed us toward the ""Roadmap for America’s Future,"" a bill from Rep. Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. The plan includes a proposal to allow people under 55 to steer a portion of their payroll taxes toward an individual retirement account of their choosing, but overseen by the Social Security Administration. 
We decided to look at Obama's claim from two angles. First, is it fair to describe Ryan's plan as ""privatizing"" Social Security? And second, is Ryan's plan a key part of the legislative agenda being pursued by Republican leadership in Congress? 
Is Ryan's plan to ""privatize"" Social Security? 
Ryan's plan -- which is similar but not identical to Bush's -- would allow workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government (Ryan calls them ""personal retirement accounts""). But that's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security. 
To start, for those currently 55 and older, the current Social Security System would not be affected one way or another; they would simply receive their benefits as they are set up today and could not opt into a personal account. And for those under 55, the possibility of creating a personal retirement account would be totally optional -- one could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as they have been promised. And lastly, for those who do choose to create a personal retirement account, the plan would only allow -- over time -- for people to invest a little over a third of their payroll taxes in the personal account. 
In an e-mail response to PolitiFact, Ryan argued that it would be incorrect to call even the personal retirement account portion ""privatized."" 
""In the personal-accounts system, the accounts are owned by the individual, and managed and overseen by Social Security — not a stockbroker or private investment firm,"" Ryan stated. ""People choosing the reformed system select from a handful of government-regulated options — just as Members of Congress and federal employees do."" 
Not everyone agrees. 
An analysis of Ryan's ""Roadmap"" plan from the left-leaning Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, argues that, ""what makes these accounts private is their ownership, not their oversight or management."" 
We think one could make a plausible argument that the Ryan plan would establish a partially privatized plan. But Obama's sweeping characterization that Republicans are attempting to privatize Social Security seems to be one (big) part scare tactic. When Obama talks about ""tying your benefits to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market,"" it seems to suggest that the plan would affect the benefits being paid to people currently getting Social Security, but those people would be specifically excluded from creating personal retirement accounts because they would only be available to those under 55. 
Which brings us to the second part of our analysis: 
Is Ryan's plan a key part of the legislative agenda being pursued by Republican leadership in Congress? 
It certainly doesn't appear so. Ryan's bill has 13 co-sponsors (all Republicans); and the White House correctly notes that among them are Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the Republican Study Committee Chairman, and Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Ca., Assistant Republican Whip. 
Specifically and conspicuously, however, among those who have not signed on as co-sponsors are the big three in Republican leadership: House Republican Leader John Boehner, Republican Whip Eric Cantor and the Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence. 
According to Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, ""As Rep. Ryan and Republican leaders have made clear repeatedly, the Roadmap is Rep. Ryan's vision of long-term conservative reform. It is not an official position of House Republicans in any way, shape or form. Boehner has thanked Rep. Ryan for offering this vision - but he has not co-sponsored or endorsed it, nor has any other member of the House Republican Leadership."" 
Nor does the plan appear to have much traction among Senate Republican leaders. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, noted that McConnell has said he hopes the Obama-created deficit commission will come forward with a Social Security plan he and other Republicans can support. 
""I don’t know of a single plan (including Rep. Ryan's) that would take the Social Security that seniors currently have and subject it to 'the whims' of Wall Street,"" Stewart added. ""The White House doesn’t know of any either. ... The president falsely claimed that Republican leaders in Congress are trying to take current benefits from seniors and put them in the stock market."" 
Stewart suggested Obama's comments may be prompted by the results of a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that showed the the Democrats' lead on the question of which party would do a better job on ‘dealing with Social Security’ is now down to only 4 points (30 percent to 26 percent); compared to a 28 point advantage for Democrats on that question in October 2006. 
As we noted earlier, Obama has gone to this well before. Accusing Republicans of trying to privatize Social Security no doubt scores political points with many, particularly seniors who depend on it. But as it was during the campaign, Obama's warning is a big stretch. The only ""Republican leader"" who is really talking about allowing personal retirement accounts is Ryan, and even his plan is a far cry from a wholly privatized system. We rate Obama's statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB4DF80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says 700,000 illegal immigrants take jobs
","
In Florida's Republican gubernatorial primary, counting the sins of illegal immigrants has become standard code for, ""Look, I am a conservative!"" 
""If you came here seeking a job, alone, and you're here illegally as many are, I think you should be sent back home,"" Bill McCollum declared during a debate hosted in Miami by Univision, the Spanish-language broadcast channel, on Aug. 2, 2010.

Rival Rick Scott offered a similar solution. Illegal immigrants, he said, ""Need to go home and come back through a legal process.""

Scott also explained why he thinks illegal immigrants need to be shown the door. ""We have over 700,000 illegal immigrants in the state. They're costing us billions of dollars, and they're taking legal residents' jobs,"" he said.

Both candidates support Arizona's anti-illegal immigration law, the most controversial part of which is now on hold because of a court ruling. But Scott has made closing the door on illegal immigration an almost unbending campaign goal. In fact, his early anti-illegal immigrant television advertisements helped build his support base.

Given Scott's focus on illegal immigration, we decided his numbers need a walk through The Truth-O-Meter.

We separated his claim into three parts:

""We have over 700,000 illegal immigrants in our state."" 
The Department of Homeland Security put Florida's illegal immigrant population at 720,000 in 2009. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, an anti-illegal immigrant group, came up with 810,000 illegal immigrants in 2007. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated the population was more than a million strong in a 2009 report. The numbers vary because producing an exact count of an illegal population is impossible. Still, each of these figures are ""over 700,000."" Scott's low-end number earns him a True here.

""They're costing us billions of dollars."" 
Scott's campaign didn't tell us what source they used, but PolitiFact has already looked at how much illegal immigrants are costing the state of Florida. We know that the Federation for American Immigration Reform estimates the state spends $3.8 billion on education, health and incarceration for illegal immigrants.  We determined that the widely quoted study assumed all foreign born inmates and most school children enrolled in English learning classes were illegal immigrants. But Florida does not keep track of what services it provides to illegal immigrants. In short, no one knows what Florida spends on illegal immigrants, so we can't rule on this one yet, though we're still searching for facts.

""They're taking legal residents' jobs."" 
Now this is the complicated part of Scott's statement. Again, his campaign offers no support for the claim. Let's dig in anyway. 
Unauthorized immigrants comprised 8.2 percent of Florida’s workforce, or 750,000 workers, in 2008, according to the Pew Hispanic Center report. So, it is clear that undocumented workers are able to secure illegal employment once they reach the United States.

But are these jobs taken from legal residents?

Yes, in some part. 
Almost all studies, whether by liberal, conservative or business groups, conclude that immigrants take jobs that could benefit the country's least educated. 
""Illegal immigration disproportionately and adversely affects the economic well-being of the most vulnerable and needy segment of the nation’s labor force: its low-skilled workers,"" Vernon Briggs, an emeritus professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University, concluded in a March 2010 paper. He cited U.S. Department of Labor figures, which put the unemployment rate for people over the age of 25 without a high school diploma in its July 2010 report at 15 percent, the highest rate for any educational group of the labor force.

Lorraine Schmall, a law professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law, observed that illegal immigrants primarily work in construction and agriculture fields in a 2008 report titled, ""Worksite Enforcement of U.S. Immigration Laws."" It reads, ""In March 2006, a little over 24 percent of the construction workforce was Hispanic, compared to approximately 6 percent in 1980."" Those figures apply to all Hispanics, regardless of immigration status. But it is worth noting because 17 percent of construction workers were undocumented in 2008, an increase from 10 percent in 2003, according to the Pew Hispanic Center report.

The federal Department of Labor has not studied the effect of illegal immigration on the labor market, according to spokesman Michael Wald. 
Some reports found illegal immigrants reduced wages for native low-skilled workers.

The centrist Council on Foreign Relations found in a 2007 study on illegal immigration that, ""over the 1980 to 2000 period, wages of native workers without a high school degree fell by 9 percent as a result of immigration."" In a 2005 report, Harvard economist George Borjas estimated illegal immigrants who arrived from 1980 to 2000 had reduced the wages of low-skilled workers in the United States by 8.2 percent. 
Other studies, however, argue that any wage impact is minimal. In a 2010 report, the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, found U.S. born workers with less than a high school education saw a relative 0.3 percent increase in wages, or $1.58 per week. The research looked at the estimated effect of immigration from 1994 to 2007. 
Still, there is more to this story. 
Only a handful of legal residents are competing for jobs against illegal immigrants, according to many economists. 
The Council on Foreign Relations study found low-skilled legal U.S. workers are increasingly hard to find. ""Between 1960 and 2000, the share of working-age native-born U.S. residents with less than twelve years of schooling fell from 50 percent to 12 percent,"" concluded the study. ""In Mexico, as of 2000, 74 percent of working-age residents had less than twelve years of education."" 
The 2009 Pew Hispanic Center report found undocumented workers were overrepresented in construction, hospitality and service jobs, all of which tend to offer low wages for hard work, or employment unattractive to native residents, economists said. 
""Most economic research concludes that immigrants and natives work in different jobs,"" said Madeline Zavodny, an economist with Agnes Scott College. ""Immigration therefore has relatively little direct effect on natives."" 
Schmall said that a survey of raids on employment places that hire illegal immigrants, such as construction sites and manufacturing plants, illustrated that employers want to hire illegal immigrants specifically because they have fewer legal rights and are willing to work in horrible conditions. But once the illegal immigrants demanded fair pay, they were shown the door, she said. 
""Many cases at the National Labor Relations Board reflect that workers without documentation are being hired and then fired after they attempt to organize a union,"" said Schmall, who reviewed 42 cases involving worksite enforcement of immigration laws reported to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2008. 
Many economists and labor experts also argue that illegal immigrants ultimately do more good than harm, even if they reduce some native workers' employment or earnings. 
""There are enough studies and analysis that lead to something of consensus among economists that illegal workers contribute to economic growth, creating as much jobs as they occupy,"" said Orly Lobel, a University of San Diego law professor. ""The net result is probably more jobs and better jobs for others."" 
For example, the Council on Foreign Relations concluded in its 2007 study that illegal immigrants increase the supply of labor to perishable fruits and vegetables, meaning ""each acre of land under cultivation generates more output. Similarly, an expansion in the number of manufacturing workers allows the existing industrial base to produce more goods. As a result, ""U.S. cities with larger inflows of low-skilled immigrants experienced larger reductions in prices for housekeeping, gardening, child care, dry cleaning, and other labor-intensive, locally traded services.""

The Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, analyzed economic data pertaining to legal and illegal immigration in the 25 largest metropolitan areas in a December 2009 report and concluded, ""Immigration and economic growth go hand in hand. That’s easily understandable: Economic growth and labor force growth are closely connected, and immigrants are likely to move to areas where there are jobs, and not to areas where there are not."" 
The George W. Bush White House also recognized the advantages of immigration. ""Summing up the economic benefits and costs of immigration shows that over time, the benefits of immigration exceed the costs,"" concluded a 2005 presidential economic report that looked at the impact of both illegal and legal immigration. 
Along the same lines, a study published by Americans for Immigration Reform determined Florida would lose $43.9 billion in economic activity, $19.5 billion in gross state product, and approximately 262,436 jobs if all unauthorized immigrants were removed from Florida. The Houston group claims it is founded by ""Americans concerned with the destructive measures being taken and considered regarding immigration and its impact on the business community, employees and consumers."" 
Citing some of these same reports, PolitiFact Texas ruled a statement that sought to link unemployment reports to illegal immigration as False.

Finally, FactCheck.org, an another independent fact-checking site, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, ruled in May 2010 that illegal immigrants do not hurt the labor market. They also looked at multiple economic reports to reach that conclusion.  
In sum, studies show illegal immigrants do take jobs from some Americans. But they also help create more jobs and stimulate the economy by working for low wages. We rate this part of Scott's claim Half True.

To review, here's what we came up with: Scott is right on the 700,000 number, and he's not saying where his cost figures come from. On the question of taking jobs from legal residents, he's leaving out important details on the declining number of low-skill, low-wage residents affected and the overall economic benefits that result.

Scott's anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric might sound swell to his conservative base, but The Truth-O-Meter isn't so easily persuaded. We give this claim a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7CE280>],/factchecks/2010/aug/18/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-illegal-immigrants-taking-jobs/

Rep. Steve LaTourette says that the stimulus has done little for private jobs while the federal workforce is booming
","
To hear some members of Congress talk, the government’s gone on a hiring binge – at taxpayer expense -- while private-sector hiring is in the dumps. That’s not only lopsided, they say, but it wasn’t the way the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill, was supposed to work.

U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette appears to hold this sentiment. Addressing a gathering of the Portage County Tea Party on July 6, the Bainbridge Township Republican noted how other nations are adopting austerity budgets to deal with their economic problems. Yet, LaTourette said, President Barack Obama seems to think that saving government money is a crazy idea,  and told world leaders as much during the Group of 20 summit in Canada in late June.

Obama ""chastised them and he said, ‘You guys are nuts,’ "" LaTourette said, according to a complete online video of LaTourette’s speech to the Tea Party group. Characterizing Obama’s statements further, LaTourette said the U.S. president told the globe’s economic leaders, ""We need to spend more money. We need to stimulate the economy with government spending.’

""And so as a result,"" LaTourette told his Portage County audience, ""since the president became the president, we have lost 3.3 million jobs in the private sector. But you know who's done OK and who's not complaining today? The public sector. We've gained 590,000 public sector jobs.""

Is LaTourette correct? We at PolitiFact thought we should check it out.

We’ll deal with the numbers momentarily. As far as his characterization of Obama’s sentiments, some license for political hyperbole is in order. Obama doesn’t appear to have called fiscal austerity a nutty idea, and he actually agreed with the global leaders’ goal of halving their budget deficits by 2013.

But Obama also said just before the summit that nations must ""be flexible"" in how they cut spending. Withdrawing stimulus measures too quickly, he said, could trigger ""renewed economic hardship and recession,"" according to news service reports. And he argued strongly against ""any early slowing of stimulus spending by governments,"" according to a Voice of America report from the summit, ""saying that it might bring about a second recession.""  Transcripts of Obama’s closing news conference on June 29 in Toronto are consistent with that report.

But what about LaTourette’s numbers on hiring?

His numbers are right, but only after omitting a key qualifier. In January 2009, there were 110,961,000 private-sector jobs in this country, according to a database of employment statistics maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. By the end of May 2010, that number had dropped to 107,635,000.

That means a private-sector job loss of 3.3 million between January 2009 and May 2010, as LaTourette said.

As for public sector jobs, LaTourette was counting federal workers and not the state and local workforces, which have actually contracted. In January 2009, there were 2,803,000 federal employees. By May, there were 3,396,000 federal workers. That’s a gain of 593,000, putting LaTourette on the money.

But here’s the problem. BLS makes clear, the White House makes clear, and every major news report makes clear when these numbers are released each month that the stimulus had little to do with the growth of the federal workforce. Most of it -- 559,000  new jobs from January 2009 through May – came entirely from the temporary buildup of census workers. And many of those jobs have already disappeared.

For example, the government brought on 411,000 temporary U.S. Census Bureau workers in May 2010. But one month later, 225,000 temporary census workers completed their work and were let go. One month made that big a difference.

Exclude all the census workers hired from January 2009 through May 2010 and total federal hiring comes to only 34,000, not the 590,000 figure that LaTourette cited.

You could contend, as LaTourette’s office did when we contacted it initially, that BLS counts all these jobs in its online databases without separating or distinguishing the Census hires from the rest of the federal workers. That’s true. But BLS makes those distinctions elsewhere -- in its monthly releases of job numbers, and in a fact sheet on census hiring --  and distributes them widely to economists, policymakers, journalists and whatever segment of the public that might be interested.

The distinction for the census is crucial here because it was LaTourette who said that ""as a result"" of stimulating the economy, the public sector gained 590,000 jobs.

The government gained the jobs, but the stimulus had little to do with it. The hiring was planned before Obama became president, as were the rapid-fire census terminations occurring now . By saying there was a cause and effect, LaTourette went off the mark, but he was accurate with his private-sector number, so we rate his claim Half True.

Federal employee pay out of control, candidate says
","
Mike Keown is running for Congress on the belief, in part, that the federal government is growing too big.

Part of his argument comes from some recent newspaper articles about the salaries and benefits of federal employees.

USA Today reported in March that federal employees have higher average salaries and benefits than private-sector employees in more than eight of 10 occupations. On Aug. 10, the newspaper reported that the average annual pay and benefits for federal workers is twice as much as private-sector employees. The August report was picked up by newspapers across the nation and by ABC News.

Initially, we wanted to drop our pens and reporter notebooks and apply for jobs with Uncle Sam. Instead, AJC PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig into the numbers. Do federal workers really bring home twice as much money in salary and benefits as private-sector employees?

Numbers in the newspaper story came from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an agency within the U.S. Department of Labor.

Keown, a Republican hoping to unseat Democrat Sanford Bishop to represent Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, highlighted one set of numbers from the Aug. 10 article on his Web site.

""It is wrong for the average federal worker today to make more than $100,000 while the average private-sector worker makes less than $70,000,"" Keown wrote.

Jay Walker, a spokesman for Keown, said the candidate was trying to illustrate his argument that the federal government should consider privatizing more of its higher-paying jobs. Walker could not recall when Keown, a state representative from Coolidge, posted his comments on his Web site.

""They privatize the cheap jobs,"" Walker said. ""Why can't you privatize the more expensive jobs?""

The exact numbers, according to the story, were somewhat more ($123,049) in 2009 for federal workers and slightly less ($61,051) for private-sector workers. The total compensation, however, includes pension benefits, health care insurance and cost of living adjustments.  

USA Today reported that average compensation for federal employees has risen 36.9 percent since 2000. Those numbers were adjusted for inflation. The big difference, USA Today noted, seemed to be benefits. The average federal benefits were $41,791, compared with $10,589 for private-sector workers.

Federal spending -- and the growing federal deficit -- has been a hot issue as the November midterm elections near. Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown made federal employee pay a theme in his successful campaign to fill the U.S. Senate seat of the late Edward Kennedy. President Barack Obama has proposed a 1.4 percent pay hike for federal workers in 2011, the smallest increase in a decade. Congressional Republicans want to stop across-the-board increases entirely, saying it will save the government $2.2 billion.

No one disputes the raw numbers USA Today reported. The BEA and others quoted by USA Today, however, caution that those numbers do not tell the complete story.  

USA Today noted that the analysis did not consider differences in education and experience.

The August report does not compare the salaries of people working in specific federal jobs to similar positions in the private sector. The BEA notes that its private-sector data includes employees of all professions. That means everything from minimum-wage jobs to the salaries of chief executive officers. Federal employees typically work in professional occupations that pay more, such as accountants, attorneys and economists, according to Congressional Budget Office research.

The BEA also noted in recent years that the federal government is hiring more highly skilled workers who tend to make more money. Many of the lower-paid positions, the BEA found, have been contracted out to the private sector.

""This trend contributed to higher average for federal government civilian employees than for private sector employees,"" the BEA says on its Web site.

Mercer University economics professor Roger Tutterow said cost-of-living and experience must be considered when conducting salary comparisons.

""There are a variety of factors that could account for that difference,"" he said.

The articles do not indicate whether some factors, such as the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C. area, where many federal employees work, were considered. National Treasury Employees Union President Colleen Kelley was quoted in USA Today in March as saying any comparison between federal and private-sector employees is faulty because it ""compares apples and oranges.""

The BEA notes many factors need to be considered when comparing pay and benefits of federal employees to private-sector workers. The statement on Keown's Web site does not mention those factors. Therefore, we rate Keown's statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE8C040>],/factchecks/2010/aug/18/mike-keown/federal-employee-pay-out-control-candidate-says/
"['National', 'Education', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Laura Tyson']","
Laura Tyson correct that U.S. lags in college graduation rates but overstates severity of high school dropout numbers
","
During the Aug. 15, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Laura Tyson -- who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton -- discussed what she considers a root problem with the American economy and the current rash of high unemployment.

She said, ""Let me turn to investment in education. It is the case -- we used to be number one in the world in college graduation rates. We are now number 14, number 15. We're leading the world in high school dropout rates. And as I said, the unemployment problem is most severe in dropouts."" (In fact, we rated a separate claim of hers from This Week that compared unemployment rates for those with and without college degrees. We gave it a Mostly True.)

We wondered whether it was true that the United States ranks 14th or 15th internationally in college graduation rates and whether we're really first in high school dropout rates.

To answer the question, we turned to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies. It produces statistics on a wide variety of economic and social topics that are considered the best way to compare the U.S. to its international peers.

On college graduation rates, we found a table that compared 22 countries in 2007 on what proportion of the population has graduated from college by the typical college graduation age in that country. On that list, the U.S. does indeed rank 14th, with 36.5 percent having a college degree. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Sweden and the United Kingdom all ranked higher than the U.S., while Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Switzerland all ranked lower.

So on this statistic, Tyson seems to be correct.

Meanwhile, the OECD doesn't directly calculate high school dropout rates. We can come close by looking at a statistic that the group does track -- high school graduation rates.

We looked at another table and found that the U.S. has the eighth-lowest high-school graduation rate among the countries studied. The U.S. trails Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The countries with a lower high-school graduation rate are Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.

So on this one, Tyson is off by quite a bit, though the U.S. still has higher dropout rates than the OECD average.

Meanwhile, several experts warned us about a few caveats to keep in mind about these international comparisons. First, in some countries -- especially Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom -- the college graduation rates can be skewed by the presence of a lot of foreign college students. When the percentage is calculated, these students add to the numerator (that is, the number of students graduating college) but not to the denominator (the universe of possible native-born students), thus making the percentages seem higher than they would be otherwise.

Second, despite the OECD's best efforts to standardize the data, there are still some variations from country to country in the nature and quality of the statistics. We noticed that while the college graduation rate for the U.S. and a number of other OECD countries rose by a few percentage points from 2000 to 2007, several countries posted increases of 10 to 15 percentage points, and Iceland nearly doubled its rate from 33 percent to 63 percent.

Such massive increases probably stem from a mixture of methodological differences and a concerted effort in Europe to improve educational attainment during the past decade, said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education and a specialist in international statistical comparisons. ""But overall, OECD is generally reliable for assessing the big picture, if not the fine points,"" he added.

So let's recap. Allowing for some general caution over international education comparisons, Tyson was on the money where college graduation rates were concerned, but was wrong that the U.S. led the world in high-school dropout rates. She bats .500, so we rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDD0380>],/factchecks/2010/aug/17/laura-tyson/laura-tyson-correct-us-lag-college-grads-overstate/

Attorney General candidate Pam Bondi's stance on gay adoption under attack by social conservative
","
As the Republican primary inches closer, the three Republican candidates running for attorney general -- Holly Benson, Pam Bondi and Jeff Kottkamp -- are trying to establish themselves as the conservative candidate of choice.

One big question keeps coming up in forum after forum -- where does each candidate stand on Florida’s gay-adoption ban?

So far, all the candidates say that they would follow through on a lawsuit filed by current Attorney General Bill McCollum defending the state’s gay adoption ban.

The state’s challenge comes after a Miami judge in 2008 ruled the state’s law unconstitutional, following a lawsuit by a North Miami man who wanted to adopt two foster children cared for by him and his partner.

While all the candidates have voiced their opposition to gay adoption, social conservative John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, is not convinced that Bondi, a former prosecutor with the State Attorney’s Office in Tampa, has established a strong enough stance in favor of the adoption ban.

On Aug. 8, 2010, Stemberger dispatched an endorsement letter supporting Kottkamp, stating that Bondi ""refuses to take a position on the gay adoption ban.""

We decided to check out Stemberger’s claim.

Going straight to the source, we asked Bondi her position on the issue and she responded with an e-mail stating: ""As Florida’s next attorney general, I will vigorously defend Florida’s law banning gay adoption in our state. As a veteran prosecutor who has spent her entire career upholding the laws of this state, I have the training and experience necessary to successfully defend our laws in a courtroom.""

Checking back on newspaper reports of earlier candidate forums and events featuring Bondi, it’s worth noting that earlier in her campaign, she was vague in outright declaring a position.

During a June 4 forum in St. Petersburg, when asked about upholding McCollum’s challenge, both Benson and Kottkamp said they would. Bondi said, ""Our judiciary will make a fair and just decision regarding that case.""

Earlier, at a May 18 appearance in Miami Lakes, Bondi was quoted by the St. Petersburg Times as mentioning two gay friends and noting that the adoption process needed reform. ""I have friends in Tampa who are in law enforcement who have adopted from overseas, who are in a loving, committed same-sex relationship."" Still, calling for an overhaul of the adoption process and clearly specifying whether or not gays should be entitled to adoption are two different things.

Bondi, a legal analyst for Fox News, began to clarify her support for the gay adoption ban in subsequent forums and newspaper interviews.

When asked by the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald in a June 5 interview whether she would follow through on McCollum’s appeal, she responded: ""I will continue with General McCollum’s appeal. If [the Supreme Court] can legally hear it, yes, I will appeal.""

At an Aug. 7 forum sponsored by the Christian Family Coalition, Bondi pledged to oppose gay adoption.

Bondi campaign spokesman Kim Kirtley also pointed to interviews with the editorial boards of the St. Petersburg Times on July 14 and the Sun-Sentinel on Aug. 10 where she was asked about her position on gay adoption and she stated her support for the ban. Both papers have handed Bondi an endorsement. 
So back to the question. Did Bondi ""refuse to take a position on banning gay adoptions""? No. She hedged at first, but she’s made it clear since then that she will pursue the appeal and opposes gay adoption. Therefore we rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE8C5C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/17/john-stemberger/ag-candidate-pam-bondis-stance-gay-adoption-under-/

Texas Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson says Social Security slashed poverty among the elderly
","
Aug. 14, 2010, marked the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Social Security Act, and in the run-up to that landmark anniversary, U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, praised the program in a speech on the House floor.

""On the third anniversary of the Social Security Act, President Roosevelt said, 'We have come a long way. But we still have a long way to go. There is still today a frontier that remains unconquered — an America unclaimed. This is the great, the nationwide frontier of insecurity, of human want and fear. This is the frontier — the America — we have set ourselves to reclaim.' Today, much of that dream has been realized. While we may never completely eradicate poverty, great strides have been made. In 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%,"" she said on Aug. 10, 2010.

We don't have the expertise to judge the effectiveness of social safety net programs, but we did want to check Johnson's claim that ""in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%.""

We began with the latter statistic. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, which has been collecting official poverty data for the past several decades, the poverty rate for individuals 65 and older in 2008 -- the latest year for which data are available -- was 9.7 percent. That's pretty close to the figure that Johnson cited.

The second number was a bit harder to verify. The U.S. Census Bureau did not begin tracking the poverty rate until 1959. On top of that, data for individuals aged 65 and older are not available for the years 1960 through 1965.

We spoke with Deborah Johnson, a senior editor and writer at the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Johnson told us to check out a 1987 study from Eugene Smolensky, Sheldon Danziger, and Peter Gottschalk. The three researchers used data from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses to extend the poverty line back to 1939. How did things look back then?

Among men 64 and older, the poverty rate in 1939 was 78 percent. For women, it was 77.5 percent. But what about 1935?

""Even ... 78% would probably be a slightly conservative estimate since poverty for all persons in 1939 was considerably lower in 1939 than in 1935,"" Smolensky wrote us in an e-mail. He said that by his estimates, in 1935, the poverty rate for all families was 69.4 percent. For the elderly, it could have been up to 20 percent higher. Still, the paper also notes that due to changes in the survey methodology, ""data presented here for 1939 are not directly comparable to the data for later years.""

We also looked at research from Robert Plotnick, professor of public affairs at University of Washington. Plotnick and his colleagues (including Smolensky) extended the poverty threshold, adjusting for inflation, back to 1914. In 1935, the poverty rate for the entire U.S. population was 64.9 percent. Plotnick told us that he does not have a breakdown by age, but ""since poverty among elders was consistently higher than for the overall population until the mid 1970s, it would be reasonable to assume poverty among the elders in 1935 was at least 50 percent.""

We asked Johnson's office for a source for the claim and were told that it comes from material that references Growing Old in America, a 1978 publication by David Fischer, now a history professor at Brandeis University. Page 226 contains the statistic that Johnson may have been talking about: ""Dependent poverty among the old grew inexorably, from 23 percent in 1910 to 40 percent in 1930, and 50 percent in 1935.""

The term ""dependent poverty"" puzzled us, and we tried to reach Fischer to clarify what he meant by that, but he did not respond to our query. Plotnick said it is not a standard term currently used in academic literature. After some research, we did find an instance of the term in the writings of Thomas Malthus, the 19th Century English economist known for the Malthusian theory that population, left unchecked, outstrips food supplies and leads to disaster. Malthus used ""dependent poverty'' to describe someone who depends upon charity for survival.

That may be similar to what Johnson was talking about, but it is not the same concept. During her speech, she specifically referenced the U.S. ""poverty rate,"" which is a formal term from the U.S. Census. We talked to some of the top researchers in this field, and they all agreed: the best estimates show that the elderly poverty rate in 1935 was probably somewhere in the range of 70 to 90 percent.

So, to review, Johnson said that ""in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%."" We found no official statistics for the rate of elderly poverty for the year 1935, only academic projections, and making apples-to-apples comparisons between eras is difficult. But those estimates indicate that Johnson may have seriously underestimated the level of poverty for older Americans amid the Great Depression.

Still, Johnson's underlying point stands. The poverty rate among the elderly has dramatically declined. Whether that was the result of Social Security or other factors is beyond the scope of this review. By the best available measures the rate in 1935 was, as she stated, more than 50 percent. And she was just a fraction off on the current level of 9.7 percent. So we rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB823800>],/factchecks/2010/aug/17/eddie-bernice-johnson/texas-congresswoman-eddie-bernice-johnson-says-soc/

John Kasich slams Ted Strickland for leaving job-creation post vacant while unemployment rose
","
Ohio Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich has not missed an opportunity to hammer away at the state’s double-digit unemployment rate under Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, often  throwing out a huge number for jobs loss since January 2007.

But Kasich hasn’t whaled away at just the loss of jobs. He also has chided Strickland for not doing enough to create and bring jobs to Ohio. That duty typically falls to the director of the Ohio Department of Development.

In a speech this month at a candidate’s forum, Kasich told a group economic analysts and community planners, ""We didn’t have a development director for over seven months.""

That’s a big statement in a state whose unemployment rate, like much of the rest of the country, has steadily risen in recent years. It’s a statement that can score a lot of points for you on the campaign trail.

But could it be true? A look back over the past 18 months may be clarifying.

Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher doubled as the state’s development director until February 2009 when Fisher gave up his director duties to focus on his run for the U.S. Senate. Fisher remains the lieutenant governor and is also the Democratic nominee for a senate seat.

Fisher helped handpick his successor as development director, Mark Barbash, who Fisher had brought to the agency as its chief economic development officer. Strickland made Barbash the acting director Feb. 17, 2009, the same day Fisher resigned.

But three months later, Barbash stepped down after he publicly acknowledged that he owed the Internal Revenue Service more than $146,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties and that he was facing foreclosure on his home. That same day, Strickland replaced Barbash as acting director with Lisa Patt-McDaniel, who was the department’s workforce and talent division director.

Strickland did not make her job permanent until September 2009.

That means Ohio was without a permanent development director from February to September of last year. But it is not as if no one was in charge and leading the department, the Strickland campaign has argued. By appointing acting directors on the same days that Fisher and later Barbash resigned, the department technically had a director.

Still, the tag ""acting"" or ""interim"" in front of a title generally means the job isn’t permanently filled. ""Interim"" is synonymous with temporary. ""Acting"", the word preferred by the Strickland administration, means temporarily assuming another person’s duties.

In this case, Kasich might argue that he is technically correct because the development department had no permanent director for seven months, although there were interim people in charge the entire time.

We think a natural impression someone would get from Kasich’s statement is that he was saying the chair was empty -- that Ohio’s job-making agency was without leadership for seven months just as the recession was gobbling up jobs in the Buckeye State at a quickening pace.

But we know someone was in charge.

That’s why we rate Kasich’s statement as False.

Laura Tyson says college grads have just 4.5 percent unemployment rate
","
On the Aug. 15, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Laura Tyson -- who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton -- broke down the nation's unemployment rates in a striking fashion.

Tyson, who now teaches in the Haas School of Business at the University of California (Berkeley), highlighted the significantly lower unemployment rates of Americans with college diplomas and advanced degrees, in contrast to the overall rate. 

""We have to worry about the longer-run problem of this structural employment,"" Tyson said, ""because I'm going to point out one thing for this discussion. ... Unemployment for those with college educations is now 4.5 percent. Unemployment for those with more than a college education, below 4 percent. We have a problem of education in this country, and we have to educate more of our young people fully through college education. Let's take this as an opportunity to do that.""

We wondered whether her numbers were right, given that the national unemployment rate for all workers in July was 9.5 percent -- more than twice as high as the figures Tyson mentioned. (Separately, PolitiFact Texas looked at a similar claim by President Barack Obama.)

We looked at the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the national unemployment rate as well as unemployment rates for various subgroups. Those subgroups include Americans of four specific educational attainment levels. They are: less than a high school diploma; a high school diploma but no college; some college experience but no college diploma; and a college diploma.

For those with less than a high school diploma, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 13.8 percent during July. For those with a high school diploma but no college, the rate was 10.1 percent. For those with some college experience but no college diploma, the rate was 8.3 percent. And for those with an undergraduate degree or better, the rate was 4.5 percent. That's less than one-third of the rate for high-school dropouts -- and it's exactly as Tyson said it was.

What about the unemployment rate for those with more than a college education? Economists we spoke to said that BLS doesn't regularly publish that statistic, though it can be calculated by labor and employment experts from the raw data BLS releases.

Tyson didn't return our inquiry, but we checked with BLS directly, and they gave us three relevant statistics for July -- the unemployment rate for those with masters' degrees; those with professional degrees, such as law degrees; and those with doctorates.

These aren't exactly comparable, since BLS does not release seasonally adjusted figures for those with advanced degrees. But we'll provide them anyway. The unadjusted July rate for those with masters' degrees was 4.9 percent. For those with professional degrees, it was 2.0 percent, and for those with doctorates, it was 1.9 percent.

We calculated the overall unemployment rate for all three categories using proper weighting and found that the rate was slightly above 4.0 percent. That's not ""below 4 percent,"" as Tyson said it was, but it's very close. 
In addition, the June 2010 BLS unemployment rate for those with more than a college degree is 3.3 percent. If Tyson was intending to use those statistics (which, once again, are not seasonally adjusted), she'd be correct -- but those aren't the most current figures.

So, Tyson was right about the unemployment rate for college graduates and at worst, she was close on the unemployment rate for those with more than a college education. On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDA5240>],/factchecks/2010/aug/17/laura-tyson/laura-tyson-says-college-grads-have-just-45-percen/
