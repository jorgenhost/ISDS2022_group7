Trump’s talk on preexisting conditions doesn’t match his administration’s actions
","Delivering remarks on surprise medical billing, which is a concern that has drawn bipartisan interest, President Donald Trump waded into another high-profile health issue: making sure insurance protects people who have preexisting health conditions.  ""We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, very importantly,"" Trump said on May 9. It’s natural Trump would want to make this claim. Polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that such protections, which prohibit individual insurance plans from charging people more based on their medical history, are a top priority for Americans and among the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) With that context, we decided to put a microscope to the president’s claim. We asked White House staff to point us to the policies or proposals on which Trump’s statement was based. They declined to provide specifics but reiterated the president’s assertion. Texas vs. Azar, and a health policy vacuum Interviews with four separate experts, though, suggested that the administration’s stance on a pending lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act runs counter to Trump’s claim. The case, known as Texas vs. Azar, comes from a group of Republican attorneys general who argue that the entire health law should be struck because the 2017 tax bill gutted Obamacare’s requirement to have insurance, often called the individual mandate. In December, a Texas judge agreed. The case is now before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. And, most relevant here, the Department of Justice — that is, the Trump administration’s legal arm — has refused to defend the ACA in these proceedings. It’s highly unusual for an administration to decline to defend a federal law in court.    ""This is a case when the department can make strong arguments in defense of the statute. Refusing to defend in those circumstances is almost unprecedented,"" said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan. Initially, the Trump administration’s position on the lawsuit focused on the individual mandate, arguing that without it the ACA’s preexisting condition protections should be struck down, too. In filing a brief to the appellate court, though, the DOJ joined the plaintiffs to argue the law should be scrapped entirely. This outcome would also eliminate the law’s protections for people with preexisting health conditions. In that context, ""there is real cause for skepticism"" about Trump’s assertion, said Wendy Netter Epstein, a law professor at DePaul University. The most generous assessment came from Jonathan Adler, a health law expert at Case Western Reserve University. Adler has supported previous Obamacare challenges, but he argued that this one is legally unsound. He agreed that the White House’s actual actions are ""at odds with the president’s promise."" But, Adler said, the structure of Trump’s claim — promising what his administration ""will"" do, rather than commenting on what it has done — leaves open the possibility of taking other steps to keep preexisting condition protections in place. That’s true, other experts acknowledged. So far, the White House has postponed a legislative push until after the 2020 election — leaving a vacuum if the courts do wipe out the health law. And, the GOP bills the White House has supported to date — including the so-called Graham-Cassidy legislation first proposed in 2017, which the administration again endorsed in its 2019 budget proposal — would fall short, multiple experts said. Unlike the ACA, Graham-Cassidy allows states to redefine which core benefits — a list that includes protections for people with health problems — insurance plans must cover, which would make those protections optional. (For more on Graham-Cassidy, here’s another PolitiFact check from last fall.) Plus, experts said, even if the White House had a plan, the odds of it gaining passage are slim with a divided Congress. That makes safeguarding the ACA in court ""the only show in town"" if the administration is serious about protecting consumers who have preexisting conditions, Bagley said. There’s one loophole that conservatives — the White House included — might lean on, suggested Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. It relies on what people mean when they talk about ""protections."" Some experts also point out that the administration has issued regulations that run contrary to Trump’s claim. In particular, it recently issued a rule loosening restrictions on the length of so-called short-term health plans, which supporters said would bring a more affordable option to the individual insurance market. But these plans, which, because of the rule change, can last a year instead of three months, are considered bare-bones and are not required to provide preexisting condition protections. Trump said his administration will ""always protect patients with preexisting conditions."" The White House’s policy trajectory does exactly the opposite. The DOJ’s stance, which reflects a policy in place at the same moment the president made this claim, would eliminate the only law guaranteeing that people with preexisting conditions both receive health coverage and do not have to pay more for it. And on the regulatory front, the administration has advanced a health insurance option that is not required to include these protections. Furthermore, the administration has not put forth any plan that might keep those guarantees in place. Every replacement health bill it has endorsed has offered protections less generous than those offered by the ACA. And it has taken further steps that could make it harder for people with preexisting conditions to get affordable coverage. This statement is not accurate and makes a claim in direct opposition of what’s actually happening.

The problem with calling Venezuela's crisis under Maduro a genocide
","In recent months, the world has watched a worsening situation in Venezuela, where the country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, has presided over rampant inflation, dwindling food and supplies, human rights abuses, and mass departures by his people. Most nations in the world have roundly condemned Maduro's government for the suffering in Venezuela, including many deaths. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., has a word for it: genocide. His use of that particular word sets him apart from other politicians. ""The pain, the hunger, the devastation. I cannot believe any human being would do this to young children,"" Scott said on May 13 at the 2019 Concordia Americas Summit in Colombia. ""This is evil. And there’s one man responsible for it: Nicolás Maduro. This is obvious to most of us. Nicolás Maduro is carrying out a genocide on his people."" Scott, a former governor who represents a state with many Venezuelan emigres, has used the word ""genocide"" repeatedly to describe the situation under Maduro. Scott defended his use of ""genocide"" when questioned by the Miami Herald. ""Little kids are starving to death because Maduro won’t give them food,"" Scott told the paper. ""That’s called genocide. I’m very comfortable with (calling) what’s going on in Venezuela ... genocide. I believe Maduro is intentionally starving his citizens."" When we asked Scott’s office about it, his spokesman sent over the United Nations’ definition of genocide, arguing Maduro’s actions fit the bill. Experts we contacted agreed that the situation in Venezuela is deplorable. However, they also agreed that Scott’s use of the word is a significant overreach. It matters, they said, because using the word ""genocide"" too loosely makes it harder to define and stop actual genocide. Corruption and mismanagement in recent decades has left Venezuela — once rich with generous oil resources — a disaster. More than 3 million people have left Venezuela in recent years. Maduro won re-election in May 2018 in a race that was criticized as rigged and was sworn in Jan. 10. Two weeks later, opposition leader and National Assembly President Juan Guaidó declared himself the interim president. The Trump administration, as well as many other world leaders, have recognized Guaidó. Maduro has cut off ties with the United States, kicking out diplomats and blocking aid. A precise death toll is hard to come by, though news reports said dozens of Venezuelans have died in protests this year and reports show even higher figures in previous years. Many more have died due to worsening conditions including blackouts and lack of medicine and food. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that Venezuela has seen a rise in the murder rate in recent years and a civil social organization reported thousands of killings by the government. But the Venezuelan government has refused to release information about the health crisis. When we asked Scott’s office to explain the senator’s use of ""genocide"" to describe Maduro’s actions, spokesman Chris Hartline sent PolitiFact the United Nations’ official definition of genocide: Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" including a.    Killing members of the group; b.    Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; c.    Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; d.    Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; e.    Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Amid the deaths and poor conditions, we wanted to learn how Maduro's actions fit this criteria. Experts said they don't. While laying out its definition, the U.N. acknowledges that ""the popular understanding of what constitutes genocide tends to be broader than the content of the norm under international law."" It adds, ""Importantly, the victims of genocide are deliberately targeted — not randomly — because of their real or perceived membership of one of the four groups protected under the Convention, which excludes political groups, for example. This means that the target of destruction must be the group, as such, and not its members as individuals."" Experts say the narrower definition is the appropriate one, regardless of what may popularly be used. Maduro may be in violation of other aspects of international law, such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which Venezuela affirmed decades ago. However, Maduro’s actions ""do not seem to qualify as a genocide under the legal definition"" of the United Nations, said Anthony Clark Arend, a government and foreign service professor at Georgetown University. That’s because under the U.N. definition, genocide means the destruction of a specific group. The term ""national"" in the U.N. definition does not apply to the case of Venezuela, since that term is intended to refer to national groups such as the Kurds, the Inuit, and the Basques, Arend said. ""Acts that are targeted against the population as a whole or groups not listed, while potentially horrific, do not qualify as genocide,"" he said. Examples of genocide were carried out against Jews by Nazi Germany or against Tutsis in Rwanda. ""This is standard authoritarian oppression more than anything else,"" said Florida International University political scientist Eduardo Gamarra, a specialist in Venezuela. ""It is not genocide."" While some hard-line opponents of the regime are pursuing an indictment against Maduro at the Hague for crimes against humanity, that standard is lower than genocide, said New York University historian Alejandro Velasco. ""It’s not really genocide when you are killing your own people without attention to race, language, religion, or other factors,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. ""‘Crimes against humanity’ might be more fitting."" Multiple scholars told PolitiFact that they worry about the consequences of Scott’s language. ""His words are actually demeaning to people or groups that have actually faced systematic extermination,"" said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Pomona College specialist in Latin American studies. Robert Gellately, a Florida State University historian and co-author of ""The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective,"" called Scott’s term ""inaccurate and unhelpful."" ""We have to stop using ‘genocide’ as the ultimate word we use to describe an awful crime, even deliberately hurting or killing some of one’s own people,"" he said. ""Genocide happens rarely, and we should keep in mind a narrow use of the term."" Omer Bartov, a Brown University historian and author of ""Anatomy of a Genocide: The Life and Death of a Town Called Buczacz,"" said that a watering-down of the term could hamper efforts to stop genocide when it does happen. ""Using this term when it does not fit is damaging to the very idea of genocide prevention,"" Bartov said. Scott said, ""Nicolas Maduro is carrying out a genocide on his people."" Experts on genocide contacted by PolitiFact universally agreed that the conditions in Venezuela are horrible, with many saying Maduro’s actions amount to tyranny and possibly crimes against humanity. But they strongly agreed that ""genocide,"" as defined by the U.N., does not apply to the situation in Venezuela, because it does not involve the deliberate targeting of an ethnic group for destruction.

NC Democrat says there's no wait for private school vouchers
","North Carolina lawmakers want to make more people eligible for private school subsidies from the state. The subsidies come in the form of vouchers known as Opportunity Scholarships, a program that provides up to $4,200 to families interested in sending their students to private schools. State law currently limits vouchers to families earning about $63,000 a year, WRAL reported. But a GOP-backed bill, SB 609, would raise the limit to families making up to $70,000 a year. The NC Senate on May 8 voted 27-18 to approve the bill and send it to the House — against the wishes of Democrats who said the state shouldn’t spend tax dollars on private schools. During debates, a pair of Mecklenburg County Democrats suggested program expansion isn’t needed. Sen. Jeff Jackson tweeted that ""demand has been low."" Sen. Natasha Marcus, meanwhile, said during a floor speech that there’s ""no wait list"" for the vouchers. ""To the extent there’s any wait list, it’s that these parents make too much money to qualify,"" she said. Jackson’s claim is debatable. Marcus’s claim, however, is misleading. 520 STUDENTS For the current school year, 7,593 of 8,113 eligible applicants got Opportunity Scholarships. Those 520 students weren’t rejected because their parents made too much money, as Marcus said. They were blocked from receiving vouchers due to a cap that limits state spending on kindergartners and first-grade students, as PolitiFact reported in a previous fact check. Students of any grade can receive vouchers. But the state ""can only award 40 percent of the money to kindergarten and first grade,"" said Kathryn Marker, director of grants, training, and outreach at the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority. The so-called wait list evaporates after each year. In other words, the 520 students left out last year won’t automatically be first in line when the application window opens this year. So, technically, there’s no wait list at this moment. But Marcus is wrong to suggest that scholarships were given to every eligible family. Contacted by PolitiFact, Marcus said her comment was made in the context of funding. ""I was referring to the fact that no children were denied a voucher due to lack of funding, as is so often the case with Pre-K wait lists,"" Marcus said in an email. ""The arguments on the floor in defense of this expansion seemed to suggest we needed more funding to alleviate a waitlist."" However, that distinction isn’t clear upon reviewing her full comments during the May 8 debate. ""There’s some talk about a wait list and some suggestion that not every kid who wants a voucher for private schools is able to get one and we need to expand,"" Marcus said during the May 8 debate. ""I want to be clear, as far as I know — and someone can correct me in this body if I’m wrong — every student who has requested a voucher for private school in this state, every year that this program has happened, has received the full voucher amount to which they were eligible,"" she said. ""To the extent there’s any wait list, it’s that these parents make too much money to qualify. Every student who’s eligible right now has received a voucher, and there’s still $13 million left in this fund, sitting there held hostage for two years before it reverts back to the general fund. So, there’s no wait list."" INTEREST RISING Before we rule on Marcus’s statement, we also wanted to weigh in on Jackson’s tweet. ""A few years ago, we (controversially) started subsidizing private schools with vouchers. It was limited to low income families,"" Jackson tweeted. ""But demand has been low, so now they want to raise the income eligibility."" The word ""low"" can be somewhat subjective and hard to define since the program is only five years old. There are also restrictions on who can qualify for the vouchers, so the pool of potential recipients is limited. Still, in each year of its existence, the number of new applicants and the number of recipients has gone up. ""Clearly, there’s steady interest. We feel the program is growing in a sustainable way. It’s not that it’s flat, it’s growing,"" Marker said. Contacted by PolitiFact, Jackson said unspent money is evidence of low demand ""relative to expectations."" He pointed to money left on the table, as reported by the Charlotte Observer and NC Policy Watch, a liberal advocacy group. Scholarship allocation data doesn’t necessarily represent the total cost of the Opportunity Scholarship program, Marker said. According to Marker, the leftover money amounted to: 2017-2018: $6.3 million 2016-2017: $2.7 million 2015-2016: $4.1 million 2014-2015: $5.8 million OUR RULING Marcus said there’s ""no wait list,"" and the only people who didn’t receive scholarships weren’t eligible. That’s not telling the full story. There is not a wait list in the sense that eligible applications exceed demand, and the ones who didn’t get a scholarship were rolled over to next year. But more than 500 families were left without scholarships last year — even though they were deemed eligible — because of a cap on vouchers to kindergarten and first grade students. Her claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True. Correction: A previous version of this story included inaccurate numbers for the amount of Opportunity Scholarship funding left unspent in fiscal years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. The change doesn't influence our ruling. Our Truth-O-Meter rating remains the same.

Is suicide the second-leading cause of death among Missouri youth?
","State Rep. Tracy McCreery, D-St. Louis, raised her concerns about carrying guns on college campuses at an April 8 House debate regarding House Bill 575. This bill, sponsored by Rep. Dean Dohrman, R-La Monte, passed the Senate on April 25 but has stalled out before receiving final approval. The bill, which would allow some faculty and staff on college campuses to carry concealed weapons, is unlikely to pass this session. In debate, McCreery said, ""Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among 15-19 year olds and 25-34 year olds in Missouri."" McCreery said she was not backing this bill, because she believes carrying firearms on campus would provide ""more chances for people to commit suicide."" We decided to take a closer look at McCreery’s statement that suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth and young adults in Missouri. When we asked McCreery about her claim, she pointed us to a fact sheet, Firearm Suicide in the United States, published in August 2018 by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. ""This trend has been of particular concern for children and teens, with the rate of firearm suicide up by 61 percent in the past ten years,"" according to the fact sheet, referring to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She also said she found data specific to Missouri from the Missouri Department of Mental Health. We found her data on a fact sheet, Suicide in Missouri: Where We Stand, published by the Missouri Institute of Mental Health researchers, on behalf of the Missouri Department of Mental Health, in August 2017. It precisely states that suicide ""is the second leading cause of death among 15-19 and 25-34 year-olds."" We were also able to find the most recent fact sheet, which was published in August 2018. It still states that suicide is the ""second-leading cause of death in Missouri among youth/young adults ages 10-24 in 2016,"" adding that suicides are highest among 20-24 year-olds. ""The statistics speak for themselves,"" McCreery said. ""In Missouri, young people usually use guns to commit suicide. The data is very powerful."" The information provided by the Missouri Institute of Mental Health also reveals useful information as to where Missouri stands compared to other states. Suicide rates in Missouri are higher than those nationally. The state is ranked 14th-highest in the nation with a rate of 18.33 (per 100,000 people), while the national rate is 13.42. ""Missouri has had several federal grants that have provided programs in schools and training in mental health agencies. It is one of a handful of states to have been awarded what’s called a Zero Suicide grant,"" said Maureen Underwood, clinical adviser for the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide. According to the CDC, suicide is also the second-leading cause of death among the youth and young adults ages 10-34 in the United States in 2017. Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for the same age group. McCreery said, ""Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among 15-19 year olds and 25-34 year olds in Missouri."" The latest counts published by the Missouri Institute of Mental Health show McCreery is correct. We rate McCreery’s statement True.","[('Interview, Rep.

The Mooch misstates China’s WTO misbehavior
","President Donald Trump is taking a tougher line on China following decades of what he considers unfair trade practices — and his message to Beijing is being amplified by allies in the punditsphere. Among the president’s complaints is that China continues to misrepresent itself before the World Trade Organization by claiming to be a ""developing"" country, a designation that confers certain privileges. ""China, which is a great economic power, is considered a developing nation within the World Trade Organization,"" Trump tweeted April 6. ""They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair.""  China, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S. Trump’s onetime White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci elaborated on the president’s argument during an interview on Fox News’ Justice with Jeanine. ""One of the things the president is upset about is they came into the WTO as a developing nation. So that means they can tariff and embargo things,"" Scaramucci said May 11. He added that Trump would like the WTO to treat China as a developed nation. We wondered if it was true that China’s developing nation status in the WTO empowers it to impose tariffs and embargoes. We found that Scaramucci’s claim contains some truth, but overstates the case. The WTO traces its history to the aftermath of World War II. The organization was set up to administer trade rules and resolve disputes, based on a belief that more global trade would foster cooperation and stability. The WTO’s 164 member states are split into two groups: developed countries and developing countries. How members are categorized has become a source of bitter controversy. Rather than lay out an objective criteria, the WTO lets countries choose their status. The United States, the world’s largest economy, labels itself ""developed."" But China, the world’s second-largest economy, considers itself a ""developing"" nation. The distinction matters, because developing countries get special treatment. This is Scaramucci’s broader point: China’s self-applied ""developing"" nation status confers advantages. But he exaggerated the scope of the benefits. (Scaramucci did not reply to our request for comment.) A critical point is that both developed and developing nations alike can impose tariffs; this right is not exclusive to developing nations. ""All countries have the right to tariff and impose export restrictions,"" said Stuart Malawer, a professor at George Mason University. ""But this is limited to compliance with the basic rules and commitments under the WTO."" Both rich and poor WTO countries agree to have caps placed on their tariff rates. Declaring oneself to be a ""developing"" nation does not give a country free rein to tariff to their heart’s delight. As for Scaramucci’s point about embargoes — a blanket ban on the importation of certain goods — the WTO generally prohibits this. Here are some of the perks that developing countries do enjoy. Upon joining the WTO, poorer countries traditionally have negotiated much higher tariff ceilings than richer countries. And China, which entered the WTO in 2001, has higher tariff rate caps than those of the United States. This disparity is perhaps what Scaramucci was referring to. ""The more nuanced analysis is that the U.S. wants China’s tariff rates to be reduced below their current bound rates,"" said Gregory Shaffer, a professor at the University of California, Irvine School Of Law. There are other perks to having ""developing"" country status. The WTO grants special access to certain markets. They’re eligible for technical and other WTO support. And importantly, for purposes of this fact-check, developing nations are given more time to implement trade agreements. Experts told us they couldn’t rule out the possibility that China has used the developing country status as a pretext to keep trade barriers in place, or delay their removal. ""There are a lot of confidential contexts where China could have made the argument that its development status justified a trade restriction,"" said Simon Lester of the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank. ""So I can’t say with certainty that they have not done so."" As a developing country, China also has more freedom to limit imports of agricultural products. To give a practical example, Beijing buys a nationally farmed good like wheat for above-market prices, which in turn encourages Chinese farmers to produce more than what the market demands. This artificially boosted surplus makes it harder for foreign farmers to export their product in China. According to an analysis of economic data by Kristen Hopewell of the University of Edinburgh, Beijing’s subsidies make up 38% of Chinese farmers’ revenue for wheat, 29% for corn and 32% for rice. In contrast, U.S. subsidies account for between 2 to 10% of American farmers’ revenues for these products. ""It has used this freedom, much to the annoyance of the U.S.,"" said Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which generally supports free trade. Hufbauer added that he believes China has exploited its developing country status to gain an advantage in the agricultural sector. Beijing has sometimes crossed the line in the process. The WTO’s adjudicative body this year ruled in favor of the United States in a dispute over Chinese agricultural subsidies. Washington prevailed on the grounds that Beijing regularly paid farmers in excess of agreed-to limits on agricultural subsidies, giving Chinese farmers an unfair advantage over international competitors.   The Trump administration is lobbying the WTO to establish an objective criteria to determine whether or not a country is ""developing,"" instead of letting countries decide themselves. China says that while it may be the world’s second-largest economy, the highly populous country is not rich when measured on a per capita basis. As one top Chinese official recently argued, ""China is the world's largest developing country."" Scaramucci said China’s status in the WTO as a developing nation ""means they can tariff and embargo."" All WTO members — developed and developing nations, alike — have a right to tariff. However, they must agree not to exceed certain tariff caps. Having the status of ""developing nation"" does not free a country from its obligations. Members are also generally prohibited from imposing embargoes. But developing countries typically do negotiate higher tariff caps than their developed counterparts. Experts also said there’s some evidence that China has exploited its developing country status to gain an advantage. We rate this Half True.

Social media post sharing newspaper story of Trump having a 73 IQ is fake
","An image spreading on social media appears to have made quite the discovery about President Donald Trump. The post shows a purported newspaper clipping and makes the claim that Trump’s intelligence quotient was finally discovered, and it’s 73 — just a couple of points away from ""intellectually disabled"" and far below the average IQ score of 100. The problem is, the story appears to be manufactured for the purpose of spreading misinformation: The images are miscaptioned and there is no evidence any of its claims are true. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline of the fake story reads: ""Trump IQ test results discovered in former NYMA employee’s closet. The result: 73"" The text says: ""The results of an IQ test that President Donald Trump allegedly took during his first year at New York Military Academy have been discovered in a file box in a closet in Brooklyn. According to the test results, Trump’s IQ is 73."" The article goes on to say a man named William Askew Jr. discovered the files while cleaning out his deceased father’s apartment. Askew explains that his father was a school counselor at the military school from 1955 to 1985. Let’s just get this out of the way: People have been conjecturing about presidential IQs for years, but we found no record of a presidential IQ being made public. Of course, many presidents died before the advent of the modern IQ test, the first versions of which were formulated in the early 1900s. Not that people haven’t tried to assign IQ numbers to the commanders in chief. In 2006, a University of California at Davis study by psychologist Dean Keith Simonton estimated that the sixth U.S. president, John Quincy Adams, had a genius-level IQ somewhere between 165-175. The study applied an algorithm to presidential performance ratings from historians and political scientists, as well as presidential biographies, surveys and other sources. Simonton’s study ranked Thomas Jefferson as the second-smartest president with an average score between 145-160. John F. Kennedy came in third with estimated results between 138-159. Trump, both before and after becoming the 45th president, has been known to challenge people to IQ tests, including once bragging that, in a competition with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Trump’s IQ would be higher. He also famously called himself a ""very stable genius."" But news coverage of such presidential claims have never led to an actual Trump IQ score. In 2013, when Trump was asked on Twitter what his IQ score was, he tweeted in response, ""The highest, a--hole."" Nothing about this viral image changes what we know (or don’t know) about Trump’s IQ. A reverse-image search of the supposed newspaper clipping screenshot revealed no results. Similarly, we could find no articles online or in the Nexis archive of legitimate news sources that discuss the discovery of a Trump IQ score. That’s important, because if such a story exists –– that the president of the United States once received a 73 IQ test result –– it would not only be found easily on the internet, but the reporting would have been replicated by media organizations around the world. A search with zero results suggests the post is fabricated. What’s more, the photo of ""William Askew Jr."" — the man who the post claims discovered the test results in a Brooklyn closet —  is actually a photo from an Adobe stock photography website, searchable by the phrase ""portrait of an elderly man.""   And the image of the man who is supposedly Askew’s father actually depicts Mr. Lawrence W. Hanson, the principal of Grand Forks Central High School in North Dakota in the 1950s. Jack Serafin, vice president of the Regiment of Graduates for New York Military Academy, attended the school from 1962 to 1967, a period that overlapped with Trump, a 1964 graduate. Serafin told PolitiFact the claim holds no merit. ""It's bogus, NYMA did not give IQ tests and the long time counselor of 30 years, ‘Askew,’ did not exist,"" Serafin wrote in an email. ""The only tests I remember were to gain admittance to the school, like an SAT, that was taken prior to applying."" A screenshot of what appears to be a newspaper clipping claims that Trump has a 73 IQ, according to a test he took when he attended New York Military Academy in the 1960s. That test never took place, an alumni association leader said, and the newspaper clipping pictured does not exist outside of the meme. The pictures in the post of people involved in the discovery were also cherry-picked and miscaptioned.

No, the Talking Angela app isn’t secretly taking your child’s picture
","Remember the ""Momo challenge""? It stemmed from an unsettling ghoul-like figure known as ""Momo"" that reportedly appeared online and encouraged unsuspecting children to hurt themselves. Except it was a hoax — the ""Momo challenge"" isn’t real. So we wondered when we saw a warning about another Internet-based threat. What appears to be a screenshot of a Facebook post was shared on the social media platform on May 7 encouraging parents to ""take no chances."" ""Warning to all parents with children that have any electronics devices,"" the Facebook post says in all caps. ""There is a site called Talking Angela, this site asks kids questions like: there (sic) names, where they go to school and also take pictures of their faces by pushing a heart on the bottom left corner without any notices. Please check your children’s iPods and all to make sure they do not have this app!!! Please pass this message on to your friends and family members that have kids!!!!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ll cut to the chase: As far as we can tell, the app doesn’t take users’ photos and Angela can’t ask questions unless she’s repeating back a question you asked her. The app once included a chat feature that let users text with Angela and she could ask questions there, but that no longer seems to be an option. Here’s what we know. Talking Angela is an app from Outfit7. The company’s website invites users to join Angela, a white cat with blue eyes, ""in Paris — the city of love, style and magic."" ""There are so many surprises, you better sit down. ;),"" the description says. ""Enjoy amazing gifts, pick the latest styles, and sip magical cocktails to experience special moments. And watch out for birds — you never know what might fly by.""   Outfit7 didn’t immediately respond to an email from PolitiFact asking about the Facebook post. But we downloaded the app to experience Talking Angela for ourselves. First, the app asks users for the year they were born and this writer confirmed that she is an adult. After allowing the app to access my microphone, Angela appears dressed in a blue, strapless dress. She’s sitting at a cafe table, blinking and occasionally yawning. By touching the screen, I can make her giggle or reach for her tail with a shriek. Tap her nose and she sneezes. Because my microphone is enabled, Angela also repeats what I say. There’s a button that directs users to YouTube and four buttons on the bottom of the screen that let users buy gifts for Angela or summons birds to fly across the screen. There is a pink heart, like the Facebook post says, though it’s in the bottom right corner. Clicking on the heart brings a dog dressed as a waiter onto the screen and he presents Angela with a chocolate that she opens. A fortune appears on the screen and users have the option to save it to their phone’s photos. (""Just because you don’t have a prince, doesn’t mean you’re not a princess,"" one says.) Angela didn’t ask me any questions unless she was repeating a question I asked her. But news coverage of the app in 2014 suggests parents then had valid reasons for concern. Back then there were rumors the app was a front for a pedohile ring. Writing for The Guardian, Stuart Dredge concluded that it was a hoax, but he noted that Outfit7 could improve the how children interact with the app. Talking Angela is for both adults and children but when Dredge wrote his story in 2014, there was a ""child mode"" setting (when we used the app, we couldn’t find such a setting). ""If you’ve read about Angela asking kids for their names, ages or engaging in banter about clothes-swapping parties, none of this can happen if Child Mode is on,"" he wrote. ""The downside of this: it’s far too easy to toggle it on and off."" There was also a camera feature, he said in the article, ""that encourages users to look into their device’s camera and make specific gestures: nod, shake head, smile, yawn or stick your their tongue, so Angela can copy it."" (This wasn’t a feature when we used the app.)      Lastly, Dredge wrote, when ""child mode"" is turned off, users can chat with Angela using a text box at the bottom of the screen. She asked him questions like, ""How long have you been friends with your best friend?"" and ""I’m 18. How old are you?"" When USA Today ran an article in 2014 about the pedophile ring hoax, Samo Login, Outfit7’s cofounder, told the newspaper that the app is based on chatbot software and it isn’t possible for a human to take over talking for Angela. The story goes on: When the text-chat feature is on, Angela asks the user for their name, age and personal preferences to determine conversation topics. Outfit 7 said the data from the app is ""anonymized"" and all personal information removed. In 2013, Sophos, a security software company, called warnings that the app steals children’s names and details of where they go to school and takes secret pictures of their faces ""bogus."" A blog post about the rumors says: The chain letter warning about the ""Talking Angela"" iOS app is being unwittingly spread by Facebook users, presumably with the thinking of ""better safe than sorry"" rather than ""maybe I should just check the facts before forwarding this scare onto my friends."" The truth is ""talking Angela"" appears to be entirely benign, and there are no obvious privacy concerns that differentiate it from thousands of other iPhone apps. It seems that now the app doesn’t have a chatting option at all, regardless of the users’ age. A Change.org petition from 2017 complains that even though rumors about the app were false, the option for adults to chat with Angela was removed.   ""The game is now a shell of its former self,"" the campaign creator wrote, ""but, with your support, we will tell Outfit7 we want it back!"" Our ruling A Facebook post claims that the Talking Angela app asks children personal questions and takes their picture without warning. It’s true that the app once allowed users to text with Angela if the app was not in ""child mode,"" but that option appears to have been stripped of all versions, regardless of the user’s age or settings. Pushing the heart in the corner of the app also doesn’t take a picture, as the Facebook post says. Rather, it generates a fortune with a picture of Angela that users can save to their photos on their phones.

Bernie Sanders: ‘Exploitative’ payday loans in Wisconsin average 574% annual rate
","Ramping up his latest push for the White House, Bernie Sanders is taking aim at high interest rates on credit cards and payday loans. The Vermont senator introduced legislation in May 2019 — along with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — that would cap both rates at 15%. Payday loans are small-dollar advances designed to provide emergency funds. They are typically due in full on the borrower’s next payday. Critics say these operators take unfair advantage of those in financial distress with exorbitantly high interest rates. Sanders, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, zeroed in on those rates in Wisconsin — and several other states — in a May 10, 2019 tweet. Here’s what it said: ""Average annual interest rates on payday loans: Delaware: 521% Idaho: 652% Nevada: 652% Texas: 661% Utah: 652% Wisconsin: 574% It's time to end exploitative lending that keeps Americans trapped in debt. We will cap interest rates on consumer loans and credit cards at 15%."" This implies Wisconsin’s rates are among the worst in the country for payday loans. Let’s check out where we stand and whether the 574% interest is accurate. Payday loan operators tend to thrive in poor and minority communities, where borrowers struggle to obtain traditional credit. The loans are ostensibly designed to bridge the gap until the next payday, but the astronomical interest rates — averaging more than 300% nationwide — mean most consumers can’t afford to pay it back in full, according to the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Within a month, 70% of payday borrowers take out a second payday loan. And about 20% of borrowers fall into a debt trap that includes 10 or more loans, the bureau said. That’s in line with Sanders’ claim that these loans keep consumers ""trapped in debt."" The states Sanders lists are those with the six highest annual rates on payday loans according to the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonpartisan organization that calls for more safeguards for consumers. The group calculated the rate for each state Sanders referenced based on the rate most commonly advertised for a $300 loan by the largest payday chains in each state, said spokesman Matt Kravitz. So a state where the four largest lenders had rates of 300%, 400%, 500% and 500% would be listed at 500% since that appears most often. In other words, it’s not an ""average"" as Sanders’ tweet claims. Sanders’ spokesman Bill Neidhardt confirmed the tweet was based on the numbers from the responsible lending group. Wisconsin is one of just three states — along with Delaware and Texas — that have no rate limit on short-term payday loans, Kravitz said. Many states cap these rates around 15%, and the responsible lending group says caps 36% or less can stop the ""payday loan debt trap"" cycle. Other states have recently moved to address this issue. PolitiFact Ohio rated True a claim that their state’s payday laws were the ""worst in the nation"" in June 2018.  But a law that took effect in April 2019 capped rates at 28% and limited the frequency and amount of such loans. The Wisconsin payday rate cited by Sanders and the Center for Responsible Lending is based on advertised rates. Actual rates reported to the state are slightly lower. The state Department of Financial Institutions, which regulates the payday loan industry here, said the average rate for 2018 was 486% based on data reported by the lenders themselves. That would mean $65.18 in interest charges on a $350, 14-day loan. The state does limit the interest rate charged after the loan maturity date, capping it at 2.75% per month. Other limits on payday lending in Wisconsin include restricting consumers to loans of $1,500 or 35% of their gross monthly income, whichever is less. Sanders included Wisconsin on a list of the highest payday loan rates in the country. He listed Wisconsin as having an ""average annual interest rate"" of 574%. That’s in line with the numbers reported by a national group that tracks these numbers. But Sanders labeled that the average rate, when it is actually the ""mode,"" or most common rate among the largest lenders. The state figures that calculate an actual average show a rate of 486% — slightly lower, but still astronomical and still among the highest rates in the nation. These rates can, as Sanders said, create a cycle that leaves consumers ""trapped in debt."" We rate Sanders’ claim Mostly True.  ","[('Bernie Sanders,\xa0Twitter, May 10, 2019', 'https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1126961748320423942'), ('Center for Responsible Lending, Map of U.S. Payday Interest Rates, Feb. 14, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Matt Kravitz, spokesman for the\xa0Center for Responsible Lending, May 13-14, 2019', 'https://www.responsiblelending.org/research-publication/map-us-payday-interest-rates'), ('Email exchange with Bill Neidhardt, spokesman for Bernie Sanders, May 13, 2019', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions,\xa0Wisconsin Guide to Payday Loans, January 2019', 'https://www.responsiblelending.org/'), ('National Conference of State Legislatures, Payday Lending State Statutes, Jan. 23, 2018', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/may/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-payday-loans-wisconsin/

Who pays for US tariffs on Chinese goods? You do
","  As President Donald Trump has upped the ante in his tariff war with China, he’s consistently argued that consumers shouldn’t be worried. Trump has slapped China with a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of goods and floated the possibility of tariffs on $325 billion in additional Chinese goods. China, meanwhile, prepared to impose retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion in American products. In remarks at the White House on May 9, Trump said, ""So our country can take in $120 billion a year in tariffs, paid for mostly by China, by the way, not by us. A lot of people try and steer it in a different direction. It’s really paid — ultimately, it’s paid for by — largely, by China. And businesses will pour back into our country."" He reiterated that argument in a May 13 tweetstorm, saying that ""there is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today."" Trump suggested some alternatives — buying from suppliers in a country without tariffs, or buying from an American company. His repeated message is that Americans shouldn’t worry about the economic impact of his tariffs, couching his claim by saying it's ""mostly,"" ""really,"" ""largely"" or ""ultimately"" paid for by China. Despite the hedging words he uses, experts told us the president is wrong to offer that sort of assurance. ""It is inaccurate to say that ‘countries pay’ tariffs on commercial and consumer goods — it is the buyers and sellers that bear the costs,"" said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist. ""Purchasers pay the tariff when they buy popular products. Sellers lose market share when their products get priced out of markets."" The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. The idea behind imposing tariffs is to make American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly. Economists told us, however, that real-world examples of tariffs working as intended are rare, and consumers of the tariff-levying country are the primary victims of tariffs, by having to pay higher prices. The federal treasury does get paid when tariffs are levied. But Chinese exporters don’t make the payment. The importers do — usually U.S. companies. ""If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer — say, Costco,"" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, wrote in September. ""The Chinese government pays nothing."" Customs and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don’t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill. When the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But experts say that’s not the most common decision for the types of tariffs at issue in the current U.S.-China trade war. ""When tariffs are levied at 10 percent, many firms choose to absorb the cost in their margins,"" said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. This can be done by settling for lower profit margins or cutting costs in some fashion. ""However, with tariffs now scaled up to 25 percent, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers,"" de Bolle said. ""That means that U.S. consumers could in some cases pay 25 percent more for a given good than they did before."" Meanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality. In addition, tariffs could also produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, since the economy is now tightly interwoven into complex and time-sensitive ""supply chains."" And any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy. Because studies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to spend a larger fraction of their income on goods, they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do. U.S. producers selling to China would be hurt by retaliatory tariffs, given the large Chinese share of certain American agricultural exports, such as soybeans. Finally, Gleckman wrote, a decline in overseas competition hurts consumers by making them more reliant on less competitive firms with higher prices. All estimates of the potential economic hit from the Trump tariffs are subject to some degree of speculation. However, the Congressional Research Service recently reviewed a range of professional estimates and found that they ""generally suggest a moderately negative impact."" One recent study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, and Columbia University concluded that ""the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018."" The Congressional Budget Office projected a 0.1 percent decline in the annual U.S. GDP growth rate. The International Monetary Fund projected a 0.2 percent decline in the annual U.S. GDP growth rate. A variety of companies have reported harm from the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs, including Walmart, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods, CRS reported. The U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, but China could suffer, too. Facing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China’s gross domestic product. But that’s not even certain, since China could conceivably make up those sales, or many of those sales, elsewhere. Tariffs do generate some revenue, but economists say it’s not wise to count on tariffs for this purpose. According to the Congressional Research Service, revenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs through Feb. 21, 2019, have totaled about $18.5 billion. However, that’s just 2 percent of the federal budget deficit, most recently estimated at $896 billion. Trump said that tariffs are ""paid for mostly by China, by the way, not by us."" China doesn’t pay the initial tariffs — U.S. importers do. In many if not most cases, those costs are passed on to American consumers, whether it’s directly on the products hit by the tariffs or through an impact on U.S. companies who use raw materials hit with tariffs. China could also take a hit over the longer term in its gross domestic product, but experts say the harm to the U.S. economy would be swifter, more certain and potentially bigger.

"['Climate Change', 'Public Health', 'Texas', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
Beto O'Rourke says race is No.1 indicator for location of toxic facilities. Is it true?
","If elected president, Democratic candidate Beto O’Rourke said he’d launch a $5 trillion plan to combat climate change and invest in communities already dealing with its impact. ""Climate change has a distressingly disproportionate impact on poor and minority communities across the United States and around the world,"" said O’Rourke in his plan released April 29. ""Race is the No. 1 indicator for where toxic and polluting facilities are today."" We rated Mostly False another claim in O’Rourke’s plan regarding the number of people with ""unsafe"" drinking water. This time, we wondered if he was right about race and the placement of toxic facilities. O'Rourke's claim mirrors a statement by an NAACP program that highlights environmental and climate issues affecting communities of color and low-income, and draws from a 2016 editorial in The Nation citing examples of ""environmental racism."" We asked about half a dozen experts to weigh in to help us evaluate the claim and O’Rourke’s evidence. They said that while different types of studies can yield varying results, there’s research supporting O’Rourke’s point. ""There is ample evidence that toxic and polluting facilities are disproportionately​ located in communities of color and low-income,"" said David Konisky, an Indiana University professor who researches environmental justice. The types of facilities that O’Rourke is talking about include coal-fired power plants, hazardous waste landfills and incinerators, oil refineries, and chemical manufacturers. ""The vast majority of research indicates that in the United States, minorities, particularly blacks and Hispanics, are disproportionately burdened by environmental hazards of pollution as compared to whites,"" said Jeremy Mennis, a geographer and professor at Temple University. Blacks and Hispanics in the United States tend to be poorer than whites, so there’s been some debate on whether the geographic disparity of these facilities is due to race or socioeconomic status, Mennis said. But even when socioeconomic factors are similar across white and non-white communities, minorities are still more likely to be near environmental hazards, said Paul Mohai, an environmental justice expert and professor at the University of Michigan. Some studies have found that the racial composition of a neighborhood is a stronger predictor than income, property value, and other socioeconomic factors, Mohai said. Those studies used ""distance-based"" methods and examined racial and socioeconomic disparities at the time of the facilities’ siting. In a study published in 2015, Mohai and Robin Saha, a collaborator at the University of Montana, explored which came first to a neighborhood, people of color and low-income, or commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. They examined facilities sited from 1966 to 1995 and the demographic composition of host neighborhoods around the time of siting and demographic changes after siting. ""Our findings show that rather than hazardous waste (treatment, storage, and disposal facilities) 'attracting' people of color, neighborhoods with already disproportionate and growing concentrations of people of color appear to 'attract' new facility siting,"" their study said.  Experts said that factors analyzed regarding the racial disparity in the location of hazardous facilities include: •  intentional discrimination in siting; • historical zoning and land use patterns related to segregation and redlining; • minority communities having less political clout to fight back a proposed facility; • and a ""coming to the nuisance"" phenomenon in which after a facility decides where to locate, people of color and low-income move in as property values and quality of life decline, and people who can afford to move out do so. This general topic has been studied for decades and has yielded varying results as researchers employ different methodologies. A 1995 report by the U.S. General Accounting Office summarized findings in 10 studies mainly focused on the demographics of people living near hazardous waste facilities. (The agency’s name changed in 2004 to the Government Accountability Office.) The studies’ conclusions varied, the report said, because researchers used different methodologies, different definitions of ""racial minority"" and analyzed different types of facilities. GAO told PolitiFact it wasn’t aware of an updated version of the 1995 report. Journalist’s Resource, a website that curates scholarly studies and reports, in September published a research roundup centered around environmental justice. It pointed out that people most at risk of living near toxic waste sites are often low-income or racial/ethnic minorities. The roundup included state-specific studies with different results. A 2000 study on Texas and Louisiana said that race was ""not a significant correlate with the location of hazardous waste sites."" But a 2009 study on Illinois said, ""Our results support prior research that suggested race, rather than class, was the major indicator of environmental inequality."" The 2016 editorial in The Nation, which O’Rourke’s campaign flagged as evidence, linked to a 1983 GAO report and to 1987 and 2007 studies prepared by researchers for the United Church of Christ. (The church engages in racial and social justice advocacy.) The GAO report focused on hazardous waste landfills in eight southeastern states and found that blacks represented the majority of the population in three of the four communities where landfills were located. More than a quarter of the population in all four communities had below-poverty income and most of that population was black. The 1987 study for the United Church of Christ said race was the ""most significant"" among the variables tested regarding the location of commercial hazardous waste facilities. The 2007 study said race continued to be an ""independent predictor"" for the location of the facilities and ""a stronger predictor than income, education and other socioeconomic indicators."" Mohai was one of the principal authors of that 2007 study. The 1987 study was ""seminal"" and helped launch the environmental justice movement, said Jill Witkowski Heaps, an environmental justice expert and visiting professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law. O’Rourke said, ""Race is the No. 1 indicator for where toxic and polluting facilities are today."" Several studies say that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live near hazardous waste facilities and other plants. They’ve also found that race is a stronger indicator than other variables, such as income or property value. There isn’t consensus on O’Rourke’s claim, but much research and feedback from experts support his claim. Overall, we rate O’Rourke’s statement Mostly True.","[('Beto O’Rourke campaign website, plan to fight climate change, announced April 29, 2019', 'https://betoorourke.com/climate-change/'), ('Email interview, Beto O’Rourke’s spokesman, Chris Evans, April 30, 2019', 'No link'), ('NAACP, environmental and climate justice issues', 'https://www.naacp.org/issues/environmental-justice/'), ('The Nation, Race Best Predicts Whether You Live Near Pollution, Feb. 18, 2016', 'No link'), ('Quartz, Race is the biggest indicator in the US of whether you live near toxic waste, March 22, 2017', 'https://www.thenation.com/article/race-best-predicts-whether-you-live-near-pollution/'), ('Email interview, Daniel Faber, sociology professor at Northeastern University, May 7, 2019', 'No link'), ('Phone and email interview, Paul Mohai, Professor of Environmental Justice, School for Environment & Sustainability, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, May, 7-9, 2019', 'https://qz.com/939612/race-is-the-biggest-indicator-in-the-us-of-whether-you-live-near-toxic-waste/'), ('Email interview, Jill Witkowski Heaps, an environmental justice expert and visiting professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law, May 7, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview, David Konisky, an Indiana University professor whose research includes environmental justice, May 7, 2019', 'https://www.gao.gov/assets/160/155134.pdf'), ('Email interview, Jeremy Mennis, a geographer and professor at Temple University, whose research includes environmental justice, May 7, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Aba Blankson, senior vice president of marketing and communications NAACP, May 6, 2019', 'http://archive.gao.gov/d48t13/121648.pdf'), ('U.S. General Accounting Office, HAZARDOUS AND NONHAZARDOUS WASTE Demographics of People Living Near Waste Facilities, June 1995', 'No link'), ('U.S. General Accounting Office, Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills And Their Correlation With Racial And Economic Status of Surrounding Communities, June 1, 1983', 'https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/unitedchurchofchrist/legacy_url/13567/toxwrace87.pdf?1418439935'), ('United Church of Christ, Toxic Wastes and Race report, 1987; Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty', 'No link'), ('1987—2007, March 2007', 'https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/unitedchurchofchrist/legacy_url/491/toxic-wastes-and-race-at-twenty-1987-2007.pdf?1418423933'), ('Iopscience.iop.org, Which came first, people or pollution?

"['Abortion', 'Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Eric Swalwell']","
Swalwell’s tweet about Georgia’s new abortion law is only slightly off-key
","Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp recently signed into law the state’s latest abortion restriction. Political reaction to the measure, which prohibits the procedure once a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat — usually at about the six-week mark — was swift. Abortion opponents applauded the measure, which puts Georgia in the company of Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota and Iowa. (Courts have blocked the Iowa and North Dakota laws.) Reproductive rights activists are widely expected to challenge the Georgia law, which many legal experts say violates the abortion standard set by the Supreme Court in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, was among the critics who weighed in. ""The so-called ‘heartbeat’ law outlaws abortion before most women even know that they're pregnant,"" Swalwell posted on Twitter. ""This is one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in our country."" Swalwell’s claim is an argument we’ve heard often about the six-week abortion ban. We emailed his press team, who redirected us to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, describing the law’s passage. But we wanted to dig deeper. ‘Most women’? Swalwell’s claim has two components: First, he said the law bans abortion ""before most women even know that they’re pregnant."" This is a tricky one. We contacted four reproductive-law experts, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. We also looked at information from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy organization that supports abortion rights but whose research is widely cited. None of those sources could point us to data showing when ""most women"" know they’re pregnant. Maggie McEvoy, an ACOG spokeswoman, said the organization doesn’t track that information, and it isn’t clear anyone does. And about Swalwell’s statement: ""Is it empirically true? I don’t know that the medical literature supports that,"" said Katherine Kraschel, who runs the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School. But even without that data, experts said, it is abundantly clear that women who are not trying to conceive are much less likely to be aware of a pregnancy until well after six weeks. That’s because ""six weeks"" really means ""six weeks after a woman’s last menstrual cycle."" Typically, a cycle is about 28 days, or four weeks, long. But many women are accustomed to having irregular periods, and delays can be exacerbated by everyday factors such as stress and fatigue, which could stretch a cycle to 30 or 40 days. At this point, though a woman may not yet be aware that she is pregnant or be experiencing any symptoms, a physician may be able to discern a fetal heartbeat.  Most women don’t realize they’re pregnant until missing at least one period, said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an OB-GYN at Rutgers Medical School. Often, it takes two. Generally, medical experts say, women who are actively trying to conceive tend to track their cycles very closely and know much sooner if they are pregnant. But for women whose pregnancies are unintended, and who may be more likely to contemplate an abortion, Swalwell’s statement is more accurate. About two-thirds of women seeking abortions usually come in around eight weeks since their last menstrual period, per the most recent Guttmacher statistics. In other words, the six-week restriction would cut off access to abortion at a point in the pregnancy when ""there’s a high level of women who might not know,"" Kraschel said. ‘One of the most restrictive’ The second half of Swalwell’s claim is easier to verify. He said this is ""one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws"" in the country, a characterization experts say is certainly accurate. The phrase ""one of"" is a crucial distinction. The Georgia ban is no more stringent than those approved in the five other states that have passed heartbeat laws. In Alabama, lawmakers are considering a bill that would effectively criminalize all abortions — treating physicians who perform the procedures as felons. If it were to become law, Alabama’s would be the most stringent in the nation. But voting in the state Senate on that legislation was postponed after debate erupted over whether to include an exemption for rape or incest.   Legal experts also suspect that, as conservatives pursue new abortion legislation, heartbeat restrictions are among the likeliest to end up in front of the Supreme Court. Conservatives believe the judicial makeup favors a ruling that could overturn or scale back the abortion protections outlined in Roe v. Wade. Our ruling Swalwell runs into data obstacles with the first half of his claim. He says a six-week ban prohibits abortion before ""most women"" know that they are pregnant, but there isn’t any research that conclusively says that’s correct. Some clarification would help him here. Most women who aren’t trying to conceive are less likely to know this early that they are pregnant. They probably aren’t taking pregnancy tests or closely monitoring their periods. And women seeking abortions are generally coming in after six weeks. To be fair to Swalwell, his broader point here is true: The women more likely to seek abortions are, six weeks from their last period, less likely to realize they are pregnant. The second half of this claim is unequivocally correct. Georgia’s law is indeed among the nation’s strictest. This claim is correct but could use more context and clarification. We rate it Mostly True. Update: On May 16, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law the state legislation referenced in this fact-check. It does not affect the rating.","[('Rep.

"['Public Health', 'Illinois', 'Marijuana', 'Kelly Cassidy']","
Cassidy puffs up what stats say about teen marijuana use
","Among the issues taking center stage in Springfield as lawmakers enter the final stretch of the legislative session is whether Illinois should join a growing number of states in lifting a prohibition on recreational marijuana. While the legislation under consideration would bar legal sales to those under 21, critics have raised concerns that the easier access could still lead to greater use among teens. One Democratic lawmaker who spoke in support of the plan when it was unveiled recently by Gov. J.B. Pritzker was state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat. ""Cannabis should be sold in venues that are highly regulated, taking the pot market out of the shadows,"" Cassidy said. ""In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right."" PolitiFact in recent years has assessed changes in pot use among youth while investigating claims about how legalization has affected citizens in Colorado, which became the first state in the nation to greenlight retail sales in 2014 after voters approved cannabis for adult recreational use by ballot measure in 2012. Since 2014, the data show no statistically significant uptick in pot usage among teens so legalization hardly leads to the reefer madness some critics feared. But the numbers available for Colorado and other states that have lifted bans for adults also don’t reveal the clear pattern of decline in youth pot use that Cassidy described. If lawmakers approve the plan, Illinois could become the 11th state to allow adults to use cannabis recreationally and the second in the Midwest, after Michigan, where voters in November approved a measure legalizing the drug. So far, retail sales are up and running in seven of those states, including three in just the last three years. That makes it harder to come by comprehensive statistics. Cassidy sent us an email promising an aide would ""share the studies out of Colorado,"" but nothing arrived from the lawmaker’s office as of our deadline. She also didn’t explain what she meant by ""do it right."" Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize retail marijuana sales, so they have the longest track records to study. In Colorado, a 2018 report by the state Department of Public Safety's Division of Justice reviewed data from the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey, which includes answers to various health questions asked of more than 40,000 middle and high school students every other year. The survey is conducted by the state’s Department of Public Health & Environment. Results from the survey show 19.7% of Colorado high schoolers reported using marijuana within the past month in 2013, the year before the first retail marijuana store opened. In 2015, that figure rose slightly, but experts told PolitiFact in 2016 that increase was not statistically significant. In 2017, the rate dipped to 19.4%, slightly lower than it had been in previous surveys dating back to least 2005. But the Colorado report includes a major disclaimer. It states upfront that the majority of data related to marijuana legalization is ""baseline and preliminary,"" making it ""difficult to draw conclusions about the potential effects of marijuana legalization and commercialization on public safety, public health, or youth outcomes"" due to the lack of historical data. Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-director of RAND’s Drug Policy Research Center, echoed that warning to PolitiFact Illinois. ""The full effects of cannabis legalization won’t be seen for a generation after national legalization, which has not even happened yet,"" he wrote in an email. As for preliminary state results? Caulkins said that making recreational marijuana legal for adults has done little to affect use by youth — in large part because cannabis was already relatively easy for minors to obtain in those states. Indeed, material included in the Colorado survey characterizes as ""relatively unchanged"" the slight variations in teen marijuana use since legalization. Voters in Washington also approved recreational cannabis in late 2012, and retail sales of the drug there began in 2014, six months after Colorado. The state conducts a biennial youth health survey similar to Colorado’s, which breaks its data down by grades. Its results show some small declines but suggest little has changed there either, with decreases of 1% between 2014 and 2016 among 8th and 10th graders who said they currently used pot, followed by 1% increases for both grades in 2018. For 12th graders, rates fell by 1% the year after retail sales began and have remained at that level, which is in line with pre-legalization rates. ""The findings with respect to youth are generally mixed and depend critically on what measures of youth use one wants to focus on,"" said Rosalie Pacula, a senior economist with RAND and current co-director of the Drug Policy Research Center who analyzed survey data for Washington and Colorado in several recent reports. She explained in an email to us that studies of states where adult use is legal generally show either no effect or some decline in past-year or 30-day use rates among youth, depending on the survey data used. But results for more frequent and risky use are ""a bit more mixed,"" she said, with some showing an uptick. Changes in the other five states where retail sales are underway are even more difficult to evaluate than Colorado or Washington. Alaska’s state survey reported no statistically significant changes since recreational cannabis was approved for adults in 2014 and hit the market in 2016. Results in Oregon, which followed a similar timeline, were mixed. And it’s too soon to assess results out of Nevada, California and Massachusetts, which each repealed bans in late 2016 but only began allowing sales within the last two years. Cassidy said, ""In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right."" She did not provide any proof to back up her statement. Of the 10 states that allow adults to use cannabis recreationally, only four have permitted retail sales long enough to provide enough data points for a preliminary comparison. While state survey data show no spike in current marijuana use among teens, they also fall short of suggesting the downward trajectory Cassidy described. We rate her claim Mostly False.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Is there a Dallas teacher making $90K in his third year?
","Texas lawmakers are looking at different ways to boost teacher pay during this year’s legislative session, debating proposals that include across-the-board raises and merit-based increases for top educators. Raising teacher pay is a priority for Gov. Greg Abbott, who discussed the initiative during his February state of the state address. He said an incentive pay program in one Texas school district created a path to six-figure salaries for effective teachers. ""When I visited Blanton Elementary School in Dallas, I met an outstanding teacher who was only in his third year of teaching and already making more than $90,000 a year in salary,"" he said. We were curious about Abbott’s salary statement, can a third-year teacher be making close to six-figures? It’s true that experienced teachers in the Dallas school district can pull in a $90,000 base salary, but it typically takes years to get there. Those with less experience have also reported high earnings in the district — usually through a combination of salary, stipends and bonuses tied to performance and other factors, such as being bilingual or teaching in schools with low student academic performance. Teacher from Abbott’s claim earned bonuses Abbott’s office did not return requests for more information about the teacher he cited in his speech. Dallas school officials wouldn’t name the educator, but we found he had spoken to another media outlet and called him. Josue Tamarez Torres, who teaches fourth grade science and math in the Dallas school district, said he believes he was the teacher cited in Abbott’s speech. Last school year it was Tamarez Torres’ third year at Blanton Elementary School, he said, but his eighth year teaching in the Dallas school district. While he did earn more than $90,000 in the last school year, Tamarez Torres’ base salary was $82,000. On top of that, he earned a $12,000 stipend for teaching at a low-performing school through the district’s Accelerating Campus Excellence initiative. He remembers meeting with Abbott last summer to talk about the district’s pay structure, but only learned their conversation would be part of Abbott’s speech after it was delivered in February from the governor’s office, he said. Pay plan relies on performance, school quality The Dallas school district, the second largest district in Texas, adopted a salary model about five years ago that pays teachers based on their effectiveness in the classroom. Educators are judged on several measures, including teaching performance and student growth and feedback, said Suzy Smith, director of performance management for the Dallas school district. Teachers ranked in the top tier — known as masters — can earn a base salary of $90,000 under the district’s Teacher Excellence Initiative. But it takes years to get there. A teacher who has spent three years in the classroom can earn base pay of up to $74,000, according to the district's salary schedule. A novice teacher makes a starting salary of $50,000 a year. Still, teachers can further boost their compensation through bonuses and incentives. The district’s Accelerating Campus Excellence initiative offers one of the largest salary boosts. Educators can earn annual stipends of up to $12,000 to teach in the lowest-performing schools, said the program's director Shatara Stokes. The exact stipend amount depends on the teacher’s effectiveness. It means teachers with three years experience in the classroom who earn the highest base pay and the top Accelerating Campus Excellence stipend can earn $86,000 in annual compensation. There was another teacher with three years experience who worked at Blanton Elementary last school year and pulled in more than $90,000 between her $74,000 base salary, a $12,000 Accelerating Campus Excellence stipend and a $3,000 stipend given to bilingual teachers. She also receives $3,692 in supplemental pay for tutoring and for covering the cost of classroom supplies, according to Dallas school district spokeswoman Robyn Harris. Harris said the district doesn’t believe the governor was referring to this teacher in his speech. This school year, there are two teachers who had three years of experience when they made the jump to the $74,000 base salary. But neither teaches at a campus where teachers are eligible for the Accelerating Campus Excellence stipend, making it unlikely their total compensation exceeds $90,000, Harris said. Our ruling Abbott said he met a teacher ""who was only in his third year of teaching and already making more than $90,000 a year in salary."" While Abbott met a teacher who was earning over $90,000 last year, the educator had more than three years of experience in the classroom. It’s possible for newer teachers at Dallas ISD to earn that much in one year, but only through bonuses and stipends paid on top of their base salaries. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"['New Jersey', 'Tourism', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims Shore businesses provide $38 billion to New Jersey’s economy
","
Gov. Chris Christie isn’t quite ready to free the beaches.

As municipalities down the Shore seek financial help in restoring beaches damaged by Hurricane Sandy, two state senators have introduced legislation to prohibit towns that receive federal or state aid from charging beach access fees.

The Republican governor said in a Dec. 19 radio interview that he still had to evaluate that proposal, and questioned how towns would pay for beach maintenance without charging fees. Those beaches are a key part of tourism at the Shore, which provides $38 billion in economic activity to the state, according to Christie.

""I mean, why are we going to rebuild the beach? Because our economy in New Jersey gets $38 billion from the businesses at the Shore,"" Christie said on New Jersey 101.5’s ""Ask the Governor"" program. ""The Shore ain’t the Shore without the beach.""

PolitiFact New Jersey isn’t entering the debate over beach fees, but we did find that Christie is wrong to attribute all of those tourism dollars to Shore businesses. That $38 billion figure applies to New Jersey’s entire tourism industry, and the Shore region is only responsible for about half of that amount.

The estimate comes from a study released by state officials in March in regard to the economic impact of the state’s tourism industry in 2011.

The bulk of the economic activity represents about $37 billion in visitor spending across all of New Jersey’s 21 counties on items such as lodging and transportation, according to the study. An additional roughly $1 billion includes other economic impacts, such as capital investment to build hotels and attractions, the study states.

Of the roughly $37 billion in visitor spending, a total of nearly $19 billion, or slightly more than half, occurred down the Shore in Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May counties, according to the study.

The remaining tourism sales were spread across the rest of the state, including about $2.5 billion in Bergen County and nearly $3 billion in Essex County, the study states.

The governor’s claim in the radio interview was incorrect, but over the last several months, his administration has accurately cited visitor spending during 2011 in the Shore region. In an Aug. 23 news release, for example, the administration noted how tourism in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties ""generated approximately $19 billion in visitor revenues.""

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak didn’t question our findings, but argued that the governor has cited that $38 billion figure on other occasions in reference to the entire tourism industry.

""Other times, the Governor and Lt. Governor have cited that same figure and spoken of the central importance of our entire state’s tourism industry to our economy,"" Drewniak said in an e-mail. ""They have also noted that the largest slice of tourism dollars is generated by our Shore economy and 127 miles of beaches.

""If you want to cherry pick this particular utterance, be my guest,"" he added.

Our ruling

During an interview on New Jersey 101.5’s ""Ask the Governor"" program, Christie said the beach will be rebuilt because ""our economy in New Jersey gets $38 billion from the businesses at the Shore.""

But that 2011 figure applies to New Jersey’s entire tourism industry, from the northwestern stretches of Sussex County to the beaches of Wildwood. Of all visitor spending last year, nearly $19 billion, or slightly more than half, took place down the Shore in Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May counties.

"['Rhode Island', 'Energy', 'Infrastructure', 'Deepwater Wind']","
Deepwater Wind says electricity rates on Block Island would drop by 40 percent if a wind farm is constructed off the island
","
Around the world, businesses and governments are looking for alternatives to fossil fuels. One of those choices is wind power, and one place where it has been getting an especially close look is Block Island.

A company called Deepwater Wind wants to build a five-turbine wind farm in Rhode Island waters about three miles off the Block Island coast. The turbines would generate more than enough electricity for the island, with the surplus being sent to mainland Rhode Island.

The company also has plans for a larger wind farm of up to 200 turbines in Rhode Island Sound that could provide power to multiple states, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New York.

One aspect of the smaller project that supporters have touted is how much it would save electric power customers on Block Island. Besides providing wind-generated electricity to the island, the project calls for an underwater power cable that would connect it to the New England power grid.

Currently, the island relies on its own electric company that uses diesel-powered generators to serve about 1,800 customers. Their electric rates are the highest in the state and among the highest in the country.

Deepwater highlighted the potential savings in a Tweet the company put out Dec. 12: ""Did U know? Block Island Wind Farm would mean 40% est. drop in BI electric rates.""

We wondered whether that figure was accurate or whether Deepwater was just blowing a lot of hot air.

Block Island, or New Shoreham, as the island’s town is legally known, is in a unique position among Rhode Island municipalities when it comes to electric power.

On the mainland, except for the section of Burrillville served by the Pascoag Utility District, the state’s cities and towns get their electricity from National Grid.

On Block Island, it’s the Block Island Power Company, whose on-island generators run on diesel fuel, which must be shipped to the island by boat.

A 2010 Providence Journal story on the island’s power system noted that diesel fuel regularly costs $1 more per gallon on the island than on the mainland.

In fiscal 2011, according to a report by the town’s Electric Utility Task Group on the fiscal costs and benefits of the wind-farm project, the average cost of electricity on the island was 47 cents per kilowatt hour. In the rest of Rhode Island it was 14.8 cents.

Once the cable is laid and the wind farm project is on line, in 2014 or 2015, Block Island Power will be able to purchase electricity from the New England power network at much lower costs.

The task group estimated that electric rates on the island -- based on a 20-year agreement between Deepwater Wind and National Grid -- would fall to 30.7 cents per kilowatt hour, a 35.4-percent decrease from 2011 rates.

(The island’s rates would still be substantially higher than those on the mainland because its customers would be paying for a portion of the costs for installing the cable and for maintenance of the island’s power system.)

The task group’s analysis noted that current power costs on Block Island have risen to 54 cents per kilowatt hour because of the increasing diesel costs. Based on that figure, the decrease would be a 42-percent drop -- about what Deepwater said in its Tweet.

Our ruling

Deepwater Wind’s Tweet claimed electricity rates on Block Island will fall by 40 percent if a planned wind farm is built. The island’s Electric Utility Task Group says that, based on current prices of diesel fuel, the rates would drop 42 percent.

We rule Deepwater’s claim True.

Are there cartridge limits for large game, bird hunting in Oregon?
","The morning after a gunman killed two people and wounded a third at a Clackamas mall, state Sen. Ginny Burdick sent an email to colleagues saying that she planned to introduce legislation to limit the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The shooter, according to news reports, had been able to fire multiple rounds before his gun jammed.  

""Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting,"" wrote the Portland Democrat, a longtime advocate of gun control. ""If we limit capacity for hunting animals, why do we not extend that principle to guns that may harm our neighbors?""

Lobbyists for gun shop owners and firearms advocacy groups immediately pounced on her idea, saying that a prohibition on magazine capacity would not stop future shootings. They called Burdick’s proposal terrible, and opportunistic too.

It’s not the job of PolitiFact Oregon to make a ruling on firearms regulations or policy. So we won’t. But we were curious about the numbers in Burdick’s statement and felt it appropriate to check: Does Oregon have a five-cartridge limit for large game hunters, and three for birds?

We turned to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which licenses and regulates hunting and fishing on public and private land. Agency spokesman David Lane confirmed that the state senator is correct. There are limits, after which the hunter or shooter would need to reload cartridges or shots.

""It is both for social and for biological reasons,"" Lane said. ""The social being that when somebody takes aim at an animal, they use their shots judiciously … they’re not indiscriminately shooting with the possibility of hitting other animals. It’s a wounded loss issue.""

Now, what Burdick is proposing regarding magazines is not new. We had a federal weapons ban for a decade before it expired in 2004. Part of that law limited magazines to 10 rounds.

Burdick told PolitiFact Oregon that a shooter can be taken down in the few seconds needed to reload. ""It’s simple. It’s clear, and I think it would do some good,"" she said of her proposal.

We could stop here, but we know you love information as much as we do. So we reached out to Kevin Starrett, as well. He is executive director of the Oregon Firearms Federation, a group that calls itself Oregon’s ""only no compromise gun lobby.""

In a spirited interview, he batted the 10-round limit as arbitrary and said reloading magazines can be quick and easy. He said there are countless reasons why a person would want a 30-round magazine, including for sport shooting and to defend themselves and others when trouble breaks. Like someone trying to stop another school or shopping mall shooting. Would you want a limit on rounds then? he asked rhetorically.

That’s a question for policy makers, not fact checkers. There are limits on how hunters shoot wildlife and game in Oregon, even if there are people who think that should have no bearing on the right to bear arms.

Burdick’s statement is accurate. We rate her statement True.","[('The Oregonian, ""Clackamas Town Center shooting: Oregon lawmaker launches effort to ban high-capacity gun clips in wake of shootings,""Dec 12, 2012\nThe Oregonian, ""Clackamas Town Center shooting: AR-15 grows in public popularity,"" Dec. 12, 2012\nOregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Regulations webpage\nOregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Weapons Restrictions webpage\nEmail and interviews with David Lane, spokesman, ODFW, Dec. 26, 2012\nInterview with Kevin Starrett, executive director, Oregon Firearms Federation, Dec. 26, 2012\nInterview with Sen.

Cory Booker says 34 Americans are killed by guns every day
","
Beyond the recent mass shooting at a school in Connecticut, the fear of gun violence is felt nationwide as nearly three dozen Americans are killed by firearms every day, Newark Mayor Cory Booker said.

The Democratic mayor offered that statistic on Sunday during a roundtable discussion on ABC’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos."" The guests were discussing the prospect of increased gun control in the wake of the school shooting that left 20 children and seven adults dead, including the shooter himself.

Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist and a member of the National Rifle Association’s board, argued that Democrats are ""politicizing a tragedy,"" but Booker quickly cut him off.

""One point is very important,"" the mayor said. ""What happened in Connecticut was a grievous tragedy, but every single day in America, every single day, people in communities like mine go to bed fearing violence. You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Booker slightly overstated the number of gun-related homicides that occur on a daily basis, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC tracks the causes of deaths for residents of the United States.

The mayor’s claim about 34 murders per day refers to CDC figures showing the average number of Americans killed with guns every day between 2005 and 2009, according to a statement released by the mayor’s office in response to this fact-check.

But the statement acknowledges that, with the CDC’s final numbers for 2010, the five-year rolling average drops slightly to roughly 33 gun-related homicides per day between 2006 and 2010. The 2010 figures represent the most recent final data available.

""Whether we are losing 34 Americans a day, or 33 Americans a day, the point stands that this is an unacceptable and largely correctable epidemic, and the Mayor believes that we must immediately and intensely focus on common-sense, achievable measures that will save lives in Newark and in communities across the country,"" the statement reads.

The number of gun-related murders per day drops even further when you only consider deaths recently recorded in individual years.

In 2010, there were 11,078 gun-related homicides, or roughly 30 per day. According to preliminary figures for 2011, there were 11,101 homicides last year, which also is roughly 30 murders per day.

Both figures represent a roughly 13 percent decrease since there were 12,791 gun-related murders in 2006, or about 35 homicides every day. That statistic represented the highest amount for any year in the last decade.

In fact, the annual number of gun-related homicides dropped every year from 2007 to 2010.

It’s also worth noting that homicides represent only part of all gun-related deaths.

In 2010, for example, there were a total of 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606); undetermined (252); and legal intervention/war (344).

Our ruling

In a TV appearance, Booker claimed, ""You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day"" by gunfire in America.

The mayor’s statistic isn’t far off. According to the most recent data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a five-year rolling average of final CDC figures puts the number of gun-related murders at about 33 per day.

In terms of individual years, there were about 30 gun-related homicides on a daily basis in 2010 and 2011. That figure marks a reduction since the roughly 35 murders per day recorded in 2006, which was the highest amount for any year in the last decade.

UW System president says salaries are 18 percent below national average
","
The head of the University of Wisconsin System says it’s high time for employee pay raises after several years of freezes, cuts and furloughs.

""We will all pay the price in lost talent and sliding reputation"" unless UW starts closing a pay gap between it and peer institutions nationally, System President Kevin Reilly told the Board of Regents on Dec. 7, 2012. ""No operation – public or private – can keep its talent if compensation languishes for too long.""

Reilly, president since 2004, said the ""gap between our UW employees’ compensation and that of their peers has widened in recent years, and that gap continues to grow.""

He added: ""Indeed, faculty salaries at UW System institutions have now fallen more than 18 percent below the national average.""

We suspect, with the state budget season fast approaching, that we’ll hear that 18 percent figure again.

So let’s test it.

There are many ways to compare salaries at schools. Reilly chose to roll all the UW campuses into one, which as we shall see has limitations.

That said, Reilly made clear that his figure was system-wide, so ultimately we’ll focus on that.

We turned to salary figures collected annually by the American Association of University Professors, a member organization established ""to advance academic freedom and shared governance, to define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education, and to ensure higher education's contribution to the common good.""

The group’s figures for instructional faculty pay, gleaned from its surveys of institutions for 2011-’12, are widely quoted, notably in salary comparisons compiled and analyzed by the Chronicle of Higher Education.

Reilly didn’t make clear whether UW’s ""peers"" include competing private schools, or just public, so we’ll examine both.

For 11 of the UW System’s four-year campuses, the AAUP peer group is master’s-granting schools. The Madison and Milwaukee campuses are compared to a more select group, doctoral institutions.

The Chronicle of Higher Education site shows that all but one of the UW System’s 13 four-year campuses pay professor salaries that are ""far below"" the national median for full professors at public, private and independent institutions of similar type. Madison is the lone exception; average pay for full professors there ($114,690) is merely ""below"" the median for doctoral institutions. Figures are for full-time professors.

Pay at 11 of the 13 schools for another group of faculty -- assistant professors, which is considered the entry level -- was ""below"" or ""far below"" the national median. At the other two, it was above the national median -- Madison ($75,860) and Whitewater ($62,178).

At the UW System’s 13 two-year campuses, professors of all types collectively are paid ""far below"" the national median, the salary figures show. The two-year campuses include schools such as such as Rock County, Fox Valley, Waukesha and Barron County.

Let’s quantify the size of the gap.

At the flagship Madison campus, full professors collectively would need a 4 percent to 5 percent raise to reach national averages, depending on whether independent and private schools are included in the comparison, according to calculations we did using the AAUP data.

Assistant professors at Madison, by contrast, are 4 percent to 6 percent above the national averages.

But Madison stands alone as coming close to the national averages in both categories.

The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the state’s only other public doctoral institution, runs 24 percent to 27 percent below national levels for full professors, with average pay of $95,570. Assistant-professor pay there runs 6 percent to 8 percent behind.

The other 11 four-year campuses range from 15 percent to 33 percent below average for full professors. Full professor pay at the four-year campuses (not including Madison and Milwaukee) ranged from $67,008 to $75,857.

Assistant professor pay at 10 of the 11 fell short by 5 percent to 19 percent (with Whitewater the only school above the median).

Those two positions -- full professor and assistant -- don’t comprise the entire faculty.

Reilly’s specific claim was not about individual schools, or groups of schools, but that system-wide faculty pay has fallen 18 percent below the national average.

We asked AAUP’s research director, John Curtis, to calculate a system-wide figure, one that rolls up all the campuses into one amount, and includes all types of full-time faculty, including associate professors, instructors and lecturers.

Based on his figures, we found a collective 20 percent faculty pay gap between UW System salaries and those at similar public, private and independent schools.

The gap is 18 percent for just the four-year, public Wisconsin campuses (leaving aside the two-year schools).

Reilly’s office told us he, too, relied on the AAUP figures to reach his conclusion. His spokesman, David Giroux, provided detailed comparisons that also factored in a cost-of-living adjustment based on geography. In addition, Reilly’s approach compared schools with a select peer group rather than all schools of the same general type.

The bottom line from the UW-provided data: It reaches very similar conclusions to the analysis by Curtis. There was one major exception. Reilly’s analysis put UW-Madison professor salaries much further below the median.

Our bottom line: Reilly’s math appears to be on target.

Curtis cautioned that a system-wide number may signal a disparity in a broad sense, but really is not very meaningful for addressing pay institution-by-institution because the overall figure combines a wide range of institutions of different types.

A system-wide look does not shed light on pay differences by field, either -- history professors vs. engineering professors, etc.

Our rating

Reilly said ""faculty salaries at UW System institutions have now fallen more than 18 percent below the national average.""

The aggregate figure has its limitations as a precise guide for future action, but Reilly scores with this broad comparison, which suggests a significant disparity.

"['Sports', 'Virginia', 'Jimmy Barrett']","
Barrett says Virginia is the most populous state without a major league team
","
Virginia, the mother of presidents, is barren of a major league sports team to call its own.

Gov. Bob McDonnell didn’t make the prospects any better on Dec. 7 when he denied Virginia Beach’s request for state money to help build a $380 million arena and possibly lure a major league team -- perhaps the Sacramento Kings of the NBA -- to the city.

A day earlier, McDonnell told Jimmy Barrett, host of the monthly ""Ask the Governor"" show on WRVA-AM 1140, that Virginia Beach’s $150 million request would need to be economically justifiable to be included in the state budget. Barrett seemed enthusiastic about a major league team coming to the Old Dominion.

""There is no major league sports franchise in Virginia,"" Barrett said. ""Virginia is the biggest state in the country that does not have a professional sports franchise.""

We wondered if Virginia really is the biggest of the non-big leaguers. We tried to contact Barrett, but didn’t get a response.

It seems reasonable to assume that Barrett was comparing states by population. So we looked at 2010 U.S. Census data and found that Virginia, with more than 8 million people, ranked 12th.

We counted teams from Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Hockey League, and the National Basketball Association,.

All the states larger than Virginia -- California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina and New Jersey -- have major-league professional sports teams.

When we added Major League Soccer and the Women’s National Basketball Association, nothing changed.

There is caveat about Virginia, as Barrett acknowledged on the air.

""Now you might be able to make an argument that the Washington Redskins are equally Virginia,"" he said.

McDonnell replied, ""Well, the corporate headquarters are here (in Ashburn), so we’re claiming them.""

""The headquarters are here,"" Barrett said. ""Training camp is going to be here in Richmond --""

""Right -- Richmond,"" McDonnell said.

""The stadium is in Landover, Maryland, and the team is named after Washington,"" Barrett said.

Although the Redskins are popular in Virginia, they have never had a home stadium in Virginia. Since moving from Boston in 1937, they have played in Washington or Maryland.

The Washington Capitals of the NHL have their executive offices in Arlington. But they, too, have always had their home arena in Washington or Maryland.

After Virginia, the next-largest state that lacks a major league franchise is Alabama, which is 23rd in population. Alabama has 4.8 million people, which is 60 percent of Virginia’s population. The other states in between that have franchises are Washington, Massachusetts, Indiana, Arizona, Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Colorado.

We asked experts why Virginia lacks a major team. Chad McEvoy, a professor at Syracuse University’s David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics, said Virginia has several metropolitan areas -- Richmond and Norfolk -- that would be a good size for a NBA or NHL team. Franchises also look for a base of large corporations to become sponsors and for ready arenas or stadiums.

For example, Oklahoma City built an arena and had a group of committed businessmen who bought the Seattle Supersonics and moved the team to their city. Meanwhile, Louisville, Ky., and Kansas City, Mo., have built arenas but have not lured teams yet.

""Arenas can cost $300 million and new stadiums for baseball or football franchises can cost $700 to $800 million or more -- that’s a very significant initial capital cost,"" McEvoy said. ""There is no guarantee that if you build an arena, that it will attract a team, so it can be a pretty risky proposition.""

But arenas are what big league franchises covet, said Joe Favorito, an instructor in advanced sports marketing and communications at Columbia University, said. ""Private corporations can’t afford the infrastructure and there are grants and loan programs that a privately-funded facility could not take advantage of,"" he said.

Franchises must also consider sports saturation, Favorito said. Washington, Baltimore, Charlotte, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C., have major league teams. And the region also has plenty of college teams.

Our ruling

Sure, the Redskins have their headquarters in Virginia. But there’s no major league team that plays its home games in the Virginia or in any way bears its name.

"['Education', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says Virginia college graduates facing average $25,000 debt
","
As the father of five young adults, Gov. Bob McDonnell says he feels the pain of rising college tuition.

""The average kid comes out of Virginia colleges with about $25,000 plus in debt, and that’s just not acceptable long-term,"" he said during a Dec. 6 news conference.

No doubt, a college education is expensive. But we wondered if the governor’s debt figure is correct.

Paul Logan, a McDonnell spokesman, said his boss’s statement is based on data in an October 2012 report by the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit group that annually examines the debt loads of graduates.

The study tallied the average student debt in each state for the 2010-2011 academic year. Among Virginia graduates who had taken out loans, the average debt was $24,717, ranking 23rd highest in the nation.

That’s pretty close to McDonnell’s number, but there’s a major caveat: that figure only averages the debt of students who took out loans. It does not take into account those who were fortunate enough to graduate without debt.

The institute’s figures show that 59 percent of Virginia students graduated with debt and 41 percent did not.

The group’s website said the average debt among Virginia graduates who got bachelor degrees during the 2010-11 school year was $14,628.

The debt data comes from answers colleges provide to a survey by Peterson’s, a college guide publishing company. Peterson’s survey, which looks at students graduating from four-year public universities and private nonprofit colleges, was answered by 55 percent of colleges and universities that awarded bachelor’s degrees in the 2010-2011 school year.

The institute says there are limitations to the figures it uses in its report. Very few for-profit colleges report figures on student debt, and those schools typically generate high borrowing, the report says. And because the data is provided voluntarily, colleges ""may actually have a disincentive for honest and full reporting,"" the study says. The group also says that colleges may not be aware of the full private loan debt held borne by their graduates.

Despite those concerns, the institute says the Peterson survey is the only data that allows analysis of student debt among bachelors’ degrees recipients.

One final note: Student loans by no means encompass all the money borrowed for college. In 2011, the federal government disbursed $10.6 billion in Parent Plus loans to just under 1 million families, according to a report by ProPublica and The Chronicle of Higher Education.

Our ruling

McDonnell said the average student graduating from Virginia colleges is about $25,000 in debt.

The study he cites says that’s the level of debt among students who have taken out loans.

But McDonnell omits a key point. The average he cited doesn’t count a large number of students who graduated debt free. When they are included, the average is $14,628.

So we rate his claim Half True.","[('\nGov. Bob McDonnell’s remarks at AP Day, Dec. 6, 2012.\n\nE-mail from Paul Logan, spokesman for Gov.

"['Children', 'Education', 'Poverty', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
One in four kids and half in big cities don't graduate high school, Paul Ryan says
","
On Dec. 4, 2012, a month after the presidential election, Republican stars Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio gave speeches at a Washington event that were described as charting a new path for the GOP.

Ryan, coming off a defeat as Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate, spoke about the government’s response to poverty. He argued that ""in most cases, we’re still trying to measure compassion by how much we spend, not by how many people we actually help.""

The Wisconsin congressman and House Budget Committee chairman then ticked off a number of poverty-related statistics, including these two, saying:

""One out of every four students fails to earn a high-school diploma.  In our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate. Half.""

Do so many students fail to finish high school?

Let’s check both parts of Ryan’s claim.

1 in 4 don’t graduate?

We’ll note from the top there are different ways to measure graduation rates, depending on how you account for things such as students who take more than four years to earn a diploma and those who obtain equivalents such as a GED.

The National Center for Education Statistics, the primary federal entity for education data, calculates something called the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate (AFGR) for students in public high schools. It estimates the rate of public school students who started as freshmen and finished high school within four years -- in other words, those who graduated ""on time.""

(We’ll also note that while the government tracks enrollment for private high school students, it doesn’t track graduation rates. About 15 million students attend public high schools and about 1.3 million attend private high schools; that means about 8 percent of all students are in private high schools.)

Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert cited the most recent AFGR to support the first part of Ryan’s claim -- that ""one out of every four students fails to earn a high school diploma."" The figures show that in the 2008-2009 school year, the AFGR was 75.5 percent.

To express that another way, three out of four high school students graduated on time -- or, as Ryan put it, one in four did not.

(Wisconsin, by the way, had the highest graduation rate: 90.7 percent.)

Separately, we found that Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, a nonprofit research center and publisher of Education Week, found a nearly identical result using a different calculation. The graduation rate for the class of 2009, the most recent year available, was 73.4 percent.

So, the first part of Ryan’s claim is on target -- as far as it goes. It doesn’t take into account public school students who take more than four years to get a diploma and it doesn’t take into account more than a million kids who attend private high schools.

Half in major cities don’t graduate?

For the second part of Ryan’s claim -- ""in our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate"" -- Seifert cited a report done by the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center for America’s Promise Alliance. Colin Powell, the retired Army general and secretary of state, is the founding chairman of the alliance, which is dedicated to helping children and youth.

Again, we’re dealing only with public school students.

The April 2009 report, the most recent available, found that 53 percent of public high school students in the nation’s 50 largest cities, including Milwaukee, graduate on time.

(The research center also did a separate calculation for the nation’s 50 largest school districts. Milwaukee Public Schools’ high school graduation rate for 2009 was listed at 52.6 percent, ranking 45th.)

We also contacted some other national experts on high school graduation. Spokesmen for the
Alliance for Excellent Education, which is a partner of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University; and the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents Milwaukee and 66 other large-city public school districts, said the two sources cited by Ryan are the best and most recent available for public school graduation rates.

Our rating

Ryan said: ""One out of every four students fails to earn a high-school diploma.  In our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate.""

The claim suggests Ryan was speaking about all students, but his figures apply only to those who attend public school.

"['New Jersey', 'Debt', 'Weather', 'Steve Lonegan']","
Steve Lonegan says Hurricane Sandy aid package amounts to about $4,200 for each New Jerseyan
","
Count conservative activist Steve Lonegan among those not pleased with President Obama requesting $60 billion in aid for New Jersey, New York and other states hit hard by Hurricane Sandy.

That money’s coming from somewhere – taxpayers – and the bill appropriating the money reportedly has millions in pork-barrel projects attached to it, according to Lonegan, state director for the New Jersey chapter of Americans For Prosperity.

Lonegan issued a news release on the matter Tuesday, calling the request to Congress ""ridiculous,"" and noting that ""the price tag amounted to nearly $4,200 for every man, woman and child in the state.""

We asked Lonegan spokesman Mike Proto whether Lonegan meant the $4,200 as a cost or grant for each New Jerseyan. ""Neither,"" he said. ""It’s just simply doing the math of what it (the aid package) would equate to."" Lonegan, however, used the words ""price tag"" in his statement, which implies cost or debt. And in our calculations, the numbers don’t add up.

Let’s first review the facts that led to Obama’s request.

Hurricane Sandy walloped the state on Oct. 29, shredding houses along the Shore and inland. Millions lost power for extended periods and 40 people from 13 counties in New Jersey died as a result of the storm.

Obama came to New Jersey and toured the damage with Gov. Chris Christie. Obama also later toured New York. The damages amount for New Jersey has fluctuated, but Christie’s latest estimate is approximately $37 billion.

The total damages estimate for all three states is $82 billion, according to estimates from Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.

Proto said Lonegan’s calculation is based on the New Jersey damage estimate and U.S. Census Bureau population data for 2011.

Dividing $37 billion by the state’s population of 8,821,155 equals $4,194, which is correct, when looking at Lonegan’s estimate of ""about $4,200"" per person.

But there’s a couple of problems.

First, Lonegan didn’t use $37 billion in his news release, he used $60 billion - four times. That makes the per-person amount $6,801.

Second, any federal aid package is going to be paid by the entire country, not just New Jerseyans. The current U.S. population is 314,981,492. That means a $60 billion aid package would cost every U.S. man, woman and child $190.48. A $37 billion aid package would cost each person $117.46.

Lonegan favors no aid for the damages caused by Sandy.

""There is a moral question here,"" Lonegan said in an e-mail. ""Should a group of people who have had their homes damaged by a hurricane have more political clout than a single person who has had their home destroyed by a tragedy?""

Aid of any amount would further increase debt, Lonegan added.

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) spoke Monday on the Senate floor about the need for funding to help New Jersey rebuild, and acknowledged cost concerns.

""Unfortunately, there are those voices who are saying the cost to help families rebuild and recover is too much; that it should be reduced; that in this emergency, unlike many other similar emergencies in the past, we should do something smaller and wait to do the rest later,"" Menendez said. ""Those who make such arguments could not be, respectfully, more wrong.""

Our ruling

Lonegan said in a news release that the ""price tag"" for $60 billion in aid requested by Obama ""amounted to nearly $4,200 for every man, woman and child in the state."" Price tag implies cost.

That calculation is only correct if it’s based on New Jersey’s damages of $37 billion, an amount Lonegan didn’t mention in his news release.

A $60 billion aid package would amount to $6,801 for every New Jerseyan.

Further, the nation would share in the cost of an aid package, not just those in the Garden State, bringing the per-person cost to less than $200.

Since there is an element of truth to Lonegan’s claim, we rate this statement Mostly False.

Facebook posting on handgun deaths has out-of-date numbers, but the trend persists
","
The day after the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., sparked another round of debate about gun control in the United States, an illustration began making the rounds on Facebook contending that handgun deaths in the United States are wildly higher than in other developed countries.

Emblazoned with a picture of a gun painted with stars and stripes, it reports that, ""Last year, handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany and 10,728 in the United States.""

The version we saw had originally been posted Nov. 24, nearly three weeks before the Connecticut massacre. By Dec. 20, six days after the  tragedy, it had been shared more than 46,000 times. We wondered if the statistics were correct, especially because there hasn't been a ""West Germany"" since 1990.

The illustration invites people to call or write to Handgun Control Inc. in Washington, D.C. The phone number no longer works. That's because in 2001 the group was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Brady is James Brady, President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, who was shot and permanently disabled during an assassination attempt on Reagan in 1981.

When we contacted the Brady organization, they sent us a new illustration with different numbers and listing different countries. It says: ""In one year, guns murdered 17 people in Finland, 35 in Australia, 39 in England and Wales, 60 in Spain, 194 in Germany, 200 in Canada, and 9,484 in the United States."" Note that it doesn't specify the year, nor does it specify handguns. It talks about all gun homicides.

Brady also sent us a fact sheet from 2010 that lists its sources, which allowed us to spot-check their statistics. We found that most of the numbers come from 2008, their counts were right on (or close to) the mark, and the reports from other countries do not separate handguns from other firearms, probably because the number of firearm homicides is so small to begin with.

We found more recent United Nations data for some of those countries, and they support the pattern.

Let's pause for a moment to acknowledge two points. First, these statistics deal with murders involving guns, not accidental deaths from firearms. The second is an issue of language. The Facebook posting says ""handguns killed."" The Brady illustration says ""guns murdered."" The correct phrasing would be ""handguns were used to kill"" or ""guns were used to murder.""

The numbers in both illustrations fail to account for a few important factors.

The first is population. The number of gun homicides in Israel is expected to be lower than in the United States because it has fewer than 8 million people compared to more than 313 million in the United States.

Second, the overall homicide rate is generally lower in other Western countries. For example, the murder rate in the United States is more than five times higher than in Germany. A culture where murder is less common is automatically going to have fewer gun deaths.

It's interesting to note how often killers use a gun when they commit a murder. In the United States, two thirds of murders involve firearms. It's less than 10 percent in England and Japan. In Switzerland, it was 72 percent in 2004, although the murder rate is low to begin with. We'll leave it up to gun advocates and opponents to debate the degree to which gun control laws influence the risks reflected in numbers.

Finally, to put the numbers in a broader perspective, many countries have higher rates of gun murders than the United States. They tend to be in South and Central America.

As for the rates in the countries cited in the Facebook posting and the Brady illustration, here are the latest United Nations numbers: 

Sources: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and United Nations Statistics Division

Our ruling

A Facebook posting reported,  ""Last year, handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany and 10,728 in the United States."" 
The numbers are wildly out of date. They also omit important context, such as population size or a country's cultural attitudes toward the acceptability of violence and gun use. The list also tends to focus on Western well-to-do countries.

But the phenomenon reported in the illustration is correct. The odds of being murdered by a gun in the United States is far in excess of the risk seen in the countries named in the Facebook posting, and in the newer illustration developed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

For those reasons, we rate the statement Half True.

Stadium claim flagged for faulty numbers
","
The Georgia Dome has provided a real pot of gold for this state, says former Gov. Zell Miller.

""In total, the Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia. Not bad for an investment of a little more than $200 million,"" he wrote in an op-ed that appeared in the Marietta Daily Journal.

Miller, also a former U.S. senator and a legend in state politics, was writing to make the case that the proposal to demolish the Georgia Dome and spend an estimated $1 billion to build a retractable roof stadium in downtown Atlanta is good for Georgia. The plan calls for the Atlanta Falcons to spend $700 million on construction while the state would commit about $300 million from its hotel/motel tax.

Some polls show a majority of Georgians don’t see the need to replace the 20-year-old Georgia Dome. They don’t think the state should spend tax dollars on this project. The hotel/motel tax is typically used to promote tourism, trade shows and conventions.

A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw the op-ed and asked us to fact-check Miller’s math. Many studies used to estimate the economic impact of sports venues and/or events are typically off-base or lack context.

Miller, 80, has kept a low profile since leaving the Senate in early 2005. We tried him through the international law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge, where he is a consultant and adviser. Eric Tanenblatt, senior managing director for the law firm’s Atlanta office and chief of staff to former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, provided us some numbers used to back up the claim. Tanenblatt has been lobbying on behalf of the Atlanta Falcons for the new stadium, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported.

Since it opened in August 1992, it seems like every type of ball has been tossed inside the stadium. The Georgia Dome has hosted two Super Bowls, several events associated with the 1996 Summer Olympics, college basketball’s Final Four, Southeastern Conference basketball and football championships, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Wrestlemania and concerts featuring superstars like the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney. It’s even held church services.

The Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which owns and operates the Dome, prepares an annual report on revenue, spending and the economic impact of the stadium and its other facilities. The reports were prepared in most years by economists from either Georgia State University or the University of Georgia. In their most recent report, which covers July 2011 to June 2012, the Georgia Dome had an estimated economic impact of $269.2 million.

During the past decade, the estimated economic impact ranges between $250 million and $275 million per year, according to reports we reviewed on the GWCC website. In earlier years, the estimate has fluctuated from just below $200 million, as it did for four years, to two years when the estimate was well over $600 million. Atlanta hosted the Super Bowl one of those years (2000).

Tanenblatt provided us two spreadsheets that he said came from the GWCC. One had annual economic impact estimates for Atlanta Falcons games. The other had the economic impact for all events held there. Combined, it totaled $10 billion. However, the spreadsheets contained vastly higher estimates for most years than what we saw in the GWCC reports online.

For our own edification, we added the estimated economic impacts from each annual report and adjusted the total for inflation, using the federal government’s consumer price index. The total: $7.5 billion.

Georgia State University economist Bruce Seaman, who has prepared economic impact studies before, looked at the 2012 report and believes the economic impact is likely between $5 billion and $6 billion. He said the research is difficult and that there are many ways to make errors in these estimates. Seaman said it’s important to have access to internal data when compiling such a study.

""If you’re not careful, you’re going to make mistakes,"" Seaman said.

Starting in fiscal year 2011, which covered July 2010 to June 2011, the authority changed its methodology in compiling the report. The changes, according to the 2012 report, reflect the possibility that more out-of-towners who come to the Dome arrive later in Atlanta and leave town earlier. It also reflects that more of them share hotel rooms than believed in previous reports. 

""Overall, these improved data reduce the direct spending and, thus, the overall economic impact compared to prior studies; however, GWCC believes these results more closely reflect the realities of the Atlanta travel market,"" Ken Heaghney, the state’s fiscal economist, wrote in the report.

Heaghney is recovering from a recent surgery and was unavailable for comment.

PolitiFact Georgia shared the spreadsheets Tanenblatt sent us with the GWCC. GWCC communications director Jennifer LeMaster said there was an error in the formula used to create the spreadsheets that they gave Tanenblatt, so the $10 billion estimate in Miller’s column was based on incorrect data.

""We regret this error,"" LeMaster said via email.

To sum up, Miller wrote that the economic impact of the Georgia Dome is $10 billion since it opened two decades ago. 

Miller’s op-ed contained numbers from the GWCC that he and others thought were correct. And Miller has a point that the Georgia Dome has returned billions in economic impact. But not $10 billion as he wrote. 

The numbers were flawed. And they were broadcast to a sizable audience via an op-ed column.

We rate Miller’s claim False.","[('\nMarietta Daily Journal, ""Georgia Dome has proven its worth, but now it’s time for ...

"['Abortion', 'Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Lenny Curry']","
Lenny Curry says Charlie Crist and Todd Akin hold same abortion position: ""No exception except life of the mother""
","
Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist’s evolution from Republican to independent to Democrat has prompted speculation that he will take on Republican Gov. Rick Scott -- and led to sharp criticism from Florida Republicans.

After CNN's Soledad O’Brien interviewed Crist on Dec. 12, 2012, RPOF chairman Lenny Curry took to Twitter to keep up the attacks on Crist. He tweeted: ""Crist has a record of being rigid on guns, gays, marriage and abortion. He is making an indecent proposal to Dems.""

Curry also tried to link Crist with U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, a Republican from Missouri famous for his comment during his 2012 U.S. Senate bid that ""legitimate rape"" rarely results in pregnancy. Akin apologized for his comment and lost the election. Akin was a longtime supporter of bills that were backed by abortion opponents. He's now so famous that he is a point of reference for abortion rights.

Curry tweeted about Crist:  ""BTW, he holds the same position as Akin on abortion.""

He later tweeted: ""Answer: Todd Akin & @charliecristfl hold same abortion views. No exception except the life of the mother. Google it. Its all there.""

Democratic consultant Kevin Cate tweeted ""I’ll let @politifact sort it out....""

Okay, we will.

We’ve fact-checked many claims about Crist and abortion -- and several about Akin and abortion. But here we wanted to check to see if Curry was correct to claim that Akin and Crist hold identical positions on abortion, that they are opposed except when the life of the mother is in jeopardy.   

It is somewhat difficult to compare the views held by Akin, a member of Congress, to Crist, a former governor, because they didn’t have to act on the same pieces of legislation. But we can compare their comments and their actions on some bills.

Crist’s views on abortion

Crist’s stance on abortion throughout his career is too complex to boil down to a sound bite -- even though Crist tried to do that himself at times. He has called himself ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life.""

Long before he ditched the Republican Party, he was accused of changing his stance on abortion depending on his political race. We will borrow in part from previous fact-checks to explain Crist’s views.

In 1992 when he was running for the state Legislature, the Miami Herald wrote that Crist said he was ""pro-choice"" but opposed state-funded abortion.

When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998 against Democrat Bob Graham, Crist wrote in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times: ""I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government.""

Crist said during that campaign that he would not support a constitutional ban on abortion.

In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist’s comments about abortion  ""puzzled activists on both sides of the abortion debate,"" the Miami Herald wrote after one TV forum.

''I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,'' Crist said during that forum. ""I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law.""

During his 2006 campaign, he told a priest that if elected he’d sign an abortion ban similar to South Dakota’s which only included an exception for the life of the mother. But later Crist told an Associated Press reporter that he’d only sign such a ban if it also included exceptions for rape and incest.

He repeated that summary of his views -- only accepting a ban that included exceptions for life of the mother, rape and incest -- at other times that year.

Crist also said he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade.

When asked during his 2006 campaign about his opposition as a state senator to a 24-hour waiting period, he said the bill didn’t include an exception for medical emergencies.

""There may have been a life-threatening situation that necessitates the procedure,"" he said. ""That happens.""

While RPOF mailers defended Crist as a clear opponent of abortion, the Democrats issued press releases headlined, 'Criss-Crossin' Charlie's House of Waffles.''

In 2010, after leaving the Republican Party, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure ""punitive"" and that the measure was ""almost mean spirited.""

On the eve of the Republican National Convention in Tampa in August 2012, Crist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women’s issues.

""Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims,"" Crist wrote.

We gave Crist’s GOP-Akin comparison a Half True because the GOP platform clearly opposes most abortions but is vague on the detail and does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims. Also, there is no official Akin amendment -- he didn’t play a role in drafting the platform language.

RPOF’s explanation

RPOF spokesman Brian Burgess told PolitiFact Florida in an email that ""Crist is pro-life but allows exceptions for rape, incest and health of the mother."" However, Curry only cited one in that tweet: life of the mother.

Burgess backed up the claim by citing a 2006 interview of Crist, who was attorney general at the time, when he said that he would sign an abortion ban similar to South Dakota’s, which only allowed abortion to save a woman’s life. But Crist also said that South Dakota law was too restrictive and would only sign such a ban if it allowed abortions for victims of rape and incest.

As for Akin, Burgess pointed to a couple of bills that he either co-sponsored or voted for that sought to ban funding for abortions but allowed for exceptions including victims of rape and incest.

On Nov. 7, 2009, the House voted 240-194 with Akin in the majority for House Amendment 509 to H.R. 3962, a  Medicare and pension bill, to prohibit federal funds for abortion services in the public option and prohibits individuals who receive affordability credits from purchasing a plan that provides elective abortions. The amendment said that it would include exceptions for the life of the mother, rape or incest.

RPOF also cited a bill that Akin co-sponsored in 2011 -- the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. Akin was one of 227 sponsors of the bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.

The bill prohibits federal funds from being used for any health benefits that include coverage of abortion, according to the Congressional Research Service. (Currently, federal funds cannot be used for abortion services and plans receiving federal funds must keep federal funds segregated from any funds for abortion services, the research summary stated.)

The final version of the bill said such funding was permissible if ""(1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.""

The bill passed the house 251-175 in May 2011 and hasn’t had a vote in the Senate.

Akin was consistent abortion opponent

So it’s true that Akin supported a couple of abortion bills that contained exceptions. But those votes don’t paint a full portrait of Akin’s stance on abortion.

Akin, a former Missouri Right to Life board member, has more than a two-decade record on abortion starting with his arrests in the 1980s at anti-abortion protests and history in the Missouri General Assembly where he was first elected in 1988. Over the years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch would call Akin a ""Republican anti-abortion leader"" and ""abortion foe"" and ""long a staunch opponent of abortion rights.""

In the state’s General Assembly, Akin fought against what abortion opponents call ""partial birth abortions"" and funding for Planned Parenthood.

The National Right to Life Committee says Akin supported the group's position on 59 of its 60 key votes. NARAL Pro-Choice America gave Akin a score of zero in its 2011 scorecard.

In July 2012, the Post-Dispatch wrote that Akin and his GOP Senate primary opponents were all ""staunchly anti-abortion but with some nuances in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered.""

""There are some extreme medical conditions where the lives of both mother and child are at risk, in these situations he supports the doctors and patients making a decision that maximizes life,"" said Akin's campaign.

A month later, he seemed to take a harder line against abortion and was less supportive of exceptions.

Akin's controversial remarks came in a televised interview in August, when he said: ""If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist.""

Akin apologized several times, but largely to say that he was wrong about his medical claim or used the wrong words -- not to walk back his implication that there shouldn’t be a rape exception.

The Post-Dispatch wrote that Akin didn’t back down on his no-exceptions opposition:

""Rape is a terrible, horrible tragedy,"" Akin said, when asked in a St. Louis radio interview whether he believes ""morning-after"" medications should be outlawed even for rape victims. ""At the same time, I don't know that you fix one tragedy with another tragedy.""

Crist’s comments about Curry claim

Crist spoke to us briefly about Curry’s claim.

""I don’t even know Mr. Akin’s position except that it sounded pretty wacky during the campaign and inappropriate. ... The things Todd Akin said about this issue are pretty outrageous and has nothing to do with anything I believe.""

Crist spoke in generalities about his abortion stance: ""I am pro-life but I would not impose my will on others,"" he said, and then referenced the bill he vetoed in 2010 that would have required women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion.  

Crist also repeated a line he used in 2006 when asked by a reporter about his pro-life stance and what laws he would change:

""I said I wouldn’t change any --  I’d rather change hearts than laws. This has been my position for quite some time.""

We later emailed Crist again to ask ""did you ever -- or do you now -- support no exceptions except life of the mother?""

Crist dashed off a quick response to Curry’s claim: ""Completely wrong. He doesn't speak for me!""

 Our ruling

Since Crist has taken both sides on abortion, it is possible to attack his view and be partially correct -- just pick a year, race and quote that matches the attack.

In this case, Curry said,  ""Todd Akin & @charliecristfl hold same abortion views. No exception except the life of the mother.""

But even RPOF acknowledges that Crist's exceptions go beyond the life of the mother to include rape and incest. And RPOF ignores Crist’s words and actions that would conflict with Akin’s stances -- such as when Crist called himself ""pro-choice.""

Does the new Nike bill qualify as a tax break?
","
The term single sales factor doesn’t come up often in everyday conversation -- not unless you’re Gov. John Kitzhaber or the tax folks over at Nike. So, as the governor was testifying on a bill that would allow him to guarantee Nike up to three decades of a single sales tax factor, he tried to be very clear about what it represented.

""This is not a tax break,"" he said during a committee meeting. ""This does not lower the taxes that Nike will pay nor does it prevent the Legislature from raising those taxes in the future."" 
In fact, the bill legislators debated allows the governor to guarantee a business that its tax structure will not change for a given period of time in exchange for a promise that the business will make a certain level of investment in the state. 
So, on paper, the bill does not represent a tax break -- it doesn’t actually change the tax code in any way. That said, much of the discussion regarding the legislation revolved around the state’s single sales factor. That’s because it was clear all along that the governor was going to use the new bill to guarantee Nike decades of that tax apportionment system.

Let’s back up, though, and offer a little context. Companies can generally be taxed, to varying degrees, on three fronts: property, payroll and sales. Before 1991, Oregon weighted all three of those areas equally, but over the past 20 years or so, the state has inched toward taxing certain corporations on just their Oregon sales. That system is called single sales factor apportionment.

This method can be advantageous for certain companies, reducing the amount of money they owe to the state in a given year. In theory, that reduced tax burden then attracts them to Oregon.

Though there were no signs that Oregon’s apportionment system would be changing anytime soon, Nike wanted an assurance before committing to expanding further in Oregon. That’s why the governor asked the Legislature to pass a bill that would allow him to guarantee the structure for companies poised to make a certain level of investment in the state. (You can read more of those details here.)

We called University of Oregon economist Tim Duy to get his take. There were two issues here, he said.

The single sales factor isn’t a break in the strictest sense, but it certainly reduces the amount a company pays in taxes. The 2013-15 Oregon Expenditure Report, the document that tallies up all of the state’s tax giveaways for a biennium, estimates the state will forgo $165 million over the next two years as a result of this tax structure. Now, to be clear, this estimate is a bit squishy, if only because there’s no accounting for behavioral changes that might occur if the single sales factor didn’t exist. Certain companies, like Nike, might invest elsewhere, for instance. There’s no way of knowing for sure.

The specific break that Nike gets from this system isn’t public information, but a few years back the Oregon Center for Public Policy made an estimate. Using some publicly available information, they estimated that under the single sales factor Nike shaved more than 90 percent (about $17 million at the time) off its tax bill.

Obviously, that’s a considerable savings for any company. So what about the governor’s claim that this new law doesn’t represent a tax break?

Well, as Duy pointed out, this is already the method by which the company was being taxed and there was no talk of changing that. ""We're not actually giving up a dollar we're going to get somehow else,"" he said. ""It's not a tax incentive or a rebate of the type we're usually thinking about it.""

The governor said the bill he was asking the Legislature to pass was not a tax break. That’s true, the bill does not reduce Nike’s tax burden. But it’s been clear all along that the governor would use the legislation to ensure the continuance of a sizable tax giveaway for Nike. That is an important clarification.

We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('\nInterview with Tim Duy, University of Oregon economist, Dec. 17, 2012\n\nInterview with Paul Warner, Oregon Legislative Revenue Office, Dec. 17, 2012\n\nGov.

"['Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says Northern Virginia has the nation's worst traffic congestion
","
Northern Virginia is No. 1 in the nation when it comes to traffic jams, according to Gov. Bob McDonnell.

""Here we are with the most heavily trafficked place in the country in northern Virginia and Hampton Roads not far behind,"" McDonnell said during a Dec. 6 news conference while promoting a plan to seek $500 million in transportation funding from the General Assembly.

Anyone who’s endured rush hour in Northern Virginia can relate. But is it really the most congested place in the country?

Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman McDonnell, told us the governor’s claim is based on a 2011 study by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University, an often-cited gauge of traffic congestion in the U.S.

The research found that drivers in the Washington area -- which includes parts of northern Virginia and Maryland as well as the nation’s capital --  spent an average of 74 hours in traffic jams during 2010, the most in the country. Chicago, where commuters spent an average 71 hours on snarled roads, ranked second. Los Angeles was No. 3, where the delay per commuter was 64 hours.

McDonnell’s off-the-cuff language was a bit inexact. He said Northern Virginia was the worst, but it was the Washington region overall that earned that distinction in the Texas institute’s report.

We learned that McDonnell was more precise while delivering a prepared speech at a statewide transportation conference on Dec. 5, saying that TTI ""ranked the Washington, D.C./Northern Virginia metropolitan area as the most congested area in terms of commuter delay in the U.S...""

The Washington region has been ranked first or second in the yearly delay per commuter in each annual TTI report going back to 1999.

Hampton Roads, meanwhile, was listed as having the 26th highest delay per commuter at 34 hours in 2010. The Richmond region, with 20 hours of delay each year per commuter, ranked 64th out of the 101 urban areas examined.

The report also found the Washington area had the second highest traffic time index -- which is the ratio of how much extra time a commuter drives in peak travel conditions as opposed to ""free flow"" conditions. By that score only Los Angeles, had a worse rating.

TTI plans to update its traffic report in early 2013.

TTI’s findings have been widely cited by the Federal Highway Administration and the media. Philip Shucet, a former Virginia transportation commissioner, told us the TTI report is ""the industry standard"" for measuring traffic.

Other organizations studying traffic have come to different conclusions than TTI.

INRIX, a traffic analysis company based in Seattle, this past May released its report on the worst cities for traffic in 2011.

Honolulu topped the list; INRIX found drivers there wasted 58 hours last year in traffic. Also ranking in the top five were Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Bridgeport, Conn. The Washington area, where drivers spent 45 hours in traffic jams, ranked sixth.

We wondered why the two studies -- TTI examining 2010 traffic patterns and INRIX looking at 2011 conditions -- came up with different results.

David Schrank, co-author of the TTI report, said his institute uses a narrower definition of metropolitan areas than INRIX. Shrank said the TTI study, cited by McDonnell, focuses on densely developed areas in and near to the urban core of a region. INRIX, he said, includes less populated areas on the fringes of urban regions. Schrank also said INRIX study measures traffic by vehicle speed, while TTI took both traffic speed and traffic volume into account.

We made three attempts by phone and email to reach a spokesman for INRIX, but received no response.  

INRIX keeps an updated scorecard on its website listing the cities with the most traffic congestion in U.S. As of this writing, it showed Los Angeles at No. 1 and  Washington at No. 9.

GPS maker Tom Tom releases its own gridlock report every three months based on information from drivers using its devices. Of all U.S. and Canadian cities it surveyed from April to June,  in 2012 Los Angeles congestion was rated the worst. Among U.S. cities, Washington was tied with Seattle for third place.

Tom Tom bases its rankings on a measure of how much added travel time is caused by congestion in each area it examines.

Our ruling

McDonnell, during a news conference, said Northern Virginia is the most ""heavily trafficked"" area in the country.

His wording would have been more precise if he had said Northern Virginia is part of the most congested area in the country that also includes Washington and populous Maryland suburbs, according to a 2011 TTI report. McDonnell did make that distinction in a prepared speech he gave one day earlier at transportation conference.

While traffic is bad around Washington, not all experts agree it’s the worst in the nation. We found reports by other transportation organizations that ranked the region sixth and third. But we don’t fault the governor for relying on the TTI study -- the industry standard for measuring traffic.   

So we rate McDonnell’s comments True.","[('\nGov. Bob McDonnell’s comments at AP Day, Dec. 6, 2012.\n\nE-mail from Jeff Caldwell, spokesman for Gov. Bob McDonnell, Dec. 10, 2011.\n\nGov.

Larry Kilgore says Texas economy is about 30 percent larger than Australia’s
","
As tens of thousands of signatures piled up on a petition for Texas to withdraw from the United States, Larry Kilgore of Arlington told The New York Times that the state could stand on its own.

""Our economy is about 30 percent larger than that of Australia,"" Kilgore said in a Nov. 23, 2012, Times news story.

We decided to check that claim and one from the petition itself, which said Texas ""is the 15th largest economy in the world."" That’s True.

First, we set aside pretty much all considerations of practicality, because secession would upend a number of factors affecting the Texas economy. Besides, as Austin American-Statesman humor writer John Kelso observed in a Dec. 8, 2012, column, nearly 25 million Texans hadn’t signed it.

Kilgore has run for numerous offices in Texas since 2004 as a pro-secession candidate. His basis for this statement, he told us by phone, was a comparison of nations’ gross domestic product to that of Texas.

GDP is the most-used measure of national economic output, defined as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country.

Kilgore said he drew his numbers from NationMaster, a Sydney, Australia-based website that compares nations and U.S. states on matters from health and crime to economy, using data from many sources to generate lists and graphs.

NationMaster’s Australia page gives the country’s GDP as $606 billion, citing ""Economic Importance, 1998"" as its source. The site’s Texas page gives the gross state product as $881 billion, citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics information from March 2006.

So although the numbers are both presented as current data on the website, and they show Texas’ GDP to be 45 percent larger than Australia’s, they appear to represent the Texas economy in 2006 and the Australian economy in 1998.

""Are you serious? My goodness,"" Kilgore said, when we asked if he’d known the site was using data that old. ""I guess we need some more updated numbers."" He had not looked at the sources, he said, and didn’t do further research.

The Texas state comptroller’s office annually calculates where Texas would rank globally if it were a nation. Spokesman RJ DeSilva told us by email that the comptroller uses the GDP calculated for Texas by the federal Bureau of Economic Statistics and sent us the 2011 figure: $1.3 trillion.

By phone, bureau spokesman Thomas Dail suggested we compare the Texas figure to national GDP calculated with current prices in U.S. dollars. That would be ""conceptually consistent,"" he said.

Dail guided us through the steps of generating the Texas statistics on his agency’s website. Separately, we found a fact sheet from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with the country's annual GDPs using current prices and U.S. dollars.

The bureau’s data and the Australian government’s numbers show that Texas’ GDP was larger than Australia’s in 2007 through 2009, but not in 2010 or 2011. For 2011, Australia’s GDP of $1.487 billion was 12 percent larger than Texas’ $1.308 billion GDP.

Kilgore said Texas’ economy is 30 percent larger than Australia’s, but that was based on mismatched, outdated figures.

Campaign to Fix the Debt says failure of fiscal talks could cost states 18 percent of their federal grant money
","
The Campaign to Fix the Debt, a corporate-backed bipartisan group pressing for federal debt reduction, sounded alarms as President Barack Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner negotiated over taxes and spending.

""Looming Fiscal Cliff Threatens to Push Wisconsin into Recession,"" the group declared in a Dec. 17, 2012, news release from its Wisconsin chapter. Similar releases by the group attracted media attention in Colorado, Michigan and Louisiana.

""The country is barreling in a dangerous direction and it will take a shared compromise to get it on track,"" the Wisconsin version of the release said, attributing the quote to former Wisconsin Gov. Tony Earl, co-chair of the Fix the Debt-Wisconsin steering committee.

The group laid out this claim to bolster its case:

""If lawmakers fail to avert the fiscal cliff, 18 percent of the federal money that is sent to the states will be eliminated. Those cuts will reduce funding for important local programs including education, housing, and low-income initiatives...""

Eighteen percent -- that’s nearly 20 cents on a dollar.

Would the automatic, across-the-board budget cuts mandated to start in early January 2013 under the Budget Control Act of 2011 take that big a bite out of federal grants to states?

In a word: No.

Here’s the background.

Fix the Debt is supported by CEOs of many major U.S. companies, and has a budget of more than $35 million raised primarily from the business world, according to stories in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Los Angeles Times. The group stresses that many ordinary citizens have joined the effort, which was co-founded nationally by former Republican U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, the former Clinton administration official. The pair co-chaired the Obama-created National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. Fix the Debt has attracted a bipartisan roster of supporters from the ranks of elected officials and former officials.

The group referred in its news release to the Pew Center on the States, which issued a report on Nov. 15, 2012, ""The Impact of the Fiscal Cliff on the States."" That report relied on figures from the Federal Funds Information for States.

The report did use an 18 percent number in regards to federal grants to states for programs such as Title 1 education grants, special education, Head Start, nutrition for low-income women and children, and public housing.

But it was describing the pool of federal funds subject to some level of sequestration cuts.

Pew officials said they did not mean that the entire pool comprised of that 18 percent would be eliminated entirely, as Fix the Debt said.

In fact, Pew estimated that 7 percent of that pot of money would actually be eliminated, or perhaps slightly higher.

Not chump change, but a far cry from all of it.

Fix the Debt officials said they made an editing error in preparing the release, and became aware of it when we called. It will be fixed in future releases, they said.

A few final notes.

The largest federal grants, including Medicaid and major income support programs, are exempt from the automatic cuts, said Anne Stauffer and Kasia Murray of the Pew Center.

And Wisconsin is somewhat less vulnerable than other states on the impact of potential non-defense cuts, the Pew report found.

Our rating

Fix the Debt issued a news release claiming ""if lawmakers fail to avert the fiscal cliff, 18 percent of the federal money that is sent to the states will be eliminated.""

That’s way off. A pool of funds that size would be cut, but perhaps by 7 percent, not wiped out entirely.

We rate the group’s claim False.","[('\nFix the Debt - Wisconsin, press release, Dec. 17, 2012\n\nInterviews with Joshua Smith and Jon Romano, Fix the Debt, Dec. 18, 2012\n\nInterview with Anne Stauffer, project director, Fiscal Federalism Initiative and Kasia Murray, manager, Fiscal Federalism Initiative, Pew Center on the States, Dec. 18, 2012\n\nPew Center on the States, ""The Impact of the Fiscal Cliff on the States,"" Nov. 15, 2012\n\nPew Center on the State, ""The Impact of the Fiscal Cliff: Wisconsin,"" Nov. 15, 2012\n\nBipartisan Policy Center, ""Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Sequester,"" updated May 2012\n\xa0', 'http://wispolitics.com/1006/121217_Fix_The_Debt.pdf')]",/factchecks/2012/dec/20/campaign-fix-debt/campaign-fix-debt-says-failure-fiscal-talks-could-/
"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Barbara Buono']","
Barbara Buono claims she cut $4.5B in spending while chairing Senate budget panel
","
Cutting government spending – it’s a refrain many New Jerseyans say they want to hear from their elected officials.

Cue Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who announced Dec. 11 that she would run for governor next year and is very familiar with wielding a budget ax.

""I have the experience as Senate Budget Chair of cutting $4.5 billion in spending -- to close the deficit while protecting education and health care,"" Buono said in her gubernatorial announcement ad on YouTube.

Spending did decrease while Buono chaired the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, but it was not a singular effort..

Let’s look at how budgets work and then explain the $4.5 billion cut.

New Jersey operates on a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending the following June 30. The governor presents a budget, the Senate Budget and Appropriations and the Assembly Budget committees review it, and public hearings are held.

The committees present the budget in what’s called an annual appropriations bill, which must be approved by the Legislature and the governor. The governor must sign the budget by July 1.

Now, the cuts.

David Rosen, chief budget officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed in an e-mail to Buono that appropriations from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010 dropped by $4.481 billion.

The cuts were made after revenues plummeted by more than $3.5 billion from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, and fell another $1 billion from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010, according to Richard Keevey, who was budget director for former Gov. Jim Florio. Keevey, who teaches public budgeting systems and federal finance at Rutgers Newark, also served as a deputy budget director and budget director for former Gov. Tom Kean.

""Thus, by necessity, appropriations needed to be reduced by the Governor and the Legislature to achieve a balanced budget as required by the constitution,"" Keevey said in an e-mail.

So the cuts were made by a combination of people, including former Gov. Jon Corzine.

Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, said in an e-mail that the senator wasn’t claiming sole responsibility for the cuts.

""In the budget process both bodies of government vote on the final budgets, but the Senator's role as budget chair allowed her to oversee the budget process for those two years and begin to restore some sense of fiscal sanity to the process.""

Buono’s chairmanship was an important part of the process, noted Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.

""The inference is that she has the responsibility because she helped design the cuts,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is she was an important part of the process but the template was put on the table by the governor. I would basically say there is a core of truth to what she’s saying.""

Buono also claimed she protected education and health care while cutting the budget. But it was actually $2 billion in federal stimulus money Corzine included in his fiscal year 2010 budget that protected both. Keevey noted that $1.1 billion of the stimulus went to school aid appropriations. Without it, school aid would have dropped $900 million.

Our ruling

Buono claimed, ""I have the experience as Senate Budget Chair of cutting $4.5 billion in spending -- to close the deficit while protecting education and health care.""

The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services confirms a $4.481 billion decrease in spending from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010. The recession had much to do with the cuts, with revenues plummeting from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2010 and spending adjusted accordingly.

Also, the federal government, not Buono, protected education and health care with $2 billion in stimulus money.

While it’s true that Buono’s chairmanship gave her experience in budget cutting, she alone isn’t responsible for cutting $4.5 billion. It was a team effort. And the last word on cuts, funding and balanced budgets belongs to the governor. For those reasons, we rate her statement Half True.
