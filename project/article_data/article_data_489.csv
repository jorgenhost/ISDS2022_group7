Maddow: McCain was for the Bergdahl swap before he was against it
","For the moment, the Obama administration is losing in the court of public opinion for its decision to release five Taliban prisoners in exchange for American serviceman Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The Pew Research Center and USA Today report that 43 percent of Americans say it was the wrong thing to do while 34 percent say it was the right move. There’s no question where Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., stands. Right after the deal was announced, McCain called it ill-founded. ""It is a mistake and it is putting the lives of American servicemen and women at risk and that to me is unacceptable,"" McCain said at a Republican news conference June 3. On CNN’s State of the Union on June 8, McCain affirmed he would never have released the five Taliban officials. ""What we're doing here is reconstituting the Taliban government, the same guys that are mass murderers,"" McCain said. But MSNBC host Rachel Maddow criticized McCain of flip-flopping. ""Sen. McCain did not think that very same exchange of prisoners would be ‘unacceptable to the American people’ when he himself suggested it in February,"" Maddow said on her June 4 program. In this fact-check, we examine if Maddow has it right when she says McCain gave this exchange the nod four months ago. (A hat tip here to the Washington Post Factchecker for its work on this question.) Maddow cited an interview between McCain and CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Feb. 18. Bergdahl’s fate was in the air. A day earlier the Washington Post reported that the Pentagon, White House and State Department were ready to free five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo to win Bergdahl’s release after an intercepted video of Bergdahl suggested his condition was deteriorating. Here is the exchange between Cooper and McCain: COOPER: ""Would you oppose the idea of some form of negotiations or prisoner exchange? I know back in 2012 you called the idea of even negotiating with the Taliban bizarre, highly questionable."" MCCAIN: ""Well, at that time the proposal was that they would release -- Taliban, some of them really hard-core, particularly five really hard-core Taliban leaders, as a confidence-building measure. Now this idea is for an exchange of prisoners for our American fighting man. ""I would be inclined to support such a thing depending on a lot of the details."" COOPER: ""So if there was some -- the possibility of some sort of exchange, that's something you would support?"" MCCAIN: ""I would support. Obviously I'd have to know the details, but I would support ways of bringing him home and if exchange was one of them I think that would be something I think we should seriously consider."" This sort of deal was not McCain’s suggestion per se but he was okay with the concept. However, neither Cooper nor McCain named the five Taliban prisoners, and for that matter, neither did the Washington Post article from the day before. But McCain referred to a previous version of the American offer and a Reuters report from Aug. 7, 2012, that listed four of the five men that became part of the current exchange.  Reuters said the U.S. wanted to ""sweeten the deal"" to free Bergdahl by offering Mullah Mohammed Fazl (Fazi), Noorullah Noori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Khairullah Khairkhwa. Three of those names had come up as early as 2011 as bargaining chips. In the CNN interview, McCain said he never signed off on any of those individuals. McCain sits on the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees and was familiar with who was in play when he spoke to Cooper, calling them ""five really hard-core Taliban leaders."" In the past week, several news organizations have taken McCain to task for backtracking on his position in February. McCain said his opinion back then hinged on details related to guarantees that the Taliban officials would not return quickly to the battlefield. Our ruling Maddow said the deal that McCain opposes today is one he suggested in February. In a key interview, McCain did say he ""would be inclined to support"" an exchange involving five hard-core Taliban leaders. The identities of four of those five were public knowledge and McCain sat on committees that would discuss such matters. McCain did not propose the swap but said he was ready to entertain it if it led to Bergdahl’s release. He has since said the swap would put Americans at risk, which is pretty much the same as calling it dangerous. We rate Maddow’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9397C0>],/factchecks/2014/jun/10/rachel-maddow/maddow-mccain-was-bergdahl-swap-he-was-against-it/

Ad says Debbie Wasserman Schultz wants to send medical pot users to prison
","If you’re a South Florida senior citizen suffering from a deadly disease and you’re hoping to ease your pain with a puff of marijuana, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, has a prescription for you: federal prison. At least that’s the impression created by a TV ad launched in June by Americans for Safe Access, a group that supports medical marijuana. The ad airing through June 10 in Broward and Miami-Dade counties attacks Wasserman Schultz for her recent vote against a medical marijuana amendment. The visuals include a photo of an elderly woman who has ALS alongside her husband, who’s wearing a veterans cap. (Here’s some separate information from PolitiFact Florida about that ALS patient, Cathy Jordan, featured in the ad.) ""Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison,"" the narrator states. ""On May 30, she voted against an amendment that would respect Florida’s new laws and protect Florida’s patients. Even though 88 percent of voters support medical marijuana, why would Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz vote to send patients like this to prison? Is Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz out of touch with Florida?"" The group is running a similar TV attack against U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland. Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, represents a large elderly population in South Florida. So an ad suggesting that she wants to send ailing seniors to federal prison packs a punch. We decided to take a look at the vote cited in the ad. The medical marijuana amendment  The ad cites a vote on an amendment to H.R. 4660, an appropriations -- or funding -- bill for departments of Commerce and Justice and science agencies. The amendment, offered by U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., bans the use of federal money to prevent certain states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws. The amendment states: ""None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana."" These are largely the states where some form of medical marijuana is allowed or pending -- or in the case of Florida, is on the ballot this fall. The language was designed to expire at the end of fiscal year 2015, so a similar amendment would have to be offered each year, at which point additional states considering medical marijuana laws could be added. Wasserman Schultz was one of 17 Democrats in the House to vote against the amendment, which ended up passing, 219-189, on May 30. All told, 49 Republicans and 170 Democrats supported the amendment. ""I voted against the Farr-Rohrabacher amendment because I do not believe, regardless of the issue, that it is appropriate to limit the executive branch’s ability to enforce current federal law at their discretion,"" Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, in which she also raised concerns about Florida’s ballot initiative to allow medical marijuana. (Her concerns about the ballot measure have drawn the wrath of John Morgan, a major Democratic donor who is funding that amendment.) A Wasserman Schultz spokesman sent us the statement but declined to comment specifically on the ad’s claim that she wants to send patients to prison. Though proponents of medical marijuana cast the House’s affirmative vote on the amendment as a major victory after years of efforts, it still has to clear two major hurdles: the Senate and President Barack Obama. As of June 9, the amendment had no Senate sponsor, though Americans for Safe Access said it was courting senators to introduce a similar amendment when the spending bill goes to the floor later this month. Current legal situation As PolitiFact Florida has previously written, the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Proponents of decriminalizing marijuana strongly disagree with that definition. The law imposes strict penalties on marijuana users, growers and sellers. A first misdemeanor offense for possession in any amount can result in a $1,000 fine and a year in prison. Meanwhile, selling cannabis is considered a felony and can send a defendant to five years of prison, or even longer, depending on the amount and the circumstances. Cultivating cannabis plants carries similar penalties, based on the volume. Even with federal law on the books prohibiting marijuana, there are reasons that users and distributors aren’t constantly being busted by the Drug Enforcement Agency amid debate in many states about loosening laws governing medical uses -- or even recreational uses -- of marijuana. The 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case Gonzales vs. Raich established that the federal government has the right to use the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to regulate homegrown marijuana, even when it’s for approved medicinal use. The case addressed whether it was proper for DEA officials to destroy Oakland, Calif., resident Angel Raich’s homegrown marijuana plants in 2002, even though California’s medical marijuana law, passed in 1996, made them legal under state law. Since then, other states have continued to shrug off federal guidelines, with voters in Colorado and Washington state going so far as to decriminalize cannabis use outright last year. This has led to a recent softening of the federal government’s stance on the drug. In 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys that included new guidelines focusing on cartels or other criminal organizations -- for example, distribution to minors, cultivating plants on public land, committing violence to distribute the drug or using state-regulated operations as a cover for illicit activities. Beyond that, the Justice Department said it’s content to allow state and local agencies ""to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws."" Indeed, raids of growing operations have grown infrequent, and federal prosecution of individuals in those states is nearly unheard of. Some argue that the House amendment merely codifies the Cole memo or still leaves prosecutors with wiggle room. However, proponents hope it will influence the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. ""It could provide for the opening to enact legislative language that would be much more specific,"" Jeff Vanderslice, Rorhabacher’s legislative director, told PolitiFact Florida. Examples of federal prosecution We asked Kris Hermes, a spokesman for Americans for Safe Access, if he could cite examples of medical marijuana patients being sent to federal prison. Hermes cited examples of marijuana busts in Montana, Michigan and California, but most of the cases involved large-scale cultivators and distributors. In some cases, prosecutors accused defendants of cultivating more plants than allowed under state law or selling for non-medical reasons. For example, Aaron Sandusky, who operated multiple dispensaries, was found guilty in 2012 of conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute hundreds of pounds of marijuana. The Press Enterprise wrote that federal investigators alleged Sandusky’s company used California's medical marijuana laws as a cover for an illegal grow-and-sell operation instead of a nonprofit cultivation collective for those with a doctor's recommendation to use marijuana. He was sentenced to 10 years. Rohrabacher’s staff cited the case of Jerry Duval who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Michigan. Duval and his children were state-registered caregivers and their lawyers argued that they raised it for Duval, an organ transplant recipient. But federal prosecutors argued that they used medical marijuana as a front while peddling marijuana to non-patients. A jury found Duval, a convicted felon, and his son guilty of conspiracy to manufacture more than 100 marijuana plants, manufacturing marijuana plants with intent to distribute and maintaining a place to distribute marijuana under federal law. One case headed to trial that has drawn considerable attention involves the Kettle Falls 5, named for the defendants who grew about 70 plants in eastern Washington. Prosecutors say the five defendants were conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana and they were also charged with possessing firearms. The Safe Access group brought one codefendant, Larry Harvey, to D.C. to lobby Congress. Harvey, 70, told USA TODAY Network that he never sold any marijuana -- ""not a bit of it"" -- and the pot he grew was for personal medical use. He has a bad knee from years of long-haul trucking and his wife suffers from arthritis. Experts say prosecution permitted but rare We sent the ad to a few academic experts who study marijuana laws and asked about the likelihood of patients going to prison. ""I know of no patient-only person sent to federal prison for use of marijuana,"" Ohio State University professor Douglas Berman said. But he said the ""Kettle Falls Five"" case may be the closest, since it involves patients -- rather than distributors -- facing possible prison time. Even before states started legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational use, the federal government didn’t throw defendants in prison simply for using marijuana, Vanderbilt law Professor Robert Mikos told PolitiFact Florida. Prosecutors are focused on suppliers and distributors, he said. ""The way the ad is set up -- that the federal government is going to go after elderly people with chronic illnesses for using marijuana for medical purposes -- it’s just ridiculous,"" Mikos said. ""It never happens, and furthermore to say because someone voted a certain way on this amendment and therefore they support that (people going to prison only for using medical marijuana) is just a ridiculous stretch of logic."" That said, prosecution of patients is permitted under current federal law, said George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin. ""Even if such prosecutions rarely occur, the fact that they are possible is a deterrent for legitimate medical providers and suppliers from getting involved in the process. It also often deters banks from giving them financing."" Somin argues that while the Justice Department memo might cut back on prosecutions, it didn’t completely bar them. He added that ""this administration or a successor could reverse or modify those guidelines at any time. A new federal statute could prevent such a reversal."" Our ruling The ad by Americans for Safe Access says that, judging by a recent vote, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison""-- even the elderly ALS patient shown in the ad. We can't measure what Wasserman Schultz believes in her heart, but we are able to take a closer look at what her voting record shows. She did vote against an amendment to prevent the federal government from using money to keep certain states from decriminalizing medical marijuana. And laws that could theoretically send medical marijuana users to prison remain on the books. Still, it’s an exaggeration to say that Wasserman Schultz’s vote means she wants to send ailing seniors to prison for smoking a joint. The reality is that today, even without the amendment in force, federal prosecutions of medical marijuana users are exceedingly rare. Most of the prosecutions we found involved users who were also accused of dealing marijuana. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. CORRECTION, June 11, 2014: An earlier version mischaracterized a summary of the medical marijuana amendment. The amendment bans the use federal money to prevent certain states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws. The text above has been changed accordingly.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAAE440>],/factchecks/2014/jun/10/americans-safe-access/ad-says-debbie-wasserman-schultz-wants-send-medica/

Lamar Smith claim about Obama's 'prison break' of illegal immigrants fails to acknowledge detainees had served criminal sentences and all releases weren't discretionary
","U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, recently charged President Barack Obama with freeing thousands of convicted murderers, kidnappers, rapists and other criminals before deportation. Obama's ""lax immigration policies continue to put the lives of Americans at risk,"" Smith said in his letter in the May 31, 2014, San Antonio Express-News. ""Last year, administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions,"" Smith wrote. ""The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping, and thousands of drug-related crimes. This would be considered the worst prison break in American history, except it was approved by the president and enabled by immigration officials."" Did Obama deliver the equivalent of a giant prison break? By email, Smith spokeswoman Kim Smith Hicks told us Rep. Smith relied on a May 2014 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. The report said that from October 2012 through September 2013, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ""freed 36,007 convicted criminal aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings,"" according to an ICE document obtained by the center. By phone, the report’s author, Jessica Vaughan, told us the document came to the center from someone she declined to identify who fielded it in connection with congressional inquiries to the agency. The center included a chart in its report showing more than 88,000 convictions including 116 homicide convictions and more than 300 sexual assault offenses. But the biggest cluster of convictions (17,000-plus) were for traffic offenses, followed by more than 15,000 drunk-driving violations. The released individuals accumulated about 9,200 ""dangerous drugs"" convictions, according to the chart, and 5,000 larceny offenses. The document didn’t itemize reasons for the releases. But the center’s report said individuals were subsequently subject to little to no government supervision, though an unknown number were required to check in by telephone or to wear tracking devices. The center said less than 3,000 were released due to a 2001 Supreme Court decision preventing ICE from indefinitely detaining certain individuals whose countries will not take them back.  Vaughan told us all the convicts were let go from ICE-run facilities or other jails where housing had been federally paid for. Separately, a May 16, 2014, Associated Press news story pointed out the released individuals had all completed their criminal jail sentences, according to ICE. Also, the story said, nearly all the released individuals still faced deportation along with required check-ins with authorities while their cases were pending. And why were the detainees let go? The story quoted an ICE spokeswoman, Barbara Gonzalez, as saying that in many of the tallied cases, the agency was required by law to release the immigrants while their deportation cases were pending. ""The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report,"" Gonzalez said. For example, she said, mandatory releases accounted for over 72 percent of the immigrants convicted of homicide, the AP reported. We reached out to Gonzalez, hearing back from Carl Rusnok, a Dallas-based ICE spokesman, who emailed us similar information. ""Convicted criminals come into the agency’s custody to undergo removal proceedings after they have already satisfied the terms of their criminal sentence,"" Rusnok said. ""In many of the releases in 2013, ICE was required by law to release the individuals from custody, pursuant to decisions by the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Once in ICE custody, many of the individuals described in the report were released under restrictions such as GPS monitoring, telephone monitoring, supervision, or bond."" Rusnok continued: ""The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report. For example, mandatory releases account for over 72% of the homicides listed."" He added: ""Others, typically those with less serious offenses, were released as a discretionary matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding the priority of holding the individual, given ICE’s resources, and prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to public safety or national security."" The Obama administration has asked Congress to fund fewer so-called detention beds in ICE facilities than before, we noted in a June 2013 fact check. An April 12, 2013, Washington Times news article summed up: ""Congress fought hard during the past decade to boost the number of detentions, arguing that those who were allowed back into the general population rarely returned to be deported."" That story quoted then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as saying the department believed it could keep all high-priority individuals detained with the lower number of beds, while making use of alternatives to track the other people in deportation proceedings. By email, the center’s Vaughan ultimately called Smith’s recent statement ""completely factual and correct."" Earlier, Vaughan told us she saw little import to the released individuals reportedly fulfilling prison sentences due to their criminal convictions before their immigration cases were taken up. No information has been released, she said, about how many of the individuals were released under personal recognizance or on bonds, both of which she described as tantamount to no post-release supervision.  Reminded of ICE saying 72 percent of the individuals convicted of murder were let go under a court’s direction, Vaughan said that means 28 percent were released at the government’s discretion. Released individuals might still face deportation, Vaughan said, but she’s doubtful many will show up for final decisions. She said the center has separately calculated that some three in four ICE detainees released while their immigration cases are pending fail to show up to finish the cases. Our ruling Smith wrote: ""Last year, administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions. The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping, and thousands of drug-related crime This statement has accurate figures, but fails to acknowledge that an unknown number of the releases--including nearly three in four of the individuals convicted of murder--were not at the administration’s discretion. Also missing: Most of the tallied convictions weren’t for violent offenses; each released individual didn’t skip out on prison time connected to criminal convictions; and most released individuals still faced deportation.

Warner says U.S. student debt has surpassed credit card debt
","Sen. Mark Warner’s re-election stump speech dwells on giving everyone an equal opportunity and high on that list is an affordable college education. Warner and many of his fellow Democrats have called for legislation that would ease student debt by allowing students to refinance their federal college loans at substantially lower interest rates and limit their loan repayments to 10 percent of their annual income. President Barack Obama endorsed those measures during a speech Monday.. Warner, during a recent speech of his own, said, ""Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That’s more than credit card debt."" This statistic caught our attention, so we put it to the Truth-O-Meter. David Turner, spokesman for Warner’s campaign, backed up the statement by sending us a speech by an official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and data from the Federal Reserve System. Both of those sources say that student debt has topped $1 trillion and the speech noted that it had surpassed credit cards. But the best data comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which publishes debt statistics every quarter. In the most recent report, covering first three months of 2014, student loan debt totaled $1.1 trillion, while credit card debt hit $659 billion. The largest type of debt for Americans is mortgages, which came in at $8.2 trillion in the first quarter. Student loan debt is No. 2, followed by automobile loans at $875 billion and credit card debt in making up $11.7 trillion in all debt. Student debt began to outpace credit card debt in the second quarter of 2010, when college loans hit $762 billion. Student debt topped the $1 trillion mark in the third quarter of last year. Average tuition across the nation increased 79.5 percent from 2003-2013, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department. For comparison, the Consumer Price Index grew by 26.7 percent during the same span and average wages grew by 30.1 percent. Credit card debt, by contrast, has gradually fallen from $843 billion in early 2009 to its $659 billion level this year. Much of the decrease occurred during the recession when people cut back on spending. But the recession exacerbated college debts, according to Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. She cited two reasons: ""You have to remember that during the time of the Great Recession, more people were going back to school because of the job situation, so they were taking on more debt,"" she said. A study she co-wrote tackled the demographics of people with student loan debt. It found that student loan debt, for those ages 29 to 37, had increased by $10,381 on average from 1989 to 2010, while car loans had increased $302, credit card debt had increased $1,215 and other debt had decreased $2,078. In 2012, 40 percent of Americans in their 20s had student debt, 30 percent in their 30s owed on student loans, 19 percent of Americans in their 40s, 12 percent in their 50s and 4 percent in their 60s. This included students and parents who borrowed to send their children to college. Our ruling Warner said, ""Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That’s more than credit card debt."" His figure on student debt is accurate and total U.S. credit card debt in the first quarter of this year was $659 billion.

Did Barack Obama sign a bill to forgive all outstanding student debt? No
","Sometimes art mirrors real life so closely that it’s hard to tell the two apart. On June 9, 2014, President Barack Obama made a speech announcing a ""presidential memorandum"" that allows 5 million federal student loan holders to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income.  That announcement followed the introduction of a Senate Democratic bill that would aid borrowers in two ways. The bill would allow students with existing debt to refinance to the interest rate new borrowers can get -- 3.86 percent. The bill also offers an option to refinance private student loans into the federal student-loan system. Right around the same time, debt-laden Americans were noticing chain emails and social media posts with a headline that offered something even bolder -- ""Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt."" A PolitiFact reader was skeptical and asked us to look into it. As is often the case these days, we found that this ""news"" cluttering up users’ inboxes and feeds was a bit of satire -- or, to those unable to detect much humor in the item, a sly bit of clickbait designed to generate ad revenue. Here’s a portion of the article published in the online publication Empire News (you can read the full article here): ""Americans who are under the financial strain of repaying student loan debt may now be off the hook for their education costs. President Obama signed a new federal bill this week releasing any student who has accrued outstanding debt because of the high interest rates and outrageous balances caused by college loans. "" ‘Any student, past or present, who has taken loans from the federal government within the last 10 years to pay for higher education, will no longer be required to pay back those loans,’ said President Obama. ‘This forgiveness also is to be extended to any student currently enrolled in college, who may need financial assistance for the next several years as they finish their degrees.’ "" If you’re a student with a lot of debt, this sounds great. But it’s too good to be true. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates that outstanding student loans total roughly $1 trillion. That works out to about one-third of the entire annual federal budget -- an enormous amount that, even if it was phased out over a few years, would lead to even greater deficits, budget cuts or tax increases. Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, phasing out just one fifth of the student debt total each year for five years -- $200 billion a year -- would mean adding an annual outlay equal to today’s combined budgets for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor and Transportation. As it turns out, the article was never even intended to be accurate. Empire News has a ""disclaimer"" page that says, ""Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental."" The article’s focus on student loans gains some believability from Obama’s long association with the topic. For instance, during the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama promised to overhaul the government’s relationship with private student lenders and ensure that the maximum Pell Grant award is increased for low-income students. Both of those earned a Promise Kept on our promise tracker, the Obameter. The Senate bill, which Obama has endorsed, would allow existing student-loan borrowers to refinance at lower interest rates, which backers say could ""save a typical student $2,000 over the life of his or her loans."" The pending measure, sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., faces a tough road to enactment, even with Obama’s support. Republicans oppose the measure, which Warren wants to pay for with an income tax hike on Americans who earn more than $1 million a year. Our ruling Emails and social media posts are circulating a claim that ""Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt."" But while Obama has taken executive action and called for passage of a student-loan refinancing bill now pending in the Senate, he didn’t say he was planning to forgive all student debts -- a far more massive undertaking. The claim is ridiculously false, so we rate it Pants on Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE3F740>],/factchecks/2014/jun/09/chain-email/did-barack-obama-sign-bill-forgive-all-outstanding/

Average student loan debt in Texas close to price of a pickup truck, though privately taken student loans can be refinanced
","U.S. Rep. Pete Gallego invoked pickup trucks to frame his case for making it easier for college students and young graduates to refinance student loans. ""The average student loan debt in Texas is over $22,000,"" the Texas Democrat wrote in a May 14, 2014, email blast. ""That also happens to be the cost of an average size pickup truck!"" ""But here’s what’s truly alarming: students are NOT allowed to refinance their loans at lower rates -- the same way car owners can,"" Gallego wrote. Democratic-sponsored legislation would provide federal aid so students and graduates stuck with high interest rates could repay the loans at the lower rates Congress approved for new student loans in 2013, though a May 16, 2014 National Journal news story called the proposal a long shot in the Senate, where Republicans were described as likely to resist higher taxes on the wealthy to pay for the refinancing wrinkle. Gallegos revved our curiosity thrice over. Average student loan debt By email, Gallego’s campaign manager, Anthony Gutierrez told us the congressman’s average student-loan debt figure came from a news story posted online May 8, 2014, on the GovBeat blog of The Washington Post. That story said more than a million Americans would graduate this year with substantial student loan debt, a conclusion it attributed to the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""The graduates will have an average of $26,500 in student loans,"" the Post story said, ""joining the tens of millions of other adults who collectively hold more than $1 trillion in student loan debt. That burden is largest, on average, in many Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, a few Southeastern states and California."" An accompanying U.S. map shows more than 20 states including Texas where the average student loan debt is $22,000 to $25,000""  The Post credited these conclusions to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, using data from the third quarter of 2012. We ventured to a web page for the reserve bank where its entry on student loan debt led us to a research paper, published in 2012 and revised in April 2013, by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. According to the revised paper, student loan debt increased dramatically over the last several years, from about $346 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $996 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, a surge of nearly 14 percent a year. By comparison, the report said, total credit card debt was $679 billion and auto debt was $783 billion. Then again, the report states, increasing levels of debt were driven largely by growth in the number of borrowers, rather than growth in average debt levels of borrowers. The report said that in the fourth quarter of 2012--a few months after the period analyzed in the Post’s chart--the ""median borrower holding student loan debt owed $13,924 in student loan debt. The average amount of student loan debt across all consumers with student loan debt was $24,699."" That’s the latest available calculation, Bill Medley, spokesman for the Kansas City Fed, told us by email. Pricing average pickup trucks Next, did Gallego capture the price of an average-size pickup? Gutierrez told us the campaign researched average used truck prices on the Cars Direct website. He pointed us to an April 5, 2012, article on the site showing suggested retail prices for five 2010 and 2007 models. ""These prices are for a base model pickup truck with standard options and no additional accessories,"" the article said. According to the story, the average manufacturer’s suggested retail price for a 2010 two-door Ford F-150 was $22,355 and the average for a 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 was $21,510--prices close to the $22,000-plus cited by Gallego. Then again, the Cars Direct article listed estimated prices for two 2010 models at less than $22,000. It also listed the price for another 2010 truck as nearly $6,000 higher. But Gallego priced used pickups; we looked on Edmunds.com, which compiles car and truck prices, for manufacturer’s suggested retail prices for model-year 2013 and 2014 pickups. According to the site, the price for a basic Ford F-150 ""regular cab"" starts at $24,070 (2013 model) and $24,735 (2014). A Toyota Tacoma ""regular cab"" starts at $17,625 (2013) and $18,125 (2014), the site says. Limits on refinancing student loans? Finally, are students really not allowed to refinance college loans? Gutierrez pointed out news articles including a Feb. 20, 2013, Time magazine piece stating that unlike other consumers who have taken advantage of reduced interest rates to refinance purchases, student borrowers have been restricted because Congress—not the free market—""sets the interest rate on the vast majority of student debt, and because these loans are not secured by collateral private lenders are loath to undercut the federal government’s terms."" The Time story noted that student loan debt was at $1 trillion—and of that, the federal government backed $864 billion. Also, most of the debt was being carried at an interest rate higher than 6 percent, a figure Time attributed to a Feb. 13, 2013, report from the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ""That’s almost twice the rate of an average 30-year mortgage,"" Time said. By telephone, Heather Jarvis, a North Carolina attorney specializing in student loan law, said that some graduates may be able to refinance student loans at lower rates through private lenders, though she said this would only happen in cases of substantial income. (Car owners, in contrast, have four-wheeled collateral.) By email, Jarvis said ""refinancing federal loans with a private loan is risky.  The borrower gives up important protections that accompany federal loans (like flexible repayment and discharge provisions)."" Students repaying federally backed loans, Jarvis said, are effectively barred from refinancing opportunities because federal law makes no provision for the government to make such offers. Also by phone, Brian Stewart of the Center for American Progress -- which has urged the Democratic-backed action -- said it’s possible but difficult to refinance student loans with private lenders while there's no way for students to get the federal government to refinance a government-backed loan. Stewart, a spokesman for Generation Progress, a center project focused on young adults, said the center has been researching student-loan issues for about two years. Our ruling Gallego said the ""average student loan debt in Texas is over $22,000...the cost of an average size pickup truck."" But unlike car owners, he said, ""students are not allowed to refinance their loans at lower rates."" This claim reflects the latest estimate of average student-loan debt and a findable price for an average-size pickup. It’s also so that most college loans are federally backed and Uncle Sam doesn’t offer a way for students and graduates to refinance. On the other hand, students taking loans from banks or other private lenders aren’t prevented from refinancing; this claim lacks that clarification. We rate this statement as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Gillespie says EPA carbon rules will kill 244,000 jobs a year and hike bills by $1,200
","The White House on June 2 unveiled tough new regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.   Moments after the long-awaited announcement, many Republicans panned it as the latest escalation in President Barack Obama’s so-called ""war on coal"" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. Among the GOP critics was U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie, who was campaigning that day  in Southwest Virginia -- the heart of coal country. Gillespie, who is hoping to unseat Democratic incumbent Mark Warner this fall, was interviewed by WCYB-TV. ""These new regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs,"" he said. Gillespie was referring to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released May 28 and became the basis for much of the GOP criticism of Obama’s carbon-reduction plan. The national goal of the regulations is to cut carbon emission from existing power plants by 30 percent by 2030 -- compared to 2005 levels. This is to be achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many coal plants. But the chamber study that Gillespie and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030. That’s a significant difference when it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, a point that the chamber acknowledges.   ""We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward,"" Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told PolitiFact National.  ""Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)."" Why can’t the numbers simply be converted? In assuming Obama would set a higher goal, the chamber also postulated that the Environmental Protection Agency would be forced to change other policies to meet the 42 percent threshold. The goal would be attainable, the chamber concluded, only if the EPA by 2022 required new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology.  The actual proposal, however, does not require plants to have such capabilities. This is important because, as the chamber report noted, plants with carbon capture technology are far more expensive to build and operate than traditional ones.Therefore, the chamber’s conclusion that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. The chamber report said power companies would significantly increase their electricity rates to recoup the costs of building new plants with carbon capture technology. Businesses would recoup their increased energy expenses, the report said, by paring jobs. The EPA was highly critical of the chamber’s report and on the day of its release, blogged that the study was ""irresponsible speculation based on guesses of what our draft proposal will be."" It noted that the chamber failed to consider significant health and climate savings that would come from lowering carbon emissions. And the EPA tipped its hand, five days prior to Gillespie’s TV interview, by announcing its soon-to-be-revealed regulations would not require carbon capture. We also should note that Gillespie, in his TV interview, overstated two figures in the flawed  report: He said an average family would spend $1,200 a year more on electricity; the actual figure was about $200. We asked Gillespie’s campaign for an explanation and spokesman Paul Logan said the $1,200 figure actually came from an analysis by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. Heritage’s estimate, released in March, incorrectly assumed that the EPA would phase out all coal-fired energy plants. Gillespie said the chamber predicted an annual loss of 244,000 jobs; the actual number was 224,000. In addition to his TV interview, Gillespie posted a tweet that applied estimates in the chamber report to the administration’s proposal. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said defended his boss’s comments by saying the chamber study ""looked at a similar regulatory scheme"" to what Obama proposed. As we noted, Gillespie was hardly the only Republican who used chamber statistics to denounce the White House proposal. Similar comments were made by U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th; Pat Mullins, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia; and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the statistics in a robocall attack against incumbent Warner, whom Gillespie is challenging. Our ruling Gillespie, during a visit to coal country, said new EPA ""regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs."" Gillespie refers to a May 28 chamber study that wrongly assumed the White House would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030 -- a standard that the report said could only met by requiring the construction of natural gas plants with expensive carbon capture capabilities. The regulations, released June 2, actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber says its estimates do not apply to the goals as announced. There was opportunity for Gillespie to realize the chamber’s assumptions were unreliable. Five days before his comments, the EPA announced that carbon capture would not be part of its upcoming proposals. Gillespie not only continued to use numbers from the report, he overstated some of them. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7982C0>],/factchecks/2014/jun/09/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-epa-carbon-rules-will-kill-244000-j/

Conservative columnist says Obama fought to keep Taliban official in Guantanamo Bay because he was a 'huge risk'
","The merits of the prisoner exchange that resulted in the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from his Taliban captors continued to be a point of contention on this week’s political Sunday shows. On Fox News Sunday, panelists debated the potential political fallout in the midterms and the 2016 elections from President Barack Obama’s decision to swap five high-level Taliban officials from the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for Bergdahl. Stephen Hayes, a columnist for the conservative Weekly Standard, said he thought Obama’s maneuver would be ""politically problematic."" ""I think at a very base level, people who aren't following politics day in and day out, are looking at this Guantanamo five and saying, ‘Why in the world would we do this?’"" Hayes said. ""And the conflicts that we're hearing within the administration's own story. The administration went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk, such a risk to U.S. national security. And now they're letting him walk. Those are the things you don't have to have a Ph.D. in national security studies to understand."" Did Hayes find an example of the administration insisting one of the detainees was a risk, and then letting him walk free? (PolitiFact looked at the five freed prisoners in more detail here.) We asked Hayes to make the case to us. He showed us a recent column he wrote on Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, one of the five men released to Qatar in the Bergdahl deal. He also sent us a link to a 2011 court case where he said the United States argued for continued detainment of Khairkhwa, a former Taliban governor, spokesman and Minister of the Interior. But this wasn’t Obama’s Justice Department going to court to keep Khairkhwa in jail because he was ""such a huge risk,"" as Hayes said.  Actually, Khairkhwa, captured in 2002, was appealing for his release, saying he was being held illegally. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo Bay detainees had the right to challenge the legality of their confinement. At question wasn’t whether the Obama administration considered Khairkhwa a risk. They didn’t have to prove that. In fact, the court makes that clear in its ruling: ""The government's authority to detain an enemy combatant is not dependent on whether an individual would pose a threat to the United States or its allies if released."" This stemmed from a 2010 court decision, Awad vs. Obama, in which Adham Mohammed Ali Awad, a Yemeni national, argued that he was no longer a threat to the United States and therefore his detention was unlawful. But the court said that wasn’t an issue. Rather, the Obama administration simply had to prove that, under the Authorization for Use of Military Force granted by Congress, Khairkhwa was a member of the Taliban or al-Qaida or associated forces at the time of his capture. The United States had ample evidence to make their case. Khairkhwa was part of the Taliban’s highest governing body and was a known associate of Osama bin Laden. Therefore, most of the administration’s case against Khairkhwa is centered on his past ties to the Taliban. There is no discussion of the risk he may or may not pose if he returned to Afghanistan. ""It’s fair to say whoever said that hasn’t read the decision,"" said Mark Denbeaux, a law professor at Seton Hall University who has represented multiple Guantanamo Bay prisoners. ""It doesn’t say that it’s the U.S. trying to keep them here, it’s the U.S. defending the standard that someone is a lawful enemy combatant."" ""The hearing (for Khairkhwa) took six years, and it concluded that he was a combatant for the Taliban, not that he was a terrorist,"" he added. ""They didn’t even need to find out if he had attacked Americans."" That’s not to say the government did not view Khairkhwa as a risk. There were varying opinions on that from within the administration. In documents released by Wikileaks, the Department of Defense labeled Khairkhwa as ""high risk"" and warranted continued detention. Khairkhwa, according to Wikileaks documents, was highly intelligent and may have known more about ""the inner workings of the Taliban than any other detainee held."" The administration, however, also once considered releasing Khairkhwa, who is a friend of Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai, in an effort to bring peace between the Taliban and the new Afghanistan government. The military considered him ""as more of a civilian than a military figure,"" according to Reuters. Our ruling Hayes said the Obama administration ""went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk."" We’re not assessing whether the Obama and the Pentagon viewed Khairkhwa as a ""risk"" if he was released. We’re looking at the rationale Hayes offered as to why the Obama administration went to court. Hayes said a 2011 court case was evidence of a ""conflict"" in the administration’s story. Actually, that court case had nothing to do with Khairkhwa's risk level. In fact, the court explicitly said assessing whether Khairkhwa was a threat if released wasn’t a factor at all. Instead, the administration was simply confirming that Khairkhwa was tied to the Taliban after he claimed that he was being held illegally. Hayes is right that the Obama administration argued to keep Khairkhwa in Guantanamo, but he misrepresented why they did so.

Vanden Heuvel: '1 out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person'
","The city of Seattle refreshed the national debate on the minimum wage recently by approving a plan that will gradually hike its hourly minimum wage to $15. The move positions Seattle with the highest minimum wage in the country, almost $5 more than than the $10.10 level sought by President Barack Obama. ABC’s This Week spotlighted the decision in a June 8, 2014, segment pitting Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot against The Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel. Gigot argued the proposal may have detrimental effects by pushing young earners with toes in the workforce out of low-wage jobs. Vanden Heuvel countered with a point that inverted popular understanding of who is affected by minimum wage policies. ""Listen, this is smart economics, it’s good politics, and it’s morally right,"" she said. ""First of all, only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person."" PunditFact wanted to fact-check her talking point. What the numbers say We have unpacked similar claims over recent months. The notion that most minimum wage earners are young workers starting out their professional careers or teenagers working over the summer or to pay for college is not always cut and dried. A February Congressional Budget Office report says that ""of the 5.5 million workers who earned within 25 cents of the minimum wage in 2013, three-quarters were at least 20 years old and two-fifths worked full time."" But are just 10 percent of minimum wage earners young adults or teenagers? The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a reliable federal trove of employment data, is the most detailed source of information on federal minimum wage workers. But even its data isn’t complete because it focuses only on workers who earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. That does not account for workers in the 21 states and District of Columbia with higher minimum wage levels, from $7.50 in Missouri to $9.32 in Washington. Half of all workers live in states where the minimum wage is more than $7.25 an hour, according to the Congressional Budget Office report, which makes for a significant caveat.  Still, according to the BLS, workers who are 16 to 24 years old comprise 50 percent of workers who earn at or below the federal minimum wage. (Someone can earn less than the minimum wage thanks to exceptions in the law for vocational students, for example.) That’s a far cry from what vanden Heuvel said. A different study Vanden Heuvel told us she was trying to describe who would benefit from raising the minimum wage, and that the majority of those people would be older workers. That’s not what she said, but we’ve seen others make the same mistake -- including Obama. Vanden Heuvel appears to rely on data from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which supports increasing the minimum wage. The institute looked at workers who would benefit from increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, which would include everyone who makes less than that amount, not just those workers earning $7.25. The institute also factored in workers making up to $11.10 an hour currently, assuming that if workers below them would get a raise, they would as well, EPI report author David Cooper said in April. So what did EPI find? Among the people who EPI believes would get a raise, only 12.5 percent are less than 20 years old. Here’s a breakdown by age bracket: Age EPI (workers earning up to $11.10) 19 and under 12.5% 20-29 36.5% 30-39 16.6% 40-54 20.8% 55 and over 13.7% So that’s closer to one in 10, though it doesn’t factor in young adults in their 20s and it’s measuring workers who might benefit from raising the minimum wage -- not who is making the minimum wage today. ""The number she is using is much more along the lines of who would get a raise, not who is today a minimum wage worker,"" said Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. The Congressional Budget Office report also looks at workers who would be affected by a hike in the minimum wage, using the same logic as EPI that some employees would indirectly see a pay increase to retain their spot in a company pecking order. CBO projected 12 percent of workers who would be paid $11.50 an hour or less by 2016 are teenagers (Table 2). CBO did not break down its data by more narrow age groups. Our ruling During a faceoff with a Wall Street Journal editor on ABC This Week, vanden Heuvel listed several reasons in favor of raising the minimum wage. ""Only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person,"" she said. Her words described the current demographics of minimum wage workers, but that is not what’s reflected by the research we found. According to the BLS, workers who are 16 to 24 years old comprise 50 percent of workers who earn at or below the federal minimum wage. Vanden Heuvel was wrongly describing a study of who would get a raise from increasing the minimum wage. According to the liberal Economic Policy Institute, teens would make up 12.5 percent of people who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $10.10.

Did Israel trade 1,000 prisoners for one?
","The exchange of kidnapped Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl for five high-risk Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay has elicited criticism of the Obama administration. Politicians and lawmakers have taken issue with the administration’s action on several grounds, including President Barack Obama’s decision to ignore a law requiring advance congressional notification and the questions surrounding Bergdahl’s original disappearance. But Charles Krauthammer, a conservative columnist and Fox News contributor, has come out supporting Obama’s decision to make the swap, despite concerns that Obama made Bergdahl’s release a highly public ""cause for celebration."" ""We have long engaged -- and all other countries in the West have long engaged -- in hostage swaps where the West always comes out on the short end,"" said Krauthammer to Fox News host Bret Baier. ""And the reason is that we put a value on an individual human life the way that the barbarians at the other end of the table don't."" To demonstrate that other western countries have been on the short end of such swaps, Krauthammer cited an Israeli hostage exchange from 2011. ""The best example is the Israelis, who gave up 1,000 terrorists in return for one sergeant,"" Krauthammer said. We decided to see whether Krauthammer’s claim was accurate. We found that it was. In 2006, the Islamic terrorist organization Hamas captured Israeli Sgt. Gilad Shalit after tunneling into Israel and attacking an army outpost. Israel’s first attempt to free Shalit, by launching a military invasion into Hamas-controlled Gaza, failed. Shalit was held captive for five years. During that time, many Israelis pleaded with their government to strike a deal for Shalit’s return. Israel had already failed to secure the freedom of Air Force Navigator Ron Arad, who had crashed his warplane in Lebanon 25 years before his death in 2008 while in the control of Shiite captors. Many Israelis worried that Shalit’s capture would end the same way. But it didn’t. Shalit returned home on Oct. 18, 2011, following Israel’s freeing of 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. It's not clear that all 1,027 were ""terrorists,"" but some were indeed terrorists serving several life sentences for killing Israeli citizens. (In addition, the definition of ""terrorist"" varies quite a lot depending on who is using the term.) One Israeli minister who voted against the exchange called it ""a great victory for terrorism."" That fear has been echoed in the wake of the Bergdahl exchange. Krauthammer took issue with such claims in an op-ed in the Washington Post. ""The (Obama) administration might have tried honesty here and said: Yes, we gave away five important combatants. But that’s what you do to redeem hostages,"" Krauthammer wrote. As for what to do with Bergdahl, Krauthammer concludes that the right course is, ""Free him, then try him."" Our ruling Krauthammer said Israel ""gave up 1000 terrorists in return for one sergeant."" In 2011, Israel freed 1,027 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Gilad Shalit, who had been held captive by Hamas since 2006. While we can't confirm that all 1,027 were terrorists, some definitely were, and the definition of ""terrorist"" is often fuzzy.

Scott Walker says Wisconsin graduation rates and third-grade reading scores have risen while he’s been governor
","Gov. Scott Walker responds to critics of his cuts to education funding by pointing out signs of progress in the state’s elementary and high schools. State residents look at results, Walker says. ""For all the hype and hysteria about education, they look at the fact that graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office,"" he told WISN-AM (1130) talk host Jay Weber on April 16, 2014. ""ACT scores continue to be some of the best in the country."" Wisconsin students’ longstanding high-achievement scores on the ACT college-readiness exams (second nationally) are well known. But we were interested in what has been happening on the other two measures the governor cited. When asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marré said state Department of Public Instruction data proves the governor’s case. And we found it’s the best source of data in both areas. Finishing high school Wisconsin’s statewide public school graduation rate was 85.7 percent in the last full school year (2009-’10) before Walker’s term started in January 2010, according to the data. The figure counts those who graduate within four years of starting. In 2010-’11, the rate rose to 87 percent. This school year began months before Walker took office, so any policy changes would have had negligible effect on graduation rates. The results since then: 2011-’12: 87.5 percent 2012-’13: 88 percent That 88 percent rate was tied for second-best in the country along with Nebraska, Texas and Vermont. Iowa topped the list at 89 percent, DPI reported. At the time Walker spoke on WISN, that 88 percent figure for 2012-’13 was not yet public. Also, we should note that pre-2009 data that is comparable is not available. The new data tracks individual students, while the old method used a different methodology. Under any of the scenarios, the arrow is pointing up, though not emphatically. Reading Scores Third-grade readers, the group cited by Walker, are the youngest public-school students to take the annual Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examinations. State officials typically measure progress, or lack thereof, on reading by calculating the number of students deemed ""proficient"" or ""advanced"" based on the exams. The recent history of that figure for third-graders follows a pattern of one-year improvement followed by one-year decline. 2005-06: 32.8 percent proficient or advanced 2006-’07: 34.4 percent 2007-’08: 33.9 percent 2008-’09: 35.2 percent 2009-’10: 32.7 percent (last full school year before Walker’s election) 2010-’11: 34.2 percent 2011-’12: 33.1 percent 2012-’13: 34.9 percent 2013-’14: 34.6 percent So the figure has ping-ponged between about 33 percent and 35 percent. The current figure is higher than most going back nearly a decade, but lower than two of the years. It hasn’t been a straight line upward in Walker’s time, the figures show. Still, the latest year’s count is ""up"" compared to the baseline year pre-Walker. It’s up just slightly compared with 2010-’11, and more significantly compared with 2009-’10, depending on which is used as the baseline for Walker’s term. Public schools, of course, are not the only ones receiving state education aid. Under the voucher or ""choice"" program, private schools in certain districts, most notably Milwaukee, benefit from publicly funded vouchers. We concentrated in this item on public schools because Walker’s comments were in the context of responding to criticism of his public-school funding moves. But for the record, third-grade reading scores also have improved in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program since 2010. Did the governor cherry-pick third-graders because they did better? Not really. Reading scores were up as a whole for students in grades 3-8 and grade 10 who take the test. Walker has made third-grade learning a focal point of his educational platform, and DPI official John Johnson told us that ""third-grade reading and eighth-grade mathematics assessments are often pointed to as predictors of future academic success or struggles."" Finally, there’s the issue of credit. Walker doesn’t directly credit his own policies as responsible for the positive trends. He cited the numbers as part of litany of positive things around the state while discussing voter attitudes. But implicit in Walker’s statement is some degree of chest-thumping, of course. He’s a candidate seeking re-election, after all. He and his critics no doubt would disagree on his impact on these statistics. But it’s clear that longer-term trends are at play here on the shorter time frame Walker cites. Our rating Walker said, ""Graduation and third grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office."" The numbers, in both cases, are up compared with the year before he took office, though the reading scores bounced around some. Some credit may be due prior elected officials, though, because the trend lines haven’t really changed much going back deeper into the pre-Walker era. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB5F3C0>],/factchecks/2014/jun/08/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-graduation-rates-and-t/

Gubernatorial candidate Allan Fung says his Republican primary opponent, Ken Block, supports Obamacare
","In the contest to be the next Republican candidate for governor in Rhode Island, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung has released a TV commercial that lampoons supporters of his GOP opponent, businessman Ken Block. The commercial, called ""Blockhead,"" portrays them with large, cube-shaped heads and has them espousing positions that most Republicans would find objectionable, as ""Over the Waves,"" a song often heard during circus trapeze acts, plays in the background. One of the ""blockhead"" characters says: ""Block supports Obamacare,"" a reference to the Affordable Care Act that Republicans in Congress have tried to repeal, gut or delay more than 50 times.   When the ad was released June 2, 2014, Block's campaign manager Jeff Britt, publicly invited PolitiFact Rhode Island to evaluate the claim because, he said, it misrepresents Block’s position on Obamacare. How could we resist? Britt sent us an email stating, unequivocally, that ""Ken never supported Obamacare."" He added that Block, who ""has frankly been a strong critic, pointing out in speeches and in radio interviews how devastating it has been to his business."" When Block, president of a Barrington software firm, reacted to the commercial on Buddy Cianci's WPRO radio show, he made the same assertion: ""I've never supported Obamacare, in fact I've whacked Obamacare pretty hard because of the negative impact it's had on my business and the cost of acquiring insurance."" While we were waiting for information from the Fung campaign seeking the source of its claim, we examined a new flier from Fung’s campaign that made a slightly different claim about Block's support for Obamacare. It shows a green-faced Block, along with Gov. Lincoln Chafee, depicted as ""Two Peas in a Pod"" because both ""have been cheerleaders for liberal agendas."" ""Both supported Obamacare,"" it asserts, characterizing Block's support in the past tense. So where's the truth? Unlike the television ad, which lists no source for its claim, the flier says the claim is based on Block's Nov. 15, 2013 appearance on the WPRI-TV show ""Newsmakers."" Four minutes into that program, Block states that he has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, including President Obama in 2012. ""In 2012, I bought what Barack Obama was selling in terms of changes to health care for me as a small business owner, someone who buys insurance for employees. I can no longer afford to do what we're doing. And I believed that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, was going to provide the kind of relief that we needed in my business to insure my employees,"" he says. ""And it turns out that the promise didn't live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote,"" Block continued. ""I'm looking for answers and those answers didn't come."" In other words, Block acknowledged in November that he did support the promise of Obamacare, signed into law in March 2010, and Obama's reelection in 2012, but stated that he no longer supports that law. And on March 31, the enrollment deadline for Obamacare, Block released a statement, published in The Providence Journal, characterizing it as ""a horrible bill, ill-conceived, unilaterally passed by one party, and terribly implemented."" He said it ""raised taxes and massively disrupted the health insurance market in Rhode Island without increasing competition, access, or affordability."" Even if Fung hadn’t seen that story, we know he is aware of Block’s earlier repudiation of Obamacare. That’s because when Fung appeared on ""Newsmakers"" on April 11, moderator Tim White challenged Fung over his internet ad that selectively quoted Block's November ""Newsmaker"" appearance. He noted that the Fung ad clipped out Block's phrase, ""The promise didn’t live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote."" Fung said he didn't have a problem with the omission. Despite this, the ""Blockhead"" commercial says ""Block supports Obamacare,"" asserting that he supports the controversial health care law today. When the Fung campaign got back to us, spokesmen Patrick Sweeney and Robert Coupe argued that it is accurate to say that Block supports Obamacare today because Block has never called for repeal of the law, as other opponents have and has never formally revoked the support he acknowledged in the November ""Newsmakers"" appearance. On the latter point, we disagree. Block has repeatedly made it clear he no longer supports Obamacare. The very ""Newsmakers"" appearance the Fung campaign cites in its attack on Block shows that. In light of all the evidence, it is clear that Fung is making a ridiculously blockheaded claim. We rate it Pants On Fire.

"['Immigration', 'Virginia', 'Laura Ingraham']","
Laura Ingraham says Eric Cantor and Luis Gutierrez ""toured the country"" for immigration reform
","Dave Brat recently brought some right-wing firepower to his campaign to unseat U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor in the 7th District Republican primary on Tuesday. Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio talk show host, headlined a June 3 rally for Brat at Henrico County’s Dominion Club and quickly brought up immigration. She noted that Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., held a May 28 rally in Richmond and urged Cantor to allow the House to vote on immigration reforms. Cantor, the House majority leader, has blocked votes on a comprehensive immigration bill and an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would allow children of illegal immigrants to join the military and receive legal status once they’ve served. Cantor has signaled, however, that he might support a narrowly drawn bill establishing a path to citizenship for children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. That’s spurred Brat to label Cantor weak on immigration and claim the majority leader is quietly working on a deal with Gutierrez to pass reforms. Brat said Gutierrez’s appearance in Virginia was designed to bolster Cantor’s credentials as tough on immigration prior to the GOP primary. Ingraham picked up that note, saying the immigration rally was ""beautifully choreographed."" She likened Cantor and Gutierrez to a touring ""Simon and Garfunkel in the 70s.""   Ingraham said of the two politicians, ""They’re touring the country last year talking ‘How to Make Life Work’ -- some ridiculous, meaningless titled tour -- joined at the hip, working together, in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform."" The Cantor-Gutierrez national immigration tour was news to us. So we looked into Ingraham’s claim. Julia Hahn, Ingraham’s executive producer, said the radio personality was referring to a widely publicized ""Becoming America Pilgrimage"" held July 25-27, 2013. The event, organized by the non-profit Institute for Faith & Politics, took lawmakers to Ellis Island, the Museum of Jewish Heritage and other sites around New York City. A delegation of about 100 people, including House members, academics and faith leaders, traveled from Washington for the event. An article in Politico previewing the New York event said it wasn’t ""meant to hash out the nitty-gritty of legislation or debate the politics of specific immigration policies. But lawmakers hope it will be small step forward in Congress’s effort to enact immigration reform."" Gutierrez and Cantor attended parts of the three-day event. Cantor spoke at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights in Queens about the ""special struggles that Jewish people had arriving in a country that often did not understand or welcome people of his faith and culture,"" according to a synopsis of his speech by the Faith & Politics Institute. Hahn pointed to a video of part of Cantor’s address on the conservative Breitbart.com website. It shows Cantor acknowledging Gutierrez in the audience and saying,  ""Luis, thank you for the leadership you’re providing through thick and thin right now as we try and navigate these very tough political times and choppy waters. My hat is off to you."" Ray Allen Jr., a Cantor political adviser, said the majority leader’s recognition of Gutierrez was a simple courtesy. Allen was dismissive of Ingraham’s remarks. ""No, Congressman Cantor did not tour the country with Congressman Gutierrez,"" Allen emailed. ""No, they had no meetings on immigration and no, they never talked prior to Mr. Gutierrez coming to Richmond to attack Eric Cantor for stopping the Senate’s comprehensive immigration plan. And yes, despite what the Left says, we believe it is an amnesty plan."" Douglas Rivlin, a spokesman for Gutierrez, said while the Illinois congressman sat in on Cantor’s speech in New York, Gutierrez only attended about 12 hours of the three-day immigration pilgrimage. Rivlin also said his office checked the congressman’s schedule and found Gutierrez ""has never once had a meeting with Majority Leader Eric Cantor on any issue, including immigration."" Rivlin also said that beyond the ""Becoming America Pilgrimage,"" he’s not aware of any other immigration-related events that Gutierrez and Cantor both attended. We asked Ingraham’s executive producer if, beyond the New York event, she could name other immigration functions Cantor and Gutierrez attended. She came up empty. Our ruling Ingraham said Cantor and Gutierrez were ""touring the country last year … joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform."" Cantor and Gutierrez were among 100 leaders who attended a pilgrimage to the New York City area last July that focused on immigration issues. Aides say that’s the only immigration event Cantor and Gutierrez both happened to attend and that the two lawmakers have never met to discuss immigration. One event in New York does not make a national tour. Ingraham can’t point to another immigration gig Cantor and Gutierrez both attended. Her likening the two politicians to Simon and Garfunkel ""joined at the hip"" on a tour to promote immigration reform is not only false, it’s ridiculous. We rate Ingraham’s statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECD089C0>],/factchecks/2014/jun/06/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-says-reps-eric-cantor-and-luis-guti/
"['Public Safety', 'Texas', 'Judith  Zaffirini']","
State Sen. Judith Zaffirini says 11 percent of fatal car crashes in 2009 were attributed to distracted driving, such as texting
","
Advocating for a statewide ban on texting while driving, state Sen. Judith Zaffirini warned the practice can cause fatal crashes.

""In 2009, 11 percent of fatal crashes — that's 995 out of 5,474 — in the U.S. were attributed to this kind of driving, distracted driving,"" the Laredo Democrat said on the Texas Senate floor on May 25.

The proposal, which later won legislative approval, was vetoed Friday by Gov. Rick Perry.

Still, we wondered if distracted driving really plays into more than 1 in 10 fatal car accidents. To back up the statistic, Zaffirini spokesman Will Krueger pointed us to a September 2010 ""distracted driving"" study by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

The study says the department describes a ""distraction"" as a ""specific type of inattention that occurs when drivers divert their attention from the driving task to focus on some other activity.""

In 2009, the study says, 45,230 drivers were involved in 30,797 fatal U.S. crashes. In those crashes, 33,808 people were killed. And, it says, distraction was reported for 11 percent (5,084) of the drivers involved in those fatal crashes.

Notably, that’s not 11 percent of the crashes, which is how  Zaffirini put it. It turns out, though, that distraction figured into a bigger percentage of fatal crashes in 2009 — 16 percent, according to the study, up from 10 percent in 2005.

The vast majority of distracted-driving related fatalities — 84 percent — were associated with driving in a careless or inattentive manner. That could include using cell phones, eating or talking, according to the study.

The study relies on fatal crash data that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System annually collects from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The study also relies on a sample of police-reported crashes from the National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System.

The study warns that data on distracted-driving-related crashes and resulting injuries and fatalities is limited because investigations are conducted after the fact and police accident reports vary across jurisdictions, creating reporting inconsistencies.

For example, ""some police crash reports"" have a field devoted to identifying whether ""distraction"" led to a crash, according to the study, whereas other reports only give officers the chance to mention distractions in narrative accounts of the accident. Also, if a driver dies during a crash, law officers may not have enough information to judge whether distraction played a role.

Lastly, we searched for other data on distracted driving. According to a 2009 distracted-driving fact sheet from the National Safety Council, more than 50 peer-reviewed scientific studies have identified risks associated with cell phone use while driving.

The sheet cites two studies concluding that drivers who use cell phones are four times more likely to be involved in a crash — a 1997 New England Journal of Medicine examination of hospital records and a 2005 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study linking crashes to cell hone records.

An April 2006 paper by the Canadian Automobile Association and the Traffic Injury Research Foundation summarizing the findings and recommendations from a 2005 International Conference on Distracted Driving notes that ""crash-based studies are retrospective. They begin with the outcome (the collision itself) and endeavour to reconstruct what factors were associated with, or contributed to, the collision.""

Each method for analyzing the risks involved with distracted driving ""has strengths and limitations and because of this no study is definitive,"" according to the report. ""There is no single research approach or design that will answer all the questions about the magnitude and characteristics of the problem and the risks it poses.""

Where does that leave us?

In warning against the dangers of texting while driving, Zaffirini misstated the percentage of fatal crashes attributed to distracted driving: It’s 16 percent, not 11 percent.

State Sen. Chris Widener says May tax revenue dip shows economy remains precarious
","
For the past year, the financial outlook for the state of Ohio has been on a gradual upswing marked by a dropping state unemployment rate and rising tax revenues that have outpaced expectations each month since June 2010.

The rising financial tide has brought with it questions from reporters trying to sort out what and how much money the state may have left at the end of the fiscal year 2011 on June 30.

And it has left Statehouse Republicans eager to tamp down on the speculation that there will be hundreds of millions in ""extra money"" lying around to potentially ease the burden of deep cuts made to state government, K-12 education and other areas of the state budget.

That was the backdrop on the evening of June 7, just a few minutes after the Senate Finance Committee voted out the state budget, when Sen. Chris Widener, the committee's chairman,  was asked about what the state might do with the ""hundreds of millions"" left in the bank in excess revenue for 2011.  

The Springfield Republican suggested that the state's economic recovery could nosedive at any moment and talked about sitting in on a meeting with a half-dozen financial experts on the governor's board of economic advisers who had ""very disparaging reports"" on the future of the American economy.

Trying to hammer home his point that future revenue growth in the state is a shaky proposition, Widener referenced the state’s tax revenues for May, which had just been released.

""You know the revenue estimates for the month of May? I think the (Senate) President (Niehaus) mentioned after session. We’re down for the month as compared to estimated revenue,"" he told reporters. ""That's not a good sign. That's basically a clear indication the governor's counselors are probably right--that we are still not out of the woods yet. We're going month by month.""

Widener made a similar remark on June 15 during a public budget conference committee meeting.

With tax revenues running above estimates for every month since June 2010, a poor showing in May could certainly be interpreted as an ominous sign. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check if May's tax revenue was really down as Widener suggested, and if so, what could be the cause.

We started with tax revenue data was released by the state budget office prior to Widener's statement. It showed May tax sources off by $3.8 million -- a negative 0.2 percent of all tax revenues. However, one of the best indications of the health of Ohio's economy relative to expectations -- personal income tax -- was $94 million above estimates.

So what caused collections to come up short?

It turns out domestic insurance tax, which Ohio insurance companies pay on the premiums they collect, was the guilty party. Revenue from that tax for May was 48 percent below estimates for the month, which adds up to a whopping $87 million, according to the revenue data.

Dave Pagnard, a spokesman for the state budget office, said in an e-mail that the numbers for domestic insurance tax were off because of the timing of the mailings of the billings -- notices were sent too late in May for the payments to be received in time to count in the monthly numbers.

He forwarded a 26-page Monthly Financial Report dated June 10, 2011 from state budget director Tim Keen to Gov. John Kasich that gives a detailed explanation about what happened with the domestic insurance shortfall.

""This is primarily attributable to the loose billings and payment schedule for this tax as the Department of Insurance must certify the amount of billings to the Treasurer of State no later than the first Monday in May (May 2nd). The Treasurer of State then has up to 20 days after certification to send out the bills. Those billed then have 20 to 30 days after certification to submit payment,"" the report says. ""As a result of this issue, the balance of the May billings (which totaled $195.5 million) will be received in June and thus June receipts for this tax should exceed the estimate by approximately the same amount of the May shortfall.""

Translation: It's a timing issue. The state of Ohio will pick the money up in June so the numbers aren't really off by $87 million -- only a temporarily accounting problem.

In fact, had the domestic insurance revenue not been delayed, the state would have been $82.2 million in the black for the month of May.

So how does Widener’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter?

The Senate Finance chair offered up the failure of the state to hit its tax revenue marks in May as evidence that Ohio could be sliding back from a gradual recovery.

And while it’s true that the state was under revenue estimates -- just barely -- it's a mirage based on the state's domestic insurance tax notices going out too late in May for most of them to be returned within the calendar month.

While Widener was correct that May's tax revenues were slightly below estimates, he said it was ""clear evidence"" that Ohio is ""not out of the woods yet"" and could fall back into an economic decline.

There’s room for debate on the progress of economic recovery in Ohio, but in this case the numbers were really nothing more than evidence of bureaucracy in state government. The lower than expected revenues were a result of timing, not depressed collections. That’s a critical fact.

On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that contains an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give listeners a different impression gets one rating: Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB83AE00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/20/chris-widener/state-sen-chris-widener-says-may-tax-revenue-dip-s/
"['Georgia', 'Religion', 'Herman Cain']","
Cain claims Muslims tried to influence sharia law in NJ and OK
","
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain can’t get away from the subject of Islamic law.

Reporters have been dogging him on the issue since March, when a liberal blogger asked Cain whether he’d feel comfortable appointing a Muslim to his Cabinet if he became president. Cain said he would not appoint one because Islam demands they follow Sharia law, above all others -- including the U.S. Constitution.  

Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation.  

Later, Cain denied saying he would not appoint Muslims -- a statement PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants on Fire. CNN anchor and moderator John King asked Cain about the subject again during the June 13 Republican primary debate in Manchester, N.H.

""Are American-Muslims as a group less committed to the Constitution than, say, Christians or Jews?"" King asked.

""There have been instances in New Jersey -- there was an instance in Oklahoma where Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law. I was simply saying very emphatically, ‘American laws in American courts,’ "" Cain replied.

Have there been instances in New Jersey and Oklahoma where Muslims tried to ""influence court decisions with Sharia law""?

We turned to news accounts and court documents to address the issue.

First, we’ll consider Oklahoma, where voters approved the ""Save Our State Amendment"" Nov. 2. It forbids courts from using Sharia law as well as international law when they make decisions. A judge granted a request later that month for a preliminary injunction that bars the amendment from going into effect. It is being challenged in federal appellate court.

During a Nov. 22 hearing in Oklahoma federal court, state Assistant Attorney General Scott Boughton defended the amendment on behalf of the state. He conceded under questioning by a federal judge that he did not know of any instances where Sharia law was used in state courts, according to The Oklahoman newspaper.

An Oct. 28 Los Angeles Times article on the proposed amendment found three cases that backers said demonstrate Sharia law is being used in U.S. courts. None of them took place in Oklahoma.

A brief filed in federal court in support of the Oklahoma amendment did not assert that Sharia law had been used in Oklahoma courts. Instead, it listed one example from New Jersey.

This brings us to Cain’s mention of New Jersey during the June 13 debate. In 2009, state Superior Court Judge Joseph Charles denied a woman a restraining order after she reported her husband repeatedly beat and sexually assaulted her. She and her husband are Muslim.

Charles asked their imam during the injunction hearing how Islamic law applies to sexual behavior. The imam testified that a wife must comply with her husband’s sexual demands, but a husband was forbidden to approach his wife ""like any animal.""   

Charles said he denied the restraining order in part because the husband’s ""desire to have sex when and whether he wanted to, was something that was consistent with his practices and it was something that was not prohibited,"" according to the decision.

The New Jersey appeals court ruled July 23, 2010, that Charles was wrong. His decision contradicted U.S. and state Supreme Court precedent on conflicts between criminal law and religion, the ruling said.  

Let’s sum up.

Cain was wrong on Oklahoma. Voters did pass an amendment to the state constitution that would prevent the use of Sharia law in state courts, but supporters found no instance where ""Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law,"" as Cain said.

There was a New Jersey case in which a judge considered Islamic law when he denied a request for a restraining order.

However, since the issue of Islamic law arose only when the New Jersey judge questioned the couple’s imam, it is unfair to accuse Muslims of trying to ""influence court decisions with Sharia law."" The judge raised the subject.

We rule Cain’s statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB934340>],/factchecks/2011/jun/20/herman-cain/cain-claims-muslims-tried-influence-sharia-law-nj-/

Diane Allen blames Greenhouse Gas Initiative for Ocean Spray’s pending departure from Bordentown
","Editor's Note: This Truth-O-Meter ruling is the subject of a story found here. Before Gov. Chris Christie announced plans in late May to withdraw from a cap and trade program, Republicans had added a new ingredient to the ongoing debate: cranberries.

In early May, Ocean Spray announced plans to close its Bordentown facility, where the growers' co-op makes beverages, and relocate operations to the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania.

On May 9, Republicans held a news conference and issued a press release to call for an end to the state’s involvement in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Under RGGI -- or ""Reggie"" as it’s called -- energy companies buy allowances to comply with a cap on carbon dioxide emissions.

State Sen. Diane Allen (R-Burlington/Camden) cited Ocean Spray's move as an example of how the RGGI was hurting the state's businesses.

""As a former president and CEO of a small business, I can attest to the impact rising energy rates have on an employer’s ability to add jobs and expand,"" she said in a May 9 news release. ""Just ask Ocean Spray, which last week announced it will be moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania, in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI.""

PolitiFact New Jersey dug into her claim and quickly found it didn't have much juice: Five news articles and two TV segments about Ocean Spray's move didn’t mention any connection between the decision and RGGI.

We checked with Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, who said Allen’s comments were based on information she received from longtime cranberry grower Bill Haines Jr. According to Ocean Spray, Haines served on the Ocean Spray board of directors between 1996 and 1999, and then again in 2002.

Haines never called us back, so we asked Ocean Spray.

Company spokesman John Isaf said in an email that higher energy rates factored into the decision to leave Bordentown, but ""not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate.""

The decision, he said, ""was based on a variety of factors -- lower energy costs, improved transportation and distribution (warehousing/freight) logistics; proximity to supply chain partners and customers; lower labor costs; other utility cost advantages (water/wastewater/gas); and a more efficient and modern infrastructure and facility,"" Isaf said in the statement.

""While energy costs were one of several considerations that went into our decision, and NJ’s costs are significantly higher than other states, we were looking at the total rate paid, not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate,"" Isaf said.

That's enough for the Truth-O-Meter, but we thought it was also worth exploring the senator's underlying point, that the cap-and-trade portion is driving up electricity costs.

Utility representatives and experts have an answer: not so much.

According to Karen Johnson, spokeswoman for Public Service Electric and Gas, which supplies power to the Bordentown area, the cap-and-trade portion doesn’t affect electricity bills very much for a customer in Ocean Spray’s rate class.

For the average customer in that rate class, the cap-and-trade portion -- meaning the cost of purchasing allowances -- accounts for 0.4 percent of the annual bill, Johnson said.

Judi Greenwald, vice president of Innovative Solutions at the Virginia-based Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the effects of RGGI on utility costs have been mostly undetectable.

""The rate impacts have been miniscule and probably not even perceptible,"" Greenwald told us.

Across the 10-state region within the RGGI, the emissions cap accounted for between 0.24 and 0.61 percent of average residential electricity bills in 2010, according to a fact sheet prepared by RGGI. That impact represents 46 extra cents per month for a typical household’s electricity usage, according to the RGGI.

In many cases, electricity prices in New Jersey are based on bids submitted by suppliers in non-RGGI states, according to Peter Shattuck, a carbon markets policy analyst for Environment Northeast. For instance, if a supplier in Pennsylvania, which is not part of RGGI, sets the price, New Jersey utilities are not facing RGGI-related charges, he said.

So let’s review:

Allen claimed that Ocean Spray was leaving Bordentown ""in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI."" Yet Ocean Spray said it did not consider RGGI and its impacts on the energy rate.

On top of that, a PSE&G spokeswoman and energy experts said RGGI has had a minimal impact on utility costs.

NJEA ad: Not renewing Jersey’s millionaire’s tax gives break to wealthy residents
","
In the latest attack ad on Chris Christie, the New Jersey Education Association contends the Republican governor is coddling millionaires while he cuts education, women's health care and public safety.

The TV ad, which was also posted on the NJEA-funded website millionairesforchristie.com, claims that the governor cut taxes for the rich.

The ad shows various images of Christie and in capital letters states sources of contributions to the governor and what programs he cut. The ad says, ""We thought he was different but he took thousands in contributions from Wall Street executives, thousands from insurance executives, thousands from drug company executives, and as soon as Chris Christie was governor, he gave a tax cut to millionaires -- a back-door deal to reward the people who put him there. And what about the rest of us? Christie cut our schools, women’s health care and our public safety -- all to give a tax cut to millionaires. Chris Christie. Now it’s clear whose side he’s really on.""

PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether Christie ""gave a tax cut to millionaires.""

The tax bracket has been around since 2004, when Gov. Jim McGreevey approved higher income taxes on residents earning more than $400,000. It became known as the ""millionaire’s tax.""

For tax year 2009, Gov. Jon Corzine approved a one-year tax rate increase for varying income levels to help generate additional revenue for the state: 8 percent on income over $400,000; 10.25 percent on income over $500,000; and 10.75 percent for income above $1 million. The tax rates were to revert to 2008 rates on Jan. 1, 2010 -- before Christie took office. 
Democrats, however, wanted to renew the surcharge and approved a bill that would raise the rate from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent for about 12,000 state residents earning more than $1 million a year. The increase would have generated $637 million in revenue for Fiscal Year 2011, according to an analysis of the proposed surcharge done by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.

Christie vetoed the bill minutes after Senate President Stephen Sweeney brought it to his office.

The Legislature was unable to muster enough votes for a veto override, which meant the surcharge was not reinstated.

So did Christie ""cut"" the tax, as the ad claims?

He actually did not cut anything, because there was nothing to cut. The tax had expired before he took office.

The NJEA told PolitiFact New Jersey Christie's veto is the same thing as a cut.  It's ""a distinction without a difference,"" said spokesman Steve Wollmer. By vetoing the bill, Christie assured that millionaires would continue to pay the lower rate.

Kevin Roberts, Christie’s deputy press secretary, said it wasn't a cut; Christie was just keeping his promise that he wouldn't raise taxes.

To recap: The NJEA ad says that Christie ""gave a tax cut to millionaires,"" which suggests that the governor specifically enacted a cut for a select few. In fact, the tax had expired and, when the Democrats tried to renew it, the governor opposed it. That's not a cut; his veto maintained the status quo. Still, the governor’s veto failed to enact a higher tax rate, meaning a lower rate applies. To some, that’s break enough. We rate the NJEA’s claim Half True.

Immigration expert says hundreds of U.S. cities have been infiltrated by Mexican cartel members
","
For years, Southwestern states, particularly Arizona, have been trying to reduce the porosity of the Mexican-United States border, in part to control the flow of illegal drugs coming into the country.

Most of us are aware that drugs make their way to our region via Mexico and that the Mexican cartels are ruthless. But in the Northeast that threat seems relatively remote.

So we were intrigued when Michael Cutler made one of his regular appearances on WHJJ's ""Helen Glover Show"" and suggested that the cartels now have a serious presence in hundreds of U.S. cities.

Cutler spent 30 years with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (most of them as a criminal investigator) and is a fellow with Californians for Population Stabilization, which wants to limit both legal and illegal immigration in that state.

""A couple of hundred American cities are infested by members of the Mexican cartels, which, by the way, have been responsible for about 35 or 36 thousand people killed in Mexico just since Felipe Calderon became president,"" he said.

First, let's look at his choice of the provocative -- and loaded -- verb ""infest.""

The word is all too often used as a slur applied to immigrant populations. Cutler said in an interview that such usage would be inappropriate. But he said it does apply to the drug traffickers.

""I'm not talking about illegal aliens,"" he said. ""'m speaking about the cartels,"" which he characterized as extraordinarily vicious.

So, to be clear, we were interested in applying the Truth-O-Meter solely to his claim that the reach of Mexican cartels has extended to hundreds of cities.

To infest is to live as a parasite or, in the words of The American Heritage Dictionary, ""to inhabit or overrun in numbers or quantities large enough to be harmful, threatening or obnoxious.""

We decided that having a drug distribution network in a city would clearly qualify as an infestation of illegal activity. Just dropping off drugs for distribution by other groups might not seem to qualify, but the effect of those deliveries is certainly harmful, threatening or obnoxious to a community.

We uncovered a series of articles on various websites reporting a similar claim made in April 2011 by Roberta Jacobson, deputy secretary of state for Mexico and Canada. According to one of them, she said the Mexican drug cartels are operating in more than 230 U.S. cities.

When we first heard from Cutler, he said his source was Janet Napolitano, the U.S. secretary for Homeland Security, who has repeatedly used the 230 number going back at least to 2009.

When we dug a bit deeper, we discovered the source of that estimate.

In December 2008, the U.S. Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center issued its 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment. It reports that Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) ""control most of the U.S. drug market"" with various transportation routes and strong affiliations with gangs in the United States.

""Law enforcement reporting indicates that Mexican DTOs maintain drug distribution networks or supply drugs to distributors in at least 230 U.S. cities,"" the report says.

The report includes a map showing where Mexican drug organizations were reported between Jan. 1, 2006, through Sept. 30, 2008. In New England, it includes Providence, Boston, Hartford, Portland, Fitchburg, Mass., and Greenville, N.H.

The 2009 version warns that it may contain outdated information, so we found the most recent report, released in February 2010. The newer version doesn't give a count of cities where the cartels have influence, but it does say that their reach is expanding, ""primarily in areas where the direct influence of Colombian DTOs is diminishing"" and that ""they are active in more cities throughout the country than any other DTOs.""

The 2010 report also says the Mexican cartels ""are increasing their cooperation with U.S.-based street and prison gangs to distribute drugs and expand their reach into more rural and suburban areas."" The report estimated that the United States has more than 900,000 ""criminally active gang members representing approximately 20,000 street gangs in more than 2,500 cities.""

Most recently, we've seen some direct evidence of cartel activity in Rhode Island. In January, three men whom law enforcement officials say are linked to a Mexican cartel were arrested in a storage unit in North Kingstown with 145 pounds of cocaine and $1.2 million in cash.

We should also note other evidence of Mexican cartel influence, even though it may not involve drugs. In February 2011, federal officials said they had identified a Mexico-based fraudulent-document trafficking operation that had cells in 19 cities, including one in Pawtucket. Cell managers were charged with various counts that included murder, racketeering, money-laundering and kidnapping. Prosecutors said kidnapping and beating was used to drive competitors out of the region.

To sum up, Cutler said that ""a couple of hundred [U.S.] cities are infested by the Mexican cartels,"" a 2008 Justice Department report said the cartels either run drug distribution sites or supply illegal drugs for distribution in 230 cities, and the latest report said the influence of those cartels have only grown.

We rate his statement True.

George Allen says U.S. corporate tax rate is second-highest in world
","
Republican Senate candidate George Allen recently complained that corporate taxes are too high and discourage economic expansion.

""The tax on job-creating businesses in the United States is 35 percent, second worst in the entire world,"" he said during a June 14 news conference at which he unveiled his Blueprint for America’s Comeback..

We wondered if the U.S. really is No.2 in the world when it comes to high corporate taxes and asked for the source of Allen’s information.

Katie Wright, spokeswoman for Allen’s campaign, pointed to a March 8, 2011, report from the right-leaning Tax Foundation. It indeed showed that the U.S. had the second highest total corporate tax rate among industrialized and emerging nations. Only Japan placed higher levies on business profits.

But taxes are a complicated subject, and Allen’s claim needs elaboration.

Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Tax Policy Center, noted most corporate income is taxed at the top U.S. federal rate of 35 percent, which Allen cited. The tax applies to American companies doing business here and abroad as well as to profits earned in the U.S. by affiliates of foreign companies.

Allen understates his argument when he says the 35 percent federal corporate tax rate is the second highest in the world. Actually, it outstrips Japan and is the highest national rate among nearly three dozen industrialized democracies, according to 2011 data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

But national tax rates on companies don’t tell the whole story.  

When looking at how the U.S. corporate tax liability compares to other countries, analysts usually  examine a combination of federal and state corporate income tax rates.

By that measure, the combined average corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 39.2 percent this year, according to the OECD. Among industrialized democracies, only Japan’s combined corporate rate of 39.5 percent is higher.

Japan had planned to lower its corporate tax rate by 5 percent on April 1. But it delayed making the cut after a disastrous earthquake and tsunami struck in March.

The OECD report only discusses statutory corporate tax rates. It does not address deductions and credits companies can claim in various countries to lower their liabilities. These loopholes produce an ""effective tax rate"" - the percentage of profits companies actually pay in levies.

The World Bank published a report last November containing the effective corporate tax rates of 183 nations. The U.S. had an effective corporate tax rate of 27.6 percent, according to the study, which is still pretty high. Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand had higher effective tax rates on corporate profits.

Allen, during his news conference, said he would like to lower the 35 percent national corporate tax rate to 20 percent and eliminate loopholes.

Let’s sum up:

Allen said the U.S. corporate income tax of 35 percent is the second highest in the world.

The national rate of 35 percent is actually the highest among democratic industrial nations. The U.S. combined corporate tax rate -- the average total of state and national levies on business profits -- is 39.2 and ranks second among industrialized democracies.

So Allen is a smidgen off on tax rates, rankings and definitions. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC4C740>],/factchecks/2011/jun/18/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-corporate-tax-rate-second-hig/

Out-of-control Oregon DEQ levying fines for no reason?
","
Recently, state Sen. Doug Whitsett, R-Klamath Falls, excoriated the Department of Environmental Quality at a legislative budget hearing. He called the agency ""out of control"" and cited the following as one small example of DEQ’s lack of common sense:

""In Medford, the Medford Water Commission has been fined $279,000 for the egregious offense of dumping drinking water in Lone Pine Creek. This is a practice that the, Lone Pine Creek is a highly urbanized stream, the Medford Water Commission has been doing this for decades. When it was determined by DEQ that this was some kind of offense, the Medford Water Commission agreed to stop doing it. They were fined almost $300,000 anyway.""

Whitsett’s implication is that DEQ trumped up a charge against the Medford Water Commission, which was just doing what it has done for years and causing no problem to anyone. And even after the commission agreed to stop doing what it thought was legal, DEQ remained unreasonable. We wanted to know if that was indeed the case.

The facts: On Nov. 30, DEQ issued a $278,794 civil penalty against the Medford Water Commission for dumping chlorinated drinking water into Lone Pine Creek. (The commission sends extra water into the creek in the rainy season, when people don’t need as much water.) The water is OK for human consumption, but toxic to fish unable to tolerate the chlorine used to make the water drinkable in the first place. So the agency issued a fat fine, much of it based on the $13,000 annual cost the commission avoided for roughly a dozen years by not dechlorinating the water.

The commission in its appeal basically claimed that it did nothing wrong, and in the alternate, that it didn’t know it was doing anything wrong. The appeal is pending. ""It was plain drinking water,"" said Larry Rains, manager of the Medford Water Commission. ""We're just arguing we thought we were following the rules, (and there is) a disagreement on how those rules are interpreted.""

On the face of it, it looks like a clear violation by the water commission: You can’t divert chlorinated drinking water into fish habitat. But then we put in a call to Sen. Whitsett, who said that the water commission never considered the creek a stream; it was a storm drain.

""The rules have been that if you discharge chlorinated drinking water into a stream, it has to be dechlorinated. If it’s a storm drain, there has to be sufficient time for"" the chlorine to dissipate before it reaches fish habitat, Whitsett said. ""DEQ decided to call it a creek, and not a storm drain.""

So we checked with the department. Jeff Bachman with the agency’s Office of Compliance and Enforcement said there’s no way that Lone Pine Creek is a storm sewer. It’s an ""urbanized stream,"" he said.  

A ""storm sewer"" or ""storm drain"" is a human-made system of channels, conduits, pipes or a mix of the above to control and carry storm water to a waterway.  Bachman said Lone Pine Creek runs underground in a pipe, in a concrete channel through the Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport and in a natural stream channel.

But, he added, even with storm drains you can’t just dump in chlorinated water: ""The Department's policy on disposal of chlorinated water states that such water may be discharged to a storm sewer only if there is no other feasible alternative, such as dechlorination, and if the sewer is long enough such that the chlorine can dissipate during the time it takes the chlorinated water to travel to a water of the state.""   

Again, we’re left to think that DEQ had every right to fine the water commission, although we can see where the confusion may lie. So we called Sen. Alan Bates, D-Ashland, who may be considered more friendly to environmental regulation than Whitsett. But Bates was just as ticked off at the agency as his Republican colleague over Lone Pine Creek.

""It’s never been clear in anyone’s mind what it is,"" Bates said. ""If you think of it as a pristine little creek, that’s sorely not the case. On the other hand, we’re trying to clean up these kinds of areas.""

Bates said it was fine for DEQ to point out the problem so the commission could fix it. But assessing a fine that dates back to 1997? He didn’t get that at all. ""DEQ over-reached. They’ve lost their mind and put this huge fine on people.""
   
Whitsett’s statement is partially true, but lacking an important detail. He’s absolutely right about the amount of the fine, but he left out the fact that the water was chlorinated and unfit for fish habitat. We understand why he would, since he disputes Lone Pine Creek is a stream. On the other hand, as DEQ points out, people can’t just dump chlorinated drinking water into storm drains either.

We rate the statement as Half True. As for whether the agency is justified in assessing such a large fine, well, we leave that question to you.

Bloggers say West violated federal law by diving with American flag
","
A couple days before Flag Day, Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West went for what was supposed to be a fun excursion for the Army vet: A patriotic dive off the coast in Broward County.

Little did West know he was entering hot water.

The Miami Herald reported on West's June 12, 2011 dive with a group of Army, Navy and Marine Corps veterans and published a photo of West underwater in scuba gear, saluting the American flag. ""I think it's important wherever we are, that the flag flies,"" West, a 22-year veteran Army officer and experienced scuba diver, told the Herald. The veterans who joined him agreed.

But was the whole thing illegal?

That's a claim being circulated by bloggers.

The Daily Pulp, a blog of the Broward-Palm Beach New Times, reported on West's deep sea adventure June 14 with the headline: ""Allen West violates federal law during weekend diving trip.""

""There's nothing really bad to say about Rep. Allen West going diving off the coast of Deerfield Beach with a bunch of military veterans -- except for the fact that he violated U.S. federal law in the process and provided a pictorial of himself doing so,"" the blog claimed. ""During his diving session Sunday, Lt. Col. West was photographed holding an American flag underwater, on top of an artificial reef -- which would be a violation of the United States Code.""

The blog then quoted Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 8, Subsection B of the U.S. Code: ""The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.""

The allegation against West -- a freshman legislator being targeted by Democrats in 2012 -- was picked up or repeated by dozens of websites, including POLITICO, and BlogPost, a Washington Post blog. The Salon.com headline was ""Why does Allen West hate the American flag?""

PolitiFact Florida wanted to see if the blogger's claim had merit.

There is indeed a ""Respect for Flag"" section of the U.S. code. It reads: ""No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.""

The code contains several rules about how to respect the flag including that it should ""never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free ... never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery"" and ""never be used as a covering for a ceiling.""

For this fact-check, we're focusing on the part that pertains to West, that ""the flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.""

We contacted five different experts -- two former federal prosecutors and three law professors who teach constitutional law. All agreed the flag code is intended to advise people on how to respect the flag and that there is no penalty for violating the code. Most said, generally, that West's actions did not violate law.

• The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right to burn the flag. So, experts asked, how could diving underwater with a flag be possibly considered worse? West's display of the flag underwater would be protected by his First Amendment rights, which would trump the code, said Kendall Coffey, a former federal prosecutor who worked for Democrats in the Bush v. Gore 2000 recount case.

""It's really just a guidance rather than an instrument of prosecution,"" Coffey said. ""He's acting inconsistent with the law, but if your actions are in effect protected by the Constitution which overrides laws you would not say he is violating the law. ... I don't think he has violated the law. I think he is fully protected by the U.S. Constitution.""

• The flag code uses the word ""should,"" as opposed to ""shall."" That suggest the code isn't legally binding, said Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami.

""It's pretty clear to me that this rule is advisory, or normative, but, not mandatory unless referenced somewhere else in the code. (I'm aware of no such references.),"" Froomkin wrote in an e-mail. ""While one might expect a congressperson to choose to obey these rules voluntarily, that is an issue of decorum, not law. So, yes, it is a violation of something in the U.S. Code, but no, not a violation of a law that you can actually get arrested or fined for violating.""

Bob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, agreed. ""There is no punishment here,"" Jarvis said. ""When we talk about law where there is no enforcement mechanism it's an advisory law. Then the question becomes is that really a law?""

• No prosecutor would ever try the case. Coffey and former South Florida federal prosecutor Jeffrey Sloman said prosecution was extremely unlikely. ""It is my opinion that no U.S. Attorney (in his right mind) would ever prosecute anyone, let alone a U.S. Congressman, for the conduct you have described,"" Sloman wrote in an e-mail.

We asked for a response from West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano. She e-mailed us back a June 15, 2011 blog item in the conservative Weekly Standard, which wrote ""it turns out that U.S. Armed Forces routinely takes the flag underwater for reenlistment ceremonies and various other reasons. Nevermind that it was obvious West was honoring the flag, and he's a retired lieutenant colonel and combat veteran that's probably far more sensitive to what is and is not appropriate to do with the flag than a flurry of liberal bloggers."" Sachitano also sent us a link from the Navy's website showing a photo of a member of the Navy underwater holding the U.S. flag. 
So is the Navy breaking the law? 
Is West breaking the law? 
No, at least in the opinions of experts. He may have violated U.S. Code, but there's no penalty for doing so, and there's a question if the code is anything more than a suggestion. And even if it was, the U.S. Supreme Court has already said you can burn a flag, so experts say (and we agree) that you can go swimming with one. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB941280>],/factchecks/2011/jun/17/blog-posting/blogger-says-west-violated-federal-law-diving-flag/

Herman Cain touts alternative to Social Security used in Galveston, Texas
","
During Monday’s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former pizza executive Herman Cain touted an alternative to Social Security that has been operating for three decades in Galveston County, Texas.

""The city of Galveston, they opted out of the Social Security system way back in the '70s,"" Cain said. ""And now, they retire with a whole lot more money. Why? For a real simple reason -- they have an account with their money on it. What I'm simply saying is we've got to restructure the program using a personal retirement account option in order to eventually make it solvent.""

We’ll give Cain a pass on a pair of minor errors -- it’s Galveston County, not city, and the program launched in 1981, not in the 1970s. Instead, we’ll cut to the bottom line: Has the program meant that participants ""retire with a whole lot more money"" than they would under Social Security?

First, some background on the Galveston program, which is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. (The federal government banned such moves by local governments in 1983.)

In 1981, employees of Galveston County -- as well as those in two adjoining Texas counties, Matagorda and Brazoria — voted, after lengthy presentations and discussions, to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits. Participants would contribute to their retirement accounts, supplemented by an amount from their employers, and those funds would be invested in annuities through a financial-services company chosen by a county-run bidding process.

The Alternate Plan, as it is called, was designed to supplement a separate, existing, defined-contribution pension plan known as the Texas County and District Retirement System. The Alternate Plan’s benefits are not indexed for inflation (a key difference from Social Security -- more on that below), and while each participant is assigned an individual account, the employee is not able to control investment decisions.

In recent years, as various politicians have floated ideas to partially privatize Social Security, the Galveston plan has received an unusual amount of public attention. However, the primary statistics available to gauge Cain’s claim are imperfect, since they are more than a decade old.

Judging which plan provides a better payout requires constructing models for various types of employees, accounting for variables such as income, the length and consistency of job tenure, marital status and the number and age of dependents. So comparing the two plans is a complex undertaking, and the most thorough independent examinations of the question -- a pair of 1999 studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Social Security Administration -- do not appear to have been updated in the past dozen years.

We’ll first explain what GAO and SSA concluded in 1999, then look at what variables must be taken into account before applying their 12-year-old conclusions to today.

As our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas summarized in an item published in December, 2010, participants who had higher earnings and fewer or no dependents generally fared better under the Galveston plan, particularly over the near term. But workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security.

This stems from the plans’ divergent designs. The Galveston plan is somewhat analogous to a 401(k) plan -- that is, a plan designed to encourage workers to save for retirement -- rather than a social insurance, or safety-net, program like Social Security.

""Social Security is a social insurance program designed, in part, to provide a basic level of retirement income to help retired workers, disabled workers and their dependents and survivors stay out of poverty,"" GAO wrote in 1999. As a result, GAO said, Social Security benefits ""are tilted to provide relatively higher benefits to low-wage earners"" than they would have received based on what they put into the system.

There is no such redistributive mechanism in the Alternate Plan. If you have a higher salary and put more money into the system, you’ll get more out of it -- perhaps even more than Social Security would provide, GAO and SSA concluded. But if you are on the low end of the income scale, Social Security will give you a relatively better payout at retirement, compared with the Alternate Plan.

There’s another important factor to note. Because the Alternate Plan lacks inflation protection -- unlike Social Security, which increases benefits annually if there’s inflation in consumer prices -- the studies found a serious risk that Alternate Plan beneficiaries will fare worse over time than if they had received Social Security and its built-in cost-of-living increases. (The specific scenarios outlined in the studies are highly varied; readers who want more details should read the reports directly.)

The takeaway from the GAO and SSA studies is that the Galveston plan can be better than Social Security -- if you’re better off and if you fall into certain specific demographic categories. For many workers, especially those who are paid less, Social Security provides more.

This result doesn’t directly conflict with Cain’s statement, but it does undermine the sweeping certitude with which he said that participants will ""retire with a whole lot more money.""

""It's a great plan if you have worked under the plan for many years, if you do not die and leave any dependents, if you are not divorced from someone covered in the plan and if you are not interested in having your retirement income stream protected against inflation,"" said Eric Kingson, a professor at Syracuse University's School of Social Work and a longtime skeptic of the plan. ""Short-term workers who leave the plan receive little if any benefits for their work and do not have their years under the Galveston Plan covered by Social Security. Low-income working persons do not receive anything approaching the kind of protection they receive under Social Security.""

Keith Brainard, the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, agreed that the Galveston plan is better for some types of workers, including those with long tenures.

But the ""problem,"" he said, ""lies in Cain’s implication that Social Security should be a wealth-producing vehicle, when that’s not what it’s supposed to be. Social Security is supposed to be old-age insurance. That should be the emphasis of the program, not ‘retiring with a lot more money.’""

As we noted, the GAO and SSA studies are old. How do they hold up? As it turns out, they may bolster or even strengthen the case for Social Security.

The 1999 studies were conducted at a time of higher returns in the marketplace. The Galveston plan invests conservatively -- by design and from the beginning -- in annuity contracts with a guaranteed rate of return, rather than stocks. So the Galveston system is insulated from much market volatility.

Still, even these safer financial vehicles have seen ramped-down returns in the current economic climate. Because of prevailing low interest rates, the contracts now provide the minimum rate of return that was negotiated as a floor in 1981 -- either 3.75 percent or 4 percent annually, said Rick Gornto, president of First Financial Benefits Inc., who has operated the Galveston plan for 30 years. That’s lower than the 1999 GAO and SSA studies had projected.

And that’s notable, because when the 1999 studies came out, plan supporters criticized the reports for assuming lower returns than the plan had produced historically, thus unfairly selling the plan short compared to Social Security.

""These studies assumed a low 4 percent return, which is the minimum rate of return on annuities guaranteed by the insurance companies,"" wrote Judge Ray Holbrook, who oversaw the creation and administration of the Galveston plan, and Alcestis ""Cooky"" Oberg in a 2005 paper for the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative think tank that has been a longtime supporter of the plan. Holbrook and Oberg wrote that as of 2005, the average annual rate of return had been ""about 6.5 percent over 24 years.""

Our reading of the SSA study is that they actually assumed a 5.55 percent rate of return for the Galveston plan. The figure used in the GAO study was not specified.

Either way, the rates of return for the Alternate Plan are either equal to or lower than the 1999 studies had assumed. That would either bolster the 1999 conclusions or put the Alternate Plan at a disadvantage if such a comparison were made today. (Rates of return for Social Security depend on a person’s individual economic history, so there is no simple apples-to-apples comparison to make. That’s why comprehensive, model-based analyses like the GAO’s and the SSA's are necessary.)

Now we’ll add some caveats.

Retirement plans can only be judged on long-term returns, so today’s low rates may be putting the Galveston plan in an unusually poor light on the specific issue Cain highlighted. There’s nothing to say that the Galveston rates won’t rise in the future.

In addition, there are some advantages to the Galveston plan -- not just to the higher earners who get more out of the program, but also to the government entity running them. The Alternate Plan doesn’t face the same kind of long-term fiscal challenges that Social Security does, because it only promises participants the investment returns for the money they pay in to the system.

The downside, of course, is that the investments may not perform well enough to exceed what Social Security would have provided. In addition, some commentators have said that structural reasons would prevent a Galveston-type plan from being a good model on a national level, even if it were deemed to work well in a local context.

But that debate is beyond the scope of this article. On the specific question Cain raised -- whether participants in Galveston will ""retire with a whole lot more money"" than if they were in Social Security -- the answer is, ""it depends."" According to studies published a dozen years ago, some will, and some won’t. And the outlook today for the Galveston plan’s rate of return -- while not immutable going forward -- is more downbeat than it was in 1999. On balance, we rate Cain’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC38CC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/17/herman-cain/herman-cain-touts-alternative-social-security-used/

George Allen says U.S. leads world in energy resources
","
George Allen says the United States has plenty of energy resources and that the president should allow more exploration and excavation of them.

Allen, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat of retiring U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, said during a June 14 speech that America’s energy resources outpace those of any other nation.

""We are number one in the world when it comes to energy resources,"" he said. ""You would never know it. The Russians are second; Saudi Arabia is number three.""

When it comes to coal, oil and natural gas, are we really No. 1 here in the United States?

Allen’s spokeswoman, Katie Wright, said the claim comes from a report by the Congressional Research Service, the non-partisan research arm of the legislative branch. The CRS study, and our own research, relied on the Energy Information Administration. The EIA, a unit of the Department of Energy, is a clearinghouse for information on energy production and consumption.

The CRS report, released in 2009, converted the different types of fossil fuels into a ""barrels of oil equivalent."" Since each fuel produces a different amount of energy when burned, the conversion allows an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison. Natural gas reserves, for example, are reported per trillion cubic feet. About 5.64 trillion cubic feet of natural gas produce the same amount of energy as one billion barrels of oil.  Coal reserves are reported in tons. One billion tons of coal produces as much energy as 3.45 billion barrels of oil.

We used a 2010 version of the CRS report to get the latest figures.

According to the CRS, the United States has the highest amount of proven fossil fuel reserves, the equivalent of 972.6 billion barrels of oil. Russia is second at the equivalent of 954.9 billion barrels of oil, followed by China with 474.8 billion barrels. Iran and Saudi Arabia are fourth and fifth, at 328.1 billion barrels and 309.1 billion barrels, respectively.

The CRS also attempts to project the quantity of undiscovered reserves in each nation. If those are included, Saudi Arabia moves into third place because of its vast oil endowment. The United States and Russia retain the first two spots. Allen’s claim was based on the combination of proven and potential reserves.

Uncle Sam is the undisputed king of coal, holding more than 27 percent of the world’s reserves. The United States ranked fourth in natural gas reserves, behind Russia, Iran and Qatar. We were a distant 11th when it comes to oil reserves, behind several Middle Eastern countries, Canada, Venezuela, Russia and Nigeria.

When it comes to newer technologies like biofuels or wind power, there is little uniform data on global potential for those energy sources.

Before we issue a ruling, there are a few caveats worth considering. A key issue is that world reserves of fossil fuels are always evolving. New fields are discovered, estimates for existing fields are altered, and resources are extracted or burned. Essentially, experts who estimate reserves are aiming at a moving target.

And as former Energy Department official Alan Hegberg pointed out, some reserves may stay untapped in the current economic climate, given the cost or difficulty of extraction. But advances in technology or changes in weather could change the equation in the future. One example, he said, is the Arctic Ocean.

""People think there is a ton of gas in the Arctic,"" he said.

Arctic natural gas is now considered inaccessible, but a receding ice pack and longer summers could make those resources easier to reach. The next issue will be who owns the gas under the ice pack. Russia has tried to stake some claims, but Canada, the United States and Denmark -- which controls Greenland -- will also want a say.

So where does the data leave us?

Allen said the U.S. has the most plentiful energy resources in the world, followed by Russia and then Saudi Arabia.

According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. has the largest proven reserve of fossil fuel resources, followed by Russia and China. If estimates of undiscovered oil and gas are included, the United States remains first, followed by Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Data from the Energy Information Agency show that Russia has the largest volume of the three fossil fuels. But the American lead in coal, which produces very high amounts of energy when burned, means the United States narrowly edges Russia in the CRS report.

Our only quibble with Allen is his decision to list Saudi Arabia third, since that ranking relies on undiscovered reserves. But that is a minor point.

We rate the statement True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9824C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/17/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-leads-world-energy-resources/

State Rep. David Simpson says the state budget includes funding for commercials for Fortune 500 companies
","
State Rep. David Simpson says the state budget lawmakers sent to Gov. Rick Perry spends money in the wrong places — such as on Walmart commercials.

""Despite conservative boasts of cost cutting, not raising taxes and not using the Economic Stabilization Fund, or ‘rainy day fund,’ the budget still preserves about $500 million of pork for special interests including film and music makers, video games and commercials for Fortune 500 companies,"" the Longview Republican said in a June 5 op-ed in the Longview News-Journal.

It’s well-reported that the state promotes music, film and even video games. But this is the first we’ve heard about funding TV spots for the top 500 U.S. companies that Fortune magazine ranks by revenue every year.

To back up the statement, Simpson aide Michael Bullock noted that the 2012-13 budget the House approved on May 28 appropriates $32 million for film and music marketing, a program overseen by the governor’s office. The budget provides $16 million each year to ""market Texas as a film location and promote the Texas music industry,"" according to the May 26 House-Senate conference committee report.

What does that have to do with Fortune 500 TV spots?

Bullock pointed us to a March report by the Texas state comptroller analyzing the state’s economic development incentives for 2010. According to the report, lawmakers in 2007 revised the Film Industry Incentive Program, created in 2005, so its grants could be extended to companies working in ""the entire moving image industry,"" sweeping in makers of commercials, TV programs and video games.

In 2009, the Legislature appropriated $64 million in incentives for the biennium.

According to the report, from April 2009 through August 2010, the Texas Film Commission approved 152 applications to help fund the production of commercials, awarding $2 million to grantees who, all told, said they’d spend $37.4 million in Texas.

And did any of the commercials promote Fortune 500 companies? The report lists a handful.

As of Aug. 31, the company Action Figure No. 1. Inc., had received more than $8,000 for an AT&T television commercial, which was one of three commercials made for AT&T, a Fortune 500 company, by three different companies using state grants totaling about $25,600, the report says. Also, the company Radical Media received $32,000 in grant money to make a commercial for Walmart, another Fortune 500 company, and the company Modern Times received $11,133 to make a commercial for the TV show ""Friday Night Lights."" That show aired on NBC, a network owned by the Fortune 500 company General Electric.

We wondered if each Fortune 500 company benefits from grants going to separate production companies. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us the grants can go to either the production company, advertising agency or the client — such as a Fortune 500 company — involved in a supported TV ad.  

Lastly, we turned to the Texas Film Commission, which says on its website that certain commercials — such as ads for state agencies or those that portray Texas negatively — aren’t eligible for incentives.

Otherwise, state law permits incentives for a TV commercial project of up to 5 percent of the amount spent on the project in the state, according to the commission. To qualify, the maker must spend at least $100,000 in Texas, at least 60 percent of its shooting days must be completed in the state and at least 70 percent of the paid crew, cast and extras must be Texas residents.

Nashed told us TV commercial projects will continue to be eligible for incentives in 2012-13.

"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich still claiming Obama made a dozen campaign trips to Ohio
","
In a June 13 interview on Fox News’ Hannity program, Gov. John Kasich retold an old tale — how he beat incumbent Gov. Ted Strickland despite the Democrat getting repeated help from President Barack Obama, who jetted to the Buckeye State on Air Force One to help his party mate.

If this is starting to sound familiar, it should.

""The president came in and campaigned against me 12 times,"" Kasich told Sean Hannity. ""And, you know, I mean, it didn’t work.""

Kasich made the comment after Hannity asked the governor about his invitation to play golf with the president on June 18, and how comfortable he would be with Obama given their political differences.

But did Obama really come to Ohio 12 times to campaign against Kasich?

Kasich has made this claim several times since being elected and Politifact Ohio has checked it and rechecked it. And while it is true Obama came to Ohio in 2010 to help Strickland with his bid for re-election, Politifact Ohio has also noted that the governor is clearly overstating the scope of the president’s assistance.

The facts bear repeating, so here it goes.

Obama did indeed visit Ohio 12 times between taking office in January 2009 and the November 2010 election. But a review of Obama’s travel schedule and the speeches he made offers a different picture.

One of Obama’s visits, for instance, occurred March 3, 2009, a full two months before Kasich even announced his candidacy.

And of Obama’s 12 trips, nine were made under the guise of official White House business during which he pushed specific policies – mainly health care reform and the economic stimulus bill.

Two trips in 2010, Oct. 17 and Oct. 31, were made specifically to campaign for Strickland and the Democratic ticket. And on a trip made Aug. 18, 2010, Obama hosted a fund-raiser for Strickland and in a separate event pushed his economic polices.

Transcripts from Obama’s non-campaign visits show he referred to Republicans in Washington many times in arguing that his policies are better than GOP plans. But Obama never mentioned the governor’s race or Kasich.

At a campaign rally Oct. 17 before 35,000 people in Columbus, Obama never mentioned Kasich. He did name Kasich twice when he spoke at an Oct. 31 rally in Cleveland.

So, by that recounting, Obama actually visited Ohio just three times to directly campaign or raise money for Strickland and only once in those three trips did the president actually mention Kasich by name.

Kasich’s campaign team argues that every time Obama trekked into Ohio during a campaign season, his visibility alone could be taken as a campaign stop for Strickland, who trailed in the gubernatorial race the entire way and ended up losing by two percentage points. 

""Whether it’s one visit or 12 visits, Ohio is a key state and clearly the President wanted to keep his party in control of it going into 2012,"" Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said Thursday.

And on several of the ""non-campaign"" stops, Strickland was at the president's side, Nichols rightfully points out, which certainly gives the impression that Obama was visiting to stomp for Strickland.

But conversely, Ohio is an important political state for anyone seeking to be elected or re-elected president and Obama, facing re-election next year, could just as well have been trying to maintain and strengthen his own political fortunes in this bellwether state.

The governor does have reason to be proud of his election victory.

Here’s a completely accurate statement the governor could use that is remarkable unto itself: Kasich was the first person to defeat an incumbent Ohio governor since 1974.

That alone makes his victory historically significant.

As we have said before, there is a small element of truth in Kasich’s claim. Obama did make 12 visits to Ohio prior to the November 2010 election.

But he made just three trips directly on Strickland’s behalf and he mentioned Kasich by name in his remarks on just one. Those are critical facts that give a different impression.

On the Truth-O-Meter, that means Kasich’s claim rates Barely True.

Governor compares creating 25 jobs in rural Umatilla County to creating 500 jobs in the Portland area
","
Jobs, jobs, jobs. If there has been an unofficial theme for the 2011 legislative session -- you know, besides budget cutting -- it would have been job creation. That’s what everything seems to revolve around these days; how do you put the state back to work?

Even a recent hearing on the Oregon Youth Authority’s diminished budget turned toward jobs.
Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, thanked the subcommittee that had worked on the department’s budget for not cutting certain facilities located in her district.

""The loss of those rural jobs would be absolutely devastating,"" she said.

Then she added something that caught our attention: ""I keep remembering Gov. Kitzhaber's remarks that 15 jobs in Tillamook is equal to 500 in Portland. By maintaining these facilities -- these are economic drivers, we profoundly thank the committee for keeping them open.""

The reason this jumped out at us is that we’d actually seen this sort of statistic attributed to the governor before. Back in April, the governor released a noteoutlining some of the successes of his first 100 days in office.

One of them read like this: ""I traveled to Pendleton and Ontario to launch a new solar array and visit Oregon companies like Hill Meat Company. Creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County has the same impact as 500 jobs in the Portland metro region.""

We’d actually started to fact check it back then, but got distracted. Sen. Johnson’s comment was just what we needed to get us back on track.

Back when the governor sent his note out, we asked Amy Wojcicki, his spokeswoman, to explain exactly what the governor meant. She got back to us with a cheat-sheet of the staff’s math and told us there had been a slight mistake. Turns out, she said, 25 jobs in Umatilla was more like 780 jobs in the Portland area.

Their math, as Wojcicki explained it, went like this:

Using state employment statistics from January 2011, the Portland metro area had an overall employment level of 1,067,037 while Umatilla had one of 34,261.

""The quickest and least complicated way to demonstrate equivalency is a simple ratio,"" she wrote. So the team took 25 and divided it by 34,261 to get an idea of what 25 jobs was relative to the overall employment number in Umatilla. They took the result of that equation and multiplied it by the Portland-area employment level to get an idea of how many jobs would be needed to have a similar impact there. The answer: 779 jobs.

""Adding 25 jobs in Umatilla county was therefore equivalent to adding 779 jobs in PDX in January,"" Wojcicki concluded.

The math seemed sound to us, but we’re not employment experts, so we got in touch with Dallas Fridley, a regional economist for the Oregon Employment Department located in Hood River.

He walked us through the state’s employment recordsand we did a few of our own calculations based on the overall employment data from 2010. According to our stats, 25 jobs in Umatilla was more like 750 in Portland, but the governor’s point was still right on. If anything he had originally underestimated the impact.

(For those of you wondering, the impact of 25 jobs in Tillamook is comparable to some 2,230 in the Portland-area under this method.)

Still, something was nagging at us. Sure, 25 jobs in Umatilla would have the same impact in terms of employment statistics as 700-some jobs in the Portland area, but would it have ""the same impact"" overall?

We wondered what Fridley thought. He was of two minds about the issue.

""At the end of the day we are talking about equivalents here,"" he said. ""I think there actually is an argument that the net is only 25 jobs ... at the end of the day it's not 750 jobs.

""While it is technically true that, proportionally it works out this way, it's still not an increase of 750 jobs.""

If you’re looking at the state as a whole, he said, there’s really no question that it would be better to have 750 jobs rather than 25 -- those 750 would go much further toward lowering the overall employment rate. ""Growth in Portland or growth anywhere in the state does often benefit the entire state.""

But, Fridley added, for rural communities, it’s important to consider the relative local impact, as well. ""For the most part, job opportunities are harder to come by in rural communities. … In some ways, (25 jobs in a rural community) is a bigger deal, simply because the rural areas don't grow as quickly.""

Ultimately when you’re making these sorts of comparisons, he said, ""you don't really have a lot of options.""

What’s that joke about economists loving the phrase ""on the one hand ... and on the other … ""?

We decided to get one more opinion on the issue and phoned up Tom Potiowsky, the state economist. We asked him what he thought about the governor’s Umatilla-Portland comparison.

Obviously, from a statewide perspective, 750 jobs will always be more advantageous than 25, Potiowsky said. But, if you’re comparing the way one defined area would be impacted by receiving a certain number of jobs to the way another defined area would be impacted, then the approach is the right one.

""When you start thinking about other geographic areas, then, I think that comparison makes sense,"" he said. ""In those localities, they have a much smaller labor force, and so a much smaller number of jobs increase.""

That makes sense to us. Once it’s clear the governor is talking about local impact, his statistics hold up -- they’re even understated. But, without that clarity you might hear that statement and think that 25 jobs in Umatilla had the same impact for the state as a whole as 750 in Portland, which just isn’t the case. So, we’ll give the governor a Mostly True here -- the statement is accurate but needs some clarification.

"['Georgia', 'Crime', 'Ray Lewis']","
Ray Lewis crime claim gets flagged
","
For more than a decade, Ray Lewis has been one of the most fearsome players in professional football.

Lewis, a 12-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, recently offered a prediction if the ongoing National Football League lockout continues through this season that sounded scarier than getting tackled by him. There’s talk that NFL owners and players are closer to a labor agreement, but if not, Lewis says watch out.

""Do this research,"" Lewis told ESPN. ""If we don’t have a season, watch how much evil, which we call crime, watch how much crime picks up if you take away our game.""

Lewis, to be clear, was talking about fans committing more crime, not players.

Lewis, as some Atlantans remember, has a criminal history in this city. In 2000, Lewis and some friends got into an argument at a Buckhead nightclub with two men who were fatally stabbed. Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstruction of justice and was sentenced to probation. Lewis now speaks of his Christian faith and is one of the sport’s most popular players.

Thus far, many bloggers and others have laughed at Lewis’ comments. Considering his size and hitting ability, we won’t. Still, we decided to be game and, as Lewis advised, do some research. We tried to talk to the former Super Bowl MVP or one of his representatives, but our efforts were unsuccessful.

Our first thought was to look at past NFL work stoppages and see whether crime did increase.

In the Super Bowl era, there have been two work stoppages during the regular season. In 1982, the 16-game season was cut down to nine games because of a 57-day labor dispute from late September to mid-November. There was a 24-day strike in 1987.

We thought it would be more interesting to see whether there was an increase in crime in 1982 than 1987 because the work stoppage in the earlier year was almost two months long. The nation’s violent crime rate in 1982 was slightly lower than it was the year before the work stoppage, according to FBI crime data. The violent crime rate dropped more significantly the following year, the data show.

Northeastern’s Sport in Society center examined Lewis’ claim after a call from us and also focused on the 1982 NFL work stoppage. It, too, reached a similar conclusion.

""There is very little evidence supporting Lewis’ claim that crime will increase the longer the work stoppage lasts,"" the center told us.

The Baltimore Sun also looked at crime in 1982 and found an increase during the strike in only one category: homicides.

The Sun tried some other methods to tackle Lewis’ claim. The newspaper’s Crime Beat blog looked at crime data last season when the Ravens had their bye (off) week. The Sun found there was slightly more crime during the bye week.

The Sun looked at crime in Baltimore the four weeks before the season started and the first four weeks of the season. There was the same number of crimes. The Sun also examined the crime rate there at the end of the Ravens’ season and what happened afterward. What did it find? There was less crime after the season ended in early January.

The Sun stressed several times that its findings were unscientific.

We tried the Sun’s approach and examined Atlanta crime statistics during the Falcons’ bye. The Falcons’ bye weekend in 2010 was Sunday, Oct. 31, and Monday, Nov. 1, just like the Ravens’. Again, it may be unscientific, but the data do not help Lewis’ argument. They show crime declined around that time.

Two weeks beforehand (Oct. 17-23), there were 771 Part I offenses reported. Part I crimes include murder, rape, robbery, auto theft and aggravated assault. There were 755 of those crimes Oct. 24-30. Between Oct. 31 and Nov. 6, there were 736 of those crimes. There were 683 Part I crimes Nov. 7-13.

We decided against comparing crime from the last week of the Falcons’ season and the week after. The last week of the Falcons’ season was also the week a snow and ice storm kept much of the region’s population at home.

""[The storm] caused a decrease in crime, since there were very few people on the streets,"" Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said.

The FBI says crime typically decreases during football season, but it doesn’t see a correlation, according to a newspaper account provided to us by the Sport in Society center. The FBI believes criminals prefer to strike when the weather is warmer.

Some current and former NFL players have argued Lewis has a point, including his quarterback, Joe Flacco.

One criminologist we interviewed had a different take. Northeastern University professor James A. Fox heard Lewis’ comments and did a study. He looked at key FBI data from the last three years available, 2006 through 2008, focusing on the week before the Super Bowl because there were no games that week and there was intense interest in football around that time of the year. Fox, who was referred to us by the FBI, found no increase in crime the week there was no football.

""I took the Ray Lewis challenge and I don’t see any evidence of [a crime increase],"" said Fox, the author of several books on crime who also writes a crime and punishment blog for the Boston Globe.

We, too, took the challenge and found no substantive evidence that Lewis has a point. Hopefully, we won’t see this fall whether Lewis is right. For now, we’re throwing a flag on this claim. Our rating is False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE98A00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/17/ray-lewis/ray-lewis-crime-claim-gets-flagged/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Gov. Chris Christie blames Democratic tax, fee hikes for $70 billion in wealth leaving New Jersey
","
When Democratic governors were raising taxes and fees between 2004 and 2008, New Jerseyans took $70 billion of their wealth to other states, Gov. Chris Christie said recently at Princeton University.

Christie made that argument during his May 20 speech about the fiscal climate facing New Jersey. When government continues to increase the cost of living and residents subsequently can’t plan their own budgets, ""that’s when folks decide just to get up and leave,"" he said.

The governor went on to say that ""between 2004 and 2008, at the height of these tax increases and tax expansions and fee expansions in the state government under Jim McGreevey, Dick Codey and Jon Corzine, $70 billion of wealth left the state of New Jersey.

""That’s departed wealth, not diminished wealth because of the financial crisis. Departed wealth and departed predominantly to four states – Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania,"" Christie continued. ""What do all four of those states have in common? They all have lower taxes than New Jersey. All of them.""

PolitiFact New Jersey dug into Christie’s argument that tax hikes led to that migration of wealth, but first, let’s look at the source of the governor’s numbers.

The $70 billion figure comes from a January 2010 report on migrating households by a research center at Boston College. From 2004 to 2008, about $117 billion of wealth came into New Jersey and about $187 billion left the state, causing a net reduction of about $70 billion. So that number is right.

Christie is slightly off when it comes to the top four destination states of that departed wealth, according to the report.

Based on the percentage of departing households, the top four states were Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and North Carolina. Based on the percentage of wealth, the top four states were Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and California. Between those two measures, the governor is leaving out New York and California.

Christie, however, is right that New Jersey’s tax burden exceeds other states. New Jersey ranked the highest among states as of 2009 for the percentage of per-capita income spent on state and local taxes, according to the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation, a pro-business research group.

And from 2004 to 2008, New Jersey’s state-local tax burden increased every year.

Now, here’s the tougher question -- did New Jersey’s tax increases really chase away that $70 billion of wealth?

We asked Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts in two emails to provide evidence, but he never did.

""The Governor’s remarks concerning the study and his argument made concerning the impact of tax policies speak for themselves,"" Roberts wrote to us.

The Boston College study provides a mix of reasons for migration, based on federal data. Based on that analysis, family- and job-related matters topped the reasons for leaving New Jersey from 2004 to 2008.

PolitiFact New Jersey also reached out to three experts and consulted four other studies on migration, and a varied picture emerged of the impact of higher taxes.

A 2007 report from the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University said high taxes were among the reasons driving people from New Jersey. According to a 2008 report out of Princeton University, New Jerseyans move to states with lower property taxes and lower costs of living.

""Our conclusion is that migration out of New Jersey is based on the very high cost of housing in the state (of which property taxes are an element),"" Stanford University professor Cristobal Young, one of the authors of that 2008 report, wrote in an email. ""Retirement-based migration is also important, as shown by the large flows of people to Florida.""

Those studies support the argument that high taxes contribute to migration, but other research suggests the impact has been minimal. A recent study -- by Young and a Princeton graduate student -- reached that conclusion in regard to a 2004 tax increase on high income earners.

Joel Slemrod, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, who also found a minimal effect of taxes on migration in his own study, said the financial environment is just one aspect of many that people consider in where to live. Another factor is the quality of services in a given location, Slemrod said.

""You have to look at both sides of the government ledger,"" Slemrod said.

According to University of Massachusetts, Amherst professor Jeffrey Thompson, higher taxes don’t push people out of a state, because of the value placed on the services and the small nature of the tax increases when compared with moving costs.

But higher taxes also can keep people from moving into a state, Thompson said. If states use the additional tax revenue to create jobs and reduce crime, they can overcome the unattractiveness of the higher taxes, Thompson said.

Going back to Christie’s statement, let’s review:

The governor blamed Democratic tax hikes for chasing away $70 billion of wealth from 2004 to 2008. Christie was not completely accurate about the destination states for the departed wealth, leaving out New York and California.

Several experts agree higher taxes play a role in migration, but the governor’s spokesman couldn’t provide any specific evidence of that, and some research has found the impact to be minimal. The Boston College study -- the basis for Christie’s $70 billion figure -- also listed family- and job-related reasons as the main factors chasing people from New Jersey.

We rate Christie’s statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Mitt Romney']","
$500 billion from Medicare for Obamacare, Mitt Romney says
","
Mitt Romney keeps making the case that the health care plan he put into place in Massachusetts is substantially different from the health care law signed by President Barack Obama.

At a debate in New Hampshire on Monday June 13, 2011, Romney continued that theme. One difference was, he said, that his state plan didn't make any changes to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly.

""Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare,"" Romney said. 

We've written about how the health care law affects Medicare many times, but Romney made his point in a new way, so we decided to put his statement to the Truth-O-Meter.

To begin with, the Massachusetts plan and the federal plan are conceptually similar. Both leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering tax breaks to help people with moderate incomes buy insurance. Individuals are required to have insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the ""individual mandate."" And companies that don't offer insurance to employees have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. 

Romney's point was that the Massachusetts plan didn't change Medicare, the health insurance program for people over age 65. We should note that Medicare is a federal program; states can't change it anyway. So don't give the Massachusetts plan too much credit on the point. 
The national health care reform law, though, made several changes to Medicare, which makes up 12 percent of the federal budget.   
In a few cases, the law actually increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source that analyzes the health care system. For instance, the health care law added money to cover prevention services and to fill a gap for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. (That coverage gap is sometimes called the doughnut hole). 
Other provisions are designed to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage the program to operate more efficiently and to improve the delivery and quality of care, in ways including reducing hospital re-admissions. The bill doesn't take money out of the current Medicare budget but, rather, attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in anticipated spending increases over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. 

So while the health care law reduces the amount of future spending growth in Medicare, the law doesn't cut Medicare.

Still, where does the $500 billion in future savings come from?

Nearly $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in payments that health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. A new national board will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. Then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.

Romney said, ""Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare."" The law doesn't literally take money out of Medicare, but Romney isn't entirely wrong in his point, either.

That's because in creating the law, Democrats wanted to make sure they did not increase the federal deficit. The savings from Medicare offset new spending resulting from the health care bill. 

The major new spending in the bill comes from tax credits to help people of modest incomes buy health insurance and from expanding Medicaid to offer coverage to the poor. The tax credits and other cost-sharing subsidies are estimated to cost $350 billion over 10 years, while the Medicaid expansion costs $434 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Those two initiatives add up to more than $500 billion. So in addition to reducing Medicare spending, the law also increases Medicare taxes on the wealthy and creates new fees for the health care industry, as well as a few other things, to come up with the needed sums.

Romney said, ""Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare."" He's right that future savings from Medicare are planned to offset new costs created by the law. But the way he phrases it gives the impression that the law takes money that was already allocated to Medicare and funds the new health care law with it. In fact, the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Those savings are then applied to costs created by the law -- especially coverage for the uninsured -- so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEB7900>],/factchecks/2011/jun/16/mitt-romney/500-billion-medicare-obamacare-romney-says/
