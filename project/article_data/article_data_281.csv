More photos show crowds at other events, not Trump’s Tulsa rally
","""Don’t believe the leftist lies!"" warns a Facebook post showing three photos of crowds. ""Here are pictures from Trump’s Tulsa rally!!! This was an awesome turnout in spite of all of the threats of violence, threats of Covid, etc!!! MAGA!!!!!"" What you shouldn’t believe is this Facebook post, which was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ve already fact-checked a batch of photos wrongly claiming to show the crowd that gathered for President Donald Trump’s June 20 campaign rally at BOK Center in Tulsa, Okla. The images in this post are also being misused to make it look like Trump’s rally was packed, when the actual attendance was far lower than the campaign’s stated expectations. We used Google Images and TinEye to do reverse image searches of the photos in the Facebook post to figure out what they actually show.  The first photo is from a Trump rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds in July 2018.  The second photo is from a Trump rally in Manchester, N.H., in February 2020.  The third photo is from a rally in Lexington, Ky., in November 2019.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EDF340>],/factchecks/2020/jun/23/viral-image/more-photos-show-crowds-other-events-not-trumps-tu/

Instagram graph misleads on the racial breakdown of homicides
","Over the past few weeks, millions of people around the country have protested police brutality against black Americans. But a recent Instagram post says violence against African Americans isn’t as big a problem as activists say it is. On June 17, an account called Casual Libtard published a bar graph that purports to break down murders by race. The smallest bar, labeled ""0.77,"" is for blacks killed by whites. ""Black Lives Matter is b****ing about this?"" reads the title of the graph. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It has more than 5,500 likes, and the same graph has been widely shared in conservative Facebook groups. We’ve previously fact-checked graphs and statistics that mislead on the racial breakdown of homicides and ""black on black"" crime. So we wanted to take a closer look at this bar graph, which has been around since at least September 2017, when it was published on a meme-making website. We’re not sure what the numbers on the bar graph mean or what units they use, but the post is misleading in its comparison of four categories of homicides. While white-on-black murders were the most infrequent kind of homicide in 2013, the year the graph cites, the post underrepresents the proportion of white-on-white murders. It also doesn’t take into account the fact that, given their population size, black Americans are disproportionately killed by civilians and police. The purported source of the graph is a data table in the 2013 FBI Crime Report, which breaks down homicides by race. The graph correctly shows white-on-black murders are the rarest kind of homicide, but it misrepresents the relative frequency of white-on-white murders. According to the FBI’s 2013 data, whites killed by whites constituted the largest proportion of all homicides. The Instagram post wrongly suggests that black-on-black murders are five times more frequent than white-on-white murders. In 2013, they were about 11% less frequent.  The data confirm what homicide researchers have long known: most murder cases in which the race of the killer and the victim are known are intraracial — that is, they are of the same race. This was the case in 2013, according to FBI data.  ""Homicides overwhelmingly happen among people who know each other,"" David M. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, previously told PolitiFact. ""There are relatively few absolutely straight-up stranger homicides. Homicide is a phenomenon of social networks. ... Most people’s relationships are primarily with someone of their own race or ethnicity. As long as anybody has studied homicide, this has been the pattern."" (See the historical data.) That pattern still holds true. FBI homicide data for 2018, the last year the bureau published a full crime report, show that the vast majority of murders were intraracial. The Instagram post is correct to show that relatively few white Americans kill blacks. But what do homicide numbers look like when you account for population? Data for the race of the victim and offender in homicides isn’t shown for every case in the FBI’s crime reports. It is shown only in the cases in which the race was known (some murders are never solved) and in cases involving a single victim and defendant. When looking at homicides as a whole, vblack people are disproportionately victims. In 2018, they made up 52% of homicide victims, despite making up about 12.7% of the population. White people made up about 43% of homicide victims despite making up 72% of the population. The racial disparity is more stark for police shootings. In 2013, the Black Lives Matter movement started in response to police killings of African Americans. The Washington Post’s database of police shootings shows that, since 2015, nearly twice as many white people have been shot and killed by police as black people.  However, the data comes with a big caveat: As with civilian homicides, black Americans are killed by police at a higher rate than white Americans. ""They account for less than 13 percent of the U.S. population, but are killed by police at more than twice the rate of white Americans,"" the Post reported. ""Hispanic Americans are also killed by police at a disproportionate rate."" An Instagram post shows a bar graph comparing homicides for various racial groups. The graph purports to draw from 2013 FBI crime data. It accurately shows that white-on-black murders were the rarest kind of homicide that year, but the graph misrepresents the relative frequency of white-on-white murders, which constituted the largest proportion of all homicides. Experts say most homicides are intraracial. The Black Lives Matter movement started in response to police killings of black Americans. When accounting for population and homicides as a whole, blacks are killed by civilians and police at a higher rate than white Americans. The Instagram post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1D8CC0>],/factchecks/2020/jun/23/instagram-posts/instagram-graph-misleads-racial-breakdown-homicide/

No, NASCAR didn’t say noose found in Bubba Wallace’s garage was an automotive belt
","A noose was recently found in the garage stall of Black driver Bubba Wallace during a NASCAR race at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama.  The incident occurred just weeks after Wallace — who is the only fulltime Black driver in NASCAR’s Cup Series — painted his car in a Black Lives Matter scheme for a race and successfully helped push NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag at its events and facilities. NASCAR issued a statement saying it’s launching an immediate investigation. The FBI and U.S. Justice Department said they are also looking into it.  But one Facebook user claims that these investigations are apparently already over, sharing a purported announcement from NASCAR that Wallace confused a circular serpentine automotive belt for a noose. The post, made to look like a screenshot of a news report, reads: ""Talladega, Ala. – NASCAR said a serpentine belt was confused as a noose in Bubba Wallace’s garage stall at Talladega Speedway in Alabama on Sunday. Wallace, who is from Mobile, is the only Black driver in the Cup Series In a statement released Sunday night, NASCAR said, ‘Late this afternoon, NASCAR was made aware that something that resembled a noose was found in the garage stall of the 43 team. We were angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we took this allegation. We launched an immediate investigation, and determined Bubba Wallace had mistaken a 26"" serpentine automotive belt for a noose.’"" In the caption, the user wrote: ""What a moron! Can’t drive and don’t even know what a serpentine belt is. Get everybody all stirred up over your stupidity AGAIN!!!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  NASCAR made no such announcement. The post was manipulated to make it look like a NASCAR statement.  Despite its appearance as a news story, the supposed development has not been reported by any news organization. The most we could find was this unsourced photo on social media.   The faux statement contains some similarities to the real one that NASCAR released on June 21, but it also has notable differences, particularly the omission of a serpentine belt.  pic.twitter.com/aArKg0Tq3c Wallace released his own statement, and in a show of support, dozens of drivers and crew members pushed Wallace in his car to the front of the field during pre-race activities on June 22. A Facebook post says NASCAR announced that Wallace mistook a serpentine automotive belt as a noose. This isn’t accurate. NASCAR has made no such statement as investigations continue.  We rate this Pants on Fire! (Update: On June 23, 2020, NASCAR released a subsequent statement about the incident. It read: ""The FBI has completed its investigation at Talladega Superspeedway and determined that Bubba Wallace was not the target of a hate crime. The FBI report concludes, and photographic evidence confirms, that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall. This was obviously well before the 43 team’s arrival and garage assignment. We appreciate the FBI’s quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn that this was not an intentional, racist act against Bubba. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all who love racing."")",[<zip object at 0x000002809C244100>],/factchecks/2020/jun/22/facebook-posts/no-nascar-didnt-say-noose-found-bubba-wallaces-gar/

Photos show crowds at other events, not Trump’s Tulsa rally
","During President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa on June 20, news cameras occasionally panned to the upper levels of the BOK Center, where he was speaking, to reveal rows of empty seats. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence canceled plans to address supporters outside of the arena as outdoor overflow crowds failed to materialize. The New York Times reported the president was stunned by the empty arena tiers, and a Tulsa official said 6,200 people were in an arena that had a 19,000-seat capacity. Social media accounts are telling a different story.  ""The media won’t show this!"" begins one post featuring several photos of crowds. ""They are saying the place was empty! Puullease!! Lots of people!!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) With good reason. The first photo shows Trump during a rally at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Ind., in 2018.  The second photo and fourth photo have been online since 2016, when Trump appeared at a rally in Florida.  The third photo is from a Trump rally in Orlando in 2019.  The fifth photo is from a January 2020 rally in New Jersey.  The sixth photo does show Trump on the floor of the rally in Tulsa. And, finally, we couldn’t find the original version of the seventh photo in the Facebook post.

Instagram post shares misleading information about 8 companies, prison labor
","An Instagram post called for a boycott of companies that it claimed ""use prison labor."" It specifically calls out eight companies: Whole Foods, McDonald’s, Walmart, Victoria’s Secret, AT&T, Bank of America, Starbucks and Wendy’s. The caption on the June 2 Instagram post said: ""Through a loophole in the 13th Amendment, slavery has survived via mandatory unpaid prison labor as ‘punishment for crime.’ These are just a few of the big companies exploiting prison labor."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Instagram is owned by Facebook. The Instagram account links to a Ranker.com story, which lists the companies in the post and several others such as IBM, Target and Verizon. The story, headlined ""49 Large American Companies That Use Prison Labor,"" cites news reports for each of the companies it mentions. It notes some companies that had used prison labor no longer do. In this fact-check, we’ll focus on the eight companies mentioned in the Instagram post. Overall, the post misleads by providing outdated or incorrect information for most companies. A report by the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization that advocates against mass incarceration and other social justice issues, said that the majority of incarcerated people have institutional maintenance jobs, such as cooking, laundry or janitorial duties; and about 4% work a corrections-industry job, producing goods or services for an outside vendor, most commonly the U.S. government or state universities and colleges. (The report cites 2017 incarceration data). The Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program, created by Congress under a 1979 law, allows private companies to enter into contracts with corrections agencies to use inmate labor. A 2018 U.S. Justice Department overview of the program said inmates are paid a ""prevailing local wage,"" although corrections departments are allowed to deduct up to 80% of inmates’ gross wages for ""room and board, taxes (such as federal, state, and FICA), family support, and crime victim compensation/assistance."" Participation under that program is voluntary for inmates and helps them gain skills they can use after their prison release, according to the Justice Department. What about the 13th Amendment reference in the Instagram post? The 13th Amendment says neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist in the United States, ""except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."" Netflix in 2016 released ""13th,"" an Oscar-nominated documentary on racial inequality in the United States with the focus of mass incarceration and its connection to slavery. ""Across the U.S., millions of prisoners are forced to work and are paid a pittance for it — or nothing. Conditions can be harsh, and prison workers lack most labor protections,"" said a post paid by Netflix and created by the brand marketing arm of The New York Times. The paid post said the U.S. incarcerated population is disproportionately black ""and social researchers describe our prison system and its supply of ‘free labor’ as a new form of slavery."" We contacted the eight companies called out by the Instagram post. Six rejected the claim that they use prison labor, said they’ve stopped selling products made by inmates, or said they ended their relationship with companies that used their labor. One of them, Walmart, said some of its suppliers do use voluntary prison labor. McDonald’s did not get back to us, but we found no evidence that it actively relies on prison labor. Whole Foods A spokesperson for Whole Foods Market, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc., said the company stopped selling any products made with the use of prison labor in April 2016. Whole Foods said its Supplier Code of Conduct prohibits the use of prison or inmate labor. Victoria’s Secret The lingerie company said it does not use prison labor for any aspect of its operation, or use or sell any products or services that come from companies that use prison labor. Victoria’s Secret said that in the 1980s, it learned that one of its vendors, Third Generation, hired prison inmates to make some of its apparel, and it ended that relationship as a result of that finding. ""Since that violation of our Code of Conduct nearly 40 years ago, we have not had any instances of our partners across our supply chain using inmate labor, as we do not tolerate such behavior,"" Victoria’s Secret said in a statement. AT&T AT&T said it does not use prison labor and holds its suppliers to the same standard. Starbucks Starbucks said it does not use prison or forced labor of any kind and has a zero-tolerance policy on the use of prison, child  or forced labor by suppliers. The policy also applies to contractors and subcontractors, the company said. ""Starbucks has had relationships, in the past, with suppliers that used inmate labor. However, at this time, none of the suppliers we contract with engage in the practice, and our Supplier Social Responsibility Standards have been in place since 2006,"" Starbucks said in a June 4 tweet. Wendy’s ""We have no reason to believe that this is accurate,"" Wendy’s said about the Instagram post. ""The Wendy’s Company does not employ prison labor."" Wendy’s also pointed to its Supplier Code of Conduct, which says, ""our suppliers should not utilize or engage with factories or production facilities that force work to be performed by unpaid or indentured laborers, or those who must otherwise work against their will."" Bank of America A spokesperson for Bank of America said the company does not use prison labor. The Ranker.com story cited in the Instagram post connected Bank of America to prison labor by noting the bank’s past support for the American Legislative Exchange Council. It described ALEC as an organization that ""has promoted prison labor and helped pass laws to increase inmate manufacturing for private corporations."" However, Ranker.com said that Bank of America cut ties with that organization in 2012. Walmart Walmart said its supplier standards ""strictly prohibit involuntary prison labor"" and that a review of its records did not find that the businesses managing and processing its returns are using involuntary prison labor. ""As permitted by law, a small number of our U.S. suppliers use voluntary labor as part of prison rehabilitation programs,"" Walmart said in a statement. ""These voluntary programs pay the inmates prevailing wages and provide positive, private sector job training and marketable skills to help them integrate back into society and gain meaningful employment as they exit the criminal justice system."" Walmart said that as part of racial equity initiatives it announced this month, it will review its policies on the programs ""to understand what, if any, role they should play going forward."" McDonald’s McDonald’s did not respond to our query. The Ranker.com story said McDonald’s uniforms ""are manufactured by prisoners through a subcontractor that relies on Oregon inmates."" Ranker.com cited a 2015 Thrillist.com story that made a similar claim. That story, in turn, linked to a 2010 post on DailyKos.com that said McDonald’s is not ""‘directly’ using inmate labor in their food service operations,"" but got its uniforms from a company that used prison labor.  We did not find contemporary information substantiating whether McDonald’s gets its uniforms from a company that uses prison labor. The report from the Quaker group said McDonald’s and other large corporations ""have been exposed by the media as using prison labor through their respective supply chains, however each stopped contracting with those private companies when the information was made public."" An Instagram post said, ""Companies that use prison labor: Whole Foods, McDonald’s, Walmart, Victoria’s Secret, AT&T, Bank of America, Starbucks, Wendy’s."" Whole Foods, Victoria’s Secret, AT&T, Bank of America, Starbucks, and Wendy’s told PolitiFact that they do not use prison labor or rely on suppliers that do. Walmart said it has some suppliers that use voluntary inmate labor. McDonald’s did not provide information and we found no  confirmation that it uses prison labor or contracts companies that hire inmates. The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No evidence tying Bill Gates to a $100 billion COVID-19 deal before the outbreak
","An article shared widely on Facebook claims a COVID-19 conspiracy with this headline: ""Six Months Before The Covid Plandemic, Bill Gates Had Negotiated A $100 Billion Contact Tracing Deal With Democratic Congressman Sponsor Of Bill."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could find no evidence to back up the claim. The term ""plandemic"" became widely known in May from a 26-minute conspiracy video called, ""Plandemic: The Hidden Agenda Behind COVID-19."" It was viewed tens of millions of times before YouTube and Facebook removed it. We fact-checked eight of the most misleading claims in the video, which is a deep dive into conspiracy theories about COVID-19, public health and figures such as Gates. The claim we’re checking here is from an article shared from the website of Rangitikei Environmental Health Watch. That article is actually an excerpt of an article by conservative website TruePundit.  Both articles cite an interview given by private investigators John Moynihan and Larry Doyle on a TruePundit podcast in which the investigators said that representatives from the Gates Foundation met with U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., in Rwanda, East Africa, in mid August 2019 ""to hash out who would score the windfall from a government contact tracing program."" The article points out that, in May, Rush introduced the $100 billion Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act to fight the coronavirus. Our searches of Google and Nexis turned up no reports of a meeting in Rwanda between Rush and the Gates Foundation. A philanthropic organization interested in issues of global health and education, the Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential novel coronavirus vaccines. But there is no evidence that the foundation stands to profit from these efforts. Moynihan and Doyle previously claimed to have found financial wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation. But when appearing before a House hearing in December 2018, they refused to submit what they said were 6,000 pages of documents. As we’ve reported, the Trace Act was introduced by Rush in May. It would provide $100 billion in grants in the current fiscal year to faith-based organizations, clinics, medical centers and other organizations that perform testing for COVID–19, do contact tracing or provide services for individuals who are isolating at home.  Contact tracing is a process that tasks public health workers with learning as much as they can about whom an infected patient has been in contact with, so they can be notified about their potential exposure. The bill stands a 4% chance of passage, according to a service used by GovTrack.us., which tracks federal legislation. The Gates Foundation sent PolitiFact this response: ""This claim is false.""  We didn’t get replies from the two investigators or from Rush. An article shared widely on Facebook claimed: ""Six months before the COVID ‘plandemic,’ Bill Gates had negotiated a $100 billion contact tracing deal with (the) Democratic congressman sponsor of bill."" There is no evidence of Gates collaborating on the bill, which would provide $100 billion to faith-based organizations, clinics, medical centers and other organizations that perform COVID-19 testing, conduct contact tracing or provide services for individuals who are isolating at home.  We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A5E00>],/factchecks/2020/jun/22/facebook-posts/no-evidence-tying-bill-gates-100-billion-covid-19-/

Obama Foundation didn’t post image of George Floyd protest sign before he died
","In the wake of George Floyd’s death, a Facebook post questions why a tweet from the Obama Foundation, posted before he died on May 25, displays a protest sign with Floyd’s image on it.  The June 7 Facebook post is a screenshot of a tweet, dated May 16, congratulating the graduating class of 2020. The tweet says, ""#GraduateTogether #Classof2020, are you ready to lead in your community? Join us at obama.org.""  ""This picture is from the Obama Foundation. It was posted May 16th, 2020,"" the Facebook post says. ""George Floyd was killed May 25th, 2020. Why was The Obama Foundation posting this picture of George Floyd before he died?"" A spokesperson for the Obama Foundation told PolitiFact that the photo with the George Floyd protest sign was a preview image for the foundation’s website, obama.org. The photo was taken May 30 and first used on the site on May 31, according to the spokesperson.  How could this photo be attached to a tweet posted before Floyd’s death? To understand that, it helps to know how Twitter handles the images that appear with some tweets. Twitter allows certain certified account holders to designate a preset image, called a card, to appear automatically with tweets that include a link to the website associated with their accounts. According to Twitter Developer, Twitter’s computers scour sites on the Internet every week or so to check for updates to these designated images. When those computers recognize a change from a site’s owner, Twitter updates the image on all the tweets linking to that site — including past ones.  The protest image appeared on obama.org, without a photo credit, on May 31 with an Obama Foundation press release about organizations that are working to end systemic racism and police brutality in the United States. (A reverse-image search didn’t turn up any earlier appearances of the photo on the Internet.) When the foundation designated that image as its card for obama.org, the image began to appear on Twitter with its earlier tweets also. It’s similar to the way, say, Facebook shows a user’s current profile picture with a post. When users change their profile pictures, the new one appears alongside future posts, and past ones. But unlike Twitter, Facebook doesn’t retroactively apply the preset images that are associated with websites. So, any Facebook post from mid-May that includes a link to the Obama Foundation’s website would continue to show whatever image was set as the site’s card at that time. A Facebook post claims that a tweet from the Obama Foundation appears with a photo from a George Floyd protest before Floyd’s death.  The photo was not part of the tweet when it was posted. It was a preview image associated with the Obama Foundation website that Twitter applied retroactively to tweets linking to obama.org.  We rate this statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097800E00>],/factchecks/2020/jun/22/facebook-posts/obama-foundation-didnt-post-image-george-floyd-pro/

Yes, the 1942 Milwaukee YMCA brochure featured a racist carnival game
","The black-and-white photo from long ago leaves a jarring impression in 2020.  Below a carnival banner that proclaims ""HIT THE (n-word) BABY,"" a group of young, white boys are seen hurling objects at a blackened, shadowy target. This picture has been widely viewed on Facebook, including a post from June 12, 2020, that has been shared more than 9,000 times. ""This image is authentic and shows a 1942 YMCA brochure for Camp Minikani, a children’s summer camp in Wisconsin,"" the post says. The post goes on to describe a carnival game in which participants hurl objects at a human target. The more than 1,000 comments include many expressing shock and disgust, while others wondered if the image is legitimate. One comment we saw suggested it had been doctored to inflame racial tensions. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Is the picture real? And is the description accurate to attribute it to a Wisconsin youth camp brochure? Time for a disgraceful history lesson. It’s an ugly topic, but it’s one that’s important to examine to both understand the long-running nature and impact of systemic racism — even through childhood games — and to acknowledge how the mindset behind it lingers today.  ""We can use the past to inform how we got to where we are, and then use that as a tool to educate us about the challenges we continue to face,"" said Reggie Jackson, historian and head griot, or storyteller, at America’s Black Holocaust Museum, located in Milwaukee. ""As we do build toward racial repair and reconciliation, these are some of the things we need to be aware of that we’re fighting against, those mindsets that are still way more common than they need to be."" The picture is real — and it comes from the cited YMCA brochure. The text of the Facebook post is actually a direct quote (without attribution) from a 2018 factcheck by Snopes.com, which rated True a claim that a game by that name was once a popular fairground attraction. The game went by the name on the banner, as well as ""African Dodger,"" ""The Black Dodger"" and an array of other labels we won’t repeat here. Participants got three throws with a ball or egg to try to hit a target. Sometimes that target was a picture or model of a Black man, but often it was a real person, hired to play the role of the ""dodger."" The game was highlighted in the 1942 brochure for Camp Minikani, a camp in Washington County owned then and now by the YMCA of Greater Milwaukee. The camp was established in 1919 and remains in use. The four-page brochure is on display at the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia in Michigan, and was included in the 2019 book ""Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the rise of Jim Crow."" The game is featured on the brochure’s last page, which promotes ""Special Events"" such as an all-camp carnival. Carrie Wall, president and CEO of the Milwaukee YMCA, called it ""a part of our history that we are not proud of."" ""The image of this cruel ‘game’ horrifies and disgusts us,"" Wall said in a statement. ""As an organization, we are committed to diversity, inclusion, and equity for all. We can’t hide from our past, but only pledge to be better every day since."" The question from today’s perspective is how a game in this vein could be so normalized. An article on the game on the Jim Crow Museum website said it was ""as commonplace in local fairs, carnivals and circuses as Ferris wheels and roller coasters are today."" Newspaper clippings showed it in use at events hosted by churches and schools. ""The idea that African Americans were sub-humans was prevalent and widely accepted,"" said the article, by museum multimedia specialist Franklin Hughes.  Pop culture was rife with mentions of the game. A video compilation from the Jim Crow Museum shows clips featuring Popeye the Sailor (1933) and Donald Duck (no date) playing versions of the game, and it was the central theme of a 1931 movie called ""The African Dodger."" Department stores even sold an at-home table version of the game. Newspapers from the early 1900s often mentioned the game. Some advertised for ""dodgers"" to play the role of target, and one account detailed a man hospitalized after participants brought their own weighted balls to use. A viral Facebook post says a picture of white boys playing a racist carnival game comes from a 1942 brochure for a Milwaukee-area YMCA camp. Museum archives and other research confirms the picture is authentic and comes from a brochure for Camp Minikani. The barbaric game was widely played from the 1800s into the mid-1900s, prevalent at all manner of fairs and carnivals, as well as in the media of the time.

There’s no proof ‘Aunt Jemima’ was a millionaire
","When Nancy Green, the inspiration for Aunt Jemima, passed away in 1923, it would have been newsworthy had she died as one of America’s first black millionaires. Green had been enslaved in Kentucky until after the Civil War.  But we can’t find any evidence for such a claim. The claim is made in an image shared in a June 17 Facebook post from Peggy Hubbard, a black Republican and former U.S. Senate candidate. Her post has been shared more than 186,000 times.

She was the first woman hired as the Aunt Jemima and died ""as one of America’s first black millionaires."" Quaker Oats Co. announced June 17 it will remove the image of Aunt Jemima from its packaging and change the name of the more than 130-year-old brand, saying:  ""We recognize Aunt Jemima's origins are based on a racial stereotype. While work has been done over the years to update the brand in a manner intended to be appropriate and respectful, we realize those changes are not enough."" The announcement came in the aftermath of the Minneapolis police brutality death on May 25 of George Floyd. The picture that emerges about Green’s work as Aunt Jemima is that it helped provide her a comfortable living, but did not set her up as wealthy. At least, we couldn’t find any evidence of it. Fact-checkers Snopes also researched this claim and came up empty-handed. And Green’s Wikipedia page, which is presented as the source of the claim, makes no mention of her being a millionaire.  Green was the inspiration for the first Aunt Jemima and served as the face of the brand for more than 100 years, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. She was born in 1834 and enslaved until the war ended, when she moved to Chicago. She connected with flour manufacturers there and later did a pancakes demonstration at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.  A video biography says Green funded programs to fight poverty in Chicago, but there is no other reference to her wealth. A story by KYTV-TV in Lexington, Ky., said Green ""gained financial freedom and used the money to help her community."" Women’s Health magazine makes no reference to Green’s wealth. Several experts told us they are aware of no evidence that Green was a millionaire. They include: Kenneth Janken, professor in the Department of African, African American, and Diaspora Studies at the University of North Carolina; Shane White, a University of Sydney history professor and author of a book on America’s first Black Wall Street millionaire; David Pilgrim, the Ferris State University Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia founder and director; Fred Opie, a professor of history and foodways at Babson College; Rutgers University-Newark African-American and African Studies professor John Keene; and culinary author historian Adrian Miller. ""Unless her family had something passed down, it’s hard to believe that she became a millionaire,"" Patricia Turner, professor of African American Studies and World Arts and Culture at UCLA, told PolitiFact.  ""She was probably paid more than she had been as a cook. She was likely able to lead a middle-class black life, being a supporter of her church and other causes, own a home,"" Turner said. But ""there was no reason for the company to pay her that well. They could easily hire other black women."" Social media posts say Green, the first Aunt Jemima model, died ""as one of America’s first black millionaires."" There’s no evidence Green was a millionaire, and experts say they know of none.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2FB140>],/factchecks/2020/jun/22/facebook-posts/theres-no-proof-aunt-jemima-was-millionaire/

GOP renews line against McMurray’s work, and it’s still wrong
","    Republican Chris Jacobs, running for Congress in New York’s 27th District, uses a familiar line of attack against his opponent, Democrat Nate McMurray. The Jacobs ad, ""Steals,"" says: ""As a lawyer working in Korea, Nate McMurray helped send American jobs to Asia, supporting trade agreements costing us thousands of jobs. McMurray even helped American companies hire foreign workers.""  Just two years ago, when Rep. Chris Collins campaigned against McMurray, the Collins camp sent direct mail to voters with the claim ""Nate McMurray lobbied to send our jobs to China. (And Korea, too.)"" Voters in all or part of eight counties in Western New York cast their ballots in a special election on June 23. We wanted to fact-check this persistent claim, specifically that ""As a lawyer working in Korea, Nate McMurray helped send American jobs to Asia."" McMurray worked in Asia as a corporate lawyer from 2006 to 2013, first in China, then in Korea. In Korea, he helped foreign companies invest there and resolve employment issues.  We reached out to the Jacobs campaign about the ad, and received information regarding McMurray’s involvement with a chamber of commerce when he worked as a lawyer in Korea, as well as a list of news articles that detailed how companies moved operations to Asia, or established new operations there.  The Jacobs campaign says that in 2011, McMurray was a vice chairman of the Foreign Investment Committee of The American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, which we verified through a document from the chamber. The chamber paid roughly $30,000 to lobby for the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, according to a 2011 U.S. Senate Lobbying Report, provided by Jacobs.  In their memo on the ad, the GOP campaign also sent articles that stated that the U.S.-Korea trade deal from 2012, supported by the chamber, led to a more than doubling of the U.S. goods trade deficit, according to Reuters, and ""more than 95,000 lost U.S. jobs,"" according to an analysis from the union-backed Economic Policy Institute in 2016. (The White House said in 2018 that the goods trade deficit grew by 75 percent under the 2012 agreement.) The biggest source of the trade deficit was related to car sales, according to Vox in 2018.  The Jacobs memo also has links to articles about Western New York companies that moved their operations, though many of these moves happened before the trade deal took effect in March 2012, or the work went to countries other than South Korea. These examples included American Axle closing its Cheektowaga plant in 2011, and Ford laying off 150 workers at its Buffalo stamping plant, also in 2011. Also on the list was New Era’s shutdown of its Derby plant in 2019, and its move to manufacturing in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Haiti, as well as an operation in Miami. In another example from the memo, New Era opened an office in South Korea around 2013, leading to retail stores there.         The Jacobs campaign’s argument is that because McMurray was a co-chair of a committee in the chamber, he had something to do with the chamber’s lobbying activities in favor of the U.S.-Korea trade agreement.  But in 2011, the chamber had around 2,000 individual members and 1,000 member companies. In 2018, McMurray’s campaign told us that McMurray did not participate in lobbying activities.  As a lawyer in Korea, McMurray helped American companies enter the Korean market, according to Thomas Pinansky, a former partner at Barun Law in Seoul. Pinansky recruited McMurray and spoke to PolitiFact in 2018.   McMurray helped American companies succeed in the Korean market, historically a difficult market to penetrate, Pinansky said. ""He would have no authority to export jobs, U.S. jobs overseas,"" he said.  Two years ago, McMurray’s former campaign manager told us about McMurray’s work as a lawyer in Asia, and said: ""In none of these positions did he have the authority to outsource any jobs.""  When PolitiFact fact-checked a claim that McMurray ""lobbied to send our jobs"" to China and Korea, we found it to be False.   Repeating a talking point from the Collins campaign, the Jacobs campaign took aim at McMurray for his previous job that it says helped send American jobs to Asia. This claim is becoming an old chestnut on the campaign trail whenever McMurray is on the ballot. We rated it False when the Collins campaign made it. And nothing Jacobs says now is making it any more credible. McMurray was one of thousands of members of a business association that supported the U.S.-Korea trade agreement, which took effect in March 2012. After the trade deal took effect, the trade deficit grew. But nothing Jacobs provided showed that McMurray was responsible for American jobs moving to Asia, whether it was New Era moving their manufacturing offshore, but not to Korea, or New Era seeking to sell their products in retail stores in Korea, or American Axle closing its Cheektowaga plant months before U.S.-Korea trade deal even took effect. It was False two years ago. And it remains False now.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280971CA8C0>],/factchecks/2020/jun/20/chris-jacobs/gop-renews-line-against-mcmurrays-work-and-its-sti/

No, Osama bin Laden did not endorse Joe Biden
","It’s Father’s Day weekend. What do you get for a very wealthy man who also occupies the Oval Office? Donald Trump Jr. had something for his father: A scrap of text from the seized documents of Osama bin Laden, the former head of al Qaeda, mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, killed by U.S. special operations forces in 2011. In an interview with President Donald Trump, Trump Jr. unveiled a passage describing bin Laden’s desire to kill President Barack Obama. ""He wanted to assassinate President Obama because it would put Joe Biden in charge, and essentially he's so grossly incompetent, it would lead to the destruction of America,"" Trump Jr. said June 18 on his YouTube program ""Triggered."" ""What does it say to you, that basically the Democrat nominee for president of the United States got the posthumous Osama bin Laden endorsement?"" The father and son were engaging in a bit of political theater, because Trump senior said that if it was true, he’d make a commercial around it. ""It’s true,"" Trump Jr. said. ""OK, we speak the truth,"" Trump said. And then they played the ad, which contrasted Trump and Biden. Fighter jets and endorsements from veterans and firefighters symbolized Trump.  ""Joe Biden endorsed by Osama bin Laden"" was the line about Biden. Here, we examine whether there’s any truth to that. Here’s the accurate part of that exchange. During the years bin Laden was holed up in his compound in Pakistan, he still sought to cripple American power in the Middle East. When American special operations forces raided bin Laden’s compound in 2011, on Obama’s orders, they found a trove of computer files. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence translated and published the last of that material in 2017. Among the many memos was one where bin Laden called for the assassination of Obama. ""Obama is the head of infidelity, and killing him automatically will make Biden take over the presidency,"" bin Laden wrote, according to a 2012 Washington Post article. ""Biden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis."" Now, this plot never went far, and officials said this never posed a real risk to Obama. But bin Laden had a poor opinion of Biden. The Oxford Dictionary defines endorsement as the ""act of giving one's public approval or support to someone or something."" Politicians seek endorsements all the time, and roll them out at strategic moments in their campaigns to win more votes. An endorsement is a positive statement that speaks to a candidate’s good qualities. Political scientist Janine Parry at the University of Arkansas said Trump Jr.’s use of the term doesn’t ""pass the smell test"" for two reasons. First, ""declaring someone ‘totally unprepared’ for the job is the opposite of an endorsement by any definition,"" Parry said. ""A close second is bin Laden’s stated goal that a Biden presidency would lead the U.S. into a crisis. This, too, is the antithesis of an endorsement by any standard."" Through a political-science lens, bin Laden’s words don’t constitute an endorsement. ""To be persuasive, endorsements need to come from endorsers who are both knowledgeable and trustworthy,"" Hofstra University political scientist Craig Burnett said. ""I strongly suspect that, for most people, bin Laden fails on both counts."" Trump Jr.’s statement, reinforced by the campaign ad, makes the further stretch that bin Laden was somehow weighing in on the choice between Trump and Biden. Bin Laden has been dead for nine years. If creating a crisis in the U.S. was his goal, we can’t know which candidate in 2020 he would prefer. Trump Jr. said bin Laden endorsed Biden. Bin Laden said Biden was unprepared for the presidency. That is the exact opposite of an endorsement. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096614040>],/factchecks/2020/jun/19/donald-trump-jr/no-osama-bin-laden-did-not-endorse-joe-biden/

Trump shares manipulated toddler video targeting CNN
","President Donald Trump shared a manipulated video on Twitter that claimed CNN aired fake headlines and lied about the relationship between two toddlers in order to stoke racial tension. The video, which Twitter marked with a ""manipulated media"" label, displays the CNN logo and a banner that says, ""Terrified todler (sic) runs from racist baby,"" as a black toddler runs down a sidewalk and a white toddler runs after him. The banner switches to ""Racist baby probably voted for Trump."" The video then fades to black and text appears on the screen that reads, ""This is what really happened,"" before showing the full video of the boys excitedly running toward each other and embracing.  It concludes with text that says, ""America is not the problem. Fake News is. If you see something, say something. Only you can prevent fake news dumpster fires."" Trump shared a deceptively edited video. CNN never ran those headlines, and it accurately covered the story in 2019. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Trump, because he is a politician, is exempt from Facebook’s policies against sharing false or misleading information. But other people online have shared the same video, and they are not exempt from the Facebook fact-checking program. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The video of the toddlers — Maxwell and Finnegan — was taken in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City and was posted on Facebook in September 2019 by Michael Cisneros, Maxwell’s father. The clip quickly went viral, and the boys and their parents appeared on various shows, including a CNN broadcast and the Ellen DeGeneres Show.  Several media outlets, CNN included, accurately covered the story and showed the full video of the boys hugging and then running down the sidewalk. Cisneros told CNN last year that the boys are best friends and that he posted the video because it was a beautiful moment to share in the midst of racism and hate in the world.  In response to Trump’s post, Cisneros wrote in a Facebook post, ""HE WILL NOT TURN THIS LOVING, BEAUTIFUL VIDEO TO FURTHER HIS HATE AGENDA!!!!!!"" ""Utterly shocked. Trump posted this on his Twitter. For all you Trump supporters, I hope that his use of their beautiful video in this way disgusts you. It should,"" Finnegan’s mom, Erica Russo McKenna, said on Facebook. The manipulated video includes a watermark for a Twitter account called @CapreDonktum, which routinely creates and posts satirical memes and parody videos.  A CNN spokesperson also responded to Trump’s post on Twitter.

No, Tim Tebow didn’t kneel during the national anthem
","President Donald Trump is continuing to stand firm in his opposition to anyone kneeling for the national anthem, saying he ""won’t be watching"" if athletes decide to take a knee on gameday. ""OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high,"" Trump posted on Twitter. ""We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!"" Trump has gone as far as to call for NFL players who kneel to be fired by NFL owners. But a post on social media cries hypocrisy, saying Trump and others have targeted their criticism at African American players like Colin Kaepernick, while giving a white player who did the same thing, Tim Tebow, a pass. Tebow ""kneeled in protest of abortion during the National Anthem in 2012.

It actually took on a name, ""Tebowing,"" which the University of Florida Heisman Trophy winner went on to trademark. ""It's something I do that's prayer for me, and then it got hyped up as Tebowing. So I think (it's) just to control how it's used, as well. Make sure it's used in the right way."" The Broncos’ 2011 season ended with a playoff loss in January 2012.

Job openings in Texas match the number of people on unemployment
","Gov. Greg Abbott followed 18 other Republican governors on Monday by rejecting federal pandemic unemployment benefits.  In a press release, a tweet and an appearance on Fox News, Abbott justified the decision by citing two figures that he argued illustrate the state’s post-pandemic economic recovery. First, there are more job vacancies than people receiving unemployment benefits; and second, the number of job openings in the state today is significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.   ""I had the Texas Workforce Commission dig into the numbers and provide me with the numbers, and here they are,"" Abbott told Fox News host Bill Hemmer on Tuesday. ""We now have more job openings than we do people who are on unemployment. We have 60% more job openings today than we did the month before the pandemic hit the state of Texas.""  Abbott’s decision, which goes into effect June 26, will cut $300 weekly payments to unemployed Texans by ending the state’s participation in the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program. Abbott also ended the state’s participation in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provided self-employed people with aid throughout the pandemic.  As of March, the unemployment rate in Texas stood at 6.9%, or nearly 970,000 people, which is down from the pandemic high of 13% in April 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Texas Workforce Commission reports that 1,029,890 million Texans are currently receiving unemployment payments; about 31% of them are receiving aid as self-employed workers.  The state’s withdrawal from the federal benefits programs comes at the urging of business leaders, who said that 60% of Texas businesses were hiring for at least one position and blamed their hiring struggles on the $300 weekly aid payments. But are there more job vacancies in the state than unemployed people, as Abbott claims? And how does the number of job openings today compare to pre-pandemic levels?  The Texas Workforce Commission, which provided Abbott with a job vacancy estimate at his request, explained how they determined this figure.   According to a spokesperson, the state workforce agency found that a combined 850,000 jobs had been posted to the agency’s two state-run job boards — WorkinTexas.com and MyTXCareer.com. Then, using third-party software, the agency combined this total with the number of Texas job listings posted to private job boards like Indeed and Monster.com.  ""The exact point of the software is to determine the number of jobs without double counting, since most jobs are posted on multiple sites,"" said Workforce Commission spokesperson James Bernsen.  According to this methodology, there were about 1,022,000 job postings in Texas as of May 11, which is slightly less than the total number of people currently receiving unemployment benefits.   But the job vacancy total comes with one caveat, Bernsen said. Because a single job posting may have more than one job vacancy associated with it, the total number may be ""a bit deceptive,"" he said. However, the agency didn’t provide an estimate for how this caveat may affect the 1,022,000 total.  Turning to Abbott’s second claim — that the state has 60% more job openings today than in February 2020 — we look again at data from the Texas Workforce Commission.   Using the same methodology that determined the present number of job openings, the Texas Workforce Commission found that about 645,000 jobs were available across the state’s job boards and private job boards in February 2020. That’s a 58.4% increase between the February 2020 number and the 1,022,000 job vacancies recorded on May 11.  Critics argue that low wages are to blame for employers' hiring difficulties rather than the $300 weekly unemployment payments.   Rick Levy, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, a pro-labor group, has called Abbott’s analysis too simplistic, and says that these computer-generated statistics ignore barriers to employment people continue to face.   ""A bunch of business people said they wanted this to happen, and that’s why this is happening,"" Levy said. ""And now [the governor’s office is] going back and backfilling their reason with this computerized approach.""  Abbott said on Fox News that he directed the Workforce Commission to ""dig into the numbers and provide me with"" job market data. We asked for a copy of this correspondence from the governor’s office but have not received a response. We also asked the Workforce Commission for a copy of the correspondence. An agency official instructed us to file a request under the Texas Public Information Act. That request has not yet been fulfilled.   ""Labor is a commodity, and if there is a shortage of labor, just like when there is a shortage of anything else, then you raise the price on that commodity,"" Levy said. ""There is a shortage because people are unwilling to do it and wages today are historically low. The profits in this economy have been sucked up by the top 1%."" Abbott said that there are now more job openings in the state than the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, and that the number of job openings today is 60% higher than the number recorded in the month before the pandemic.   Based on Texas Workforce Commission methodology, there are 1,022,000 job postings on state-run and privately run job boards, some of which represent more than one job. That should total slightly more than the 1,029,890 Texans on unemployment as of the most recent data. Furthermore, that 1,022,000 number is indeed about 60% higher than the 645,000 job openings the Texas Workforce Commission counted in February 2020.   We rate this claim True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1FCA00>],/factchecks/2021/may/21/greg-abbott/job-openings-texas-match-number-people-unemploymen/

No, the Moderna vaccine does not contain an ingredient that’s for “research use only”
","Although more than a billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across the globe, misinformation continues to persist about them — whether it’s about their safety or their ingredients. A video making the rounds on social media claims the vaccine manufactured by Moderna contains an ingredient that is harmful to humans. A version of the video on Instagram shows a man Googling the phrase ""active ingredient of Moderna vaccine."" The man then clicks on a link from Hackensack Meridian Health, a New Jersey hospital network, that takes him to a page titled ""A Simple breakdown of the Ingredients in the COVID Vaccines."" As he scrolls down the page, the man stops at an entry listing some of the ingredients in the vaccine. He reads the entry for different lipids contained in the vaccine and wonders aloud about one listed as ""SM-102."" He then pulls up a safety data sheet from a biotech company claiming the lipid is ""for research use only, not meant for human or veterinary use.""  Instagram is owned by Facebook and the post was flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the Moderna vaccine does contain the SM-102 lipid, the man misinterpreted the safety data sheet. Lipids are used in both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines as a way to protect the mRNA that is used in them. The lipids surround the mRNA in a fatty shell, allowing it to enter cells. The company that provided the data sheet referenced in the video, Cayman Chemical, sells chemicals to pharmaceutical companies for research in developing new medicines. But this safety data sheet was from a product listing for a version of the lipid that has been dissolved in a solution of chloroform, a highly toxic compound often used in chemical manufacturing. The safety warnings and risks listed on the sheet are for the chloroform used in the solution — not the SM-102 lipid itself. The Moderna vaccine does not contain any chloroform. The SM-102 lipid is safe for humans. A video shared on Instagram claimed that a lipid used in the Moderna vaccine was unsafe for humans and is meant to be only used in research. The video showed a safety sheet provided by a biotech company listing the dangers associated with the lipid. However, the safety sheet was not for the lipid itself but a version dissolved in a solution of chloroform that’s sold to pharmaceutical companies for research purposes. The dangers listed on the sheet are for the chloroform, which is a toxic substance. The Moderna vaccine does not contain any chloroform — and none of its ingredients are deemed toxic to humans.

Nelson flubs comparison between student loan debt, real wages
","It’s not 2022 yet, but Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate candidates are already making their priorities known.  Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson, a Democrat, has repeatedly expressed support for increasing taxes on wealthier Americans, presenting himself as a stark contrast to Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson — who has not yet announced whether he will seek a third term. In an April 11, 2021 tweet, Nelson used the issue of student loan debt to further his argument. ""Since 2010, student debt has increased by 102% and real wages have *fallen* by over 8%,"" he tweeted. Is Nelson on to something here?  Not exactly. When asked for evidence to support Nelson’s claim, his campaign acknowledged that they couldn’t find data to match the specific numbers he cited and deleted the tweet. But they argued the broader point still stands — that student loan debt is outpacing wages. So, we decided to take a look at the numbers. First, a programming note: There are multiple measures for analyzing economic trends over time. Nelson cited real wages — or wages adjusted for inflation — so that will be our focus here.  According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the annual average weekly earnings for all employees sat at $353.53 in 2010 and increased 10.8% to $391.90 in 2020. (Note: These numbers are all in 1982-84 dollars, per the standard used by BLS.) For production and nonsupervisory employees, weekly earnings increased roughly 11.5% over that 10-year period. So, real wages haven’t fallen. Quite the opposite — they have increased. Meanwhile, data from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis showed the total student loans owed in the fourth quarter of 2010 sat at around $855 billion. That skyrocketed to $1.7 trillion by the end of 2020, which was a nearly 100% increase. What’s more, Experian found that the average individual loan balance grew by over $3,000, or 9%, from 2019 to 2020 alone and 6% from 2015 to 2019.  That means Nelson was generally on target with how much student debt has risen. But he flubbed the comparison. In a since-deleted tweet, Nelson said ""since 2010, student debt has increased by 102% and real wages have fallen by over 8%."" Student loan debt has increased astronomically during that time period, so Nelson was on the mark there. But weekly earnings for employees have not fallen — they have  gone up roughly 11% since 2010, when adjusted for inflation.  A statement is Half True when it is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F6280>],/factchecks/2021/may/21/tom-nelson/nelson-flubs-comparison-between-student-loan-debt-/

Eric Trump’s Pants on Fire claim that Joe Biden’s White House doesn’t travel
","In a falsehood-filled attack on President Joe Biden’s administration, Eric Trump wrongly claimed that the White House under Biden is not traveling — to the border, overseas, or anywhere. ""There’s no fight coming out of the White House,"" Trump, the second son of former President Donald Trump, told Fox News host Sean Hannity May 18. ""There’s no one there. They don’t travel. They don't go down to the border. They don't go overseas."" The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has affected Biden’s transition into office, but Trump’s claim about White House travel and work is wrong. Previously, he criticized Biden for traveling on the job too often, calling Biden’s weekend trips to his home state of Delaware ""heartbreaking.""  The Trump Organization and former president’s office did not respond to requests for comment.  President Joe Biden meets with congressional leaders in the Oval Office of the White House on May 12, 2021, in Washington. (AP) Trump’s claim that ""there’s no one there"" in the White House is inaccurate.  The Biden White House has maintained a slimmed-down in-person workforce because of the coronavirus pandemic, but it is gradually returning people to the office environment.  ""Today, those who physically come into work vary in the West Wing,"" Politico reported May 6. ""Most senior advisers around Biden are in the office every day."" The administration includes Biden’s Cabinet, made up of the 15 agency heads and other senior officials, such as White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. The president has also announced his intent to nominate 233 people to serve in Senate-confirmed positions across the executive branch, according to a White House fact sheet about his first 100 days in office.   President Joe Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a member of Biden's Cabinet, meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and members of the House of Representatives in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on March 4, 2021. (AP) The White House has hired nearly 1,500 additional presidential appointees to serve roles in various agencies that don’t require Senate confirmation, the fact sheet says. In April, Biden hosted Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the first in-person visit of a world leader during his presidency.  President Joe Biden tours the New Orleans Sewerage & Water Board's Carrollton water plant on May 6, 2021, in New Orleans. (AP) Trump’s claim that Biden and his administration haven’t been traveling is also inaccurate. On May 18, the same day Trump accused the Biden administration of staying put, Biden had traveled to Dearborn, Mich., where he spoke at Ford’s electric vehicle center and test-drove the company’s new electric truck. Hannity highlighted portions of Biden’s remarks from that visit on his show. In addition to those trips and his time spent at his home Delaware, Biden has also traveled to Georgia, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Wisconsin and Texas. He has delivered remarks, toured vaccination sites and public health agencies, visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and participated in ceremonies such as the laying of a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.  His first major trip as president outside the Washington area was in February, when he flew to Milwaukee to participate in a CNN town hall.  Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and other members of the White House have also traveled beyond Washington, both with the president and without him.  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and other officials have visited the southern U.S. border with Mexico multiple times. Similarly, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and John Kerry, a special presidential envoy on climate, have all traveled overseas, among other officials.   Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin speaks at a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels on April 14, 2021. (AP) On May 18, the day Trump made his false claim, Blinken was in Iceland as part of a trip that also included a visit to Denmark. Kerry was in Berlin that day, rounding out an overseas tour that included stops in Rome and London. Blinken has also traveled to Japan, South Korea, Belgium and Afghanistan, according to a list of his foreign trips. Austin joined Blinken in Japan and South Korea in March and went to Israel, Germany and Belgium in April. Kerry has also made trips to London, Brussels and Paris, and to the United Arab Emirates, India and Bangladesh.  Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry speaks with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris on March 10, 2021, after a meeting. (AP) Biden, who has been in office for about 120 days, has not traveled himself to the southern border or abroad, although he has pledged to go to the border ""at some point."" He is scheduled to make his first overseas trip as president in June. He will attend the G-7 Summit in the United Kingdom and NATO Summit in Brussels. Harris is slated to go to Mexico and Guatemala in June, marking her first trip abroad and her first trip to the border as vice president. Donald Trump’s first foreign trip as president came in late May of 2017, when he traveled to the Middle East and Europe. That was about 120 days after he took office. Eric Trump said of the Biden White House, ""There’s no one there. They don’t travel. They don't go down to the border. They don't go overseas."" That’s wrong on every point. The coronavirus has kept some White House staff working away from the White House grounds, but it’s not true that ""there’s no one there.""

No, CDC did not admit overcounting COVID-19 cases in hospitals
","An article widely shared on Facebook claims to have caught the leadership of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a ""gotcha"" moment, admitting to attributing unrelated deaths to COVID-19. The article from The Gateway Pundit, a conservative news site, is headlined, ""CDC director finally admits that COVID cases were overcounted in hospitals —  just as Gateway Pundit and Donald Trump reported in August.""  The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The latest claim piggybacks on the already-debunked premise that the CDC was overcounting COVID-19 deaths. In this case, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky’s recent comments about deaths from breakthrough infections — which occur when fully vaccinated people contract COVID-19 — were paraphrased and taken out of context. In August, President Donald Trump retweeted and The Gateway Pundit reported on several posts that falsely claimed the CDC quietly adjusted the number of U.S. coronavirus deaths downward by 94%, from 153,504 to 9,210.  The claims were based on a report from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which indicated that about 6% of Americans who died from COVID-19 had only the virus, and no other conditions, listed on their death certificates. The vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients who have other conditions, which are also listed on their death certificates, but that doesn’t mean COVID-19 was not a factor in their deaths. The CDC considers the underlying cause of death as ""the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death,"" Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the NCHS told us.  In 92% of death certificates that mention the virus, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. Though the August claim about overreporting COVID-19 deaths was debunked, The Gateway Pundit revisited the falsehood this week, after Walensky appeared on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""  Walensky said during her appearance that as of May 10, the CDC is aware of 223 deaths from COVID-19 among fully vaccinated people. She added, ""I also want to convey that now many, many hospitals are screening people for COVID when they come in, so not all of those 223 cases who had COVID actually died of COVID. They may have had mild disease, but died, for example, of a heart attack,"" according to a transcript of her comments.  The CDC’s data on breakthrough infections shows that of the 223 deaths, 42 — or 18% — were reported as asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19. Walensky said ""many, many hospitals are screening people for COVID when they come in."" But The Gateway Pundit paraphrased and misrepresented her comments, reporting that she ""admitted that ‘many, many hospitals’ were counting COVID deaths to include cases that were not COVID deaths.""  A story by The Gateway Pundit says, ""CDC director finally admits that COVID cases were overcounted in hospitals —  just as Gateway Pundit and Donald Trump reported in August.""  The original claim in August, that the CDC was overcounting deaths, was not true. It was based on a report from NCHS that differentiated between death certificates that only listed COVID-19 and those that listed other conditions as well. In the recent claim, the Gateway Pundit misrepresented comments made by Walensky of the CDC. She said that ""many, many hospitals are screening people for COVID when they come in."" But The Gateway Pundit said she ""admitted that ‘many, many hospitals’ were counting COVID deaths to include cases that were not COVID deaths.""  We rate this claim False.   ",[<zip object at 0x000002809713C0C0>],/factchecks/2021/may/20/gateway-pundit/no-cdc-did-not-admit-overcounting-covid-19-cases-h/

CDC is not manipulating its COVID-19 breakthrough data — it’s changing how it collects it
","A change in the way federal health officials are tracking ""breakthrough"" COVID-19 cases among vaccinated people has prompted claims on social media that the government is maneuvering to manipulate or hide negative information about the vaccines.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a breakthrough case occurs when a person who has been fully vaccinated still contracts the disease.  While the three COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States drastically reduce the chances of infection, health officials caution that no vaccine is 100% effective, so some breakthrough cases are expected to occur, and the CDC has been tracking them to monitor the effectiveness of the vaccines. As of May 14, though, the CDC is monitoring only the more severe breakthrough cases that result in hospitalization or death. It previously tracked all reported breakthrough cases, including those that were largely mild or asymptomatic. The change alarmed some on social media who are skeptical of the vaccines’ effectiveness. ""CDC says it will no longer update the number of vaccinated people who test positive for COVID unless they are hospitalized or die,"" one May 10 tweet read. ""But they’ll still update the number of COVID cases for normal people who test positive. So you want to scare us with cases but not vaccinated cases?"" ""When The V8ccinated Still Get the Virus, V8ccines Fail, and How The CDC Are Attempting to Hide It All,"" said the start of a Facebook post published May 16.  That post goes on to state: ""Such a drastic change in official reporting is inherently disingenuous, and serves to conceal the true number of those who will test positive despite being v8ccinated. This will not ‘maximise the quality of data,’ but has been purposely implemented to ensure the very concealment of data that might reflect the majority of actual ‘breakthrough’ cases."" The latter post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Misspelling the word ""vaccine"" is a common technique used on social media to circumvent the tools used by fact checkers. As for the claims of a CDC cover-up? ""Completely false,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a phone interview with PolitiFact. Nordlund told PolitiFact in an email that zeroing in on severe breakthrough cases is meant to provide vaccine researchers with more complete and reliable data on the cases they’re most concerned about, since not all people with breakthrough infections can be identified, particularly those with asymptomatic or mild illness who do not get tested. The CDC uses a passive surveillance system to collect data on breakthrough cases, Nordlund said. This means that the agency relies on state health departments to voluntarily report such cases.  ""The surveillance system was set up to get a snapshot and help identify any unusual patterns or concerning signals among vaccine breakthrough cases,"" she added. ""To date, no unexpected patterns have been identified in the case demographics or vaccine characteristics among people with reported vaccine breakthrough infections."" The latest publicly available CDC data showed that out of 95 million people who were fully vaccinated as of April 26, there were at least 9,245 recorded breakthrough COVID-19 cases. Among them, there were 832 hospitalizations and 132 deaths, though not all of them were related to COVID-19. The CDC acknowledges that its breakthrough case numbers are incomplete and an undercount, since they rely on passive surveillance. But there is no evidence to support the claim that the federal agency is attempting to hide or manipulate the data to misrepresent the effectiveness of the vaccine. State health agencies report their data to the CDC, which is then published to its REDCap database, an internal data-management platform that can be accessed by public health officials. ""CDC has many surveillance systems in place to look at complications of COVID-19,"" Nordlund said in the email. ""This is not the only system that gives CDC an opportunity to look at the performance of the vaccines in different populations, settings, and the impact of variants."" Nordlund told PolitiFact that states can continue reporting any kind of breakthrough infection to the federal government, regardless of severity. But the agency’s priority will be on learning more about how vaccinated individuals develop serious illness from COVID-19. As of May 18, CDC data indicates that about 48% (nearly 160 million people) of the U.S. population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while about 38% are fully vaccinated as of May 17. A Facebook post says a new CDC tracking policy is meant to cover up cases of breakthrough COVID-19 infections among vaccinated people. Under the new policy, the CDC is monitoring only the breakthrough COVID-19 cases that involve hospitalization or death. The agency says the change is meant to provide more researchers more meaningful data about the cases it’s most concerned about. There is no evidence the agency is attempting to hide or misrepresent its own data about the effectiveness of the vaccines. We rate this claim False.

Demonstrators In Orange County Are Wrong: Kids Are Not At Risk Of Lung Diseases From Wearing Masks
","A Facebook group called Informed Parents for California held a public rally on Monday in Orange County, protesting the use of face masks in California public schools. The group of more than 52,000 Facebook users created fliers for students to ""sit out and zoom out."" Parents were encouraged to make fliers for other school districts from Orange County up to Yuba County. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The flier was riddled with false information about the health risks of wearing a mask. One of those false risks is wearing a face mask could cause pulmonary fibrosis, a disease in which scar tissue develops in the lungs.  As reported previously by PolitiFact, there is no evidence that wearing face masks causes lung infections or reduces blood oxygen levels. Only people with pre-existing respiratory conditions may be at risk to prolonged use of tight-fitting masks, like N95 respirators.  ""There is no evidence that mask wearing leads to pulmonary fibrosis in either children or adults,"" said David Cornfield, Chief Pulmonary, Asthma, and Sleep Medicine at Stanford Children’s Health. ""Masks are safe and effective tools to mitigate the spread of viral illnesses spread in the air.""  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention peer reviewed two separate studies — one with children and one with adults — on possible adverse effects associated with mask use. According to the studies, the agency found no indication of decreased oxygen or increased carbon dioxide blood level, nor clinical signs of respiratory distress among participants.  Other false health claims on the flier included induced exhaustion syndrome and respiratory impairment. PolitiFact debunked these claims back in the summer of 2020 after talking to health experts who said face masks don’t cause lung infections. The CDC also updated its guidelines on face masks to include research on why face masks don’t cause harm. According to a recent PolitiFact story, the misinformation stems from a theoretical paper written in Medical Hypothesis, a journal for ""radical, speculative and non-mainstream scientific ideas,"" that is not peer-reviewed.  The paper first went viral after Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, published a story with the headline, ""Stanford Study Results: Face masks are Ineffective to Block Transmission of COVID-19 and Actually Can Cause Health Deterioration and Premature Death.""  The paper was purported to be in association with Stanford University. The author of the theoretical paper, an exercise physiologist, was last affiliated with Stanford in 2016. Stanford asked for Medical Hypothesis to retract any affiliation with the university. The CDC recently announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear face masks or practice social distancing indoors unless under certain circumstances. California intends to align with the CDC's new guidelines on June 15. Until then, school districts are working with the California Department of Public Health to determine what activities are safe to do for vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Our Ruling A Facebook group called Informed Parents for California continues to spread false information on the health risks of wearing face masks. The group, which has tens of thousands of followers, shared a flier that had multiple claims, including one that said children who wear masks are at risk of the lung disease pulmonary fibrosis.  We found that health claim — as well as the others on the flier — to be incorrect.  These same claims have been debunked repeatedly by experts over the past year. Two CDC peer-reviewed studies this year showed face masks don’t decrease oxygen or increase carbon dioxide blood level. Nor do they cause respiratory distress. Medical experts we spoke with also disagreed with the claims, and added that ""masks are safe and effective tools to mitigate the spread of viral illnesses spread in the air.""  The debunked information came from a journal entry in Medical Hypothesis, a non-peer reviewed theoretical journal, and the author was falsely affiliated with Stanford University.

Youngkin shifts position on the legitimacy of Biden's election
","Glenn Youngkin,  the Republican nominee for governor, says there’s nothing new about his recent proclamations that Joe Biden was legitimately elected president. ""I mean, the reality is, and I have said this before, Joe Biden was legitimately elected our president,"" Youngkin said during a  May 13 interview on Fox Business. ""He took the oath and was sworn in. He’s sleeping in the White House. He’s unfortunately signing executive order after executive order."" Youngkin is suggesting his position hasn’t changed. But an examination of his statements shows his rhetoric has changed since May 10, when he was declared the winner of a Republican drive-in convention held at 39 sites across the state. Let’s take a look on our Flip-O-Meter. Pre-convention Youngkin has made ""election integrity"" a major issue in his campaign, calling for stronger laws for voter identification and verifying mail-in ballots. While courting Republican delegates prior to the convention, he repeatedly deflected questions about the legitimacy of Biden’s election by simply saying Biden was president because he had been inaugurated. For example, VPM reporter Ben Paviour asked Youngkin on April 20 whether he believed there was ""fraud"" in the presidential election. ""People absolutely continue not to have faith in the process,"" Youngkin replied. ""This is the issue."" Youngkin then talked about hanging chads in Florida during the state’s 2000 presidential election recount. When pressed again about whether he believed the 2020 election was fraudulent, Youngkin replied, ""At the end of the day the president is Joe Biden because he was inaugurated as such."" The Washington Post reported on Feb. 22 that Youngkin said ""no,"" when asked if he believed Biden ""stole"" the election, but ""declined to say if he believes Biden was legitimately elected."" One of Youngkin’s two closest competitors, Pete Snyder, took a similar position. The other, Amanda Chase, repeatedly made unsupported claims that the election was rigged. On April 1, Reuters reported that Youngkin’s campaign and those of his GOP competitors, ""did not respond to questions asking if their candidate believed Biden was the legitimate winner of November’s election."" On April 7, the Virginia Mercury reported that Youngkin and Snyder were ""declining to say whether they believe Biden’s November victory was legitimate."" Post-convention We asked Youngkin’s campaign for taped proof of his May 13 claim that, ""I have said this before, Joe Biden was legitimately elected our president."" We were sent three statements by Youngkin, all occurring after he was declared winner of the GOP nomination on May 10 and beginning a general election campaign.  On May 12, Youngkin was asked by Bloomberg Radio if Biden was legitimately elected and answered, ""Of course. He’s our president. He slept in the White House last night. He’s addressed a joint session of Congress. He’s signing executive orders that I wish he wasn’t signing. So, let’s look forward and just recognize that what we have to do is lead."" The same day, WAVY-TV in Portsmouth asked Younkgin if Biden won fairly. ""Yeah,"" he said. And the campaign pointed us to the May 13 interview with Fox Business when Youngkin said, ""I have said this before, Joe Biden was legitimately elected our president."" We asked the campaign if it had any examples of Youngkin saying before the convention that Biden was legitimately elected.  We didn’t get a reply.  Democrats will choose their nominee in a June 8 primary. Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe is the frontrunner in a five-candidate field. Our ruling Prior to his victory at the Republican convention, Youngkin toed a delicate line when asked if Biden was legitimately elected. He acknowledged that Biden was president but would not clearly say whether he thought the president was fairly elected. After the convention, Youngkin began acknowledging that Biden’s election was legitimate.  His position changed, and we rate it a Half Flip.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097105BC0>],/factchecks/2021/may/19/glenn-youngkin/youngkin-shifts-position-legitimacy-bidens-electio/

Among men, 51% said they are more likely to clean the house compared with 9% of women. And 50% of men said they are more likely to handle child care on a daily basis compared with 7% of women.  But those numbers aren’t right.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the Gallup poll results, 2019 data that was published on the company’s website in January 2020, and the data is flipped.  According to Gallup, 58% of women said they are more likely to do laundry compared with 13% of men. Fifty-one percent of women said they are more likely to clean the house compared with 9% of men. And so forth.  We reached out to MSNBC about the graphic but didn’t immediately hear back.  What we do know: The data itself, as presented in the Facebook post, is wrong.  Gallup’s poll found that women bear a larger load of household duties in the United States.

Pope Francis was photographed with Holocaust survivors, not Rockefellers and Rothschilds
","The Rothschild and the Rockefeller families are sometimes targets of misinformation. So is Pope Francis.  Now, an image of the pope kissing a man’s hand while other men look on is being framed as a moment involving both families and the leader of the Catholic church.  ""Pope Francis kissing the hand of David Rockefeller & John Rothschild,"" the post says.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Rothschilds are a wealthy Jewish family who established a financial empire in Europe beginning in the 1700s. The Rockefeller family fortune started with John D. Rockefeller, an oil tycoon and devout Baptist who became America’s first billionaire. His son, David Rockefeller, was a billionaire philanthropist who died in 2017. According to the Rothschild Archive, there are no members of the family named John Rothschild, though there are two spouses of Rothschilds who have ""John"" in their name.  But the man whose hand Pope Francis is holding in the photo is neither a Rothschild nor a Rockefeller. According to Getty Images, it’s Holocaust survivor Eliezer Grynfeld. The photo was taken in 2014, when Pope Francis visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial museum in Jerusalem.  The man standing next to Grynfeld is Moshe Ha-Elion, another Holocaust survivor. Pope Francis was also photographed holding his hand.  Reuters reported at the time that the pope was introduced to six survivors of Nazi concentration camps that day, and he slowly kissed the hand of each one.  We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097236E80>],/factchecks/2021/may/19/viral-image/pope-francis-was-photographed-holocaust-survivors-/

No, these aren’t photos of a photographer crying at the Aqsa Mosque
","The Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem sits on a site that is sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians, and it was the backdrop for recent violence between Israeli police and Palestinians.  A photo of Israeli security forces at the mosque is among four images included in a May 10 Facebook post. The other three are of a man crying behind a camera. ""A photojournalist rolls down tears while capturing pictures of Masjid Al-Aqsa,"" the post says.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image of the mosque is authentic and was taken on May 7 by Anadolu Agency photographer Mostafa Alkharouf.  It was published on Anadolu Agency’s website with this caption: ""Israeli security forces are seen as they enter the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, intervene Muslim worshippers with stun grenade during prayer.""  But Alkharouf was not joined by the crying photographer featured in the Facebook post. A reverse image search shows that those photos have been online since early 2019. On Jan. 24 of that year, the verified Twitter account of soccer’s AFC Asian Cup tweeted one of the images and wrote: ""Passionate. Emotional moment for an Iraqi photographer during the Round of 16 clash."" The tweet includes an emoji of Qatar’s flag. Iraq played Qatar in the Round 16 of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup and lost 0-1. The verified Twitter account of Sports360 Arabiya tweeted the same image that day. The caption, translated by Google from Arabic to English, says: ""An Iraqi photographer cries while performing his work as he watches his country’s national team exit from the Asian Cup.""

No proof for Trump claim that a database for 2020 election in Ariz. was deleted
","On May 15, 6½ months after losing the presidential election to Joe Biden, Donald Trump continued his baseless claims about election fraud with a statement about the GOP-commissioned audit of results in Maricopa County, Ariz. ""The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED!"" the statement said. Trump called the alleged deletion ""illegal,"" then went on to make several other claims of ""election crime"" and ""presidential election fraud."" Trump’s statement didn’t describe the database he referred to, and his office did not reply to our requests for information to support his claim. There is no evidence that an entire database from the 2020 election in Maricopa County was illegally deleted. In fact, one of the firms doing an audit of the election essentially walked back its initial claim of the database being deleted. Final official results of the November election showed Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, 1,040,774 votes to 995,665. Even though the original result has been validated by a hand-count sample audit and a forensic audit of tabulation equipment that found no abnormalities, this ongoing Maricopa audit was ordered up by Republican state senators. It began April 23. Cyber Ninjas, a technology company lacking election audit experience, is leading the audit. The firm is headed by Doug Logan, who promoted ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.  On May 12, three days before Trump issued his statement, the audit’s Twitter account stated: ""Breaking Update: Maricopa County deleted a directory full of election databases from the 2020 election cycle days before the election equipment was delivered to the audit. This is spoliation of evidence!""  On May 17, the Maricopa County Elections Department issued a memo refuting the claim. An analysis confirmed that ""the original database folder on the ‘EMSPrimary’ server was not deleted or otherwise tampered with during packaging and delivery"" of election materials to the Arizona Senate for the audit, the memo said. The next day, at a public meeting on the audit called by Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, one of the auditors backtracked on the database claim. ""I discovered a (Master File Table) that clearly indicated that the database directory was deleted from that server,"" Ben Cotton, founder of CyFir, one of the firms involved in the audit, said at the hearing.  ""So, all of this, however, may be a moot point because subsequently, I've been able to recover all of those deleted files and I have access to that data."" The auditor simply did not know how to look for the data, according to an email to Fann from the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in response to the tweet. The tweet ""is demonstrably false; the only thing it does demonstrate is your auditors’ incompetence,"" the board’s letter said.  ""Their stunning lack of a basic understanding for how their software works is egregious and only made worse by the false tweet sent defaming the hardworking employees of Maricopa County."" Trump claimed: ""The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED!"" His statement came three days after the Twitter account for an ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County claimed that the county ""deleted a directory full of election databases."" A few days later, the head of one of the firms helping do the audit said he in fact was able to access the data.  There is no evidence any election database was deleted illegally. We rate Trump’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097015880>],/factchecks/2021/may/19/donald-trump/no-proof-trump-claim-database-2020-election-ariz-w/
