Chris Larson says Chris Abele spent $42 per vote in spring election
","As the results became clear in the race for Milwaukee County Executive, unsuccessful challenger Chris Larson took the stage and thanked his supporters. Larson, a Democratic state senator from Milwaukee, lost April 5, 2016 to incumbent Chris Abele by a 55 to 44 percent margin. In his concession speech, Larson said his campaign was a success, in part, because it made Abele more responsive and willing to listen to concerns of residents. He then mentioned a key element in the race: money. Abele largely paid for his own campaign, taking in only a handful of contributions. And records showed he spent an estimated $3.5 million on the campaign between July of 2015 and two weeks before Election Day. At that point, he also had $642,618 in cash on hand. ""Big money may have won the battle, but they haven't won the war,"" said Larson. He then offered a calculation to illustrate the spending disparity. ""For the votes that we got, I think we spent, on average, two bucks a pop. Compared to 42 bucks from the other guy,"" Larson said in remarks carried on live television. That’s quite a gap. During the campaign, Larson regularly told audiences that he was being outspent by Abele by 20 to one. But in his concession speech, Larson put an even bigger figure on the gap. Was he right? Doing the math Let’s work some numbers, based on the vote totals and campaign finance reports on file with the Milwaukee County Elections Commission. Abele: Reports show that between July 2015 and March 21, 2016, his campaign spent just over $3.5 million. Unofficial returns from the general election show Abele received 156,524 votes. That comes to $22.36 per vote. (A footnote: Abele’s reports show about $5.6 million in personal loans to his campaign, but some of those loans go back as far as 2010 and his first run for the office. That figure would amount to $35.77 per vote, but we are using the narrower time frame to focus on this election.) Larson: Reports show that in the same pre-election time frame, Larson spent $216,243. Virtually all of that came from individual contributors, although Larson loaned his campaign $10,000 on March 21, 2016. He received 125,292 votes, so he spent about $1.72 per vote. So, it’s clear Larson was outspent by a major amount -- just not the amount he cited. ""Our number-crunching showed that Abele spent $24-25 a vote,"" Larson campaign manager Josh Kilroy said in an email. ""In the dim lighting and fraught emotions, I suspect Larson inverted the numbers."" Last-minute spending The final reports showing last-minute spending do not have to be filed until July of 2016. So, the final dollar-per-vote number -- on both sides -- will be higher. Would that spending make a difference? A key indication of the final weeks’ spending -- television advertising buys -- can be found in reports filed by local TV stations with the Federal Communications Commission. The Abele campaign spent or planned to spend about $195,000 on 482 television spots in the window from March 21 to the election, according to the reports, which are prepared before the ads aired and subject to revision. If you take the known spending by Abele -- the money already spent plus the final batch of TV ads -- it comes to $3,695,000, or $23.60 per vote. In addition to the TV ads, Abele sent out numerous direct mail fliers. Also, many other payments to staff and consultants, bonuses and bills from vendors come in after the election. The tally would rise to about $26 per vote if Abele spent the full $642,618 in cash on hand -- and didn’t pour any more of money into the race. But there are no indications the spending would end up at $40 per vote, as Larson claimed. And, in any case, just as Larson could only rely on known information in making his claim, we must base our rating on information available at the time. Our rating In conceding defeat, Larson claimed he spent about $2 per vote received while Abele spent $42. Our calculation shows the gap, based on current reports, is more like $26 to $1.70 -- but it will grow somewhat by the time final reports are filed in July. Larson’s broader point about being vastly outspent was correct. Although he was right on the concept, he was far off on the numbers. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2016/apr/11/chris-larson/chris-larson-says-chris-abele-spent-42-vote-spring/

Mira Signer says state with highest gun ownership rates have highest suicide rates
","Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting near Tucson, recently visited Virginia’s Capitol to push for tougher gun laws. She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, launched a coalition that will seek ""common-sense solutions"" to gun violence in the state. High on its list is convincing a resistant General Assembly to close loopholes in Virginia’s background check law for prospective gun buyers. About a dozen community leaders and law-enforcement experts met with Giffords and Kelly to help set strategies. Among them was Mira Signer, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She said the availability of guns poses special risks to those with mental disorders. States ""that have the highest gun ownership also have the highest suicide rates,"" she said. ""The evidence is there. We know that."" We wondered whether Signer’s statement is correct. Signer told us her claim is based in part on a report called ""The Truth About Guns and Suicide,"" published in September 2015 by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocating gun control. The report says, ""Studies examining firearm ownership and suicide rates at the national, state and regional levels provide further evidence of the firearm-suicide connection. They show that suicide rates, both overall and by firearm, are higher in areas where gun ownership is more widespread."" Footnotes in the report say the Brady Center’s statement is based on a series of studies by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Massachusetts - the last published in 2008. Researchers compared data that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kept from 2000 to 2002 on the number of suicides in each state and the percentage of households in each state where at least one firearm was held. ""Among men, among women, and in every age group (including children), states with the higher rates of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides,"" the researchers wrote in an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine. Back then Why rely today on statistics that are more than decade old? Researchers say they’re still the best numbers available. Every year, the CDC conducts an extensive health-risk poll with more than 250,000 U.S. adults that ‘s called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It used to ask participants whether they had guns in their homes. With its huge sample, the results could be broken down to statistically reliable percentages of households with a gun in each state. The CDC, under congressional demands to stop researching gun issues, removed the question from the survey after 2004. Since then, no other poll has offered a reliable, detailed look at gun ownership rates in each state. The CDC surveys showed that the top three states for percentage of household gun ownership - Wyoming, Montana and Alaska - often ranked as the three states with the highest suicide rates. Roughly 60 percent of households held firearms in those states, much higher than the national median of 40 percent. Their suicide rates, according to other CDC data, hovered around 20 people per 100,000 - nearly double the national average of about 11 per 100,000. Conversely, the nine states with the lowest per-household gun ownership from 2001 to 2004 also had the nine lowest suicide rates. They were Hawaii, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, California, Illinois and Maryland. Overall, the statistics show a distinct correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates in states. There are, of course, anomalies. Nevada, for example, ranked 36th in the percentage of households with guns from 2001 to 2004 but had fourth-highest suicide rate. Virginia, if you’re wondering, ranked 32nd in the percentage of household with guns and 34th in suicide rate during that period. Today Signer’s statement was made in present tense, so there’s an issue of whether these old findings remain relevant. The ranking of states based on suicide rates barely has changed over the years, according CDC data for 2013 - the latest final statistics available. Wyoming, Alaska and Montana still had the highest rates. So that leaves the problem on quantifying household gun ownership in each state without updated, exhaustive surveys from the CDC. YouGov, an international market research firm, conducted an Internet poll in 2013 that asked 4,622 U.S. adults to participate in an online survey that asked whether they owned guns. YouGov broke the numbers down by state and got results that broadly resembled the CDC figures. Columbia University researchers used those figures in a 2013 paper on the gun culture in states and regions around the U.S. Bindu Kalesan, the lead researcher, told us in an email that the numbers for many states have a high margin of error. Many analysts, in exploring a variety of gun issues, still cite the CDC state figures. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us the numbers still are relevant. ""Gun ownership levels across states hardly change over time,"" he said. ""For example, the best predictors of whether you will own a gun is whether you grew up with guns and whether your neighbors are gun owners or not."" These indicators, Hemenway said, ""don’t switch back and forth."" Hemenway sent us four studies from other researchers that also connected the presence of guns to high suicide rates. ""It all makes sense psychologically,"" he said, ""since so many suicides are pretty spontaneous with little planning and people use whatever is handy. The urge passes and people who have survived even serious suicide attempts rarely go on to kill themselves. The case fatality rate for guns is 90 percent, while the case fatality rate for the two most common forms of suicide attempts - pills and cutting - is under 3 percent."" Our ruling Signer said states that have ""the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates."" Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement. The three states with the highest percentage of household gun ownership - Alaska, Wyoming and Montana - also had the three highest suicide rates. The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates. The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years. But the CDC has stopped surveying gun ownership in states, and nothing nearly as reliable has filled the void. A much smaller poll conducted in 2013 suggests the ranking of states by the percentage of  homes with guns hasn’t changed much either. And there’s no shortage of researchers, past and present, who have concluded there is a strong link between the presence of guns and suicides. So we rate Signer’s statement True.

Clinton voted for 'virtually every' trade agreement, killing millions of jobs, Sanders says
","The race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders heated up this week after a rhetorical spat over who was or wasn’t qualified to be president.   It started when Clinton said Wednesday that Sanders ""hadn’t done his homework and he’d been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn’t really studied or understood."" Responding to a Washington Post article that cast Clinton’s comments as questioning his qualifications, Sanders shot back, saying Clinton is the one who’s unqualified, upsetting Clinton’s supporters and former president-husband. The tiff leveled off Friday when Sanders took back his statement and said ""of course"" Clinton is qualified. But Sunday on Meet the Press, Sanders said his point all along was Clinton lacks good judgment. ""Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs,"" he said, ""when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water, and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country."" There’s a lot to fact-check in this statement, but we were particularly curious about Sanders’ claim that Clinton supported ""virtually every trade agreement."" Sanders is exaggerating slightly, but he has a point that Clinton has been largely in favor of free trade. His claim that these deals have cost the country ""millions of jobs"" is up for debate. Clinton’s position on free trade Unlike Sanders’ two decades of consistent opposition to free trade agreement, Clinton has zigzagged through the years. ""Some people are generally pro-trade or anti-trade. She’s case-by-case on trade,"" Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, told the Washington Post last year. As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably in the 1990s and in the early 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by President Bill Clinton. ""Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal,"" she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History. As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She said yes to six and no to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and the deal with Andean countries. She skipped the votes on agreements with Jordan and Peru, which came up when she was running for president the first time, but supported both deals. Clinton explained her seemingly inconsistent positions in a 2005 speech to Congress: ""The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement included internationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of the agreement. Sadly, DR-CAFTA is a step backward."" While the deals with Chile, Australia and Singapore similarly excluded labor rights standards, Clinton said she ""supported these agreements despite these concerns because I believed the agreements would not harm the average working person in those nations."" However, Clinton (as well as then Rep. Sanders) voted against the Trade Act of 2002, which expanded duty-free exports from Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru and gave President George W. Bush ""fast-track authority"" to approve trade deals with South American countries. The Sanders campaign pointed out that Clinton supported normalizing trade relations with China while campaigning for Senate in 2000, and, once elected, she also voted for legislation that included an amendment granting Vietnam normalized trade status. (Sanders voted against both.) As a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA ""a mistake"" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail. ""I support the trade agreement with Peru. It has very strong labor and environmental protections. This agreement makes meaningful progress on advancing workers’ rights, and also levels the playing field for American workers,"" she said in 2007. ""The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers. I am very concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. And as long as the head of Panama's National Assembly is a fugitive from justice in America, I cannot support that agreement."" As secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

On one side, unions and some left-leaning think tanks often link American job losses to expanded trade. Labor advocates opposed the Chile and Singapore agreements, which they said in a 2003 report would kill an unspecified number of jobs. The liberal Economic Policy Institute has found that NAFTA has cost the United States over 800,000 jobs and the South Korean deal about 60,000. In a 2014 report, the think tank reported that the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China. Business groups, on the other hand, argue that trade deals actually boost employment. For example, a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs. Meanwhile, the U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times contend that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy.    And in a recent fact-check, we found several nonpartisan reports demonstrating that NAFTA produced no significant job losses nor job gains. Analysis by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected no net impact on employment from the Chile, Singapore and South Korea deals. Our ruling Sander said Clinton voted ""for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs."" Out of the 10 trade deals Clinton could have voted on, she voted in favor of six and against two. On two other deals (with Peru and Jordan), she didn’t vote but did vouch for them. As for Sanders’ point about subsequent job losses, independent research has shown the impact of NAFTA, for example, to not be significant one way or the other for jobs. Sanders’ claim is partially accurate and needs additional information. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/10/bernie-sanders/clinton-voted-virtually-every-trade-agreement-kill/

Glenn Beck, a Cruz supporter, says Hillary Clinton always beats Donald Trump in polling matchups
","With doubts persisting over whether Donald Trump will be able to clinch the Republican presidential nomination on the first ballot, NBC's Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked conservative commentator and Ted Cruz supporter Glenn Beck what he would do if Trump is the nominee. Beck said he would never vote for Trump and instead would probably focus on the strongest House and Senate candidates who ""would keep Hillary Clinton at bay because Trump is not going to win the general. If you look at the polls — Todd, and you know this no matter what they say — you look at the polls, Hillary Clinton wins every time with Donald Trump."" For this fact-check, we'll look at whether Beck is accurately characterizing the national head-to-head polls. As it turns out, he is. Our source is the compilation of national surveys by RealClearPolitics.com. Since a Fox News poll dating back to Feb. 15, Clinton has won every hypothetical head-to-head matchup with the billionaire. And in every case, the winning margin has been larger than the poll's margin of error. The website’s aggregation of the most recent polls gives Clinton a spread of 10.5 percentage points over Trump. The trend has been clear for the past year. If you go back to polls released in May 2015 (before Trump was officially a candidate), Clinton has bested Trump in 51 of 58 matchups. In 43 of those surveys, she's outpolled Trump by a percentage that's greater than the margin of error. Trump has come out on top in only five polls. The last time was in a February USA Today/Suffolk survey, where the two-point spread was within the margin of error. That poll has not been repeated. His winning margin hasn't been greater than the margin of error since a November survey by Fox News. More importantly, Fox's two newest polls, from February and March, both show Clinton winning. The March survey gives her a winning margin of 11 percentage points. One of those five polls, from early September, hasn't been repeated either. Two other surveys released since May 2015 have had him tied with Clinton. The most recent was conducted in early October. But once again, the latest versions of those polls, by Public Policy Polling in late March and CNN/ORC in mid March, have Clinton way ahead. Our ruling The bottom line is every recent poll shows Clinton clearly ahead of Trump. The only polls that favor Trump are old and have mostly been superseded by newer surveys showing that Clinton has pulled ahead.

Rhode Island is small, but not that small
","After Rhode Island’s proposed ""Cooler & Warmer"" slogan tanked, many small-state natives threw their own catchphrases into the mix. Enter artist Hilary Treadwell, who sells a quirky T-shirt on her website, Lilhop.com. ""Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide."" Naturally, we asked Treadwell how she came up with this number. That’s what fact checkers do. She said she made it up. ""I just like the number three, it’s big enough, but small enough,"" she said. ""It’s a joke that speaks to a truth."" She did look up the state’s area, and the length of its coastline and fiddled around with the numbers, but couldn’t get much farther. ""I would love to know what it really is,"" she said. ""I’m a math nerd, but non-scientific math.""   So we dug in. We quickly discovered this is a tough question, and after tinkering with the Rhode Island Geographic Information System Geospatial Data Catalog for a few hours, we called for backup.   Chuck Labash and Michael Bradley, who work at the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center, say an accurate calculation would require a Ph.d. or master’s-level study into shallow water bathymetry (the science of underwater depth)  and an analysis of Rhode Island’s tides. You would need to establish what low-tide measurement to use — Lowest Astronomical Tide, Mean Low Water, or Mean Lower Low Water — then you’d have to check every point in the state at that designated low tide.   Or, you could commission a light detection and ranging airplane flight and measure all of the state’s shores using lasers and sensors within the span of the average hour-long low tide period. But this would cost ""hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" according to Bradley. We didn’t think our bosses would bankroll that kind of research.   We turned to Bryan Oakley, a geoscientist who studies glacial, coastal, and marine depositional environments at Eastern Connecticut State University. He was able to give us rough some numbers. Rhode Island is about 1,000 square miles, if you don’t include the water, as the state does in its  1,214 square mile figure. A 3-percent increase in size would be about 30 square miles, or roughly the size of Cranston.   ""This seems a tad unrealistic to me,"" Oakley said. Here’s Oakley’s cocktail-napkin analysis: Rhode Island has 400 miles of coastline. The intertidal zone, or the area on the shore covered at high tide and uncovered at low tide, is at most 50 feet wide. The fluctuation in size between tides is about 3.7 square miles at most, making the state .37 percent bigger at low tide, he said.   These numbers, he told us, are very rough and his guess is that Rhode Island is about .1 percent bigger at low tide. Labash and Bradley agreed. So did Jim Turenne, a soil scientist for the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service. Our Ruling:  On T-shirts and postcards, Treadwell writes: ""Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide."" She admits making that up. ""It’s like I know we’re weird and have problems but hey, we’re still here,"" Treadwell said.   Besides, who would buy a T-shirt saying: ""Rhode Island: 0.1% bigger at low tide?"" Nevertheless, it’s ruling time and this is certainly a ridiculous (although fanciful) claim.

N.C. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest says new state law HB2 prevented a bathroom free-for-all in Charlotte
","Conservative North Carolina lawmakers called a special legislative session in late March to overturn an LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance in Charlotte that would’ve gone into effect April 1. They ended up adding a lot more to the bill. But the original motivation was to prevent Charlotte, or any other local government, from allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with in public accommodations – such places as government facilities, hotels, restaurants and movie theaters. That and some of the bill’s other provisions have led to national criticism, from late-night talk show jokes to a canceled Bruce Springsteen concert and the loss of 400 jobs in Charlotte after PayPal pulled out in protest. Republicans have shot back, saying the bill was a common sense solution to safety and privacy concerns. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a key supporter of the new law, commonly known as HB2, went a bit further than most. He tweeted a picture from PayPal’s website that showed a bathroom door in the background, with a sign designating the room for men. ""This would be illegal under (the) Charlotte ordinance,"" Forest tweeted. He then doubled down, posting a screenshot of part of Charlotte’s now-defunct ordinance. ""Charlotte ordinance opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times when it removed exception for bath & locker rooms,"" Forest tweeted. It sounds odd. Charlotte officials say it’s completely untrue. Forest and his team, though, are sticking by their claims. Who is right? The answer isn’t relevant to Charlotte bathroom users anymore because the ordinance has been shot down, but it is relevant to the ongoing political fight over why Republicans felt compelled to overturn the ordinance. Private bathrooms First, let’s take a look at the claim that PayPal’s own gender-specific bathroom sign ""would be illegal"" in Charlotte if the city’s ordinance had been allowed to stand. It wouldn’t. Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance specifically said that ""this section does not apply to a private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public."" A PayPal corporate office is a private establishment. So no, it would not have been illegal for PayPal to have male and female restrooms in its own offices. By the same logic, Forest's statement that ""(the) Charlotte ordinance opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times"" is demonstrably false. The anti-discrimination law would have applied only to public accommodations. Those include places like government buildings, restaurants and hotels. Specifically, Charlotte’s proposed ordinance said the ""full and equal enjoyment"" of such places must not ""be refused, withheld from, or denied any person because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or national origin."" Previously, that ordinance only included race, color, religion and national origin. The city had also banned sex-based discrimination, but in a separate section that specifically exempted bathrooms and other such facilities. That section was stricken in the new ordinance, which Forest also cited in favor of his argument. Public bathrooms Forest was wrong about private bathrooms, but what about public bathrooms? Would the Charlotte law have opened them to ""all genders at all times?"" Here, the question gets a little more complex since Charlotte did eliminate the existing ordinance that had singled out bathrooms and locker rooms for exemptions. In February, Rep. Dan Bishop – the Mecklenburg County Republican who ultimately sponsored HB2 – sent out an email with claims similar to the ones Forest is making now. City officials replied in a memo that such claims were ""incorrect"" and ""counter to common sense."" City Attorney Robert Hagemann said the right to have separate bathrooms is implied in society and doesn’t need a local ordinance to confirm it. He added that no other city or state with similar anti-discrimination rules has argued that anyone could go into any bathroom, and that Charlotte officials never wanted to argue that, either. Forest’s press secretary Jamey Falkenbury said the argument for an implied right might be true for some places, but Charlotte would’ve been different because it specifically removed that right from its laws. ""When a legislative body removes an exception, they are indicating to the courts they do not want the former exception implied,"" he said. ""Hypothetically, if a man who identifies as a man in Charlotte was tried for trespassing for being in a women's bathroom, you better believe that any criminal defense attorney worth their salt would raise this as a defense."" But Hagemann said there would be wide-reaching consequences if Forest, Bishop and others were right that an all-inclusive protection for sex-based discrimination meant all bathrooms were opened to everyone. ""I understand that a similar argument was used by Phyllis Schlafly and other opponents of the Equal Rights Amendment back in the late 1970s,"" he wrote in an email. ""... And if their reasoning is correct, every employer covered by Title VII, including the State of North Carolina, could not provide separate restrooms for their employees since Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sex in the workplace."" Our ruling Forest, a vocal opponent of Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance, said it would have ""opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times."" That is wrong. The ordinance would not have applied to private clubs or businesses – including PayPal, despite Forest’s claims to the contrary. The ordinance would have applied only to public accommodations. And while there’s disagreement on what might have happened with bathrooms in public accommodations, precedent is on Charlotte’s side.

Jorge Ramos echoes count of 80 journalists killed in Mexico since 2006, but tallies vary
","Before moderating the March 9, 2016 Washington Post-Univision Democratic presidential debate, journalist Jorge Ramos, a Univision news anchor who works out of Miami, met with NPR’s Steve Inskeep, to talk about ""Take A Stand,"" his book recounting his experiences as a journalist. During the interview, Ramos commented on differences between being a reporter in the United States and Latin America. He noted the safety concerns of what it’s like to interview U.S. presidents versus presidents or dictators in Latin American countries. ""When you have 80 journalists who have been killed in Mexico, for instance, in the last decade, yeah, you realize how lucky we are here in the United States in which you can go to the White House, talk to the president and go back to your house,"" Ramos said. ""And then you can take a bike ride and go to the supermarket and no one is going to kill you. No one is going to do anything against you. That's a huge difference."" It’s no secret: Mexico can be unsafe for journalists, including Americans. The Committee to Protect Journalists lists two cases of American journalists dying in Mexico in connection with their jobs. In 2006, Bradley Will, a freelance journalist, was shot while covering a protest. Before that, in 1998, San Antonio Express-News’ Mexico City correspondent Philip True was killed on a trail between remote villages while reporting on Huichol Indians. So, was Ramos right about the number of journalists lately felled in Mexico? That depends on who’s counting and if (or how) deaths are confirmed as work-connected. Ramos offers backup To our inquiry, Ramos said by phone that he mainly relied on nonprofits that gather such data such as the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which promotes press freedom as it tracks journalist deaths, and the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, which works for press freedom and tallies journalist deaths. We shortly learned that pinning down deaths in Mexico as journalism-related can be slippery. For starters, a person who declined to give her full name on the Reporters Without Borders’ Latin America desk emailed a list of 52 journalists it says it confirmed as killed in Mexico from 2006 into 2016 in connection with their work. Then again, Emmanuel Colombié, the head of Reporters Without Borders’ Latin America desk, said in an email that the group has previously gotten to a count of 80 deaths by counting all journalists killed in Mexico -- including those whose deaths weren't proved as work-related. Meantime, a list posted by the Committee to Protect Journalists indicates 62 journalist killings in Mexico from March 9, 2006 through Feb. 20, 2016. However, the committee says only 24 deaths were confirmed as occurring because of the victim’s work as a journalist. In those cases, the group says, they are ""reasonably certain that a journalist was murdered in direct reprisal for his or her work; was killed in crossfire during combat situations; or was killed while carrying out a dangerous assignment such as coverage of a street protest."" The other 38 deaths had unconfirmed motives, the committee says, meaning ""it is possible that a journalist was killed because of his or her work."" Carlos Lauría, the group’s New York-based Americas program coordinator, said by phone its ""motive confirmed"" estimates are likely more conservative than others, due to the group’s vetting. ""I think that the complexity of the crisis in Mexico is so profound,"" Lauría said. ""There are so many factors involved in some of these cases."" Lauria said some such factors include things like whether the journalist was only working as a journalist and not holding other jobs or participating in activities that could cause a threat to his or her safety, if the reporter was working on issues that would put him or her at risk. Ramos also pointed to articles he’d seen with numbers around 80. One, published by Univision on Dec. 23, 2012 , says 82 journalists have been killed in the country since 2005, citing the Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos (CNDH), Mexico’s national human rights commission. Others from CNN Mexico and El Universal, a newspaper in Mexico, both citing Reporters Without Borders, put the count at or over 80 – though we noticed these reported figures didn’t reflect the group’s lower tallies as of April 2016. Other analyses Our hunt for additional research yielded a couple lists delivering a total close to what Ramos declared. But counts vary. To get started, we turned to the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas at the University of Texas where Teresa Mioli guided us to recommended organizations offering counts suggesting 60 to 89 journalists had been killed in Mexico since 2006. By email, Mioli advised that variations in counts reflect different filters used by groups to classify deaths. ""For example,"" Mioli wrote, ""some organizations only count journalists who were killed because of their work, while others also include journalists killed during protests or in combat. Some also count journalists who are in car accidents on their way to cover a story or who are killed while at work. ""The numbers may also vary,"" Mioli wrote, ""because one organization only counts journalists, while another counts all media workers. And finally, sometimes it's difficult to determine if the journalist was killed because of their investigations or opinions, for a reason unrelated to their work or if they are a random victim of a crime, especially in countries where violence is more rampant."" Generally, it’s worth noting, the definition of journalist includes reporters, broadcasters, editors, photographers and others involved in news-gathering: On the high end, the International Federation of Journalists, a group that ""monitors press freedom violations"" and releases an annual report on journalists and media staff killed, says there were 89 journalist deaths in Mexico from March 9, 2006 through Feb. 9, 2016, as well as the 2007 death of a driver. The group says it looks at cases that ""include targeted killings, crossfire lethal incidents as well as work-related accidents which result in loss of life."" Artículo 19 Mexico, a group that says it promotes and defends freedom of expression, pointed us to its own infographic identifying 76 journalists killed in Mexico, possibly in connection with their work, from January 6, 2006 through Feb. 20, 2016. Single-year highs of 10 were killed in both 2006 and 2008 with fewer felled in other years; as few as three were taken down in 2007 and the first part of 2016, according to the graphic. Sandra Patargo, deputy officer of the Protection Program of Artículo 19 Mexico, explained by phone that the group requires at least three sources – such as a family member, a boss or coworkers – to confirm a death was related to the victim's work as a journalist. The International Press Institute, a network of global media professionals, produces a yearly ""Death Watch"" of journalists ""deliberately targeted because of their profession."" We sifted the lists and counted 62 deaths of journalists in Mexico from March 9, 2006 through May 2, 2015, the latest date shown for Mexico. UNESCO identifies 60 journalists killed from March 14, 2006 through Feb. 20, 2016 when, it says, a radio ""presenter,"" Moisés Dagdug Lutzow, was killed. Source of Tally Journalists Killed in Mexico International Federation of Journalists 89 March 9, 2006 to Feb. 9, 2016 Artículo 19 Mexico 76 Jan. 6, 2006 to Feb. 20, 2016 International Press Institute 62 March 9, 2006 to May 2, 2015 UNESCO 60 March 14, 2006 to Feb. 20, 2016 Committee to Protect Journalists (Death related to job confirmed) 24 Oct. 27, 2006 to Jan. 21, 2016 Committee to Protect Journalists (Death related to job unconfirmed) 38 March 9, 2006 to Feb. 20, 2016 Reporters Without Borders (Death related to job confirmed) 52 March 9, 2006 to Feb. 20, 2016 SOURCES: Emails, telephone interviews and lists and reports posted online (received, conducted and accessed by PolitiFact Texas March-April 2016) Merging lists Next, we made a run at merging the lists, bringing together every name to find there may have been more than 100 journalists killed in Mexico from 2006 into the first part of 2016. We’d caution, though, that we didn’t judge how many died in connection with their work. We lack that expertise. When we circled back to Ramos, he agreed some of the published counts didn’t match his declared ""80."" We noted that all told, there may be considerably fewer journalist deaths over the decade confirmed as work-related. By email, Ramos replied: ""The fact is that Mexico is an incredibly dangerous country to be a journalist."" Whatever the exact count, we’re not discounting any of the enumerated deaths. A little perspective: According to CPJ, three journalists were killed in the U.S. from 2006 through 2015 in connection with their work. Our ruling Ramos, expressing safety concerns about Mexico, said 80 journalists were killed there in the last decade. Our merger of lists from watchdog groups suggests that more than 100 people connected to journalism (not all of them journalists) died in the country from 2006 into 2016. But Ramos was clearly speaking to journalists killed at, or due to, their work. Apply that filter and the count diminishes to as few as 24 deaths confirmed as related to reporting work though we also gathered counts of 52 to 89, perhaps an indication different groups take considerably different approaches. No doubt, journalists in Mexico can face peril. But a decade-long count of killings is not as straightforward as Ramos’ figure would suggest. We rate his statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Jack Graham says 'it's clear' Hillary Clinton 'violated national security laws,' but it's not clear
","During a debate among Republicans seeking to be Colorado's U.S. Senate nominee, candidate Jack Graham blasted Hillary Clinton's use of personal email as secretary of state. ""It's clear she's lied to us about her emails, that she's violated national security laws in that regard,"" Graham said in the debate on 9NEWS. We’re focusing on Graham’s claim that ""it’s clear...she violated national security laws."" Questions about whether Clinton mishandled classified information have dogged her frontrunner pursuit of the Democratic presidential nomination. But what Graham states as a clear-cut fact is very much in dispute. We’ll delve into Clinton’s email problems to explain why. The media learned in the summer of 2014 that Clinton exclusively used a private email account as secretary of state. That’s when State Department officials were responding to a records request from the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Its members were interested in how Clinton’s email choices may have affected the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya and its aftermath.    In July 2015, the inspector generals for the Intelligence Community and the State Department -- both of whom are independent of their respective agencies -- sent what is called a security referral to the Justice Department. A security referral is essentially a notification that classified information might be stored outside of the government’s secure network. In this case, the location was Clinton’s private email server located at her New York home. FBI agents were assigned to look into the security setup for Clinton’s home email server and a thumb drive that contained copies of Clinton’s work emails. But what started as a security review soon became an investigation into whether anyone had committed a crime in handling classified information, the New York Times reported, citing multiple, anonymous law enforcement officials. Clinton has apologized for what happened: ""Yes, I should have used two email addresses, one for personal matters and one for my work at the State Department. Not doing so was a mistake. I’m sorry about it, and I take full responsibility."" She has maintained that ""nothing I ever sent or received was marked classified at the time."" The situation with Clinton’s email is downright confusing -- for several reasons. As PolitiFact has reported, federal agencies have the ability to classify information after the fact. So some of the emails weren’t classified when Clinton sent or received them, but they were later classified after a government review. On top of that, government agencies regularly disagree over what should be classified. Independent inspectors general have said Clinton’s emails contain some classified intelligence information, but the Clinton campaign and the State Department dispute those findings -- saying the information was not classified. Meanwhile, the State Department has released more than 50,000 of Clinton’s emails, which the public can search on the agency’s website. Overall, 2,093 of the emails were redacted because they contained some classified details. Most were rated ""confidential,"" the lowest classification level. But the State Department has said that, at the request of intelligence agencies, 22 emails were deemed ""top secret,"" and will not be made public, the Washington Post reported.   Some of the released emails show Clinton’s State Department team cautiously avoiding emailing each other classified information. Senior adviser Alec Ross noted in a February 2010 email that he was keeping his comments ""within the boundaries of unclassified email… regarding the country we discussed."" But Clinton’s defense that she never sent or received email that was ""marked classified at the time"" doesn’t wash with Ronald J. Sievert, a former federal prosecutor and with experience in national security issues who now teaches at the University of Texas School of Law. In a USA TODAY commentary, Sievert called the defense a ""smokescreen,"" saying the relevant federal law ""does not even once mention the word ‘classified.’ "" Instead, the law makes it a crime for anyone ""entrusted with … any document ... or information relating to the national defense … through gross negligence (to permit) the same to be removed from its proper place of custody,"" he writes. ""The courts have held repeatedly that ‘national defense information’ includes closely held military, foreign policy and intelligence information and that evidence that the information is classified is not necessary for a prosecution."" Few details have become public about the ongoing FBI investigation. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department has granted immunity to a former State Department staffer in exchange for his cooperation in the investigation. The former employee, Bryan Pagliano, installed the email server in Clinton’s New York home in 2009. He also worked on her 2008 presidential campaign. The Post, citing current and former officials, also reported that FBI agents working to wrap up the investigation in the coming months are likely to want to interview Clinton and her senior aides about the decision to use a private server, how it was set up, and whether any of the participants knew they were sending classified information in emails. An expert in government secrecy says nothing revealed to date supports Senate candidate Jack Graham’s assertion that ""it’s clear"" Clinton violated national security laws. ""It is not at all clear that Clinton violated any national security law, and Mr. Graham did not indicate what law he had in mind,"" said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. ""The laws that govern classified information are a patchwork of statutes dating back as long as a century ago (before today's classification system even existed), and their application is often unclear,"" Aftergood said. ""But most of those statutes require criminal intent in order to commit a violation. There is no known evidence of criminal intent on Clinton's part. If Mr. Graham has such evidence, he should immediately provide it to law enforcement officials."" Graham’s campaign manager Dick Wadhams sent us this message when we asked for evidence: ""I am confident you are very familiar with this Clinton controversy and by googling ‘Hillary Clinton Email Scandal’ or similar words you will find a multitude of sources that agree with Jack Graham and his statement."" Our ruling Graham said: ""It’s clear ... she violated national security laws."" Hypothetically, the evidence may someday support Graham’s accusation against Clinton. But at this time, there is no clear evidence that Clinton has broken the law. No one has been charged with a crime in this case -- let alone convicted. Graham goes too far in stating that possibility as fact. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2016/apr/08/Jack_Graham/jack-graham-says-its-clearhillary-clinton-violated/

Hillary Clinton says Bernie Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns
","Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders is putting gun manufacturers ahead of the Sandy Hook victims, says opponent Hillary Clinton. Twenty school-age children were killed in the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Now, some family members of the victims are attempting to sue gun manufacturer Remington, which produced shooter Adam Lanza’s weapon, as well as the wholesaler and a local retailer. But it’s questionable whether this lawsuit will be able to proceed, given a 2005 law that put restrictions on the gun industry’s liability for crimes committed using their products. As Clinton often points out, she voted against this law, while Sanders voted for it. ""I voted against it,"" Clinton said on CNN April 6. ""President Obama voted against it. Because clearly it was an effort to bypass legal accountability. And so here we have this remarkable situation where you cannot question the liability or the behavior of gunmakers and sellers. I thought Sen. Chris Murphy from Connecticut really summed it up. He said Sen. Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns."" The claim that Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns caught our attention. We wondered if Sanders’ support for this law indicates that he thinks toy manufacturers should be more open to lawsuits than gun manufacturers. We talked to a number of experts on gun law and products liability, and they disagreed over whether Clinton is standing on solid ground. A liability gap? The law at issue is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused, meaning if a gun dealer legally sells a person a gun, and then the buyer uses the gun to commit a crime, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. The law arose after victims, cities and states started to bring lawsuits against gunmakers that pursued new legal paths, such as one that argued manufacturers Glock Inc. and China North Industries had oversaturated the market, producing so many guns that it was inevitable some would fall into criminal hands. Most judges dismissed these kinds of lawsuits, but a minority allowed them to proceed. There are several situations that are not protected from lawsuits under the law. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. Opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court because the liability immunity is so broad and ambiguous, while the exceptions are narrow. Supporters, though, say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. We’ve written before that Congress has passed laws giving some other industries varying levels of immunity. A couple experts told us Clinton’s statement is unsound because the law sought to impose equivalent, rather than fewer, standards for gun makers that are already established for manufacturers of other products. As it stands, the victim of a crime committed with a toy — say, if a person seriously injured another person by shooting them with bb gun pellets — generally cannot sue the toy manufacturer, just as they can’t sue Toyota or Budweiser if they’re struck by a drunk person driving a Prius. The 2005 law ""basically put gun manufacturers in the same position that other product manufacturers are in,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""They’re responsible for defectively manufactured and designed products but not for failing to prevent criminal misuse of their products."" Additionally, toy guns and real guns pose fundamentally different risks because real guns are much more likely to be used in a crime than a toy gun, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor who edited a book on suing gun industry. So before the law, the gun industry was subject to a wider range of liability that just doesn’t apply to a toy. As such, it’s hard to imagine a realistic incident with a toy gun that would cause someone to bring a suit against the toy company, yet they would not be able to sue a gun manufacturer for an equivalent situation involving a real gun. A hypothetical situation might be if a city experienced an epidemic of deaths or injuries that resulted from a prevalence of realistic-looking toy guns; think of the recent story of Tamir Rice, a Cleveland child carrying a toy gun who a police officer shot and killed, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of civil procedure at the University of Connecticut School of Law. In that case, a city might want to bring a suit against the toy gun manufacturer or seller for creating a public nuisance. But under the 2005 law, a city cannot sue a gun company if there is an epidemic of people being injured or killed by their guns. Lahav added, though, that she thinks the idea someone would bring a suit like this against a toy company is highly unlikely. In theory, there might be a liability gap between toy guns and real guns, but that wouldn't necessarily play out in reality, she said. Toy and real gun manufactures can be sued for product defects that cause injury when the product is used as intended. But if an injury is caused by a product defect coupled with a criminal misuse of the product, a toy gun manufacturer could be held liable, but a real gun manufacturer could not under the 2005 law, said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor and an expert in the Second Amendment. That limits the gun industry’s incentives to make their products as safe as possible. The fact that a party cannot even attempt to bring these kinds of lawsuits against real gun manufacturers sets them apart from other industries, including toys, said Mark Geistfeld, a law professor at New York University and an expert in products liability. Such lawsuits against the gun industry might be destined to fail, but the 2005 law doesn’t even allow for the arguments to be tested. ""You’ve granted an immunity to the gun industry that you haven’t granted to any other industry,"" Geistfeld said of Sanders, noting that this supports the gist of Clinton’s point: that Sanders holds guns to a lower standard. Lytton noted, though, that he would not presume to know whether Sanders would grant similar immunity to the toy industry if the opportunity arose. ""It’s not fair to basically enter into hyperbole that somehow he treated firearms differently he would come down harder on toy guns,"" Lytton said. Consumer safety votes We also wanted to note another piece of evidence the Clinton campaign sent us to show that Sanders supports higher standards for toy guns. They pointed to Sanders’ congressional votes in favor of the 1993 Child Safety Protection Act and the 2008 Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, both of which became law. These bills dealt with things like putting warning labels on toys with choking hazards, increasing civil penalties on companies that produce defective products, and limiting lead in toys. Experts told us that these votes do not have any impact on Clinton’s argument one way or another because they are about product safety regulations, which are a totally different ballgame than tort law and product liability. Though he thinks Clinton’s claim is on point because of the points discussed earlier, Geistfeld called these votes a red herring. ""You don’t have to love that (2005) law to see that it’s a very different thing,"" said Lahav of the University of Connecticut. ""I would have never thought to compare these things."" Our ruling Clinton said Sanders ""wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns."" Clinton points to the fact that Sanders voted in favor of a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively.   This is a complex legal question, on which reasonable minds can disagree. Given this disagreement, and the fact that it’s impossible to know how Sanders would vote if a similar legislation concerning the toy industry were to arise, we rate Clinton’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-wants-higher-s/

Fact-checking Bill Clinton’s Philly defense of his controversial crime bill
","Bill Clinton’s now-controversial 1994 crime bill was at the center of a clash Thursday between the former president and protesters in Philadelphia in which Clinton defended the bill, saying it was the reason behind huge drops in crime rates by the end of his presidency. ""Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this,"" Clinton responded Thursday, ""because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence. And how do you think those lives were, that mattered? Whose lives were saved, that mattered?"" But can the decreases in crime since the late 1980s really be attributed to Clinton’s signature legislation? Here’s what we found. During Bill Clinton’s campaign stop for his wife in Philadelphia on April 7, a protester with the Philadelphia Coalition for Real Justice yelled questions at the former president while another held a sign that read ""Clinton crime bill destroyed our community."" The protester, later identified as Erica Mines, criticized the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act that provided for higher federal funding for prison facilities that some say ushered in mass incarceration in America. The former president continued defending the bill, asking the protesters whether they were really defending criminals. ""I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out into the street to murder other African American children,"" he told the protesters. ""Maybe you thought they were good citizens — [Hillary Clinton] didn’t."" At a campaign stop the next day in Erie, Pa., Bill Clinton issued an apology of sorts, saying he ""rather vigorously defended"" his wife. ""I did something yesterday in Philadelphia,"" he said, according to MSNBC. ""I almost want to apologize for it, but I want to use it as an example of the danger threatening our country."" In addition to prison funding, the crime bill also expanded the use of the death penalty, provided states with incentives to implement harsher sentences on criminals and established the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which provided grants to fund up to 75 percent of new police hires for three years. As Bill Clinton said, the crime rate at the end of his presidency was the lowest in two decades and statistics published in a 2000 report on homicide trends from the Bureau of Justice Statistics show the murder rate had ""declined to levels last seen in the late 1960s."" But experts say the decline in crime during Clinton’s time in the White House can’t all be attributed to the 1994 crime bill. Crime rates nationally began to drop just before the passage of the crime bill, in 1992. Multiple academic reports on the topic begin with 1991 to trace when recorded incidents began to slip. There are several factors, researchers find, that could have caused this fall in crime. In fact, researchers don’t entirely agree on which factors had the greatest impact. Our analysis can find this consensus: the drop cannot be solely attributed to the crime bill, and the size of the crime bill’s contribution, while arguable, may not be higher than a third, according to more favorable analyses, if not marginal overall, per more conservative accounts. For starters, here are some other debated but commonly acknowledged factors. Through 1991 to 1993, the ‘90s boom began, creating more job opportunities in the low-wage sector. The impact of the the crack epidemic entering its death knell has also been cited. The crime bill created 100,000 new jobs for cops, but the number of police officers in the U.S. rose by 50,000 to 60,000 per capita over the decade, a 14 percent increase. By the end of Clinton’s time in the White House, the number of incarcerated Americans rose by nearly 60 percent, according to figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. A 2015 study by NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice found that ""increased incarceration at today’s levels has a negligible crime control benefit."" According to the researchers, increased incarceration accounted for about 6 percent of the drop in property crime in the 1990s and had little impact on nationwide decreases in violent crime. Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, said the crime bill’s investment in local police forces did contribute to a decrease in crime rates, but mass incarceration played a smaller role in driving decreases in crime. She suggested the the drops could also be attributed to improved technology in policing techniques and changes in social and economic factors like an aging population and a decrease in alcohol consumption. Other studies also suggest mass incarceration leads to ""diminishing returns,"" meaning the practice may have had a larger impact on decreasing crime rates when it was first implemented, but those results slowly decrease over time. A 2014 study from the Hamilton Project, an offshoot of the Brookings Institution, called mass incarceration and crime control ""a classic case of diminishing marginal returns."" Marc Lamont Hill, a political commentator and professor of African American studies at Morehouse College, told CNN Thursday ""there's absolutely no empirical evidence to suggest that crime bill was the causal factor that made crime go down."" ""You can cherry pick anecdotes, a bunch of anecdotes together and it doesn't make it data,"" Hill said. ""The data does not bear out."" Hillary Clinton has somewhat separated herself from her husband’s legislation. ""It's time to change our approach,"" she said during a talk on criminal justice last year. ""It's time to end the era of mass incarceration. We need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe."" Bill Clinton’s defense of the crime bill comes less than a year after he appeared at a national convention for the NAACP when he issued a mea culpa of sorts over his own bill. ""I signed a bill that made the problem worse,"" he said in July 2015 in Philadelphia. ""And I want to admit that."" Our ruling In a heated exchange with protesters in Philadelphia, Bill Clinton defended his 1994 crime bill saying ""because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this, because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence."" Experts and studies haven’t reached consensus on what caused the historic drops in crime. But they do roundly agree that it can’t all be attributed to Clinton’s 1994 crime bill. In fact, most suggest the crime bill’s role in the drop was negligible. We rule the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/apr/08/bill-clinton/fact-checking-bill-clintons-philly-defense-his-con/

Donald Trump claims most wire transfers to Mexico are from undocumented immigrants
","Donald Trump’s new plan to get Mexico to pay for a wall along the Southern border is drawing comments from all sides. Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said if the plan works, it’s ""fantastic."" President Barack Obama, on the other hand, called it ""half-baked."" The plan, released on April 5, 2016, reads as a series of hypotheticals. Trump claims barring undocumented immigrants from sending wire transfers would entice Mexico to pay for the wall. ""They (Mexico) receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens,"" Trump said. In turn, Trump argues that he would not let the wire transfer ban go into effect if Mexico contributes ""the funds needed to the United States to pay for the wall."" We were curious as to whether most Mexican wire transfers, using services such as Western Union, come from undocumented immigrants. Hard to tell We did not hear back from Trump’s press office but readily found data on remittances -- or how much money is transferred from the United States to Mexico. According to Bank of Mexico, there was $24.77 billion in remittances to Mexico in 2015. So Trump’s first claim checks out, but the second part is not that simple. ""We don’t know of any estimate by any organization or researcher of what share of remittance senders are unauthorized immigrants – or indeed are immigrants of any legal status,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. ""Keep in mind that some number of U.S. born who are of Mexican heritage might also still send remittances."" San Diego State University economics professor Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes worked on a paper on remittances published in the 2005 Economic Review. The paper estimates that 75 percent of undocumented Mexican immigrants have the probability to remit money. It also notes that these immigrants send almost $439 a month on average to Mexico. The Pew Research Center estimates that there are 5.6 million undocumented Mexican immigrants living in the United States as of 2014. Using these three numbers, Alfredo Cuecuecha Mendoza, an economic expert and president of El Colegio de Tlaxcala, A.C. in Mexico, estimates that 48 percent of remittances are sent by undocumented Mexican immigrants. Overall, Pew estimates that there are 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Amuedo-Dorantes said undocumented immigrants are more likely to remit money than documented immigrants, who are often settled with their family in the United States. ""That said, it is also the case that legal migrants have better paying jobs and, in absolute terms, are able to remit more than the undocumented.  So I am not sure his (Trump’s ) statement is correct,"" she said. Manuel Orozco, a remittance expert at Washington D.C. think tank Inter-American Dialogue, said it is ""not possible"" to say how much of the billions Mexico receives from remittances come from undocumented immigrants. ""Sounds like a guess to me,"" said Roy Germano, a remittance expert and international relations professor at New York University. Our ruling Trump said, ""they (Mexico) receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens."" The number is right, but saying the majority of that money comes from undocumented immigrants is a pure guess. One estimate, based on data more than a decade old, could associate 48 percent of remittances with undocumented Mexican immigrants. But that’s a stretch at best -- and it’s still not the majority -- as Trump claims. Experts we spoke with said there is no way to track undocumented remittance senders.

""Last year, I worked with my colleagues to end funding for federal Race to the Top grants, which require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding,"" he said on his campaign website. The Common Core State Standards are a set of shared guidelines in English and math designed to prepare students for college and to unify educational goals nationwide. They’ve become an unpopular subject with many conservatives. We decided to test Jolly’s assertion that states had to adopt the Common Core in order to win federal grants. Race to the Top Our lesson begins with a primer on Common Core. In 2007, the Council of Chief State School Officers considered creating state-based standards that could be shared nationwide. The idea was that a high school diploma from Tennessee would then have the same value as one from Idaho or New Mexico. Two years later, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to develop what was called Common Core with input from teachers, parents and education experts. President Barack Obama’s signature education program, Race to the Top, invited states to compete for grant money from the 2009 federal economic stimulus. States had to show they were committed to improving educational standards and performance and implement reforms to win the cash. The final Common Core guidelines came out in 2010, and states could decide to use them or ignore them. Forty-five states decided to accept the standards. Minnesota adopted the English standards, but not the math guidelines. Indiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina agreed to use Common Core at first, but later backed off the plan. Jolly’s assertion is that the application process demanded states adopt Common Core to get a grant. That isn’t the case. Committing to Common Core was not a stipulation of winning a grant, but it did factor into the application process. The Education Department gave states that had adopted a set of standards extra points (40 of a possible 500) when competing for grants. The shorthand was, if you had adopted Common Core, you had a better chance at hitting the federal grant lottery. Jolly’s campaign pointed out the guidelines for the grant process that said applicants had to show a ""commitment to adopting a common set of high-quality standards."" They reasoned that almost all of the 19 eventual grant winners (including Florida, which won $700 million in August 2010) had adopted Common Core before winning grants. But experts told us there was no demand that states adopt Common Core before Washington would hand over funding. And even then, there was no requirement for actually implementing them. Delaware, for example, won its grant in March 2010, but didn’t adopt Common Core until August of that year. Tennessee also won in March 2010, but adopted them in July of that year. Daniel Thatcher, a senior policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said Washington has subsequently been accused of coercing states into adopting Common Core. In 2015, a federal judge rejected former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s coercion claims in a lawsuit he brought against the Education Department, which his successor has since ended. Common Core did have supporters in Washington, although they often were careful about not using the term Common Core. But many state legislators and teachers unions and education reformers approved of Common Core at the time, too. (For the record, even Jindal once was a Common Core advocate before changing his mind and suing the federal government.) ""For any single state, it's difficult to know whether Race to the Top merely rewarded an applicant for doing something it was already inclined to do, or whether the competition changed behavior in any material way,"" University of Chicago political science professor William Howell said in an email. He noted the timing of the grants during the recession may have potentially spurred some states into action to shore up finances, leading them to adopt Common Core to get a leg up. ""It's hard not to conclude that features of the competition were at least partially responsible,"" Howell said. Congress stripped funding for Race to the Top state grants out of the spending bill it passed in December 2014. Jolly voted for the measure. His campaign said Jolly helped keep funding out of the following year’s bill after he joined the House Appropriations Committee in January 2015. Obama did not ask for Race to the Top funding in his FY 2016 budget proposal. The remaining funds for the grant program expired in September 2015. In December 2015, Jolly also voted in favor of the Every Student Succeeds Act. That bill, signed by Obama, specifically said the Secretary of Education ""shall not attempt to influence, incentivize, or coerce State adoption of the Common Core State Standards."" Our ruling Jolly said Race to the Top grants ""require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding."" Adopting education guidelines — Common Core or otherwise — was an element of a state’s overall application score and would add to point totals. Common Core critics have since accused Washington of coercing states. But there was no concrete requirement to adopt standards in exchange for grant money. Experts told us the promise of federal money during the recession may have spurred Common Core adoption in some places, but there’s no way to know that for sure. We rate Jolly’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/apr/08/david-jolly/common-core-required-win-obama-grants-us-rep-da/

John Kasich claims 'no rules' in place for picking GOP presidential nominee at convention
","Tell John Kasich he should drop out because he can’t amass enough delegates in the primaries and caucuses to win the Republican nomination for president, and he has a ready response. The Ohio governor will tell you he’s the GOP candidate best positioned to beat Hillary Clinton, should she be the Democratic nominee. So, the Kasich campaign forges on, with this hope: Neither Donald Trump nor Ted Cruz will earn the required 1,237 delegates prior to the party’s convention in July 2016 to win the nomination outright. That scenario would mean an ""open"" or ""contested"" convention in Cleveland, with Kasich aiming to persuade delegates to make him the nominee. On April 3, 2016, two days before he failed to win any delegates in Wisconsin’s primary, Kasich made a claim on ABC’s ""This Week"" that, if true, could bolster his chances to be the nominee. It was made during this exchange with host George Stephanopoulos: Stephanopoulos: You still have won only one state, however it is. You know under the current rules of the Republican National Committee, your only hope is to get to a contested convention. But under the current rules, you wouldn't even be eligible for the nomination, because you haven't picked up a majority of delegates in eight states. It doesn't appear that you're going to be able to do that. So how do you intend to get that rule changed? Kasich: Well, first of all, George, I'm not going to spend time on process. I have some of the best process people, you know, whether it's John Weaver or Charlie Black or Stu Spencer. But there are no rules governing the next convention. The rules have not been set. And we'll see what a rules committee decides to do. But I expect that we're going to be gaining momentum, picking up delegates and heading into the convention. What we found is Kasich is mostly on target. The 2016 convention will essentially start with the same rules that were in place for the 2012 convention. But then the rules can be changed. The process If all this sounds rather nerdy, consider that Google searches for ""Republican convention rules"" shot up by a factor of 100 in March 2016. As PolitiFact National explained in a primer on delegates, here’s what happens: On the Republican convention’s first ballot, nearly all of the 2,472 delegates are obligated to vote for the candidate who won their district or state. But if no candidate nabs the 1,237 votes needed on the first ballot, most delegates are released to support whomever they want on subsequent votes. Then there’s the 112 members of the rules committee. They determine convention guidelines, and they have the power to change rules at the convention. Should Trump (the GOP front runner, in terms of delegates) fail to nab the majority of delegates on the first ballot —  and at this point, that looks entirely possible — the race becomes a fight for the support of those on the convention floor. Josh Putnam, one of the experts quoted in the primer, filled in a few more of the blanks for us. Putnam, who is a political science lecturer at the University of Georgia and founder of Frontloading HQ blog, which tracks the presidential primary calendar, said: The convention writes, tweaks and adopts its own rules. (But) the standard procedure is that the convention rules from one convention carry over to the next. There may be some subtle changes, but they largely carry over. So while there are only temporary rules now, they can serve as the baseline set of rules for this convention. As for the possibility of changing Rule 40 (b) -- Stephanopoulos’ reference to the requirement that a GOP candidate win eight states to be eligible for the nomination -- that has already been discussed. Politico reported in March 2016 that according to current and former Republican National Committee rules committee members, a Republican presidential candidate likely won’t have to abide by that rule. No number is in effect for the Cleveland convention, according to former Republican National Committee lawyer Ben Ginsberg, whom the article described as the party's preeminent election law expert. He said: ""The 2016 convention and its rules committee has to make that decision. So there is no eight-state rule in effect right now for the next convention. The 2016 convention can make that number one, eight, 18, 28 or 58, if it wishes."" Curly Haugland, a member of the convention’s rules committee from North Dakota, told Politico that rules 26 through 42 stood for the 2012 convention but are only temporary until the rules committee and order of business reports are adopted at the 2016 convention. In other words, those rules could remain, or they could be changed. Moreover, it’s still to be determined who will serve on the rules committee in Cleveland. Each state and territory delegation chooses two delegates to serve on the rules committee. Lest there be any debate about the potential for rules to be changed, the Republican National Committee itself says: A week before the convention, the 2016 Convention Rules Committee must convene to put together a package of rules to recommend for consideration by all delegates.   The committee, after debate and discussion, adopts by majority vote a package of recommended rules that moves to the convention floor. Once a majority of the convention delegates adopt the report, the rules become the permanent rules governing that Convention. Our rating Kasich said ""there are no rules governing"" the 2016 Republican convention, ""the rules have not been set."" The 2016 convention will essentially start with the same rules that were in place for the 2012 convention. But the new rules committee for the 2016 convention can change any of the rules.

Fact-checking Trump ad on Democrats, health care for immigrants illegally in the country
","Ahead of the second night of Democratic presidential debates hosted by CNN, an ad from President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign took a stab at the candidates and their response to a previous debate question about immigrants and health care. A claim in the 30-second ad centered on a question posed by Savannah Guthrie, TODAY co-anchor and one of the moderators of a June 27 debate in Miami. The ad starts with video of Guthrie asking: ""Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants."" All candidates on stage raised their hands. On stage that night were: author Marianne Williamson; former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, entrepreneur Andrew Yang; South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado; and Rep. Eric Swalwell of California. (Swalwell has since dropped out.) ""They are all the same,"" Trump’s ad said over the image of the candidates raising their hands. ""These Democrats support giving illegal immigrants free health care at our expense."" The ad then goes to another image of a group of people — presumably immigrants on their way to the United States illegally — walking in a field. ""Spending taxpayer dollars covering illegal immigrants,"" the ad said over that image. Is it true that Democrats at a June debate said they support free health care — at the expense of taxpayers — for immigrants illegally in the United States? The ad is misleading. Candidates were asked whether their health care plans would cover immigrants here illegally. They were not, however, directly asked if that coverage would be free. By looking at candidates’ statements that night and at their individual platforms, we can get a better understanding of exactly how this notion that they support ""free"" coverage is not exactly right. Some of the candidates on stage that night support Medicare for All. Sanders’ version of it is a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. There would be no out-of-pocket costs to individuals — no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance — but anyone with a job or self-employed would pay into the system through taxes. In that sense, coverage would not be free for anyone who works. (Some immigrants in the country illegally pay income taxes.) Candidates in favor of Medicare for All share the goal of universal coverage but some are wary of a full replacement of the current mix of private and public insurance. Some candidates favor a plan that allows people to keep their private insurance and buy into a ""public option."" Also, Sanders’ 2017 Medicare for All bill said that the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be the one to set residency requirements for coverage eligibility. At this point, there isn’t a rule for purposes of health care coverage that outlines the U.S. residency criteria. Question and answer at the June debate Health care was a key topic of the June 27 debate in Miami and at some point, Guthrie turned the conversation to coverage for people here illegally. Below is a transcript of that exchange. Guthrie: ""A lot of you have been talking tonight about these government health care plans that you proposed in one form or another. This is a show of hands question. And hold them up for a moment so people can see. Raise your hand if — if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants."" All candidates on stage raised their hands. Guthrie then asked Buttigieg to support his affirmative answer. Buttigieg: ""Our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we’re talking about something people are getting a — given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care."" Guthrie then asked Biden to comment. Biden: ""You cannot let — as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can’t do that. It’s just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It’s the humane thing to do. ""But here’s the deal. The deal is that he’s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also — for example, they’ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they’re — they have a job. They’re paying the Social Security tax. That’s what they’re doing. It’s increased the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they’re in extremis."" No other candidate commented on that question. So all candidates raised their hands affirming they’d have a plan that would offer coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. But the question did not directly ask if coverage would be free. Buttigieg specifically said people would buy the coverage, and that it was ""not about a handout."" Biden in his answer spoke about the contributions of immigrants in the country illegally — and said that if they had health care coverage, they’d be reducing the cost of the overall health care system. Our ruling A Trump re-election campaign ad said Democratic presidential candidates ""support giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense."" This is misleading. The claim is based on a raise-your-hand type of question in a June debate. Candidates were asked if their health care plans would provide coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. All candidates raised their hand. But the question did not ask if the coverage would be for free. Two of the candidates who were able to provide context — Buttigieg and Biden — did not say it would be for free. Some candidates on stage that night support universal health care coverage, through Medicare for All. But there isn’t agreement among all candidates on the provisions of that type of coverage. A version of Medicare for All would offer coverage to all individuals by replacing premiums, co-pays and deductibles. One way the government would pay for Medicare for All would be through payroll taxes; so immigrants in the country illegally who do pay income taxes would contribute that way.

"['Abortion', 'Illinois', 'Jeanne Ives']","
Ives falsely claims primary foe did not publicly oppose Illinois abortion bill
","The Illinois primaries are still more than six months away, but two Republicans are already ratcheting up what is expected to be a major GOP battle to wrest control of the suburban 6th Congressional District from freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Sean Casten. A few weeks ago, Jeanne Ives declared her candidacy for the seat. A former state representative from Wheaton who ran an insurgent campaign in the 2018 GOP primary against then-incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner, Ives was little known statewide before her bid. She lost the primary to Rauner by just a few percentage points. In what is shaping up to be a rematch of sorts, Ives is expected to face off in the 2020 primary against Rauner’s former lieutenant governor, Evelyn Sanguinetti, who ran alongside Rauner in his failed 2018 re-election bid, which he lost to Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker. During a recent TV interview, Ives took a swipe at Sanguinetti over an issue that in many ways formed the cornerstone of Ives’ 2018 challenge of Rauner, whom she portrayed as being too liberal on social issues. Speaking about the track record of the ""Rauner-Sanguinetti team"" on Fox 32’s ""Flannery Fired Up,"" Ives contended the former lieutenant governor, who opposes abortion rights, had not taken an overt stand opposing Rauner’s decision to sign a controversial bill that expanded the public funding of abortions. ""She publicly did not stand in opposition to it, strongly in opposition to it,"" Ives told host Mike Flannery. ""Whatever opinion she had was never picked up by the media in that regard. And she may have opposed it, but she still stood by her man the entire time as he continued to bail out big corporations on the backs of ratepayers and everything else, so she stood with him hand in hand the whole time."" Ives’ comments clearly suggest Sanguinetti did not go public with her disagreement on the abortion measure. Yet numerous news articles published the day Rauner announced his intention to sign the bill reveal his lieutenant governor made her opposition clear. Rauner was elected governor in 2014 after running for office as a pro-choice fiscal conservative with ""no social agenda."" In September of 2017, he signed a measure that expanded abortion coverage for women on state and Medicaid health plans and ensured the procedure would remain legal in Illinois even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The move followed months of pressure from abortion rights groups after Rauner said earlier that year he planned to veto the bill over public concerns about taxpayer-funded abortions. During the news conference he held declaring he would sign the bill, known as HB40, Rauner was flanked by abortion rights advocates, including former GOP lieutenant governor Corinne Wood. But Sanguinetti was noticeably absent from the event. Instead, she issued a statement that same day declaring she opposed the governor’s decision, which was picked up by numerous local and national media outlets: ""As a pro-life Republican, I disagree with the governor’s decision to sign HB 40,"" her statement read. ""I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for a 15-year-old refugee who chose to have me and keep me. I realize this bill is a political ploy to divide the people of Illinois,"" her statement continued, referencing the Democrats who control the state House and Senate and sent the bill to Rauner’s desk. ""While I disagree with the governor on this, we must focus on our areas of agreement — enacting real reforms we need to turn Illinois around."" Following his decision to sign the measure, Rauner faced the wrath of many Republicans who said they felt he betrayed them. That list included Ives, one of the legislature’s most conservative members. She announced her candidacy for governor a month later, saying Rauner had discredited himself by signing into law what she described as ""very extreme measures,"" including HB40. We repeatedly called and emailed Ives’ campaign to ask how she squares Sanguinetti’s widely reported statement with her claim that the former lieutenant governor did not break ranks with Rauner on the issue. Neither she nor any spokespeople responded to our requests. Ives said that as lieutenant governor, Sanguinetti ""publicly did not stand in opposition"" to Rauner’s decision to sign a bill that expanded the public funding of abortions in Illinois. That narrative is contradicted by numerous news articles published the day Rauner announced he would sign the bill, which quote directly from a statement Sanguinetti released clearly stating she disagreed with his decision.

Fact-checking Marianne Williamson on school funding in the United States
","Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson rolled out a plan this week to create a new U.S. Department of Children and Youth focused on issues related to American children. In a July 28 interview with Williamson, CBS ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan steered the conversation around the candidate's plan to one specific issue: public education. ""Well, let’s talk about that,"" Williamson, an author, said. ""The truth of the matter is we are the only advanced industrialized nation that bases our educational funding on property taxes."" Really? Williamson has made the same claim several times on Twitter and Facebook, and it also appears more than once on her campaign website, so we decided to check it out. Here’s what we found: Saying the United States bases its education funding on property taxes is somewhat of a stretch, and comparisons to other countries are tough to make. (Williamson’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.) Experts said Williamson’s argument boils down to the fact that the United States leaves control of its schools up to the states. That means individual states decide how to generate funding for their schools, said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University’s Edunomics Lab. Each state is different, but ""nearly all rely on a combination of state and local funding.""  According to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics, public elementary and secondary schools got about 8% of funding in 2015-16 from the federal government, 47% from state governments and 45% from local governments. About 81% of local revenues were the result of property taxes, which means more than a third (about 36%) of all school funding came specifically from property taxes.  So Williamson’s claim exaggerates the extent of the United States’ reliance on property taxes. ""They are far from the only source of revenue,"" said Andrew Reschovsky, professor emeritus of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But a third of all education funding is not nothing, either, and Reschovsky said property taxes tend to be the revenue source that people are most aware of. ""It may well be an overstatement to say that we ‘base’ our system of education funding on the property tax, although it is understandable why people characterize it that way,"" he said. Plus, U.S. school districts have become less dependent on property taxes over the last 50 years, said Sean Corcoran, professor of public policy and education at Vanderbilt University. That shift is largely due to efforts to reduce the inequalities that result when rich neighborhoods that pay high property taxes end up with more well-funded schools. ""Many states have undergone wholesale school finance reforms in which state aid is used to equalize revenues across school districts,"" Corcoran said, citing Michigan as an example. How does that line up next to other advanced countries?  The comparison is difficult. Experts said there are no international statistics on the share of education funding that comes from property taxes.  Corcoran pointed to two related statistics that give some sense of how other nations match up. First, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — an intergovernmental economic organization — ranks the United States above all other countries when it comes to the percent of total tax revenue generated by property taxes. Second, the OECD ranks the United States sixth in terms of the percent of all primary and secondary school revenues that come from local sources. The countries that lean more on local governments to pay for schools are Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Finland and the United Kingdom. But those five countries are different from the United States because they also ""have national funding formulas that are used to ensure equitable and adequate funding,"" Corcoran said. In most advanced countries, the central government plays a larger role in financing public education, and local governments are less significant players. Still, some other countries also utilize property taxes to help cover a portion of education spending. Reschovsky said a relatively small share of the property tax in the United Kingdom goes toward education, for example. In Israel, the central government provides most of the money, but the small chunk provided by local governments comes from a property tax called the ""Arnona."" Similarly, for some provinces in Canada, the ""model works a lot like the model in the U.S. where provinces take the lead and there is a local portion that tends to tap property taxes,"" Roza said. But you wouldn’t know that from Williamson’s statement. While property taxes ""play a more important role in funding public education in the U.S. than in most other developed countries,"" her claim is ""certainly not literally true,"" Reschovsky said. At the same time, ""her basic point — that no other advanced country relies as heavily on local sources of revenue to fund school (and specifically property taxes) — is correct,"" Corcoran said. Williamson said, ""We are the only advanced industrialized nation that bases our educational funding on property taxes."" The U.S. gets about 36% of its education money from property taxes. So it’s a slight stretch to say the U.S. bases its school funding on property taxes, although there’s a heavy dependence. More to the point, experts said that while some other countries rely in part on property taxes to help pay for their schools, the United States banks on them the most.  We rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2019/jul/31/marianne-williamson/fact-checking-marianne-williamson-school-funding-u/

Scott's right: 'Modest' two-bedroom apartments not affordable at minimum wage
","U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, recently shepherded a bill to raise the minimum wage through the House of Representatives, saying the wage won’t pay for modest housing. ""The studies show at the minimum wage today, you can’t rent a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the United States,"" he told the House Rules Committee on July 15. ""I’m not talking about San Francisco or New York City, I’m talking about anywhere - a modest two-bedroom apartment."" Scott made the claim three times during a five-minute speech to the panel. We checked if he was right.  A spokesperson for the House Committee on Education and Labor, which Scott chairs, said the congressman was referring to a 2019 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition titled ""Out of Reach."" The report, updated yearly, examines the affordability of housing for minimum wage earners in more than 3,500 counties and metropolitan areas across the country. The study found, ""In no state, metropolitan area, or county in the U.S. can a worker earning the federal or prevailing state minimum wage afford a modest two-bedroom rental home at fair market rent by working a standard 40-hour work week."" There are a few terms we need to break down: The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour has been in effect since 2009. Twenty-one states, including Virginia, use that rate as their minimum wage. The rest, and the District of Columbia, have set their minimum wage higher. Scott’s bill, which faces a tough road in the U.S. Senate, would gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. The prevailing minimum wage is the baseline pay rate that’s in effect in a state or locality. Twenty-nine states exceed the federal minimum, from $7.50 an hour in New Mexico to $12 in California and Washington. Some cities have minimum wages higher than their states. The study used the prevailing minimum wage in its computations for each locality. Fair market rent is the 40th median percentile of rents (including utilities, but not telephone) paid by tenants who have moved in a locality during the last two years. It’s slightly less than median rent. It is a term used by the federal government in some housing programs and the bottom rent for what the study calls a ""modest"" home.   The national coalition defines ""affordability"" as consistent with a federal standard that no more than 30% of a household’s gross income should be spent on rent and utilities. That’s the guideline used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. So, what the study found is that there is no U.S. locality where minimum wage earners, working 40 hours a week, can find a modest two-bedroom home that will rent for 30% or less of their gross income. In every locality, at least 60% of the two-bedroom units are unaffordable, according to standard housing definitions. In most places, far more than 60% are beyond their means.  In Virginia, for example, a household would have to work 128 hours a week at the state’s minimum wage - or 3.2 full-time jobs - to afford a two-bedroom home at the 40th rent percentile, according to the report. That's third highest in the nation, trailing  Hawaii (3.6), and New Jersey (3.3). In Richmond, Chesterfield and Henrico, a household would need to work 2.8  full-time jobs at minimum wage to afford the apartment.   The study does not say no two-bedroom home would be available to a minimum-wage earner anywhere in the country. The qualifier ""modest"" home - used in the report and by Scott - is important. There might be affordable two-bedroom apartment available, but they would be below the ""modest"" standard - usually, far below. What about a one-bedroom home? A minimum wage earner would find them affordable in 28 counties across the country, or less than 1% of the jurisdications, according to the study.  Several housing experts have told PolitiFact National the coalition’s report is generally consistent with other housing studies, including a recent reports published by the Joint Center of Housing Studies and Harvard University.   PolitiFact National cited the coalition’s report last year in fact-checking a statement by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., that, ""In 99% of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can’t afford a 1-bedroom apartment."" Her claim was rated Mostly True. It was slightly downgraded because she didn’t specify the statistic applied to ""modest"" homes. Scott didn’t make that mistake. Our Ruling Scott said, ""The studies show at the minimum wage today, you can’t rent a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the United States. I’m not talking about San Francisco or New York City, I’m talking about anywhere - a modest two-bedroom apartment."" He was referring to annual studies by the National Low Income Housing Coalition that have found there is no U.S. locality where a minimum wage earner, working 40 hours a week, can find a ""modest"" two-bedroom home that will rent for 30% or less of his gross income. Scott accurately describes the findings and makes the key distinction that the results don’t apply to all apartments; just those statistically defined as ""modest.""

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) At PolitiFact, we’ve reported extensively on how Republicans and Democrats often try to pin the federal deficit on each other — muddying the facts in the process. So we wanted to see if this Facebook post is true. We reached out to Newsitics, the media outlet that Cole founded and works for, to see what evidence he used to compose the tweet and didn’t hear back. Our review shows the numbers basically check out, but they don’t tell the full story. Some people confuse the federal deficit with the debt — but they’re two separate concepts. The Department of the Treasury explains it like this: The deficit is the difference between the money that the government makes and the money it spends. If the government spends more than it collects in revenues, then it’s running a deficit. The federal debt is the running total of the accumulated deficits. Now let’s take a closer look at each president’s impact on the federal deficit. To check the numbers in Cole’s tweet, we went to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which has an interactive database for these kinds of figures. Here’s what we found for each claim: ""(President Ronald) Reagan took the deficit from 70 billion to 175 billion."" This is more or less accurate. The federal deficit went from about $78.9 billion at the beginning of Reagan’s presidency to $152.6 billion at the end of it. At points between 1983 and 1986, the deficit was actually more than $175 billion. ""(George H.W.) Bush 41 took it to 300 billion."" Close, but not exactly. The number was around $255 billion at the end of Bush’s term. The deficit spiked at around $290.3 billion the year before he left office. ""(Bill) Clinton got it to zero."" This is true. During his presidency, Clinton managed to zero out the deficit and end his term with a $128.2 billion surplus. ""(George W.) Bush 43 took it from 0 to 1.2 trillion."" This is in the ballpark. Ignoring the fact that he actually started his presidency with a surplus, Bush left office in 2009 with a federal deficit of roughly $1.41 trillion. ""(Barack) Obama halved it to 600 billion."" This is essentially accurate. Obama left the presidency with a deficit of approximately $584.6 billion, which is more than halving $1.41 trillion. The deficit was even lower in 2015 at around $441.9 billion. We had to look for more recent data to back up Cole’s allegation that ""Trump’s got it back to a trillion."" A Treasury Department statement from June put the federal deficit at about $747.1 billion so far this fiscal year. But the agency also reported that Washington is on track to post a $1.1 trillion deficit by the end of September, which backs up Cole’s claim. After we published this story, some readers asked us to look at the annual deficit in terms of constant dollars, which adjust for inflation. Data since 1940 show that the deficit was highest in 2009, 2010 and 2011 — the height of the Great Recession and the aftermath of the 2009 stimulus package. How much power do presidents have to change the deficit anyway? The president does affect the budget by negotiating and signing appropriations bills. But there’s a lot more to it. First, the country’s economic situation has a big impact on the federal deficit. The Great Recession affected the deficit near the end of George W. Bush’s administration and the beginning of Obama’s, said Stephen Ellis, executive vice president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense. There was more spending on safety net programs like food stamps and Medicaid and less income from taxes. Second, new presidents take office in January and, for the most part, inherit the budget from the previous administration for the remainder of the fiscal year — not to mention legislation passed in years prior. ""Even the ‘dream budget’ that the president proposes is tied by all sorts of historical obligations and economic conditions,"" Tara Sinclair, an associate professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University, told PolitiFact. None of that is to say that the president doesn’t have any effect on the deficit, Ellis said. He used Reagan’s tax cuts and Obama’s stimulus package as examples of how the president can affect deficit spending.  The combination of spending hikes and tax cuts amplifies deficits. Trump oversaw both. While the rise in spending was bi-partisan, the tax cuts were a Republican effort that Trump championed. In the time since Trump signed his landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, the deficit has increased by more than $100 billion. A Congressional Budget Office report from April 2018 found that the law could add almost $1.9 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. But Cole’s tweet still lacks some nuance. A viral tweet made several claims about how the deficit has grown under Republican presidents and shrunk under Democrats. On the whole, the numbers presented for each president are basically accurate. However, it’s worth clarifying that presidents alone are not responsible for the rise and fall of the federal deficit.  The tweet is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/jul/29/tweets/republican-presidents-democrats-contribute-deficit/

Has Trump encouraged an unprecedented number of migrants to seek asylum at the border?
","Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin said President Donald Trump‘s hardline stance on immigration has driven the nation’s current refugee crisis to all-time highs. ""What we’ve seen at the border in the last several months has been shocking and unprecedented,"" Durbin said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""This get-tough president who says he’s going to cut off foreign aid to countries in Central America and get tough at the border with his almighty wall has ended up attracting larger numbers of people coming to the United States presenting themselves for asylum status at our border than we’ve ever seen,"" the four-term Illinois senator said. ""Dramatic increases we haven’t seen for decades in people at the border."" It’s been widely reported that undocumented migrants are being intercepted by federal border agents or surrendering themselves along the border at levels not seen in decades, despite the president’s continued calls to curtail immigration. But has that rapid surge — still well below the 1.6 million peak in southwest border apprehensions 19 years ago — been accompanied by an unprecedented rise in migrants seeking asylum protections? And, if so, is it possible to say whether Trump played the central role in drawing them here? We decided to find out. To examine Durbin’s assertions, we took a look at what is known as ""credible fear"" claims, the first step undocumented migrants at the border must take to seek asylum by claiming to fear racial, political, social or religious persecution at home. Data on the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol’s website shows the number of migrants making such claims at the southwest border rose from 55,584 in 2017 to 92,959 the following fiscal year, a nearly 70% increase. The Customs site didn’t have data for previous years. A Durbin spokesperson referred us to an article about those recent CBP numbers, but did not provide any historical data. Still, there are other ways of tracking fear claims that suggest Durbin may be correct on this count. We looked at more data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which screens migrants who make credible fear claims, and other sources. By all those measures, the claim that asylum seekers are arriving at record levels seems to check out, though not all track fear claims made at the southwest border specifically. The USCIS numbers, for instance, show that in 2006 about 5,000 migrants made credible fear claims. In 2018, that total surged to more than 99,000. Those figures include claims of credible fear at all borders and ports of entry, but a majority come from Central American migrants, who are likely to enter at the southwest border. The upward trend began under President Barack Obama when in 2014 a migration surge occurred, driven in part by unaccompanied children fleeing violence and insecurity in Central America. But in none of those years did total claims pass the highs reported by USCIS for 2018. The Trump administration highlighted the USCIS claims numbers — which represent a nearly 1,800% increase between 2006 and 2018 — as part of its justification for a new rule that bars most migrants who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border from applying for asylum if they have not first sought refuge in one of the countries they traveled through. Announced earlier this month, that rule is temporarily blocked by a court challenge. The shifting demographic profile of migrants showing up at the border today also suggests greater numbers of asylum seekers, experts told us. For decades, most crossing the southwest border without permission were single men from Mexico looking for work. Today, migrants are more likely to come from a violence- and poverty-stricken region known as the Northern Triangle that includes El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. And the number of border apprehensions involving families has hit record levels, according to the CBP. Groups that include at least one child with parent or guardian now account for more than half of those seeking to cross. Unaccompanied minors arriving at the border are also on the rise, although that total has yet to surpass 2014’s numbers. While there’s a case for Durbin’s argument that asylum claims at the border are at a record high, it’s not possible to prove or disprove his argument drawing a direct line between Trump and his policies and the leap in asylum seekers or even the overall surge in migration. ""It’s always hard to pinpoint the cause of migration flows because there are so many factors that go into these decisions to migrate,"" said Jessica Bolter, an analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Bolter and other experts described myriad ""push factors"" leading migrants from the Northern Triangle to leave their homes, including gang violence, a precarious economy, pressures from climate change and widespread government corruption. Meanwhile, brighter economic opportunities in the strong U.S. job market and the chance to reunite with family members now living in the U.S. account for some of the main draws. Experts also said it is difficult to pinpoint what began attracting asylum seekers in higher numbers this year and last. ""It’s a little bit of a mystery because it kind of came out of nowhere,"" said Pia Orrenius, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas who studies regional economic growth and demographic change. She said those countries’ economies and job situation have not changed much, and crime, while significant, hasn’t worsened. Meanwhile, more lenient policies implemented under Mexico’s new president could play a role, she and other experts suggested. Smugglers may also be capitalizing on the backlogged asylum system, which has allowed many migrants to stay in the U.S. as their cases are processed, some experts said. That’s another avenue the Trump administration has worked to cut off. Several experts also suggested Trump’s rhetoric, along with his administration’s moves to discourage immigration, might be driving refugees to the U.S. border by giving smugglers ammunition to persuade families to migrate now before more restrictive policies are implemented. ""When Trump came in and announced his hardline policy and intention to build a border wall, I think that itself started people heading northward to get in before the wall was built,"" said Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University’s Office of Population Research, who has studied border migration for decades. ""So I think to some extent Trump actually encouraged the flow with his hardline tactics."" However, Massey added, ""there’s no really strong analytic way to show if that’s true or false."" On the other hand, Andrew ""Art"" Arthur, a former immimigration judge and an advocate for more restrictive border enforcement, argued that record high asylum claims suggest Congress is at fault for stymying the president’s attempts at reform. ""It’s not the president’s rhetoric but Congress’ inaction, both with respect to plugging the loopholes and with respect to providing sufficient resources that’s caused this huge influx of people coming to the border,"" said Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower immigration levels. ""People are taking advantage of the situation and Congress has failed to act."" Experts we interviewed also questioned Durbin’s argument that Trump’s move to cut foreign aid is to blame, noting the measure is just beginning to take effect and would have preceded the recent migration surge, which began in late 2018. Durbin said Trump ""has ended up attracting larger numbers of people coming to the United States presenting themselves for asylum status at our border than we’ve ever seen."" Despite some limitations, federal data does suggest the number of credible fear claims made by migrants seeking asylum at the southwest border has hit a record high. However, Durbin’s argument that Trump caused the increase remains unproven and overlooks many other factors experts said could be at play. We rate his claim Half True.

Gillibrand's claim on transaction taxes not whole story
","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand supports taxing certain securities trades to pay for some of her proposed initiatives, such as job training programs. The Democratic senator from New York is a co-sponsor of one bill that calls for a tax of .1 percent and another one with varying rates of up to .5 percent.    ""I believe that we can easily put in place a transaction tax,"" Gillibrand, a former securities lawyer and presidential candidate, told a group gathered at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. ""And so, I believe a transaction tax, pennies on the hundred dollars, it’s such a small amount of money. The only industry it will harm or disrupt is the flash trading industry, which I don’t believe actually creates value. But, it also creates enormous amounts of revenue. And other countries like the UK have already done it, and it didn’t affect their financial markets at all.""  Gillibrand said the tax would generate about $77 billion a year. The Congressional Budget Office found that over 10 years, a transaction tax of .1 percent would generate $777 billion, though other researchers have come up with different revenue estimates.  Transaction taxes have been used in other countries, and the United States had a transaction tax on the issuance and transfer of stocks from 1914 to 1966. There have been some calls in Congress and elsewhere in recent years to bring them back, and Gillibrand is not the only presidential candidate to favor them.    The United Kingdom has had a ""stamp duty"" since 1694, and it’s currently a .5 percent tax on securities issued by companies registered in the UK, though the original issuance is exempt. There are several other exemptions.  Many countries have enacted some kind of financial transaction tax, and some have abandoned them. A highly cited paper on transaction taxes in different countries, published in 1994 and written by Harvard economists John Y. Campbell and Kenneth A. Froot, notes that experiences with these kinds of taxes are ""quite varied.""  Since Gillibrand mentioned the United Kingdom, we focused our research there.  We approached Gillibrand’s campaign for more information about her claim, and her spokeswoman, Meredith Kelly, said the United Kingdom’s ""economy and stock exchange are thriving."" Kelly sent us two pieces of evidence to support the senator’s statement, including a paper in the National Tax Journal stating that ""many world financial centers,"" including the United Kingdom, ""thrive despite the presence of"" financial transaction taxes.  One of the authors of that paper, Leonard Burman, a professor at Syracuse University and co-founder of the Tax Policy Center, wrote in an email that Gillibrand’s claim ""sounds like an overstatement."" Financial transaction taxes ""surely reduced trading volume,"" he wrote, adding that the reduction in trading volume is something supporters like about the tax.  The other piece of evidence Kelly sent was an opinion column written in 2015 by Jared Bernstein, who was an economic advisor to former Vice President Joe Biden. Bernstein wrote that he favored enacting a transaction tax in the United States as a way to raise revenues while reducing trading that makes markets volatile. He wrote, however, that the ""historical evidence"" on whether transaction taxes raises or lowers market volatility is ""inconclusive.""  Several studies of the effects of the transaction tax in the United Kingdom have highlighted market volatility, share price and investor behavior. While some market impacts have been found, supporters of the tax note that the London market remains robust.  When transaction taxes are imposed, some countries see trading activity move to other, untaxed markets. Campbell and Froot wrote that in the United Kingdom, the tax ""cannot be avoided by trading abroad but it does stimulate trading"" in other untaxed financial instruments and ""also seems to reduce total trading volume to some degree.""  Another paper, published in 2011 by the International Monetary Fund, found the market for a kind of derivative instrument, known in the UK as ""contracts for difference,"" had ""grown rapidly since its inception in the early 1990s, in part due to its exemption from stamp duty.""  The author, economist Thornton Matheson, wrote that the transaction tax in the UK is ""frequently regarded as successful"" because of how much revenue it raises.   A 2004 paper from a British think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, found that the stamp duty depresses share prices, which may increase the cost of capital for firms, and also distorted how investors interpret share price as an indicator as to a firm’s profitability.   A 2007 paper by UK economic consultant Oxera argued in favor of abolishing the tax, claiming that stamp duty made capital more expensive, by up to 12 percent in some sectors. Like other studies, the authors found that investors chose non-taxed financial instruments to avoid the stamp duty.  A 1997 study for the Bank of England found that the stamp duty had no effect on volatility in the UK.  Those in favor of implementing a transaction tax in the United States note the London Stock Exchange is robust and the tax generates significant revenue. Sarah Anderson, global economy project director at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said the London Stock Exchange manages to thrive even in the face of Brexit uncertainty.    Another supporter of implementing a transaction tax in the United States, economist Robert Pollin, said the tax has ""not prevented the City of London market from operating on a gigantic scale."" ""It is true that the extent of day-to-day trading in the UK market is somewhat less than on Wall Street,"" said Pollin, co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. ""That may be due to the financial transaction tax. But it is really hard to pin that down one way or another."" Gillibrand said that a transaction tax didn’t affect financial markets in the United Kingdom ""at all.""  The tax has been in effect for centuries and the London Stock Exchange remains a robust financial hub. But enacting a tax likely has some effect, and studies have found that share price and trading volume are affected by the tax.  We rate her claim Mostly False.   ",/factchecks/2019/jul/26/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrands-claim-transaction-taxes-not-whole-stor/

In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Evans also shared the math behind O’Rourke’s claim: ""When you add up all of those children at all of those border patrol stations, detention centers, and (Health and Human Services) shelters across the country, we are detaining more children than anytime in American history since we interned Japanese-Americans during World War II.""  Japanese internment camps In a response to the surprise attack by Japanese forces on Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order to relocate all persons of Japanese ancestry -- both citizens and noncitizens -- inland, so they were outside of the Pacific military zone.  This was due in part to a wave of national security concerns that followed the attack. Roosevelt’s order was described as necessary to prevent potential espionage efforts and protect those with Japanese ancestry from harm amidst a growing anti-Japanese sentiment among the public. Data from the National Archives and other reported sources such as the Public Broadcasting Service, show a range of 110,000 to more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent were moved to internment camps. Most were native-born U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. Evans cited the PBS documentary Children of the Camps for the number of children who were relocated to internment camps. PBS reported 120,000 Japanese people were moved and over half that figure were children, which would be a total of at least 60,000 kids. Those impacted were forced to report to civilian assembly centers outside a massive exclusion zone designated along the west coast. Thousands were forced to close down their businesses, abandon their farms and homes and move to the internment camps, dubbed relocation centers. In January 1944, a Supreme Court ruling halted the detention of U.S. citizens without cause and the order was rescinded. The last internment camp closed in 1946. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act to compensate those who were incarcerated in camps. The legislation offered a formal apology and paid out $20,000 in reparations to each surviving victim. Overall, the U.S. government paid $1.6 billion in reparations to detainees and their descendants. That’s the historic perspective. How do the numbers compare to the situation along the border today? Detention of migrant children hit a high In an email, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services noted the crisis on the southern border has meant a dramatic increase in referrals of migrant children from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. As of June 2019, DHS had referred more than 58,500 children to the department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). The number was a 57% increase from the same time period in 2018. As of July 15, 2019, there are about 11,200 children actually in the office’s care, but the number changes daily. ""The number of referrals is unpredictable,"" the e-mail read. ""It is likely this fiscal year that ORR will care for the largest number of (unaccompanied alien children) in the program’s history."" Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that 63,624 children were apprehended at the border from January to June 2019. The last update was made July 10, 2019. The agency defines apprehensions as physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S., which may or may not result in an arrest.  So, of the nearly 64,000 apprehended at the border, not all of them were brought into camps. Numerous media reports say the number of migrants crossing the border as well as arrests made at the border have reached record levels. According to USA TODAY, DHS reported 40,891 unaccompanied migrant children were referred to the division for housing in 2019, a 57% increase from last year. Evans referred to two New York Times articles, and one from the Washington Post that report the number of migrant children in shelters have reached historic highs.  The New York Times reports children in shelters reached a total of 12,800 in September 2018 when the article was published, a huge increase from the 2,400 who were in custody in May 2017. Complicated comparisons Renee Romano, a history professor at Oberlin College in Ohio, said there are parallels between the situation with migrant children today and children who were interned in camps during World War II, but the comparison isn’t exactly equal in weight. Romano noted migrant children are arriving on a regular basis and may be detained for different periods of time while most of the Japanese American children were already living in the country and remained interned for most of the duration of the war.  ""The number of kids being detained at any given time quite fluctuates,"" Romano said of the migrant children detained today. "" The Japanese American experience was the country rounding up an entire settled population."" So, O’Rourke reaches a bit too far in making the comparison and uses the politically loaded ""incarcerated"" to drive home his point. The thrust of the claim, though, is a numeric one:  Not whether current detentions are higher than World War II ones, but whether there has been any other period with a higher number of detentions since then. We could not identify any period in which the actual detention of children has been higher. Nor could the experts we talked with, even if the two have major differences in their situation. Our ruling O’Rourke claimed the U.S. is incarcerating more children than any time since we had Japanese internment camps during World War II. According to reports, roughly 60,000 Japanese children were interned during the World War II era. News reports and government agencies site that migrant activity in the country have hit a high, including the number of children detained.  That said, the situation with migrant children today is quite different, so O’Rourke reaches a bit too far in making his claim. Our definition for Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2019/jul/26/beto-orourke/orourke-point-claim-us-incarcerating-children/

Klobuchar says there are enough drug lobbyists in D.C. to double-team lawmakers
","Senior citizens care a lot about drug prices and the future of Medicare, so it was no surprise that at a July 15 AARP-sponsored presidential candidate forum in Iowa the first question posed to Sen. Amy Klobuchar was on those topics. As president, Klobuchar said, she would unleash the bargaining power of Medicare to lower drug prices. But she noted what she would be up against: ""There are, literally, two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every member of Congress. They think they own Congress. They don’t own me."" The Minnesota Democrat’s comment tapped into ongoing concern about the political power of drugmakers in the ongoing debate over U.S. drug prices, which are the highest in the world for brand-name products. Congress and the president say they want to lower them, but so far there’s been little demonstrable action or results. We decided to take a look: Are lawmakers in Washington that outnumbered by pharma lobbyists? We contacted Klobuchar’s campaign to find out the basis for her statement. They quickly sent over information from OpenSecrets — a website that tracks the number of lobbyists and the spending on lobbying — and promised to get back in touch with confirmation that the site was the senator’s source. We haven’t heard any more. By the numbers  Still, the OpenSecrets information became our starting point. Their data comes from reports filed quarterly by lobbyists, lobbying firms and organizations with the secretary of the Senate. Lobbyists must register with the secretary’s office if they are paid to lobby on behalf of a client, make more than one contact with government officials regarding the client’s issues and spend at least 20% of their time on lobbying and related activities. OpenSecrets counted 1,451 pharmaceutical/health products lobbyists in 2018, the last full year of data available. That category goes beyond just prescription drugs to include lobbyists for medical device makers and producers of over-the-counter health products. Using a narrower definition that included only lobbyists representing pharmaceutical manufacturing interests, the group’s count came to 828. So then we did the math. There are 535 members of Congress; 100 serve in the  Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives. It turns out Klobuchar is either over- or undercounting, depending on how broadly one defines the pharmaceutical industry. There are 2.7 lobbyists per member of Congress if one looks at the broader pharmaceutical/health products industry, but only 1.5 per member when considering only drugmakers. ""It’s a lot either way,"" said Steven Knievel, the access-to-medicines advocate at Public Citizen. And how do these tallies stack up against other industries? The 1,451 pharma/health products lobbyists outnumbered lobbyists in all 89 other categories, according to an analysis by Daniel Auble, a senior researcher at OpenSecrets. The electronics manufacturing and equipment industry came in second, with 1,121 lobbyists last year. Education was third, with 1,027. Tied for last place — with eight each — were lobbyists for women’s issues and those lobbying for or against abortion rights. Industry lobbyists outnumber consumer lobbyists across the board, said experts. And that means members of Congress and their staffers are ""hearing over and over again from industry because it has more lobbyists than anyone else,"" said Lee Drutman, senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of The Business of America Is Lobbying. Many of those lobbyists are more experienced than the young staffers they meet with, he noted. When lawmakers and staff members hear far more from one side of an issue, it can lead to a ""distorted picture of how regulations might work or affect public health,"" said Drutman. Knievel agreed. When he heads to Capitol Hill to talk with lawmakers, they’ve generally heard more from industry than ""from people who are trying to lower health costs,"" he said. ""Having the resources and human power to do that makes them formidable and influential."" The second part of Klobuchar’s statement — that drug company lobbyists ""own Congress"" — brings up another element of this issue: In Washington, money and lobbying go hand in hand. The drug industry certainly has one of the biggest war chests for spending on lobbying. Last year, lobbying spending by pharmaceutical groups and health product providers, which includes makers of medical devices and other health-related items, totaled $283 million, according to OpenSecrets. The amount spent by drugmakers alone is huge: $169 million lobbying last year. That’s the most since 2009, in the heat of the debate over the Affordable Care Act. The second-place finisher, the insurance industry, spent $158 million. So what’s the drug industry lobbying on? Its latest concerns revolve around drug prices. Whenever it perceives a threat or an opportunity — such as when Congress was debating the ACA in 2009, or now, with candidates, the president and Congress all focused on the high price of prescription medicines — the industry ramps up spending. ""Companies are somewhat responsive to the political environment,""   said Drutman. And, of course, the drug industry funnels millions of dollars in campaign contributions directly to members of Congress each year. Our ruling Klobuchar said: ""There are, literally, two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every member of Congress.""    We found that there are more than twice as many pharma lobbyists per member of Congress if one looks at the broader category that includes representatives of health products, but only 1.5 per member if the comparison is restricted only to those lobbying for drug companies. We rate her statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/jul/26/amy-klobuchar/klobuchar-says-there-are-enough-drug-lobbyists-dc-/

‘Honest’ ad mostly wrong about Trump, taxes and Medicare
","Targeting Wisconsin as one of the four most critical states in the 2020 presidential election, the Priorities USA Super PAC announced it plans to spend at least $300,000 per week on digital ads in the state. The Democratic group’s initial volley includes a 30-second ad titled ""Bill & Mona"" that shows a couple on their farm discussing President Donald Trump. ""I paid into Medicare my whole life,"" says the farmer identified as ""Bill A."" ""Trump wants to cut it just to pay for tax breaks to billionaires."" Adds Mona A.: ""It is just the rich wanting to be richer, and the rest of us are just going to have to deal with it."" Priorities USA has dubbed its push the ""Let’s Be Honest"" campaign. Let’s see if their claim on billionaire tax breaks is worthy of the slogan. The ""tax breaks"" in the ad are referencing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an overhaul of the tax code signed into law by Trump in December 2017, according to a supporting document provided by Priorities USA. The Medicare ""cut"" refers to changes in Trump’s proposed budget. We’ll examine those elements separately and then see if it’s reasonable to connect them. The ad implies much — or all — of the tax cut referenced is going to billionaires. The tax cut does provide tax breaks for billionaires. And lots of other people too. The cuts are projected to total $1.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning. In 2018, about 80% of taxpayers had a tax cut due to the new law, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. The savings do skew toward high-income earners. The center said 21% of the total tax savings went to the highest-earning 1% of taxpayers in 2018, more than the total for the bottom 60%.  By 2025, that gap is projected to increase, with 25% of the tax savings going to the top 1%. The increases are larger for higher-income earners on a percentage basis as well — not just in raw dollars. In 2025, the top 1% are expected to see after-tax income grow by 2.9%, compared to 1.4% or less for the bottom 80% of income earners. That’s largely in line with estimates from other groups, such as the Tax Foundation. We couldn’t find a breakdown of exactly how much of that money is going to billionaires. The Tax Policy Center stopped its analysis at 0.1% of highest income earners. That group includes about 140,000 tax returns, and by 2025 will receive about 11% of the total tax savings. (Annual income for that group is currently at least $6.9 million, according to the IRS.) Meanwhile, Forbes reported there are 607 billionaires in the U.S. in 2019. That is less than half of the top 0.001% of income earners. Suffice it to say, the vast majority of the money is not going to billionaires. The Medicare cost reduction under Trump’s budget is expected to be roughly $600 billion over the next 10 years, when compared to current spending levels, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, largely agrees, putting the number at $575 billion.  There are some important caveats. About 85% of the savings comes from reductions in what Medicare pays to providers, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""Those cuts would primarily reduce what Medicare pays providers, and I would not expect them to have negative effects on Medicare beneficiaries,"" Matt Fiedler, an economics fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said in an email. ""The budget’s Medicare proposals are also, in my view, largely sensible policy."" Medicare changes aren’t exactly an original idea, either — Trump is actually building on proposals from Democratic President Barack Obama. Obama’s last budget proposed trimming Medicare spending by a pretty similar amount: $420 billion over 10 years. That brings us to the root of the issue — is it fair to connect proposed Medicare changes to tax cuts from two years ago? In October 2017, PolitiFact National gave U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer a Half True rating for claiming that Republicans were proposing ""to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid."" We noted at the time that drawing a direct link between specific tax cuts and Medicare-Medicaid cuts was exaggerated since they were separate pieces of legislation. The Priorities USA ad makes a different claim, starting with the fact it refers to just Medicare (not Medicare and Medicaid) and, instead of ""the rich,"" it refers specifically to billionaires. In addition, we’re now dealing with the final version of the tax cuts and a firm budget proposal.  That said, the ad does connect the two pieces of legislation in the way Schumer did, which we noted is problematic.  Finally, Fiedler notes that — broadly speaking — cutting taxes does require other adjustments be made. ""Tax cuts aren’t a free lunch: lower tax revenue will lead to higher deficits, which will require either future tax increases or spending cuts,"" he said in an email. ""Medicare is a substantial fraction of federal spending, so it’s certainly possible that Medicare would bear a portion of those future adjustments, but it’s impossible to say with any precision where those adjustments would ultimately fall."" The Priorities USA web ad said Trump is cutting Medicare to fund tax breaks for billionaires. Any large-scale tax cuts reduces revenue and can require cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, where Medicare is a high-cost piece. But the ad over-reaches in directly linking tax cuts signed into law almost two years ago and Medicare changes that are still in the works. Referring to the tax cuts simply as ""to billionaires"" is a stretch as well. The cuts do disproportionately benefit the wealthy, but a very small portion of the money actually goes to billionaires.

Elizabeth Warren says manufacturing is in recession, but signs are mixed
","Elizabeth Warren issued a warning about the economy with the dire headline ""The Coming Economic Crash — And How to Stop It."" In a post on Medium, the Democratic presidential candidate listed a number of red lights flashing, and one of the more troubling ones was manufacturing. ""Despite Trump’s promises of a manufacturing ‘renaissance,’ the country is now in a manufacturing recession,"" Sen. Warren, D-Mass., wrote. ""The Federal Reserve just reported that the manufacturing sector had a second straight quarter of decline, falling below Wall Street’s expectations."" Warren has her numbers right, and a range of stats point to a slowdown in manufacturing. The disagreement lies with what that cooling means, and whether the ""R"" word applies.  • The technical definition of an overall economic recession was met when the industrial production index from the Federal Reserve fell for two quarters in a row. • But the number of manufacturing workers continues to climb. • Other indicators show manufacturing is growing, but slower than before. In July, the Federal Reserve released numbers showing that industrial production dropped at an annual rate of 1.2% in the second quarter, and that came on top of a decline in the first quarter. Technically, two back-to-back quarters of falling growth amounts to a recession. Warren’s post linked to a MarketWatch article, in which Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said, ""the sector is in recession."" But economist Barry Bosworth at the Brookings Institution said Warren’s phrasing goes too far. ""Manufacturing is now in the midst of a significant slowdown, but it is too small today to associate with terms like recession,"" Bosworth said. Bosworth said manufacturing numbers bounce around much more than the U.S. GDP, the measure of the entire economy. The economy has grown continuously each year since 2010. As this chart shows, industrial production has gone up and down throughout that time. And the recent drop is, as Bosworth said, not unusually deep. Bosworth also noted that there’s a big difference between saying the entire economy is in recession and that a single sector is. He said it would be ""inappropriate"" to apply the same two-quarters definition to manufacturing. Another widely used measure for the health of the manufacturing sector comes from the Institute for Supply Management. It surveys companies and produces a monthly Purchasing Managers Index, where any score above 50 shows growth. That number has been falling, but at 51.7 for June, it remains in positive territory. Steve Blitz, chief economist at the investment advising firm TS Lombard points to that index as one sign that manufacturing is not in recession. And Blitz has others: Orders at U.S. factories went up $1 billion in June, he said. ""A recession is not evident in profits, still positive, and not evident in employment — flat to growing,"" Blitz said. In June, the number of manufacturing workers went up 17,000, although it was basically flat for the three months before. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers that American manufacturing is being dragged down by weak demand around the world. On top of those global trends, participants in the Institute for Supply Management survey said the U.S.-China trade dispute and concerns about tariffs on Mexican goods had put a damper on activity. Warren said the country is now in a manufacturing recession. Output has fallen for two quarters in a row, and some economists apply the recession label. But others do not; they say they’d need to see additional indicators of decline. They point to other data that shows manufacturing has slowed but continues to grow. Importantly, the sector continues to hire more workers and orders for goods rose by $1 billion in June. Warren has a point that manufacturing has weakened, but other information paints a more complicated picture.

No, survey did not say that a third of Guatemalans intend to come to the United States
","An alarming number of people are planning to come to the United States from Guatemala, said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. ""There's a survey done in Guatemala. A third of Guatemalans intend to migrate to the United States,"" Johnson said during a July 21 interview on CNN’s State of the Union. ""That's about 5.8 million people. Depopulating Guatemala and Central America, that's not good for Central America. It's not good for us."" Did a survey say that about a third of Guatemalans — or about 5.8 million people — plan to migrate to the United States? No. Johnson’s claim is based on news reports that inaccurately conveyed survey results. Johnson’s press office directed PolitiFact to a blog post on the senator’s website headlined ""How many people would come here under open borders?"" It was published the day after the CNN interview. ""39.2% of Guatemalans told pollsters they intend to migrate out of the country, and 85% of those said they would migrate to the United States,"" Johnson’s post said, reflecting what Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre reported in May. Johnson also cited U.S. versions of the story written by the Washington Examiner and the Daily Caller. Johnson has a point: a lot of Guatemalans said they intend to leave their country. ""But the specific numbers are different,"" said professor Elizabeth J. Zechmeister, director of the Latin American Public Opinion Project at Vanderbilt University. Her group worked with a Guatemalan research institute and think tank to create the AmericasBarometer Guatemala national survey. It was conducted from Jan. 22 to March 20, 2019 in face-to-face interviews with 1,596 individuals. Zechmeister said the sample is nationally representative of Guatemala’s adult population, 18 years and older.  The survey asked participants if they had any intention of going to live or work in another country in the next three years. In response, about 25% said yes. That’s much fewer than the near 40% Johnson cited.  The people who said yes were then asked the likelihood that they will live and work in another country in the next three years; 39.2% said ""very likely."" So the 39% figure is a subset of the 25% of Guatemalans who said they had an intention to leave their country. These specific set of questions did not ask where they’d go.  In a May 6 tweet, the Vanderbilt research group said it wanted to clarify Prensa Libre’s reporting, noting exactly to what the percentages corresponded. ACLARACIÓN: Queremos precisar la información publicada por @prensa_libre. Solo 25.3% de los guatemaltecos tiene intenciones de emigrar. De este 25.3%, apenas 39.2% cree que es muy probable que lo haga en lo próximos 3 años. Más información ver @ASIES_GT: https://t.co/QrgL6yFAnw pic.twitter.com/Bsq3lEvi3X Overall, almost 10% of Guatemala’s adult population is estimated to be highly motivated to leave the country, Zechmeister told PolitiFact. ""That is, the percent that both expresses an intention to emigrate in the next three years and reports that it is very likely they will do so,"" she said. Guatemalans who said their future emigration was ""very likely"" were not asked if the United States was an intended destination. A separate survey question asked if in the last 12 months, respondents considered emigrating; 17.2% responded ""yes."" Those who said yes were then asked an open-ended question about where they had considered emigrating, and 85% said the United States. So about 14.6% of the survey respondents said that in the last 12 months they considered emigrating to the United States, said Zechmeister. PolitiFact asked Zechmeister what might be the best estimate of the number of Guatemalans intending to come to the United States — since Johnson said about 5.8 million people.  ""I'm not comfortable saying that there is a particular number that is ‘correct’,"" Zechmeister said. ""This would be easier if we had asked the question directly — do you intend to emigrate to the U.S. in the next year? But since we did not, attempts to use our data to answer that question will require some assumptions and, depending on what those are, there is a range of answers that one could generate to the question."" Johnson also mentioned the survey in the context of a conversation about illegal immigration. But the survey did not ask people if they intended to migrate legally or illegally. Johnson said, ""There's a survey done in Guatemala. A third of Guatemalans intend to migrate to the United States. That's about 5.8 million people."" A survey of Guatemalans showed that many of them intend to leave their country, and some data suggests that the United States is a considered destination.  But Johnson’s estimates are based on media reports that inaccurately presented survey results. Using the survey in the kind of way that Johnson did requires assumptions that go beyond the evidence. Johnson repeated poorly reported information about the survey results.
