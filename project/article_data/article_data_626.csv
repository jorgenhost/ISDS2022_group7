Kay Bailey Hutchison, in Senate farewell, says record number of women will serve in Senate in 2013
","
In her farewell address to U.S. Senate colleagues, Kay Bailey Hutchison—the first Texas woman in the body—said, ""It’s been a long and wonderful 19-plus years.""

Hutchison, a Republican, added that while she’s leaving the 100-member body, she departs knowing that ""January will see the greatest number of female senators in our nation’s history.""

Is that right?

By email, Hutchison spokesman Tom Flanagin pointed out a Bloomberg News article posted online Nov. 7, 2012, opening: ""Women will occupy a record number of U.S. Senate seats--one in five--in January, following victories in yesterday’s balloting.""

The story says five women, four of them Democrats, won first terms in the Senate, the results meaning that when the new Congress convenes in January 2013, 20 members will be women. ""Currently, 17 women--which had been the record--serve in the chamber,"" the story says, adding that Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Hutchison are retiring.

We harvested historical perspective from a Senate web page listing the 39 women who have served as senators since a 24-hour appointee, Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia, took the oath in November 1922.

Current female senators, in order of seniority with the most experienced first, are: Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Hutchison; Snowe; Mary Landrieu, D-La; Susan Collins, R-Maine.; Deborah Stabenow, D-Mich.; Marie E. Cantwell, D-Wash.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Kay Hagan, D-N.C.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.

News accounts say the Senate's 2013 newcomers include Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Deb Fischer, R-Neb.; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.; and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii.

Footnote: Hutchison was among seven female senators on her initial swearing-in in June 1993, according to the Senate web page. Women have held more than 10 Senate seats since 2001, more than 15 since 2007.

Milwaukee County Board chairwoman touts decrease in county portion of average tax bill for city of Milwaukee home
","
When the Milwaukee County Board completed its work on the 2013 budget in November 2012, the property tax levy was about $4 million higher than it was for the current year.

Supervisors overrode 22 of 24 budget vetoes from  County Executive Chris Abele, thwarting his effort to create a budget that included no increase. The final 2013 budget tallied $1.3 billion, with $279.3 million coming from property taxes. That’s an increase of 1.4 percent.

County Board Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic defended the board’s budget in a Nov. 14, 2012, interview on WTMJ-AM (620), noting the budget boosted public safety.

But then she touted the tax levy increase as a decrease for City of Milwaukee taxpayers.

Huh?

Here’s how Dimitrijevic explained it:

""If you live in the City of Milwaukee, the City of Milwaukee our largest municipality, the 1.4 percent that we increased taxes this year -- lower than inflation, like the city of Milwaukee, like Ozaukee County – in the city of Milwaukee on the average home, would be a $19 decrease. And I think that’s a small price to pay for enhanced public safety.""

With property tax bills landing in mailboxes, time for a refresher course on how this all works.

County Board fiscal and budget analyst Steve Cady said the claim was based on City of Milwaukee property revaluations, which were set in spring 2012. These are done annually to keep up with changes in the housing market.

The average Milwaukee house had an assessed value of about $106,000. The tax rate set in the county budget is about $5.25 per $1,000 of assessed value. That’s up 54 cents. (On the tax bill, the county tax rate is lumped together with the rate to support the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, but that group’s portion of the bill is tiny.)

How much you owe is determined by the value of your house.

In the 2012 reassessment, the average home in the city fell from $122,793 to $106,000. That means even though the tax rate went up, the bill for the county share of taxes went  down on that home by about $19.

So in dollars and cents terms, Dimitrijevic is correct.

But there’s a lot more to the story.

Across the country the value of residential property got hammered in the real estate bust, and Milwaukee was no exception. Between the beginning of 2008 and 2012, total assessed residential property value in Milwaukee fell by about 30 percent, said assessment commissioner Mary Reavey. Of course, it depends on your neighborhood and condition of your home -- some losses could be much higher (or lower) than others.

""Most people don’t cheer when their major asset goes down in value,"" noted Paula Hogan, a certified financial planner who operates her own firm in Glendale.

But, in effect, that is what Dimitrijevic is suggesting Milwaukee property owners do.

What about the reverse? Should homeowners want their house values and tax bill to increase?

Not necessarily, said Michael Arnow, a certified financial planner with Menomonee Falls-based Sattell, Johnson, Appel Financial Advisory LLC.

""A higher assessment is a double-edged sword,"" he said. ""If your tax bill goes up, you pay more taxes. Who wants to pay more taxes? If the value of your home goes up and you are a retiree on a fixed income you can be priced out of your neighborhood.""

In the case of this year’s bills, property owners may be paying somewhat less in taxes but the long-term loss is more serious, experts said.

For that average City of Milwaukee homeowner, the total tax bill for all taxing units this year would be $3,175, down about $107 from a year ago. That’s a small amount compared with the $16,000 in lost property value.

Said Hogan: ""If taxes are going down because the assessed value is going down, that’s not a good thing.""

Our rating

Dimitrijevic said the average city of Milwaukee homeowner would pay $19 less in county property taxes next year. She is correct on the bottom-line number. But by highlighting it as a piece of good news, she is leaving out critical information that would give a different impression. Namely, tax bills aren’t down because spending was cut by the County Board.

The bills are down in the City of Milwaukee because property values have fallen. Had there been no change in city property values, that bill would be $84 higher -- just to pay for the County Board’s decisions.

Are administrative costs capped at 5 percent for the Portland Children's Levy?
","
CORRECTION APPENDED: RACC has a 3 percent cap on programming at schools, not for arts grants administration. This does not change the ruling. 
  
Advocates of new taxes for programs know that voters want the money to go to the people the tax is supposed to serve. So, when supporters of a tax levy for children pitched the program in 2002 and in 2008, they made sure to tell voters that administrative costs would be capped at 5 percent of all money received from an increase in property taxes.

That means 95 percent of the money goes toward direct services for low-income and at-risk children, or at least, to the programs that serve those children.

Portland City Commissioner Dan Saltzman made the same point on KGW’s ""Straight Talk"" recently. (The statement is about 10 minutes into the interview.) The City Council has voted to put the property tax levy on the May 2013 ballot.

In singing the levy’s praises, he said, ""And we hold our administrative expenses to less than 5 percent.""

We wanted to know if the figure is accurate, and if so, what that means. We noticed that the campaign pitching a Portland arts tax this fall also stated that administrative costs would be capped at 5 percent, after startup costs. So clearly it’s trendy number. (Jessica Jarratt Miller, executive director of the Creative Advocacy Network, said in an email that they borrowed the figure from the Portland Children’s Levy.)

W e checked the annual audits of the Portland Children’s Levy and confirmed that levy administrators have consistently met the standard of keeping costs at or below 5 percent. For a sense of the dollars, the latest progress report shows that in 2010-11, the fund brought in $12.9 million, bringing the total available to $19.1 million. Of that, $560,000 was spent on administration. That’s 4.3 percent of $12.9 million.  

Now, we should point out that the administrative cap doesn’t work on an annual basis, according to the levy. If fund administrators don’t use up the entire 5 percent in one year, they can the following year. Which is why in fiscal year 2011-12, revenue was $10.8 million but administration expenses were $565,000, or 5.2 percent.

Levy administrators look at the cumulative figure: Spokeswoman Mary Gay Broderick reports that from July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2012, total revenue was $95.7 million, with $4.5 million of the money spent on administration. That comes out to 4.7 percent. Grants totaled nearly $90.2 million.

What is an administrative cost? Broderick explains they include all the costs associated with allocating, negotiating and monitoring grants. This includes salaries and benefits for staff, office lease, outside audit, computer costs, office supplies and general overhead, such as access to payroll and city attorney services. Other groups may define administrative costs differently.

(The groups that receive grant money from the Children’s Levy use a different marker and the rates are negotiated separately. Generally, administration costs cannot exceed 15 percent of program expenses.)

Finally, is a 5 percent cap a norm? We don’t know, and neither does Saltzman. He does not recall how early advocates settled on the figure. ""I think the 5 percent came from my belief that we had a pretty high bar to gain public support for investing in kids, and they need to be assured that most of the dollars are going not for our administration but to the programs,"" he said.

We hunted around for some context. The Portland Development Commission, which is the city’s economic development arm, granted $158,000 last year as part of its ""Green Features Grant"" program. Total staff time to manage the program was $17,000. That’s about a 10 percent administrative rate. PDC granted $569,000 through its ""Community Livability Grant"" program, with $87,000 to administer the program. That’s about 13 percent of costs.

The Oregon Department of Justice tracks charities and nonprofits in Oregon. Management expenses and fundraising made up of expenses in 16 percent in 2009 and 13 percent in 2010. So 5 percent spent on issuing and tracking grants sounds reasonable.

Portland’s Revenue Director Thomas Lannom said comparing administrative caps may not even be the most accurate way of gauging efficiency. An outfit like the Portland Children’s Levy needs little to no resources to collect revenue -- it comes out of property taxes -- while the new arts tax will require bodies to collect what is basically a head tax of $35 per adult worker.

Lannom explained that voters authorized his office to spend up to 5 percent of revenue to collect the money. The Regional Arts and Culture Council has a separate 3 percent cap on coordination costs.

PolitiFact Oregon can’t judge what is the proper amount for administrative costs, but we can say that Saltzman is accurate when he says the Portland Children’s Levy holds its ""administrative expenses to less than 5 percent.""

"['Economy', 'States', 'Texas', 'Texas secession petition']","
Secession petition says Texas has 15th largest economy in the world
","
When numerous petitions to secede popped up on the White House’s website after President Barack Obama was re-elected, one drew a Texas-sized share of attention.

Drawing tens of thousands of signatures within days, the petition written by ""Micah H"" made national news. Among its claims: Texas ""is the 15th largest economy in the world.""

We decided to check that claim and a related one from Texas pro-secession candidate Larry Kilgore, who said the Texas economy is 30 percent larger than Australia’s. That's False.

The petition’s author was quickly identified in news reports, including a Nov. 14, 2012, story in The Shorthorn, the University of Texas-Arlington’s campus paper, as Micah Hurd, a Marine Corps veteran enrolled at the university. Hurd told CBS-TV, Channel 11, of Dallas in a Nov. 14 interview that he wrote the petition in five minutes, not anticipating it would make news.

We did not reach Hurd about the basis of his Texas ranking. Plowing ahead, we touched base with the Texas state comptroller’s office, which calculates each year how Texas would rank globally if it were a nation.

Spokesman RJ DeSilva emailed us the comptroller’s most recent chart, drawing on early-2011 figures for gross domestic product in U.S. dollars from economic forecasting firm IHS Global Insight and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the statistical branch of the U.S. Commerce Department.

He also sent the final 2011 GDP for Texas, which was almost the same as the preliminary amount; both rounded off to $1.3 trillion.

GDP, the most-used measure of national economic output, is defined as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within a country.

The comptroller’s chart showed that if Texas were a nation (in early 2011), its $1.3 trillion GDP would have ranked 14th -- just below Australia’s $1.5 trillion and above Mexico’s $1.2 trillion. 
  
Separately, bureau spokesman Thomas Dail told us by phone that finding nations’ 2011 GDP calculated with current prices in U.S. dollars would allow us to make a ""conceptually consistent"" comparison with his agency’s calculation of Texas GDP.

Dail helped us generate such a chart on the International Monetary Fund website. It looked pretty similar to the comptroller’s figures, and again, Texas ranked 14th, between Australia and Mexico.

Finally, on another suggestion from Dail, we turned to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that comprises 34 countries. Spokesman Matthias Rumpf told us his organization didn’t have Texas data for 2011, but ""the claim about the relative size of Texas' GDP does not seem out of proportion.""

He created a spreadsheet for us showing 2008 and 2009 GDPs adjusted for ""purchasing power parity,"" which eliminates distortions based on the relative value of currencies and the local costs of commodities.

Rumpf’s spreadsheet included nations and U.S. regions -- specifically, he said, ""GDP for the larger OECD countries, other large economies (some big countries are missing) and large regions in the OECD,"" given in U.S. dollars.

In 2008 and 2009, Texas ranked 14th, falling between Canada and Turkey. However, the charts showed that if California had been a country, too, it would have come in 10th and bumped Texas to 15th in both years.

Note to self: Do not secede at same time California does.

It’s all an academic exercise, anyway, because secession would change a number of economic factors. Trade agreements, national defense and the postal service leap to mind. And then there’s the labor-force productivity issue raised by Austin American-Statesman humor columnist John Kelso: Would we all have to work on the Fourth of July?

 Our ruling

Hurd’s petition claimed that Texas is the 15th largest economy in the world. By a reasonable measure, Texas’ GDP would rank it 14th among nations. We rate the statement as True.",/factchecks/2012/dec/18/texas-petition/secession-petition-says-texas-has-15th-largest-eco/

Allen West said the House voted to remove the word 'lunatic' from federal law
","The first week of December in Congress was dominated by news about the fiscal cliff. So you will forgive us if we overlooked this other tidbit tucked into the final weekly newsletter sent by U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens.

""This week we voted in the House of Representatives to remove the word ‘lunatic’ from federal law,"" wrote West, who lost a close race to Democrat Patrick Murphy in District 18 in Florida’s Treasure Coast. ""However, that does not mean there isn't plenty of lunacy going on in the workings of the federal government!""

We can’t fact-check the amount of lunacy in Washington, D.C., but we couldn’t resist looking into whether the House actually voted to remove the word ""lunatic"" from federal law.

On Dec. 5, the House voted 398-1 in favor of Senate Bill 2367, the 21st Century Language Act of 2012. The bill, which the Senate approved by unanimous consent in May, struck the word ""lunatic"" from federal law. As of Dec. 17, it was awaiting President Barack Obama’s signature.

The vote was part of an effort to remove outdated and demeaning language, and it was supported by advocates for people with mental health conditions. The bill was sponsored by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., in response to a constituent’s request.

""The term ‘lunatic’ derives from the Latin word for ‘moon,’ "" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, before the House vote, according to the congressional record. ""Before the modern era, it was used to describe a person who suffers from mental disease because of the belief that lunar cycles had an impact on brain function. But as science and medicine have progressed, society has come to understand mental illness with more clarity.""

Rep. Robert C. Scott, D-Va., said ""this bill eliminates outdated references in the U.S. Code that stigmatize individuals with mental illness issues. ... The term ‘lunatic’ holds a place in antiquity and should no longer have a prominent place in our U.S. Code.""

Scott compared it to a law in 2010 that replaced parts of federal law containing the phrase ""having mental retardation'' with the phrase ""having intellectual disabilities.''

The bill deletes ""lunatic"" from Section 1 of Title 1 of the U.S. Code which states ""the words ‘insane’ and ‘insane person’ and ‘lunatic’ shall include every idiot, lunatic, insane person, and person non compos mentis.""

The Congressional Research Service summary says the bill ""removes references to the word ‘lunatic’ from rules of construction of the U.S. Code and banking law provisions concerning: (1) trust powers of banks, and (2) bank consolidations and mergers.""

University of Miami banking law professor Stanley Langbein told PolitiFact Florida that, ""By lunatics, the law means what today we would refer to as persons ‘adjudicated incompetent’ – and the person’s affairs would probably not be administered by a committee, but by what we would call a ‘guardian.’ ...  Moreover, the term ‘lunatic,’ though once commonly used in the law (the late 19th and early 20th centuries) is no longer used; when it was used, I believe it referred to a mentally disabled individual, usually what we would call a ‘special needs’ person, or more harshly a ‘mentally retarded’ person, today.""

The lone ""no"" vote was cast by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, who issued a statement saying, ""Not only should we not eliminate the word 'lunatic' from federal law when the most pressing issue of the day is saving our country from bankruptcy, we should use the word to describe the people who want to continue with business as usual in Washington.""

For the record, West voted to strike the word ""lunatic,"" but he only gave it a brief mention in his final weekly newsletter, which focused more on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, foreign affairs, and the economy. And West wrote that his final weekly update as a congressman from District 22 wasn’t really his last word. (He represented District 22 but ran in District 18 due to redistricting. For more on his parting thoughts, read his post-election interview with NPR.)

Our ruling

West said the House of Representatives ""voted to remove the word ‘lunatic’ from federal law."" Indeed, the House voted 398-1 to do just that.

Jim Moran says cuts to pay and pensions will cost federal workers $103 billion over 10 years
","
U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, is concerned that federal employees will be viewed as sacrificial lambs in negotiations to cut deficits and avoid the end-of-the-year fiscal cliff.

So he wrote a letter reminding President Barack Obama of a number of steps Congress and the White House already have taken to save money at the expense of U.S. government workers. The Nov. 21 missive was signed by a bipartisan group of nine House members from Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia who represent large numbers of federal employees.

Moran wrote, ""Since the beginning of 2011, through various legislative and administration actions, the budget savings derived from reduced compensation and benefits for the federal workforce has totaled at least $103 billion (or more than $50,000 per employee), as measured over the 10 year budget window.""

We wondered his figures on compensation and benefits cuts for federal employees -- at least $103 billion over 10 years, more than $50,000 per worker -- hold up.

Anne Hughes, Moran’s spokeswoman, pointed us to a variety of White House and congressional documents that she said back up her boss.

Moran’s estimate of $103 billion in compensation and benefits cuts is based on three actions:

*Congress canceled 1.4 percent cost-of living raises scheduled for all federal civilian employees in 2011 and 2012. The White House, which proposed the pay freeze, estimated it would save $60 billion over 10 years.

*Obama has asked for a 0.5 percent pay raise for federal employees in 2013, but Congress is not expected to put the increase into effect before April, when it needs to approve a new continuing resolution to fund government. Congress, on the other hand, has approved a 1.7 percent raise for the military that would go into effect Jan. 1. Prior to the recession, Congress typically approved equal raises for federal workers and the military. The White House estimates the smaller pay hike for bureaucrats would save $28 billion over 10 years.

*Pension contributions made by new federal employees will be increased as a result of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Starting Jan. 1, new workers will have to contribute 2.3 percent of their pay to retirement while other federal bureaucrats will continue to pay 0.8 percent. The Senate Finance Committee and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate that the increase for new employees will save the government $15.5 billion over 11 years -- not the 10 years mentioned in Moran’s letter.

These three actions add up to $103.5 billion -- almost exactly the number Moran cited.

But do they break down to ""more than $50,000"" per federal worker, as the congressman claimed?

Not quite.

The number of full time, federal civilian employees has held steady at 2.1 million since 2010, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management that Moran used and to White House figures. So the lost wages and benefits comes to about $49,047 per worker.

We should note that the White House estimates the U.S. spent $242 billion in salaries and benefits for executive branch employees, not including the military, during fiscal 2012, which ended Sept. 30. That amounts to 6.4 percent of the $3.8 trillion in federal spending during the budget year.

Our ruling

Moran wrote that Congress and the White House has saved $103 billion over 10 years by cutting pay raises and benefits for non-military federal employees. That breaks down to more than $50,000 per worker, he wrote.

Moran is right about the $103 billion total cost. The discrepancies in other numbers he uses are insignificant. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2012/dec/17/jim-moran/jim-moran-says-cuts-pay-and-pensions-will-cost-fed/

UPDATED: Thomas Ratliff says Massachusetts imposes three mandatory student tests, Finland just one
","
Saying Texas students face too many state-mandated exams, an East Texas member of the State Board of Education suggested two faraway places enjoy stellar results with minimal government-imposed testing.

In an opinion column published in the Dec. 10, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Thomas Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said: ""Massachusetts, the envy of all public school systems in the United States, has three state-mandated tests. Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. That’s right, one.""

We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. 
But we have experience counting tests. In August 2012, we rated False a claim that Texas students spend 45 days a year on state-ordered exams after earlier rating Mostly False a claim about the number of testing days in the Austin schools.

Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliff’s article does not say if he’s critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade.

By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation.

So, what of Massachusetts and Finland?

Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard.

Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay State’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain ""proficient"" scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the state’s ""proficient"" score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing.

By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the state’s high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.

Now let’s flip to Finland.

Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there ""are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students’ senior year in high school.""

The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exam’s purpose is to ""discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university.""

According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall.

However, the exam is not a one-and-done. It’s composed of ""at least four tests,"" one that each student must take in his or her ""mother tongue""—Finnish, Swedish or Saami—and three others at their choice either on the ""second national language"" or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education.

""As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests,"" the web page says.

Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests?

Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students ""if they wish can take more exams."" Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. 
Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the country’s nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu Mäki-Lassila of Finland’s Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email.

Our ruling

Ratliff wrote that Massachusetts has three mandated student tests and Finland one.

Both claims reflect the exams that students in Massachusetts and Finland have to take to qualify for high school graduation.

But students on the academic track in Finland must take at least four separate tests. Also, given that Ratliff’s article does not say he’s speaking only to tests administered in high school, it’s worth noting that Massachusetts, like Texas, requires students starting in third grade to take state tests.

This claim grades out as Half True. 
CLARIFICATION, 10:00 a.m., Dec. 19, 2012: We amended this article to point out that Finnish students who focus on vocational courses at the secondary level do not have to take a government-mandated exam to graduate.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker erased his pledge to create jobs, state Democratic chairman Mike Tate says
","
Gov. Scott Walker is nearly halfway through his four-year term, and has a long way to go to meet his campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs.

We keep track of the promise (and many others) on the Walk-O-Meter. The most recent update, which includes the October 2012 monthly jobs report, shows the state has created 25,411 private-sector jobs under Walker’s watch -- roughly one-tenth of the total he promised as a candidate in 2010.

As state Democrats look toward the 2014 election, it’s natural they would focus on this part of Walker’s record.  Party Chairman Mike Tate launched an early volley in a Dec. 3, 2012 blog post criticizing management of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., which Walker chairs. The WEDC, which under Walker replaced the Commerce Department, is looking into millions in loans it made that have fallen behind or gone unpaid.

""Scott Walker’s WEDC was supposed to help create 250,000 new jobs and be the symbol of his first term in office,"" Tate wrote, then added: ""Scott Walker has even removed the 250,000 jobs promise from his website.""

Whoa. Has Team Walker scrubbed the top campaign promise from his website?

Asked to provide backup for Tate’s claim, party spokesman Graeme Zielinski referred us to several online posts made by Walker’s campaign, including a March 2010 YouTube video on the topic. Another link was to a 2010 appearance by Walker on the ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" show on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee, where he discussed the promise.

But these videos shed no light on Tate’s claim about the promise now being gone from the website. Indeed, they are from before Walker took office.

Zielinski also pointed to a change on Walker’s campaign web page, saying: ""On Scott Walker's issue page there is one bullet that talks about Jobs. It's now called, Putting Wisconsin Back to Work. This is a complete different page than the one he had on his website previously, called Scott’s Plan to to Help the People of Wisconsin Create 250,000 Jobs.""

Fair enough.

But Tate’s claim wasn’t that Walker had downplayed the promise. It was that he removed it entirely from his web page.

We examined the site. The ""Putting Wisconsin Back to Work"" section discusses steps Walker has taken to improve employment. It makes no mention of the 250,000 jobs claim. However the promise is mentioned in the site’s ""About Scott"" section, where it says:

""Governor Walker remains committed to helping Wisconsin's private sector create 250,000 jobs by 2015.""

The site might have changed, but the promise hasn’t been removed.

We also did a Google search of Scott Walker. That campaign site and Walker’s official site turned up in the first screen.

The governor’s official site stands behind the promise even more prominently, on the first page: ""250,000 new jobs in four years -- It’s an ambitious goal, but one that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says is achievable.""

As we’ve followed the jobs promise, we have noted many steps the administration has taken to downplay the promise, or efforts to measure it. For instance, shortly after Walker took office, the state jobs tracking agency first celebrated each month’s jobs reports. Now, the monthly reports come with long explanations about why the month-to-month data can’t be trusted.

Our rating

Tate said Walker has removed the promise to create 250,000 jobs from his website. We checked the campaign website and the governor’s official state website. The promise is there, and is repeated in numerous videos and news clippings. Even a simple search leads to that conclusion.

"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'ACLU Foundation of Georgia']","
Group says number of detainees has skyrocketed in 15 years
","
The American Civil Liberties Union estimates the federal government spends $1.7 billion a year to detain illegal immigrants, which the group thinks is a waste of money.

The ACLU Foundation of Georgia recently sent out a news release that decried the spending, made complaints about inadequate staffing levels and claimed some detainees are being mistreated at federal facilities, including the Stewart Detention Center in southwest Georgia. There was one set of numbers included in the release about detainees nationally that PolitiFact Georgia wanted to fact-check.

""In the last 15 years, we've witnessed a dramatic expansion in the jailing of immigrants, from about 70,000 people detained annually to about 400,000,"" the release said.

The liberal-leaning foundation has used these estimates in other news releases. We wondered whether the claim was correct, or is the ACLU using inflated numbers to bolster its argument?

Azadeh N. Shahshahani, director of the foundation’s National Security/Immigrants' Rights Project, said it based the claim off reports it has seen. We found lots of information detailing the current number of detainees. The data for detainees held 15 years ago? Not so easy to find.

In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Under the law, any person entering the United States illegally will be barred from entering the country legally for five years. A person who enters the United States illegally again and is caught will be banned from entering legally for 20 years. Federal reports we reviewed show there’s been an increase in the number of illegal immigrants detained since the law was passed.

The federal government says it has put a greater emphasis on enforcement, spent more on beds to house detainees, given more money to states toward the effort and has a policy of mandatory detention of illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes.

""The detention budget has increased, and our ability to detain more people has similarly increased,"" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Vincent Picard said.

The federal government uses a 12-month budget cycle that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. For fiscal year 2011, which covered Oct. 1, 2010, to Sept. 30, 2011, there were 429,247 illegal immigrants detained by the federal government, according to ICE. Detainees were held an average of nearly 30 days, ICE data show. The average daily population was 33,330.

Picard said annual data go back to 2001. That year, 204,459 detainees were held. ICE keeps data on the average number of detainees held each day going back to 1994, we found. Part of the difficulty in tracking these numbers is the federal government reorganized its immigration enforcement under the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, abolishing the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which tracked immigration data.

So where did the earlier estimate come from?

Shahshahani said the ACLU found it on several websites, which she shared with us. Indeed, the estimate of 70,000 detainees held in the mid-1990s is included in various blogs by human rights organizations. None, however, contained the source of the claim. Shahshahani suggested the annual total is likely still accurate if you look at the annual figures since 2001.

""Obviously, the daily figure has increased, so, possibly, the same extrapolation can be made of the annual figures,"" she said.

Typically, the average daily detainee figures are about one-tenth the total of the annual figure. In 1995, the year before the law was passed, federal data show an average of 7,475 detainees were held.

PolitiFact Georgia did some more digging and found a U.S. Justice Department report that backs up the ACLU Foundation’s claim. The report covered fiscal years 1994 to 2001.

""The number of aliens ordered detained and taken into the custody of the INS pending removal from the United States or other outcome of an immigration proceeding increased from 72,154 during FY 1994 to 188,547 during FY 2001,"" the report said.

Picard, the ICE spokesman, said he wouldn’t dispute the Justice Department report.

To sum up, the ACLU Foundation of Georgia claimed the number of federal detainees has increased in the past 15 years from about 70,000 to 400,000. The 400,000 estimate seems accurate. One federal estimate from the mid-1990s corroborates the foundation’s argument. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2012/dec/17/aclu-georgia-foundation/group-says-number-detainees-has-skyrocketed-15-yea/
"['New Hampshire', 'Federal Budget', 'Kelly  Ayotte']","
Obama's budget was a flop among both parties, says Kelly Ayotte, R-NH
","
Presented last month, President Barack Obama’s initial deficit reduction proposal sounded familiar to U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte.

Targeting the same tax increases without any significant entitlement reforms, the proposal had the same tenets as Obama’s last budget, according to Ayotte, New Hampshire’s junior senator. And, unless the president comes up with something new, it’s likely to meet a similar death, she said in an interview on CNN’s State of the Union.

""I see (the proposal) as very disappointing,"" Ayotte told anchor Candy Crowley during the December 2 interview.

""(We have) a big problem in this country. That's why I didn't like seeing what was essentially a re-run of his budget that couldn't get support from either party in the House or the Senate. … It is time for us to come together and solve the big problems.""

Obama’s Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal, introduced in February 2012 never reached the House floor for a vote. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it failed to get support from either side. We decided to take a closer look.

We must note that the president’s budget proposal does not dictate federal spending. Rather, the proposal serves as a starting point for House and Senate lawmakers as they shape their own spending plans.

Such was the case for the president’s $3.2 trillion proposal that the White House first unveiled onFeb. 13, 2012. Despite Ayotte’s claim that the budget received no support from either party in the House or Senate, Obama’s budget drew immediate praise from some leading Democrats.

""The President has put forth a budget that invests in job creation and economic growth in the short-term and gets our nation on a long-term, responsible path to fiscal sustainability,"" U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said at the time in a written statement.

""President Obama’s budget would continue to move the nation in the right direction,"" U.S. Sen. Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, added in a statement. ""For the near-term, it correctly focuses on strengthening the economy and creating jobs. That is the right near-term priority.""

The next month, the House Budget Committee, led by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the future vice presidential nominee, countered with its own proposal, titled The Path to Prosperity.

Before House lawmakers acted on the Ryan budget, however, Republicans called for a vote on the President’s spending plan in the form of House Amendment 999, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican.

The amendment, based on spending and revenue numbers from the president’s budget, fell in the House 244-0, and, two months later, a similar motion, Concurrent Resolution 41, failed the Senate by a 99-0 count.

Reached for comment, Ayotte’s staff referenced these two votes as support for her statement.

Republicans, both at the time and now, argue that the amendments mirrored the president’s spending plans and the votes represented an indictment of the president and his spending plan.

""It is the President's budget. It has the numbers in it that the President had. They directly reflect the President's request,"" U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, the primary sponsor of the amendment, said as he presented the amendment on the Senate floor.

But, then as in now, Democratic opponents, analysts and news outlets called the amendments maneuvers and stunts intended to stir up opposition to the president and his budget.

At the time, the White House called the House amendment a ""gimmick,"" saying it intended to distract lawmakers from the damaging effects of the House Republicans’ budget, according to an article printed in The Hill.

And now, nine months later, political analysts continue to see the amendments as political stunts more than a meaningful action.

In both cases, the amendments were sponsored by Republican lawmakers who never intended them to pass, including only the final budget figures without any specific department breakdowns or tax policies, according to Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a partnership between the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.

""It’s pure political maneuvering. Fairly simply,"" Williams said. ""The Republicans were the ones who brought it up. You know they didn't want to pass it. They do it for pure political reasons.""

Further, without the political motives, Congress, the nation’s budgeting authority, would not adopt the president’s budget in fear of losing its autonomy, according to Stuart Kasdin, an assistant professor of public policy and public administration at George Washington University.

""That would be something like saying we're no longer able to govern ourselves, we just take what the president gives us,"" Kasdin said. ""Even if this weren't a politically charged environment, Congress would never start like that.""

After the amendment vote, the House went on to approve the House Republican budget proposal, which then stalled in the Democratic-led Senate. But, with the failed amendments, Republican lawmakers came away with a good talking point regarding the president’s budget proposal heading into the fall election, analysts said.

""It’s happened in past years … and it’s never viewed as serious,"" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""

""It’s what we generally describe as votes that are designed to make some sort of a point, and then the other party always tries to avoid giving it any credibility by going along and having everybody vote it down,"" he said. ""But it certainly doesn't mean that the people who voted against it don’t support the president’s budget.""

Our ruling:

Looking only at the votes taken on the House and Senate amendments, there’s a kernel of truth to Ayotte’s statement. Neither amendment earned a single vote from either party. However, these amendments represented only a skeleton of the president’s budget, and the sponsors offered them to score political points, not for serious consideration.

Further, Ayotte said Obama’s budget couldn’t get ""support"" -- she never used the word ""votes."" And the truth is Democrats in both the House and Senate showed plenty of support for Obama’s $3.2 trillion budget plan by praising it when it was released.

We rate Ayotte’s claim Mostly False.

"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says Wisconsin has created almost 100,000 jobs since he took office
","
Gov. Scott Walker’s top campaign promise was that the state would create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his four-year term.

Walker has made the vow in a variety of forums, including speeches, videos, and on his campaign and official websites. But the state’s progress in job creation was last in the nation in 2011 -- and there have been no signs of a significant turnaround in 2012.

During the 2012 recall election, Walker touted about 33,000 new jobs.

So, where did a figure of nearly 100,000 come from?

That’s the number Walker cited Dec. 12, 2012 in response to questions at a workforce development event in Pewaukee, when he said he thought he still could reach 250,000.

""We're just under 100,000"" jobs,  he said. ""It's going to be tough, no doubt about it.""

And he added: ""We're going to achieve it.""

A few hours later at an event in Madison, Walker gave a more precise figure when asked about progress on the 250,000 jobs promise. He said the number of jobs created was just over 86,000:
""We're not there yet, but we're moving at a much better pace than most people think.""

When we asked about the ""just under 100,000 figure,"" Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster said the number was based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, considered the most reliable measure of employment. She said the data showed there were 86,490 jobs created from December 2010 (just before Walker took office) to June 2012 (the most recent quarter available).

""There was a question, and the number he gave is based on that QCEW raw data,"" Webster said.

Webster said she had no further explanation for the number other than to say it came from the state Department of Workforce Development.

""Part of it was that it was the number that the governor had been told,"" she said. ""That is where it came from.""

At PolitiFact, we’ve been down this path.

And down this math.

For our monthly update of Walker’s progress, we wanted to use the most accurate data possible. That would be the census data which comes from a quarterly survey of 95 percent of the state’s employers. There also are monthly numbers from a much smaller sample that are less accurate.

The end of the year census data for 2011 showed a net increase of 27,811 jobs. When the first quarter census data came out for 2012, we thought about adding those numbers to the 2011 figure and create a running total.

But we were warned against it.

By whom?

A state Department of Revenue Economist and officials with the governor’s office and the Department of Workforce Development.

They said it was inaccurate to view the census data in anything other than one-year blocks. In other words, you can’t combine partial years of census data with full years to create a running total.

""Please don’t, as John Koskinen, an economist at DOR would say, compare February temperatures to July,"" said Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie when we asked about job numbers last summer.

When we talked to Koskinen, here’s what he said: ""The QCEW data published by DWD, and maintained by the BLS (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), is not seasonally adjusted. The seasonal pattern overwhelms any trend, so a direct comparison between December 2010 and March 2012 is not valid.  The only valid comparison between December 2010 and March 2012 would be with data that is seasonally adjusted.""

Werwie also noted the seasonally adjusted issue, and said if we combined the yearly and quarterly data ""you’ll end up misrepresenting the truth.""

DWD has followed this approach when it has released quarterly jobs data this year.

For instance, on Nov. 15, 2012 the department issued a report based on the census data, but limited it to the 12 months between June 2011 and June 2012. That report said the state created 35,379 jobs in that time frame. The department did the same thing Aug. 16, 2012 when it released census data comparing March 2011 with March 2012, showing a gain of 37,464 jobs in that period.

To be sure, Walker has maintained a love-hate relationship with the jobs data over the course of his two years in office. Much of that has been directed at the monthly Current Employment Survey data, which is far less accurate and prone to revisions.

Early on, Walker celebrated monthly increases with news conferences.  And when the monthly numbers have declined, members of his administration have criticized the figures as being sloppy.

After talking with state officials, including Koskinen, and other experts, we came up with our own formula for measuring the jobs progress on the Walk-O-Meter. We take the full year of jobs as measured by the census numbers  -- 27,811 -- and add to that the running monthly tallies for 2012. It’s an estimate, but, all outside experts agreed, the best available given the limitations of the data.

Using this formula, we determined that as of the Nov. 15, 2012 monthly report, which covered October 2012, the state created 25,411 private sector jobs under Walker’s watch.

We emailed Koskinen and DWD officials to ask for their take on Walker’s use of the census data. No one got back to us with a response. 
We later heard again from Webster, who said Walker was simply providing the latest ""raw data"" as ""a snapshot with no assumptions."" However, the governor included no such qualifications when he made the remarks. Webster also noted ""six quarters of economic activity obviously cannot be used to accurately project two full years of job activity."" 
Our rating

Walker said the state has created ""just under 100,000"" jobs since he took office. He arrived at that number by combining full and partial years of census data.

However, several within his own administration, including his primary spokesman, have said that is the wrong way to measure jobs -- you can’t combine partial and full year data sets. As one aide said: It would be ""misrepresenting the truth.""

By his administration’s own yardstick, his statement is false. We think it’s ridiculous to -- after private admonitions -- publicly present it this way. Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2012/dec/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-has-created-almost/

Lou Greenwald says low-paying jobs seeing most growth in New Jersey
","
Job growth in some fields appears to be a bumper crop in the Garden State, but it’s not the kind that appeals to Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald (D-Camden).

Greenwald said during a Dec. 4 press conference in Trenton that the state needs higher-paying jobs to grow the economy.

""Right now one of our highest job growth sectors is Leisure and Hospitality,"" Greenwald said during the press conference to announce a Democrat bills package focusing on job creation and economic development. ""We've added jobs that mostly fall within the restaurant and bar sector industry. These are not high-paying jobs, as the U.S. Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs.""

Greenwald is correct that Leisure and Hospitality is one of New Jersey’s highest job growth sectors, and that the jobs are considered low-paying. The rest of his statement was erroneous, however.

Let’s look at each part of Greenwald’s remarks.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks data in 11 major employment sectors, including Leisure and Hospitality. Jobs in that sector typically include bartenders, servers, food-service workers and other service-oriented jobs.

""Jobs in this sector are often part-time, seasonal, and paid at low hourly rates,"" said Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.

Total employment in that sector in New Jersey increased by 5,700 jobs (1.7 percent) from October 2011 to October 2012, according to BLS data.

The only sector with higher job growth for the same period was Education and Health Services, at 16,600 jobs (2.7 percent).

Next, let’s review salary for both sectors.

Leisure and Hospitality jobs in New Jersey had the lowest average salary in 2011, at about $22,329, according to BLS data and Seneca. The average salary in the state that year was $57,546.

The numbers are also low when looking at average weekly wages, said Martin Kohli, a chief regional economist for the BLS.

For first-quarter 2012, the average weekly wage in New Jersey for workers in Leisure and Hospitality fields was $450, according to a database Koli prepared for us. That’s the lowest salary of the 11 sectors that BLS tracks, Koli said.

How did Education and Health Services compare? In New Jersey, the average annual wage in 2011 was $47,338. The weekly salary for first-quarter 2012 was $893.

""The Majority Leader acknowledged that we have created some jobs in New Jersey,"" Brian McGinnis, Greenwald's communications director, said in an e-mail. ""No one is disputing that. He used the example of the Leisure and Hospitality sector to make a larger point. As the data … show, while this sector has added jobs, they are not for the most part the kind of good-paying middle-class jobs that will help drive a strong economic recovery in New Jersey.""

Now let’s look at the rest of Greenwald’s claim.

Greenwald said Leisure and Hospitality has ""the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs."" That would mean a small number of those workers are earning minimum wage or below, and that’s not accurate. McGinnis acknowledged that Greenwald misspoke.

""The data show the Leisure and Hospitality sector is the industry with the highest proportion of its workers earning minimum wage or below,"" McGinnis said. "" The data further show that about one half of all workers who are paid at or below minimum wage are working in this industry -- primarily in restaurant/food service.""

Our ruling

Greenwald said, ""Right now one of our highest job growth sectors is Leisure and Hospitality. We've added jobs that mostly fall within the restaurant and bar sector industry. These are not high-paying jobs, as the U.S. Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs.""

Leisure and Hospitality saw the second-highest rate of job growth in New Jersey in 2011, but a BLS economist confirmed that the average weekly salary of workers for that sector is the lowest among all sectors tracked.

Greenwald, however, misstated that those jobs have the lowest proportion of workers earning minimum wage or below.

We rate Greenwald’s statement Mostly True.

Obama says fiscal cliff poses risk to 400,000 middle class Rhode Island families
","
If the fiscal cliff talks don't come to a resolution by Jan. 1, people will have to start paying more in taxes because the Bush tax cuts will no longer be in effect.

In an attempt to give taxpayers a sense of the impact of not extending the cuts, the Obama administration has issued state-by-state estimates of how many families would be affected if the cuts expire.

In a report tailored for Rhode Island, the administration claims: ""If the House of Representatives fails to extend the middle-class tax cuts, 400,000 middle-class Rhode Island families will see their federal income taxes increase.""

Rhode Island only has a million people (1,051,302 according to the latest census estimate). So 400,000 middle-class families seemed like a high number to us. We decided to check.

The latest data from the Census Bureau says there are 412,259 households in Rhode Island, but only 256,181 households with families. The rest are non-family households, mostly people living alone. That's a huge difference.

(There's an identical problem with the national numbers the Obama administration is using. The White House says 114 million middle-class families across the United States would be affected. The number of families is actually 76 million.)

The second problem: Not all Rhode Island’s 256,000 families are middle-class families.

The federal poverty level is about $15,000 a year for a family of two. According to the latest census income data from 2011, 8.4 percent of Rhode Island families -- about 21,500 -- had an income of less than $15,000.

Subtract that number from 256,000 and you get about 234,500 families.

(If you do the same calculation on a national level, the 114 million middle-class families that the White House talks about is really fewer than 70 million families.)

Another complication: There is no official definition of middle class. People in a wide range of income levels consider themselves to be there.

""Everybody thinks he's middle class,"" said Nick Kasprak, an analyst with The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy. Kasprak said the category is meaningless.

In addition, Kasprak said, everyone who already pays taxes will be in the same boat if a deal isn't reached, whether they would be considered middle class or not.

""The only people who are unaffected by the fiscal cliff are the people that don’t file a tax return,"" Kasprak said in an e-mail. Tax increases ""hit pretty much everyone"" who files. ""If you pay taxes at all, they will go up – there’s no cutoff line.""

We contacted the White House to ask about its numbers, but no one would talk to us for the record.

In summary, the Obama administration is taking the number of households in the United States -- and Rhode Island -- and inaccurately categorizing them as middle-class families.

There's no need to exaggerate the numbers. Without an agreement on tax reform, a lot of people are going to be affected.

But saying that the number of middle-class Rhode Island families to be affected is 400,000 is a substantial exaggeration. We rate Mr. Obama's claim False.

Sanchez makes Pants On Fire claim about California gun database
"," Critics have repeatedly attacked California Attorney General Kamala Harris for what they say is her slow progress investigating gun owners who are legally prohibited from having them. In 2001, California created the nation’s only database to identify these gun owners, including the mentally ill and those subject to domestic violence restraining orders. It allows the seizure of weapons by law enforcement from people in the prohibited categories. There’s no record of anyone questioning the existence of the database, which has been praised by gun control advocates. But a decade after it went into effect, the tracking system has a backlog of thousands of cases. Enter Rep. Loretta Sanchez. The Orange County congresswoman is Harris’ closest competitor for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. All three are Democrats. Sanchez told Capital Public Radio during an interview in January 2016 that Harris has squandered state resources, and hasn’t even produced a database. ""So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn’t be able to purchase guns – by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that database,"" Sanchez said. We decided to focus on whether the database exists, and check on how the state funds have been spent. #ICYMI: See & hear the words that put @LorettaSanchez on the hot seat. #PantsOnFire: https://t.co/HEY8WGisUz pic.twitter.com/pBIkGNvYHd   Our research The database is officially called the Armed Prohibited Persons System, or APPS. It was created in 2001 after the Legislature passed SB 950, a Republican-authored bill, in response to gun violence across the nation. It cross-references all handgun and assault weapon owners in California against criminal records. It’s designed to check for individuals who legally purchased or registered a firearm but later committed a crime that would prevent them from owning the gun. Law enforcement agents are charged with tracking down the individuals and trying to confiscate their weapons. The database became active in December 2006, according to Harris’ office, or four years before she was elected attorney general. In this Nov. 16, 2012 Associated Press file photo, California Attorney General Kamala Harris speaks during a news conference in Los Angeles. While the database is not public, it is real. It’s been tied to a court challenge and is the subject of reports by the Attorney General’s Office, articles by the press, and letters by gun rights groups and gun control advocates. ""Yes. It does exist,"" said Michelle Gregory, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s Office. ""These (enforcement) agents are working these cases every day. … It’s definitely a lot of work. It’s time consuming."" ""The database absolutely exists,"" added Mike McLively, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. We asked the Sanchez campaign to explain her claim. A campaign spokesman argued that it’s correct — if you add words that greatly change the original statement: ""To date, we don’t have that database as it was promised by the (State) Department of Justice in 2013,"" the spokesman wrote in an email. As a refresher, here’s what Sanchez said originally: ""Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that database."" Still a backlog? It’s a clear misstatement to say ""we don’t have that database."" But we wanted to see what progress Harris has made reducing its backlog, to better examine Sanchez’s claim that ""nothing was done"" and that ""$25 million was spent."" In 2013, the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown approved $24 million in additional funds to reduce the long list of cases. It had grown to more than 20,700 at the time, according to Harris’ office. Earlier that year, a Harris aide seemed to suggest that the backlog could be eliminated in a single year, according to news reports from the time. That same year, the attorney general pledged to hire 36 enforcement agents with the money. Two years later, only half as many had been hired  due to what Harris’ office called ""hiring challenges."" And while state investigations helped clear nearly 7,000 names off the list, the overall backlog had shrunk by only one-fifth during that time, to about 17,500, according to a March 2015 report by the Attorney General’s office.  A sample of the firearms seized through the state's APPS program.

Sanchez’s comments about the database came five days before the Attorney General’s Office issued another report on the program. It said the list is now down to about 12,700 cases, which the office called ""a historic low."" The report makes clear that the list is not static. More than 20,000 people were added to it during the past two and a half years, while about 7,800 dropped off due to death or other reasons.

Loretta Sanchez said in a recent interview that California Attorney General Kamala Harris has done ""nothing"" to address a backlog of cases in a high-profile gun ownership tracking system. The database allows law enforcement to seize guns from people with criminal records and mental illness. ""So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn’t be able to purchase guns – by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that database,"" Sanchez said. Not only does the program exist, but some progress has been made. The backlog has been cut from more than 20,000 cases to 12,700. That’s after Harris’ office spent $15 million of $24 million allocated by the Legislature and governor. Some continue to argue that the cases should be cleared more quickly, citing the mass shootings that have continued across the country. But there’s no denying that the Attorney General’s Office, under Harris, has put a dent in the backlog, allowing for the seizure of thousands of guns. And that’s far from ""nothing."" While there’s room to criticize the pace of the program, Sanchez’s statement amounts to a complete misrepresentation of reality. We rate the claim Pants On Fire.

Ted Cruz off on claim that median African-American income rose $5,000 under Reagan
","CORRECTION, Feb. 4, 2016: After we published this fact-check, a reader wrote us to say that in our original article, we had used the wrong Census Bureau data table to analyze Cruz’s statement and rate it Mostly True. However, using the proper data table, Cruz is actually incorrect, so we have changed the rating to Mostly False. The original article is archived here. During a town hall event at New England College in Henniker, N.H., Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz faced a questioner who asked what he would do for ""struggling minorities."" Cruz said the key is economic growth, underpinned by a vigorous free-enterprise system. He suggested that his father -- who worked as a dishwasher shortly after emigrating from Cuba to the United States -- would have lost his job if politicians at the time had raised the minimum wage as high as today’s Democrats would like. Cruz pointed to the Reagan years as a golden age for African-American economic advancement. ""During eight years under Ronald Reagan,"" Cruz said, ""African-American median income rose by about $5,000. That is real and meaningful transformation."" We should note that Cruz was describing the Reagan years as a time of economic growth, not crediting Reagan for a specific policy. So we’ll simply look to see how wages performed. We turned to median income data collected annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. All figures below have been adjusted for inflation.     White Black Hispanic Median income, 1980 $51,127 $29,455  $37,355 Median income, 1988 $55,365 $31,562 $39,164 Gain in dollars $4,238 + $2,107 + $1,809 Gain in percent + 8 percent + 7 percent + 5 percent So Cruz is wrong -- the gain in median income for African-Americans under Reagan was a little over $2,000, not $5,000, and the increase was smaller on both a dollar basis and a percentage basis than the increase for whites. It’s also worth noting that Reagan wasn’t the best president for African-American median income in recent history. That crown goes to Bill Clinton -- unlike Reagan, a Democratic president. Between 1992 and 2000, black incomes rose from $31,018 to $40,783 -- a gain of $9,765 and a striking 31 percent increase. Our ruling Cruz said that ""during eight years under Ronald Reagan, African-American median income rose by about $5,000."" The actual increase was a little over $2,000, and the increase was significantly larger under a subsequent Democratic president, Bill Clinton.

Cruz repeats False attack about immigration bill letting Syrians in U.S. without background checks
","Fresh from his victory in Iowa, Ted Cruz faced his first group of New Hampshire voters at the Crossing Life Church in Windham, N.H. They asked him about many things, from protecting the rights of the disabled to the 2013 immigration bill, once backed by GOP rival Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. An audience member asked Cruz to clarify his immigration position. Cruz has taken heat for introducing an amendment to the bill to provide legal status to undocumented immigrants. Cruz defended that move as parliamentary maneuver to help defeat bad legislation; Rubio said it showed Cruz's actual postion. (S. 744 passed the Senate, with Cruz voting no, but wasn’t taken up in the House.) But in criticizing the original bill, Cruz noted a failing that would have special resonance today. ""The bill expanded President Obama’s ability to bring Syrian refugees to this country without mandating any meaningful background checks,"" Cruz said. We checked a very similar assertion Cruz made in December during a GOP debate in Las Vegas. His case was thin then and remains so today. The Cruz campaign did not respond for a request for comment. In December, Cruz was a bit more absolute. He said the bill gave Obama ""blanket authority"" without ""mandating any background checks whatsoever.""  In Windham, he said it expanded the president’s authority without ""mandating any meaningful"" background checks. The most recent version is more nuanced, but still inaccurate. The heart of the assertion is that the immigration bill would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless. That designation would identify people who had no country to which the United States could send them. If refugees fleeing Syria were called stateless, the argument was that they could be admitted without vetting. David Bier, the director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center, told us in December that the immigration bill specifically stated that all refugees would still be subject to background checks. The average screening time for refugees from across the globe is between a year to a year and a half, involving background checks, interviews and confirmation from several federal agencies. The ""stateless"" classification wouldn’t have been for refugees aiming to get into the United States, said Joanne Kelsey, the assistant director for advocacy at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps resettle refugees. She explained that only people who are already in the country would face this situation. Another part of the bill about specially designating certain groups of refugees, Section 3403, is an attempt to codify something called the Lautenberg Amendment, an immigration provision that has been in effect since 1989 and must be renewed each year. The amendment has traditionally been aimed at certain religious minorities. By law, refugees seeking asylum in the United States must prove they have a ""well founded fear of persecution."" Our expert sources said Section 3403 would have allowed the president to designate a group of interest to the United States as being persecuted as a whole. Think Christians in Syria or Yazidis in Iraq targeted by the Islamic State. Basically, it allows potential refugees to get in line faster. But instead of making individuals prove they are in danger, the threat would already be associated with their group, moving the rest of the screening process along. The bill’s aim was to streamline the vetting process for refugees, not get rid of it. ""It doesn’t create refugees or allow more refugees to come to the United States,"" Bier said. ""They would still be subject to the normal refugee limit. It would create no additional numbers, but would increase, perhaps, the eligible pool of applicants."" The experts we reached all agreed that the immigration bill required background checks for refugees and to the extent that it gave the administration more flexibility, that leeway applied to people already in the country, not those seeking to get in. Our ruling Cruz said the failed immigration bill ""expanded President Obama’s ability to bring Syrian refugees to this country without mandating any meaningful background checks."" The key flaw with that assertion is the bill still required background checks for refugees. While there can be some debate over what constitutes a ""meaningful"" background check, the experts we reached said nothing would have directly changed the quality of the vetting performed on people attempting to enter the country.

GOP attacks Cortez Masto on pay raise issue
","Getting a raise as an elected official has to be a tough balancing act. This is especially the case in Nevada, where the state Constitution historically prohibited salary raises for any legislator or the state’s six executive officers, except through an act of the state Legislature. That meant even reasonable requests to update compensation could fall victim to political gamesmanship. It’s also why, on the same day that former Democratic attorney general and current Nevada Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto addressed a union-backed summit on raising the minimum wage earlier in January, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pounced. The advocacy group unloaded on the candidate for the ""shameless hypocrisy"" in accepting a pay raise in 2011 while other officials refused in order to support state workers with mandated furloughs and frozen pay. Here’s what the NRSC said in full: ""In addition to frozen salaries, workers dealt with furloughs that further cut into their take-home pay. Then-Attorney General Cortez Masto accepted a taxpayer-funded 6 percent pay raise, increasing her salary from $133,000 to $141,086 annually – even as other Nevada elected officials declined the salary hike."" Because these allegations make Cortez Masto look oblivious to state workers who faced years of furloughs and frozen pay, we wanted to take a closer look at the NRSC’s claim. Making sense of the salary formula can be rather complex for each of Nevada’s six independently elected constitutional officers (governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, treasurer and controller). Historically, Nevada’s Constitution required the part-time state Legislature to make any salary adjustment for the state’s six constitutional officers. Although the cost of living has slightly increased since Nevada became a state in 1864, any request to increase salaries often turned political, especially when legislative majorities and constitutional officers belonged to different parties. And so in 2005, lawmakers attempted to avoid that pitfall by including a clause to an otherwise routine salary increase bill for state executive officers that changed the process significantly. Under the new law, state employee pay increases over a four-year period would then be added as an equivalent salary increase for the six executive officers, applying for the next four-year term. This well-intentioned plan proceeded to backfire spectacularly. After state employees received a 2 percent salary increase in 2007 and a 4 percent increase in 2008, the economies of the nation and Nevada tanked. With unemployment rates hitting record highs and state lawmakers approving ""more than $1 billion in cuts to worker salaries and state programs"" to close the state’s gaping budget hole, legislators entered the 2011 session with a problem: an unwanted but legislatively mandated 6 percent pay raise. Lawmakers rejected an attempt to delay the mandatory raise, and because the state Constitution prevents meddling with the salaries of elected officials while in office, the six constitutional officers and the 63 members of the Legislature were essentially forced to take an untimely pay bump while most state employees were forced to take an unpaid furlough. This is where the NRSC allegations come into play. Gov. Brian Sandoval ""rejected"" the pay raise and returned it to the state, while Cortez Masto and then-Controller Kim Wallin (both Democrats) decided to accept the pay increase.  But there is a huge caveat: Cortez Masto, along with the other five constitutional officers, donated a small portion of their salary both before and after 2011 back to the state as a show of support for state employees forced to take unpaid days off. Both Sandoval and Cortez Masto actually gave back money to the state; they just gave it back in different ways. According to information collected from TransparentNevada.com and records request from the state Controller’s office, PolitiFact Nevada put together this spreadsheet of salaries, donations and what percentage of salary was donated back to the state.  As shown, it’s clear that as Attorney General, Cortez Masto didn’t ""pad her pockets"" while state workers suffered -- rather, she received essentially the same salary (not counting benefits) during her eight years in office when donations are subtracted out. And due to quirky provisions in Nevada law, the constitutional officers couldn’t outright reject the pay increase, meaning that the governor and other constitutional officers who ""rejected"" the pay increase had to find creative ways to re-distribute the new income, including cutting weekly checks to nonprofits, that made up the difference. In response to inquiries about the allegations, Nevada Democratic Party communications director Zach Hudson said in a statement that the facts were being distorted. ""The fact is that as Attorney General, when state workers were furloughed, Catherine Cortez Masto stood with them and voluntarily donated tens of thousands of dollars of her salary back to the taxpayers,"" he said in a statement. The NRSC cited two articles backing up their statement, an editorial in the Elko Daily Free Press and a story in the Las Vegas Sun that claimed that Masto and others ""are going to keep the 6 percent pay raise."" That may have been what it seemed like at the time of the reports, but Cortez Masto did give an average of 6.3 percent of her salary back every year, which is comparable to others who ""rejected"" the pay increase. Our ruling The NRSC said Cortez Masto ""was happy to line her own pockets with taxpayer dollars when state employees were slammed with frozen salaries,"" but this is a highly misleading claim. The state increased Cortez Masto’s salary during a time of pay freezes for Nevada’s state workers. She was unable to legally reject the pay increase, so she donated $38,000 back to the state during her last four years in office.

Mixed bag for Bernie Sanders' claim about wages, hours, income growth
","A Bernie Sanders campaign ad, which regularly aired in Iowa and most recently in Nevada, tries to make a point that hard-working people have been falling behind economically. ""If you're doing everything right but find it harder and harder to get by, you're not alone,"" Sanders says. ""While our people work longer hours for lower wages, almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent."" We wanted to check the three claims wrapped up in that last sentence. Are Americans working longer hours, are their wages lower, and is almost all new income going to the richest? Sanders doesn't specify a time frame, which complicates matters somewhat, and his campaign wouldn't give us one, despite repeated inquiries. The background graphic, depicting skyrocketing income among the top 1 percent, comes from a 2013 blog post by Pew Research. The Pew graphic is clearly labeled to note that the data cover 1917 to 2007. That labeling is gone from the Sanders commercial, although both the Pew and Sanders version mark 1980, a reasonable starting point for a dramatic income growth among top earners. We'll start there and consider the three claims individually. Hours The work week has been steadily declining, not increasing, over the past five decades, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1980, the average work week was about 35 hours. It's now below 34 hours. There was, however, a significant decline to 33 hours in June 2009 during the Great Recession. To argue that we're working longer hours, you have to do a bit of cherry-picking and start then, not at 1980, at least according to the BLS.  Workers might get the impression from their own lives that those numbers are too low. In fact, Gallup has consistently found from its surveys that full-time employees work, on average, seven hours longer than their 40-hour work week. Nonetheless, Gallup data from most of this century show no significant change in the work week of full-time employees from 2001 through 2014 and a decline in part-time hours, from 35.4 hours in 2001-02 to 25.9 hours for 2013-14. Neither measure shows hours increased, as Sanders claimed. However, it may be a different story if you look at families instead of individuals. The Sanders campaign referred us to a Washington Post article that references a 2011 Brookings Institution study. When Brookings looked at data through 2009 for the middle 10 percent of families, it concluded that income had increased by 23 percent since 1975. But that's not because wages had increased. It's because family members are working 26 percent more hours. Virtually all of that increase was seen among the mother, part of an effort to maintain the standard of living. ""The numbers suggest that the typical American family is earning more, but almost entirely because parents are working more — not because they are earning more per hour,"" the report says. Which brings us to . . . Wages Are Americans really earning lower wages? We called up quarterly data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, specifically the annual averages for median, usual, weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers. We looked from 1980 through 2015. The numbers are adjusted for inflation in 1982-84 dollars. Over those 35 years, earnings rose from $318 per week to $342 per week, a 7.5 percent increase. If you want to create a decrease, you have to start tracking at 2009 (when weekly earnings hit about $345) or go back to early 1973, when hourly wages reached a peak. Again, timing is everything. As Pew's Drew DeSilver noted in October, ""after adjusting for inflation, today’s average hourly wage has just about the same purchasing power as it did in 1979, following a long slide in the 1980s and early 1990s and bumpy, inconsistent growth since then.""  But it's not the same for all income groups. Since 2000, the people in the lowest-paying jobs — the bottom 25 percent — have seen their weekly wages fall by 3 percent while the people at the top have seen a 9.7 percent rise. The Congressional Budget Office has used a different measurement. A 2014 report looked at data through 2011. It shows that since 1979, average after-tax income rose 40 percent for the poorest fifth and 29 percent for the middle class (those in the 21st to 80th percentile) once inflation was taken into account. (After-tax income takes into account tax policies designed to divert income from the wealthiest Americans.)  So the overall trend is up. To say wages have gone down, you have to be very selective about where you start counting. The recovery brought things back up, but not as much as it did for the rich, which brings us to . . . New income By stopping at 2007 when he shows the rise in income for wealthiest Americans, Sanders misses some significant news. The great recession brought income for the top 1 percent down by more than a third. You can see it in the CBO after-tax data (above). From 1979 to 2007, the top 1 percent saw income grow by more than 275 percent. That growth fell dramatically the following year, and by 2011 it recovered to 175 percent over 1979 levels. There's no universally accepted way to calculate what percent of new income has gone to the top 1 percent. Sanders' claim came from the work of University of California Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez whose analysis concluded that the top 1 percent accumulated 91 percent of all income gains from 2009-12. That's because the ""top 1 percent incomes grew by 34.7 percent while bottom 99 percent incomes grew only by 0.8,"" he said. One complication is that Sanders is looking at pre-tax income minus all government payments — think Social Security, unemployment compensation, welfare, food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit. That's more likely to show that income trends are favoring the rich, said Gary Burtless, an economist at Brookings and a former economist with the U.S. Department of Labor. ""If you omit income items that go disproportionately to the poor and middle class, it is easier to make the case that income trends are favoring the very well off,"" Burtless said in an email. Saez subsequently released updated numbers from 2009 through 2014 showing that the 91 percent estimate had dropped to 58 percent, a ratio Sanders acknowledged during a Senate speech in September. In that most-recent analysis, Saez concluded that over the much broader period of 1993 to 2014, the top 1 percent has captured 55 percent of the real income growth. Our ruling In his ad, Sanders asserts that, ""While our people work longer hours for lower wages, almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent."" The question of hours is a mixed bag. The individual data suggest that people work the same or fewer hours. But family data analyzed by Brookings and only showing a limited slice of the population show that mothers are working longer hours. Wages have, in general, been going up, although barely at all compared to the gains seen among the rich. And while the super-rich may have accumulated 91 percent of the new wealth from 2009 to 2013 according to the economist Sanders has been relying on, the latest analysis shows that the ratio is now 58 percent since 2009, 55 percent since 1993. That's a huge amount of new income for just 1 percent of the population, but it's a stretch to say that it's ""almost all.""

Emily's List attacks Coffman on 'forcible' rape and abortion rights
","Emily's List is stoking the abortion debate in Colorado's 6th Congressional District race with a fundraising email saying Republican incumbent Mike Coffman ""co-sponsored a bill to redefine rape."" Emily's List -- a political organization that supports the election of Democratic women who support abortion rights -- has endorsed Coffman's opponent, state Sen. Morgan Carroll, an Aurora Democrat. Its mailer focused on reproductive rights, abortion and Roe v. Wade.  In the email, titled ""2016 goal: A Congress that fights for women and families,"" Emily's List said, ""We wish Congress was less like this"" -- citing Mike Coffman's co-sponsorship of the 2011 bill -- ""and more like this … Morgan Carroll sponsored a bill to make emergency contraception available to sexual assault survivors."" We wanted to check the accuracy of Emily's List's characterization of Coffman's role in the legislation. Coffman did co-sponsor the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act, which attempted to redefine a ban on federal funding for abortions to exempt ""forcible rape"" -- and not rape in broader terms. Critics said the ""forcible rape"" language could rule out other forms of sexual assault that are considered rape, including statutory rape, attacks where women are drugged or threatened, and date rapes. Facing a backlash from women's groups, Republicans amended the bill in committee to remove the word ""forcible"" and make the exemption for ""rape."" Coffman wasn't on this committee and didn't vote on the removal.  ""The bill was amended in committee, and Congressman Coffman supported the amended bill on the floor,"" a Coffman campaign spokesman later said. Congressional records show that Coffman voted for the amended bill in a floor vote, which passed the House but not the Senate. In recent years, Coffman has tempered his position on abortion in one of the country's most competitive ""swing"" districts, which is nearly evenly divided among Democrats, Republicans and independents. In 2012, he said, ""I am against all abortions, except when it is necessary to protect the life of the mother."" But a year later, Coffman said that while he supported a House bill to limit late-term abortions, ""I strongly support the exceptions for rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother that have been included in this legislation."" Coffman's Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, had blunt criticism of his co-sponsoring the 2011 bill's original ""forcible rape"" language. ""Rape is about the lack of consent -- not the degree of force -- and this definition takes us backwards,"" Carroll told Denver7. ""I unequivocally support a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body, including her health care,"" she said.   Coffman's spokeswoman complained that political opponents have repeatedly raised the 2011 bill and ""will twist the facts any way they can in an attempt to mischaracterize and demonize Rep. Coffman."" Our ruling Emily’s List said that Coffman ""co-sponsored a bill to redefine rape."" The record shows Coffman did co-sponsor the bill to redefine a ban on federal funding for abortions to exempt ""forcible rape."" Yet he later voted on the floor for an amended version that had removed the ""forcible"" modifier from the bill. Given the totality of his actions on the legislation, we're rating this claim Mostly True.

Does John Kasich have 'worst rating on spending of any governor in the country'?
","The super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to counter a perceived challenge for moderate New Hampshire voters from Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The PAC, Right to Rise, is airing an ad in New Hampshire that declares Kasich ""wrong on New Hampshire issues."" It’s run at least 284 times on Boston television since Jan. 21, according to the Internet Archive’s Political Ad Tracker. The 30-second ad makes a number of claims, but we decided to focus on one surrounding spending. The ad claims Kasich had ""the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat."" That’s a potentially devastating claim, especially since Kasich is selling the economic turnaround in Ohio as part of his presidential resume. It in large part hinges on Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid in the state as part of President Barack Obama’s health care law. Where the claim comes from Right to Rise isn’t pulling its claim out of the air. The super PAC is accurately citing a report by the libertarian Cato Institute. Cato’s report, entitled Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors 2014, attempts to compare 48 of the nation’s governors on a number of fiscal measures. (Virginia and Alaska were excluded.) Overall, Kasich earned a score of 44, which Cato translated to a D. Only 12 Democrats, and no Republicans, scored lower. But Right to Rise is focusing on one subcategory of the overall scorecard, which measures spending changes. On that score, Kasich indeed finished dead last -- with a total of six. Cato found that Ohio proposed 5.7 percent growth in per capita spending and ended up with 8 percent growth in actual per capita spending. In its report, Cato makes clear that the spending measures we just cited -- proposed per capita spending and actual per capita spending -- are only for general fund budgets, which Cato describes as ""the budgets that governors have the most control over."" Proposed per capita spending is measured through fiscal year 2015, and actual per capita spending is measured through fiscal 2014. As wonky as that previous paragraph sounds, that makes all the difference in assessing the validity of Cato’s report, Kasich’s rebuttal, and ultimately Right to Rise’s claim. A quick primer on state budgets If you’ve followed any state budgeting process, you’ll quickly realize that there are different ways to describe what you call ""the budget."" Cato is honing in on the general fund budget, which is usually the part of the budget that lawmakers and governors have the most power to influence. Generally speaking, this is the money that lawmakers might fight over when it comes to spending on pet projects, or subsidies for sports stadiums, or economic development incentives. Again, generally speaking, general fund spending is the most unencumbered. But there are lots of other pots of money that ultimately make up a state budget. Road tolls might go into a trust fund where they must be re-invested in road-building projects. A state lottery system might guarantee all its proceeds to education funding. Fees for developers might be dedicated to infrastructure improvements. The federal government might pass millions of dollars to a state for a specific project or need (roads, health care, school lunches). That’s all money that the state spends, but lawmakers have fewer levers to pull to try and manage it. Kasich’s rebuttal Kasich’s campaign offers two rebuttals to the Right to Rise/Cato charge. The first deals with how you define the budget. If you expand the budget to include all funds, the spending increases Cato references at 5.7 percent and 8 percent shrink to about 2 percent. The second rebuttal involves an accounting change that the Kasich campaign says inflates Cato’s numbers in the first place. Kasich officials say Ohio transitioned about $2 billion in spending into the general fund from the overall ""all funds"" budget. Analyzing only the general fund budget ""makes this accounting correction erroneously appear to be an increase, when an analysis of all state spending would reveal that total spending didn’t go up as a result of this, and that this move was merely a movement of funds between internal accounting lines,"" the Kasich campaign told PolitiFact. State officials told the Columbus Dispatch that the accounting shift came when the state moved a large chunk of Medicaid spending from the all-funds budget to the general revenue fund. The money, tied to Medicaid expansion as part of President Barack Obama’s health care law, originally was placed in the ""all-funds"" budget but was moved to the general revenue budget. ""That substantially explains …  why the (general revenue fund) grew,"" Timothy S. Keen, Ohio’s director of the state office of budget and management, told the Dispatch. ""It’s not new spending. It’s an accounting change."" Cato’s rebuttal to Kasich’s rebuttal This issue, now appearing in the campaign ad, boiled over in August when Kasich was asked about it on Fox News Sunday. CHRIS WALLACE: ""Unemployment down from 9.1 percent to 5.2 percent. And the top income tax rate has been lowered from 6.2 percent to 4.9 percent. ""But the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, gave you a ‘D’ on its government’s (sic) report card just last year, noting the budget grew 13.6 percent in 2014 and that over your time as governor, government jobs have increased 3 percent. A ‘D,’ sir?"" KASICH: ""Well, I don’t know who these folks are, Chris, another Washington group. But, look, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years and in addition to that, our budget overall is growing by about 2 percent or 3 percent, and our Medicaid growth has gone from 9 percent when I came in to less than 4 percent and no one has been left behind. We haven’t had to cut benefits or throw anybody off the rolls. So, we pay attention to the mentally ill and the drug addicted and the working poor."" Kasich’s criticism prompted a response from Cato. Cato looked at the budget in a few new and different ways, including by removing any federal Medicaid contribution from the general revenue budget. That calculation found that Ohio general fund spending increased 3 percent to 5 percent annually from 2013-16. ""By using the all-funds number, Kasich is trying to use federal spending to mask the quick increase in general fund spending,"" wrote Cato economist Nicole Kaeding. (Kaeding has since moved on to the pro-business Tax Foundation.) ""Federal spending — besides Medicaid — is not increasing in Ohio that quickly. Kasich has little control over federal spending, but he is using it to hide how much Ohio’s state spending has grown during his tenure."" We asked Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at Cato, what he makes of the Right to Rise attack and Kasich’s rebuttals. Edwards agrees that a large part of the spending increase is tied to Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid. ""I understand Kasich says we unfairly used that in our study,"" Edwards said. ""But it’s spending, and he did it."" Our ruling In an ad targeted at New Hampshire voters, a super PAC supporting Bush said Kasich had ""the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat."" Right to Rise is accurately citing a portion of a study by the Cato Institute that looked at one measure of spending for 48 of America’s governors in 2014. But Kasich disputes the study itself, and correctly notes that there are other ways to measure state spending, and that a shifting of dollars from one part of the budget to another affected the results. What to make of it all? This reminds us of some previous attempts to look at the spending records of governors running for president. And like in those cases, the result here might be a tad unsatisfying for people seeking clarity. Cato, in our judgment, did nothing to unfairly target Kasich. Yet, there is more to Ohio’s particular budget story that may leave viewers with a different impression.

Is this truly a picture of 'Milwaukee's Renaissance' under Mayor Tom Barrett?
","In his campaign for mayor of Milwaukee, Ald. Bob Donovan has criticized the record of Mayor Tom Barrett on crime, the incumbent’s support for a downtown streetcar and the conditions of the city’s neighborhoods. On Jan. 29, 2016, about two weeks ahead of the primary election, Donovan posted on his campaign Facebook page an attack that included a photograph of a dilapidated home. The home was pocked by broken or boarded-up windows, torn-off siding and holes in exterior walls. ""This is the true picture of ‘Milwaukee's Renaissance’ after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership,"" Donovan’s post began. The post had been shared more than 80 times over the next three days. But it didn’t take that long for a Facebook reader to question how true of a picture it was. Several hours after Donovan’s posting, someone identified on Facebook as Gilberto Gonzales Jr. posted a reply, saying: ""This structure was used by the Milwaukee Fire Department for a training fire. It is scheduled for demolition. Prior to that fire it did not look like that. This photo by itself is deceiving."" Gonzalez, it turns out, is someone who would know -- a lieutenant in the Milwaukee Fire Department who was the lead instructor of its training division until 2015.  Donovan responded on Facebook that evening, saying: ""Perhaps that's the case, Gilberto. But if you're familiar with the corner, you know too that there's about five additional boarded-up homes in eyesight, a fact that is not deceiving. By the way, I was not familiar with the history of the building, but quite frankly I have seen similar dilapidated residences in my travel throughout the city."" The Fire Department confirmed to us that the house, at 3068 N. 20th St., was used for training -- including with live fires in October 2015, which explains the large holes in the structure. The department chose it for training after it was put on the city’s demolition list. Eventually it will be demolished. Donovan told us he didn’t realize the house is in such a condition because of the training. But he contended that didn’t detract from his overall point about deteriorating neighborhoods, saying ""I’m certain we’d have no problem locating another home that looks like that"" in Milwaukee’s inner city. But whether other homes look something like that one doesn’t bear on whether Donovan’s Facebook statement is accurate.

Flat-out wrong: Rapper B.o.B. duels with Neil deGrasse Tyson over whether Earth is round
","It’s a rap battle straight out of the 15th century. On one side of the ring is rapper B.o.B., the hip-hop star behind hits like ""Airplanes."" On the other side is astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, known more for his truth-telling about the universe and climate change than spitting rhymes. Their beef: B.o.B. says the earth is flat. Yes, really. It all started going down Jan. 24 when B.o.B. tweeted a picture of himself at a high elevation, with two distant cities — but no discernable curve — on the horizon.  He then tweeted a series of images intended to raise questions about the fact that the Earth is round. ""I'm going up against the greatest liars in history,"" he wrote. ""You've been tremendously deceived."" Step in, Tyson. The popular astrophysicist published a brief series of tweets to counter B.o.B., including the fact that the Earth’s curve does shield part of the Manhattan skyline from a distance, but the buildings are too tall to be fully obscured. Tyson ended with: ""Duude — to be clear: Being five centuries regressed in your reasoning doesn’t mean we all can’t still like your music."" The debate escalated when both B.o.B. and Tyson dropped rap tracks, Tyson’s rapped by his nephew, calling each other out (sample lyric: ""I'm bringing facts to combat a silly theory because B.o.B has gotta know the planet is a sphere, G""). We won’t attempt to rap; we’d only embarrass ourselves. But we did ask a few astronomers what they would tell B.o.B. to convince him the Earth is round. To be clear, this is a settled question. Since at least the ancient Greeks, people have had a hunch that the Earth is round, and it has been accepted as a universal truth for the past few centuries. Cornell University astronomy professor Lisa Kaltenegger pointed out the obvious: Pictures and videos taken from space clearly show the Earth is spherical. For example, NASA scientist Reid Wiseman took this timelapse from the International Space Station.  She said there’s an experiment B.o.B. and others could do. He could fly from the East Coast to Australia, going over Europe and Asia. Then he could fly back going over the Pacific Ocean and landing on the West Coast. If the Earth was flat, you would not be able to take both routes to and from a single destination. It’s a modern-day version of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan’s 16th century voyage, the very first circumnavigation of the globe. We also know the Earth is round because of the curved shape of the Earth’s shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse, said Raymond Jeanloz, an astronomy professor at the University of California Berkeley. Further, the planet reacts to earthquakes in a very different way than it would if the Earth were a flat plane, Jeanloz said. Then there’s time zones, the fact that the sun appears at different angles at the same time in different locations. And, while you have to be fairly high up with clear skies to see the Earth’s curve, you can observe the effects of curvature from the Earth’s surface by watching a large ship go over the horizon, disappearing from the bottom up. Could there be a global conspiracy to hide the fact that the Earth is flat? No way, said David Trilling, an astronomy professor at Northern Arizona University. Millions of people and many countries, as well as numerous private corporations, would all have to be in on it, and they would somehow have to keep all the evidence concealed in the age of Buzzfeed and Wikileaks, he said. ""There is no chance that a secret that big could be concealed,"" he said. Rather, ""the evidence for a round Earth is abundant and all around us."" Our ruling Rapper B.o.B. said, ""You've been tremendously deceived"" by people who say the Earth is not flat. The world’s scientists have gathered proof that the Earth is round for centuries. Now that we’re in an age where we can view the Earth from space, we can say with certainty that our planet is spherical. Even without a spaceship, we can see the effects of a round Earth by watching a ship on the horizon or looking out of an airplane window on a clear day. B.o.B.’s claim is Pants on Fire!

Hillary Clinton compares Benghazi to 1983 attack on Marines in Beirut
","Republican attacks on Benghazi are totally overblown, Hillary Clinton says. The Democrats didn’t act this way when something similar happened under President Ronald Reagan. At a CNN town hall for Democratic presidential candidates, an audience member asked how the former secretary of state will work with Congress in responding to the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in the Libyan city. Clinton said the Republican-led inquiries continue to exist only for a partisan purpose. ""When Ronald Reagan was president in 1983, our Marine barracks, our embassy were attacked in Beirut,"" she said at the Jan. 25 event in Iowa. ""More than 250 Americans were killed. The Democrats didn’t make that a partisan issue. So, the Democratic Congress worked with the Republican president to say what can we do? How do we fix this?"" The April and October 1983 attacks happened when Democrats held the House, and Reagan’s reelection was around the corner. We wondered if the Lebanon bombings really did rise above partisan politics. We consulted experts and read numerous media accounts from the time and found that Clinton has a point that Congress’ reaction to Beirut was more muted than its reaction to Benghazi. Still, criticizing Reagan over Beirut was a big talking point for some Democrats. Muffled congressional reaction Reagan sent 800 Marines to Lebanon on a peacekeeping mission in 1982, partly in the interest in stymying Soviet Union influence. They found themselves in the middle of a civil war. In April 1983, Hezbollah terrorists killed 17 Americans in a suicide bombing at the embassy in Beirut. Six months later, a truck carrying another Hezbollah suicide bomber drove onto Marine barracks in the same city, detonating thousands of pounds of explosives and killing 241 American service personnel. Reagan pulled the Marines out in February 1984. Like the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans, questions quickly arose about inadequate security at the Beirut Marine compound. The truck carrying the suicide bomber broke through several barriers before crashing into the building where the Marines slept. Also like Benghazi, the two Beirut attacks happened when opposing parties held the White House and the House of Representatives. In 1983, Republicans held the White House, and Democrats held the House, vice versa in 2012. Here’s where the similarities in congressional reaction unravel. Unlike Benghazi, the 1983 Democratic House only launched one investigation into the Beirut attack, lasting a few months. Compare that to at least six Republican House Benghazi inquiries, one of which is still going on more than three years since the attack. Further, representatives from both parties largely agreed on the Beirut report’s findings, while Democrats for the most part oppose the Benghazi investigations. Democrats’ response to Beirut was more about preventing a future attack and less about playing politics, said Lawrence Korb, senior fellow at the progressive Center for American Progress and assistant secretary of defense under Reagan from 1981-85. He added that the Beirut attacks (and other significant foreign policy events under Reagan) pushed Democrats and Republicans to work together to pass a significant bill that rearranged how different branches of the military worked together.   ""It wasn’t partisan, people just wanted to know what happened,"" Korb said. ""No one was saying ‘fire general so-and-so’ or anything like that."" Within 48 hours of the Beirut bombings, the United States invaded the Caribbean island nation of Grenada, which might have played a role in muffling Congress’ reaction to the Beirut bombings, said Stephen Knott, national security professor at the U.S. Naval War College and former director of the Ronald Reagan Oral History Project at the University of Virginia. Knott said the reaction to Grenada was partisan, noting that several House Democrats moved to impeach Reagan. And many Democrats still think the invasion was an attempt to redirect attention away from Beirut, an allegation Knott said is incorrect. ""The reaction to (Grenada) allowed critics to pounce on Reagan's policies without seeming to appear to capitalize on the deaths of American Marines,"" Knott said. ""The Reagan years were hardly an idyllic era of foreign policy bipartisanship."" Rhetorical backlash Even if formal congressional reaction to the Beirut bombings was limited, the attacks played a big role in political rhetoric over the next year. The day after the 1983 bombings, the New York Times ran a story about how Democrats were preparing to campaign on the Lebanon attacks during the upcoming presidential primary. Eventual 1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale, who served as Jimmy Carter’s vice president, called out Reagan personally for slacking on Lebanon. ''During all this time, the president is on vacation in California,""' Mondale said in February 1984. ''If the nation is in trouble, the president of the United States should be at the helm. I recommend today Mr. Reagan get on that plane to come back to Washington and answer our questions.'' Mondale also said, following another attack on the U.S. embassy in Beirut in 1984, that through lax security, Reagan had allowed Lebanese terrorists to ''humiliate us and push us around and kill our people.'' On the congressional side, House Speaker Tip O’Neill, D-Mass., called the the Reagan administration’s foreign policy ""frightening"" — despite generally supporting Reagan’s efforts abroad previously. The following April, Reagan said Congressional criticism of his administration’s efforts in Lebanon and calls for troop removal had opened the gates to terrorists, according to the New York Times. ''The deaths of the U.S. Marines are the responsibility of the President of the United States,'' O’Neill responded. ''He acted against the wishes of our top military in this country, and now he is looking for a scapegoat.'' To sum it up: Beirut wasn’t immune to politics. It’s impossible to know for sure whether rhetoric signifies partisan attacks or simply true policy opinion differences, Matthew Beckmann, a political science professor at the University of California Irvine who has studied Reagan’s relationship with Congress. He noted, though, that research shows partisan disagreement has become more reflexive and entrenched since the 1980s. ""So officials' reactions and reporters' coverage of Beirut vis-a-vis Benghazi are surely different, quantitatively and qualitatively, but that says more about systemic changes in Washington politics than changes in leaders' personal virtue,"" he said. Our ruling Clinton said that when terrorists killed more than 250 Americans in Lebanon under Ronald Reagan, ""the Democrats didn’t make that a partisan issue."" Clinton has a strong point that the Democrat-held House did not react as forcefully to the 1983 Beirut bombings as the Republican-held House reacted to the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four. The House conducted a single investigation into the Beirut bombings, which killed more than 250 Americans, while it has conducted six inquiries into Benghazi, which killed four. But it’s not totally accurate to say the Democrats didn’t make it a partisan issue. Mondale, running against Reagan in 1984, and some congressional Democrats repeatedly said Reagan had failed personally regarding Lebanon.

Gillespie says more businesses are closing than opening in Virginia
","No doubt, Republican Ed Gillespie’s campaign for governor next year will focus on Virginia’s economy. Here’s how he started a Facebook post on Jan. 13, less than two hours before Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, began his State of the Commonwealth address to the General Assembly: ""Governor McAuliffe is absolutely right to celebrate every groundbreaking for a new business in the Commonwealth and to tout every job created here. We all join him in that. Unfortunately, those groundbreakings aren’t enough to offset the closures, as more businesses are closing than are opening in Virginia today."" We wondered if he’s right that the number of businesses in Virginia is currently declining. Chris Leavitt, Gillespie’s campaign manager, said his boss’s claim was based on an economic study released in November by the Strome College of Business at Old Dominion University. It’s called the ""2015 State of the Commonwealth Report"" and is sponsored by a foundation of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce.   Leavitt, in an email, highlighted a sentence on page 130 of the study that says, ""Further, since 2008, more firms have been dying than have been created, both nationally and regionally."" The research was overseen by James V. Koch, an economist and former president of ODU. He told us the data on the decline of firms came from the Small Business Administration and that they end at 2011.   Although the report did not specifically say Virginia is now experiencing more business deaths than births, Koch told us in an initial email that that Gillespie’s statement is ""true"" under the lens of the latest 2011 statistics. ""We’ll need to see if things change after 2011,"" he wrote. The economy has seen slow improvement since 2011 as the U.S. moves further away from the Great Recession. We wondered whether fresher figures on business openings and closings were available. A spokesman for the SBA told us its data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau. He pointed us to a census site that has figures through 2013 and shows different trend lines for business births and deaths than those offered by Gillespie and the ODU report. The data counts the annual population of ""establishments"" -- defined as a single place open for business with any number of employees. The census figures show there were 156,056 Virginia establishments in 2000 and that steadily grew each year to a high of 180,508 in 2007. Then the number dropped in each of the following four years as the state moved towards and weathered the recession, falling to 173,732 establishments in 2011. So if we cut off the data at 2011, the trendline ends with a four-year steady decline. But the line begins to rise when we go beyond that point. There were 175,013 Virginia business establishments in 2012 and 176,228 in 2013, the latest year such census data is available. Koch, in a second interview, told us he wasn’t surprised by the upswing, saying of the 2011 numbers, ""an awful lot of what we had been seeing was recession related."" He also said that the impact of federal spending cuts, while significant in Virginia, has not been as dire as expected in 2011. The pattern in Virginia closely traces the national trend, which also shows the number  of establishments steadily increasing from 2000 to 2007, decreasing annually from 2008 to 2011 and then gaining ground the next two years. The latest figures show that in 2013, the number of business establishments in Virginia and the U.S. had still not regained their pre-recession peaks.. Virginia was 2.4 percent below that high mark, the U.S. was 2.7 percent below. Our ruling   Gillespie says ""more businesses are opening than closing in Virginia today."" A campaign spokesman says Gillespie based his statement on an ODU report, published last November, that contained data through 2011. The report said that ""since 2008, more firms have been dying than have been created, both nationally and regionally."" Census data from 2011 does show a steady four-year decline in the number of Virginia business establishments. But these statistics are stale. The latest figures show the number of businesses began to slowly increase again in 2012 and 2013 -- although they still had not recovered to their pre-recession levels. The bottom line: There’s no evidence that business deaths are exceeding births today. The most current statistics point otherwise, although they hardly suggest a baby boom.

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee says maternal mortality rate for U.S. women shot up 136 percent
","Shortly before the December holidays, Sheila Jackson Lee, a 10-term U.S. House member, inserted remarks into the Congressional Record in regard to women’s legal and human rights. The Houston Democrat, sharing initial findings from the U.S. visit of a United Nations Working Group that focuses on discrimination against women, touched on the nation’s gender wage gap, the increasing percentage of women in poverty and disparities in access to reproductive health. A figure that got our attention had to do with the maternal mortality rate. ""Between 1990 and 2013,"" Jackson Lee said, ""the maternal mortality rate for women in the U.S. has increased by 136 percent."" Were women in this country dying at a significantly higher rate from pregnancy-related causes compared with almost a quarter century ago? We had to find out. We checked with Jackson Lee’s office to find the source of the 136 percent claim, and staffers sent back a Euro News article from Dec. 14, 2015. The article also referenced the U.N. working group’s U.S. visit, and attributed the 136 percent increase to U.N. rights workers. Similarly, several media outlets have used the 136 percent figure often. We also found the figure in a 2014 report compiled by the World Health Organization, UNICEF,  UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division titled ""Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2013."" It showed that yes, from 1990 to 2013, there was a 136 percent increase in the maternal mortality rate in the United States. Before we get into the figures, some definitions. The maternal mortality rate is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, regardless of duration and site of pregnancy, but not including accidental or incidental causes. A WHO fact sheet attributes 75 percent of maternal deaths to these complications: Severe bleeding (mostly bleeding after childbirth) Infections (usually after childbirth) High blood pressure during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia) Complications from delivery Unsafe abortion According to the WHO, 99 percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries. Nicholas Kassebaum, professor at Seattle Children’s Hospital and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, also analyzed the maternal mortality rate for an article in the medical journal The Lancet. His team put the rate increase between 1990 and 2013 at closer to 49 percent. Kassebaum suggested the difference in percentages could be attributed to model predictions the World Health Organization used. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation used a larger volume of data than the WHO/UN report, Kassebaum said, which showed the rate peak in 2009, and subsequently go down slightly the following years, settling at 18.5 deaths in 2013, or close to a 49 percent increase. The original WHO report used 5-year projections that predicted an increase every year. Experts such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Bill Callaghan warn against indiscriminately using the 136 percent figure. To make his point, the 2015 report (the following year) from WHO, UNICEF, et. al. showed only a 16.7 percent increase in maternal mortality rate for the United States. In an email, Sebastian Oliel, a spokesman for the Panamerican Health Organization, attributed the new figures to a change in methodology intended to allow a better comparison of mortality rates from different countries. Instead of relying on vital statistics (information gleaned from death certificates), which Callaghan said are not the most accurate, the WHO/UN began using CDC data for the United States in reports after 2014. Also, the current methodology uses estimates on an annual basis, instead of the previous method that estimated figures every five years, based on vital statistics. While the new rate looks like it’s telling a less drastic story, Callaghan said there still is a legitimate cause for concern. ""The maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is unacceptably high,"" said Callaghan, chief of the CDC’s Maternal and Infant Health branch. ""I’ve borne witness to women dying in pregnancy, it’s an awful thing. Whether it’s 18 out of 100,000 or 12 out of 100,000, it’s too high. Whether we’re first in the world or 89th in the world, it’s too high."" He said that in the 1980s and ‘90s, health experts knew maternal deaths were underreported. Vital records, such as death certificates, were the main source of information and there was no way to ensure accurate reporting of deaths due to pregnancy-related issues. ""The system was not nuanced. When women die in pregnancy, it’s not like counting people who died from colon cancer. Women who die in a particular state from a multitude of causes, it’s hard to account for it."" The CDC began the pregnancy mortality surveillance system in 1986. Callaghan says reporting has ""incrementally gotten better,"" but the process remains imperfect since states do not report every death identically. The 2014 WHO report (where the 136 percent increase originated), used older methods of modeling based purely on vital statistics, ""which we know are problematic,"" he explained in an email. The more recent estimates in the 2015 report (source of the 16.7 percent increase) are based on CDC pregnancy mortality surveillance system data. While better reporting could account for more maternal deaths, Callaghan said he believes there is a definite increase beyond that. It could be attributed to a multitude of causes, including changing demographics of women giving birth (people giving birth at older ages) and worsening health outcomes (higher rates of obesity, heart disease) in the general population. But, there has been a proportionate decrease in common causes of maternal deaths, such as hemorrhages and blood clots in the United States, he said. One ratio that has been consistent since the CDC began collecting this data has to do with health disparities between white and black women. Black women face a three- to four-times greater risk of dying from complications of pregnancy. Callaghan explained that black women aren’t dying from different causes, but they are more likely to die from complications. That could be a reflection of differences in care, or being more susceptible to certain diseases, or a ""complex combination of both,"" he said. To find a solution, there has been an increasing focus on patient safety, establishing national guidelines and rooting out possible variations in care, facility to facility. By having protocol at all facilities to handle the ""low-hanging fruit"" of hemorrhages, blood clots and women with severe hypertension, the rate in the United States could improve for all women. Our ruling Sheila Jackson Lee said the maternal mortality rate in the United States increased 136 percent between 1990 and 2013. A 2014 report compiled by the World Health Organization, UNICEF and The World Bank presented just that figure. However, experts agree it is inaccurate and based on a modeling method WHO no longer uses. While there has been an increase in U.S. maternal mortality in that time -- possibly due, in part, to better reporting and worsening health conditions in the general population -- experts said it was not as drastic.

","State Sen. Tom Garrett, R-Buckingham, recently explained why he was the lone Virginia senator to vote against the state budget last year. ""Last year, we were the only ‘no’ vote because (Gov.) McAuliffe and leadership on both sides were telling us that we couldn’t fund our core essential functions of government -- public transportation, public education, public safety,"" Garrett said in a Jan. 11 interview on ""The John Fredericks Show,"" a Portsmouth-based radio program. ""There are teachers that are underpaid. A trooper with 10 years on the force is getting $500 a year more than a trooper with 10 minutes on the force, and yet they somehow found money to waste on tents for our state parks."" What grabbed our attention here is that a veteran state trooper with a decade of service gets a mere $500 more than a newly badged trooper. We asked Garrett -- who is seeking the seat of retiring U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt, R-5th --  where he got his the information. Kevin Reynolds Jr., the senator’s chief of staff, told us the source is Wayne Huggins, executive director of the Virginia State Police Association, a professional organization that represents troopers. Huggins told us that the relatively flat pay scale of troopers is a ""seriously demoralizing"" problem that has caused many to leave the state police for better-paying jobs with local law enforcement departments. But he denied telling Garrett that the pay differential between rookies and 10-year veterans was $500. So we decided to figure out exactly what, if any difference, exists. Starting pay Troopers in most parts of the state get a starting salary of $36,207, although troopers patrolling Northern Virginia start at $45,241 due to the high cost of living there, according to figures provided by Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman with the Virginia State Police. But a trooper’s pay doesn’t freeze at that $36,207 level for a decade. As an advertisement on the State Police website notes, a year after graduating from the State Police Training Academy the salary rises to $40,482 annually. So a trooper with 10 years on the force would make almost 12 percent more than a rookie. Huggins said there are two tracks for troopers. One is that they can rise through the ranks and become a supervisor, earning extra salary. The other is to remain a trooper and, with seniority and good performance, try to rise to the ranks of ""senior trooper"" and ""master troopers."" These designations also come with a raises, but are only available to those who have been on the force for at least 12 years. Pay compression package Another thing Garrett’s statement misses is that the General Assembly last year took the first step in years to address the pay compression issue for state police. The 2014-2016 budget Garrett opposed contained a $228 salary hike for every year of continuous service as a trooper -- a payment that is only available to those who served at least three years and met performance criteria. That means the 10-year veteran’s salary would be $2,280 more than the 10-minute trooper who didn’t qualify for it. And let’s not forget the 12 percent raise after the rookie year -- worth another $4,175 annually. Our ruling Garrett said ""trooper with 10 years on the force is getting $500 a year more than a trooper with 10 minutes on the force."" In reality, the veteran trooper got a 12 percent raise after a year on the force. And last year’s budget provides a trooper with a decade on the force an added annual salary increase of $2,280. Altogether, that means a well-performing trooper who has been on the force a decade would earn $6,555 more than a rookie.   We’re not weighing in on whether the state adequately pays its veteran troopers. But Garrett is using an inaccurate number to make the point that Virginia falls short.

Ted Cruz's false claim that Trump, Clinton and Sanders 'have the identical position on health care'
","One day before the Iowa caucus, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas slammed Republican rival Donald Trump on NBC’s Meet the Press by lumping him in with the Democrats. ""Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have the identical position on health care,"" Cruz said on Jan. 31. ""Which is they want to put the government in charge of you and your doctor."" Trump, who’s leading Cruz by almost six points in Iowa, called Cruz a liar on ABC’s This Week. But is Cruz right that the Republican front runner has the health care plan as the two leading Democrats? Not exactly. Trump, Clinton and Sanders all seem to support one particular health care policy: allowing the government to negotiate drug prices. Beyond that specific proposal, however, the three candidates’ overarching positions on health care are not at all ""identical"" and, one could argue, actually contradictory. Let’s examine each candidate’s health care plan, starting with Sanders'. Sanders’ single-payer system One of the central platforms of Sanders’ agenda is his proposal for universal health care under a single-payer system. Sanders seeks to expand Medicare — the health safety net that covers those over 65 — to all Americans. The plan, which is described in detail on Sanders’ website, ""will cover the entire continuum of health care.""   ""As a patient, all you need to do is go to the doctor and show your insurance card,"" the proposal reads. ""Bernie’s plan means no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges."" To pay for the $1.38 trillion plan, Sanders is proposing a 6.2 percent payroll tax, a 2.2 percent income-based premium tax and a slew of taxes for higher income households. Sanders argues that a single-payer system would give the government leverage to trim administrative costs and drug prices. But it’s not clear those significant tax increases and cost reductions would cover the costs of his plan. Clinton to defend Obamacare Clinton, who says single-payer ""will never, ever come to pass,"" proposes instead to hold up and build upon the Affordable Care Act. According to her website, Clinton will defend President Barack Obama’s 2010 landmark health care law, also called Obamacare, from efforts to repeal it. She also wants to expand health care access for rural Americans and work to lower the costs of deductibles, copays and prescription drugs. Specifically, she proposes: • Exempting three doctor's visits per year from deductibles; • Providing a refundable tax credit (up to $2,500 for individuals, $5,000 for families) for Americans whose out-of-pocket health care expenses are more than 5 percent of their income; • Blocking or modifying unreasonable insurance rate hikes. Trump’s ambiguous plan Trump, who once voiced admiration for single-payer, has yet to release a health care plan or propose anything beyond vague suggestions. But Trump consistently has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act — a position contradicting Clinton’s vow. Obamacare would be replaced with ""something terrific"" that ""takes care of everybody,"" Trump promises but swears now that it wouldn’t be a single-payer system — a position antithetical to Sanders’ plan.   What that ""something terrific"" would actually look like is unclear. His comments over the past few months suggests he’s been adding to a grab bag of sometimes contradictory ideas. Trump has suggested a health care system in which insurance companies deemed financially stable can offer plans across state lines. He’s also advocated for the government to negotiate with hospitals and drug companies for lower prices and to provide coverage for lower income Americans. Here are some examples of what he’s proposed: • Jan. 31, 2016, This Week: ""We're going to work with our hospitals. We're going to work with our doctors. We've got to do something. …But that's not single payer and as far as Obamacare is concerned, one of the staples of my speech — and you can ask any of my many supporters — is repeal and replace Obamacare. It's a disaster. • Jan. 25, 2016, Farmington, N.H., rally: ""Drugs, with Medicare — they don’t bid them out, they don’t bid them out. They pay like this wholesale incredible number. They say like $300 billion could be saved if we bid them out. We don’t do it. Why? Because of the drug companies, folks."" • Oct. 25, 2015, This Week: ""I'm okay with the (health) savings accounts. I think it's a good idea; it's a very down-the-middle idea. It works. It's something that's proven. The one thing we have to do is repeal and replace Obamacare. It is a disaster."" • Oct. 14, 2015, WHO Radio: ""If we get rid of the artificial lines drawn around each state and companies from Iowa can bid in New York … you’ll get these great plans. And the only thing the government should be involved in is they have to be really solvent companies in case there’s a catastrophic event or whatever. As far as the other group, as far as what we can do, I don’t want to see people doing in the streets."" • Sept. 27, 2015, 60 Minutes: ""Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced. ...I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now. ...The government's going to pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most part, it's going to be a private plan, and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition, with lots of competitors, with great companies, and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have the identical position on health care, which is they want to put the government in charge of you and your doctor."" While Trump, Clinton and Sanders have all proposed to reduce prescription drug prices, that one policy is a far cry from having ""the identical position on health care."" Cruz’s description of that position (putting the government in charge of you and your doctor) can only reasonably be applied to Sanders’ single-payer system. Clinton has proposed specific ways to defend and expand Obama’s health care law. Trump, whose exact plan is unclear, has said repeatedly that he’d repeal and replace Obamacare with a market-based alternative. To suggest that Trump, Clinton and Sanders have the same health care proposal is inaccurate. There are many specific differences between the three plans.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio incorrectly says illegal immigrant population is higher than 5 years ago
","Throughout his Republican presidential campaign, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has tried to distance himself from his involvement in a 2013 failed bipartisan immigration bill. The legislation has proven to be a liability for Rubio because it contained a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and some of Rubio’s opponents say his support for the bill is evidence that he’s not tough on immigration. On NBC’s Meet the Press Jan. 31, host Chuck Todd asked Rubio if he regretted being part of the Gang of Eight senators who authored the bill. ""Look, I tried to fix the problem,"" Rubio said, referring to illegal immigration. ""This is a real problem. And where are we today? We are worse off today than we were five years ago. We have more illegal immigrants here. We have two unconstitutional executive orders on amnesty. I went to Washington to fix a problem."" Our ears perked up when Rubio said there are more illegal immigrants in the United States than there were five years ago, so we decided to check the numbers. We found that the latest available data doesn’t support Rubio’s statement. A July 2015 headline from the Pew Research Center directly counters Rubio that there are more illegal immigrants than five years ago: ""Unauthorized immigrant population stable for half a decade."" Pew found that the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has seen very little fluctuation, between 2010 and 2014, the latest five-year period of data available — going from 11.4 million in 2010 to 11.3 million in 2014. The illegal immigrant population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007. (See the chart created by Pew to the left.) The Pew analysis concluded that the illegal immigrant population has been stable the past few years because the number of new immigrants is about equal to the number of those living in the United States who are deported, leave on their own, or die. Pew also found that the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, in particular, has been on the decline — going from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to 5.6 million in 2014. The decline in Mexican immigrants is the primary reason why illegal immigration stopped growing, said Robert Warren, a demographer and senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies. He pointed us to his own recent research on the subject. The report’s executive summary says illegal immigration is a hot political topic, in part, because people believe it’s on the rise. However, the paper finds that ""this belief is mistaken and that, in fact, the undocumented population has been decreasing for more than a half a decade."" Warren’s report found that the illegal immigrant population has declined every year for the past five years of available data, landing at about 10.9 million illegal immigrants in 2014, down from 11.7 million in 2010. Why the decline in Mexican immigration? In a prior fact-check, we found that demographic change is possibly the biggest driver. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. He said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop in total apprehensions of about 40 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped around a million people coming in from Mexico per year. Last year, it was about 188,000. More surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect, he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants, and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling Rubio said, ""We have more illegal immigrants here"" than we did five years ago. Multiple estimates show that the illegal immigrant population has stabilized, or even decreased, from its peak in 2007 through 2014, the latest available data. According to Pew, the illegal immigrant population was 11.3 million in 2014, down from 11.4 million five years prior in 2010. This is in sharp contrast to dramatic and steady increases throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. There is no evidence to support the idea that the illegal immigrant population has grown in the past five years.

Reed and McCain make a case to save Gen. Petraeus' pension
","From their seats on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed and John McCain had a front row vantage point on the rise of Army General David Petraeus, the legendary military leader who authored the counterinsurgency campaign known as ""The Surge."" Both senators visited Petraeus in Baghdad, received testimony from him in Washington and greatly admired the general’s leadership of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reed and McCain, former military officers and the Republican and Democratic leaders of the committee, repeatedly voted for Petraeus’ various postings, including his appointment as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2011. Then in 2012 the roof collapsed on Petraeus’ career after a scandal involving an extra-marital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, prompted his resignation in 2012 and eventually led to his misdemeanor criminal conviction for inappropriately handling classified information. Now, in a letter to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, the two senators have come to the defense of the disgraced four-star general, whom they called ""brilliant."" Carter is considering retroactively demoting the retiree, which could take away one of his stars and slash his annual pension from about $220,000 to as low as $170,000, according to recent media reports. The senators’ Jan. 20  letter says a retroactive review of Petraeus’ retirement, coming one year after the general admitted his guilt and apologized, would be ""manifestly unreasonable and unfair."" ""It is rare that a retirement grade determination is conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces,"" says the letter, which is signed by both senators. The statement made us wonder, is it rare? Petraeus can’t be the only former military officer convicted of a crime. What happens in other cases? First, let’s look at the Petraeus case. After returning from Afghanistan during the summer of 2011, Petraeus held onto eight black notebooks that contained classified information such as the names of covert officers, war strategy and other intelligence matters, according to an admission he made at his plea hearing. ""On or about"" Aug. 28, 2011, says the court record, Petraeus provided the notebooks to his biographer. He retired on Aug. 31, and he retrieved the notebooks on or about Sept. 1. Later, in October 2012, while Petraeus was serving as CIA director, he spoke to two FBI agents and admitted his involvement in an affair with Broadwell, telling them their relationship began after he left the military. He denied providing classified information to Broadwell, which was a knowing and deliberate false statement, according to an admission he would make later in court. In November 2012, he resigned as CIA director. FBI agents recovered the notebooks from Petraeus’ home, where he had kept them in violation of the law.  In March 2015, he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor. In the U.S. Army, a process called grade determination"" governs the rank an officer retires at and also affects retirement pay. Such determinations ""are normally accomplished at the time of retirement"" and remain ""fixed"" thereafter, according to Army regulation 15-80. But the Army can lower the grade of a retired officer if any misconduct while on active duty is documented by a conviction in the wake of the officer’s retirement, says the regulation, which also talks about ""substantial new evidence"" triggering a review if it’s ""discovered within a short time following separation."" Reed and McCain argue that too much time has passed for such action. The specific sequence of events that might lead the Army to retroactively demote a retiree are quite rare to begin with, according to Anita Gorecki-Robbins, a lawyer and former Army Judge Advocate General officer who represents members of the military in grade determination proceedings. First of all, she said, the officer’s active-duty misconduct -- or lawbreaking -- must stay off the radar prior to his or her retirement. Then after retirement someone must tell the Army’s review board about it. During her 15 years of experience, she’s never encountered such a case. We asked both senators to substantiate their claim that such retroactive grade determinations are rare. Reed’s spokesman, Chip Unruh, consulted the Department of Defense and the Army and told us both entities confirm there has been only one case in the last decade involving the retroactive demotion of a retired three star or four star general. Looking at the officers’ corps at large, it’s rare for anyone to advance to the rank of three-star general and it’s rarer still for an officer of such a lofty rank to be criminally charged.  And then consider the circumstances of the Petraeus scandal, involving a storied war leader and former CIA director. As Gorecki-Robbins says: ""This is truly a unique set of facts."" Our Ruling In their letter, McCain and Reed told the defense secretary, ""It is rare that a retirement grade determination is conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces."" That claim is True. That’s our ruling. But we feel compelled to point out that the procedure itself is rare and it’s rarer still to see an American military officer rise so high and fall so far.  ",/factchecks/2016/jan/31/jack-reed/reed-and-mccain-make-case-save-gen-petraeus-pensio/
