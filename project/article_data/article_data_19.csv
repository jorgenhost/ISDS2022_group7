Tillis stakes Title 42 claim on limited data
","A North Carolina senator says President Biden is on the verge of ending an immigration-related pandemic policy that most Americans support. The Biden administration recently announced plans to lift what’s known as Title 42, a public health law that allows border officials to expel certain immigrants without giving them a chance to apply for asylum. Unaccompanied children and some others are exempt from the rule. Title 42 has been controversial since former President Donald Trump enacted it at the start of the pandemic in 2020. Critics of the rule say it’s inherently xenophobic, while supporters see it as a tool that’s necessary for managing both the coronavirus and the influx of immigrants at the southern U.S. border. U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., says he’s working with other Republicans to try to keep Title 42 in place after the Biden administration’s May 23 expiration date. In an April 7 press release with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Tillis claimed that Biden’s decision is out of step with voters’ priorities.  ""Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place, so I hope we can agree that we should maintain this policy and protect our country from a surge of illegal immigration over the next few months,"" Tillis said in the press release. Is it true that ""most Americans"" want to keep Title 42 in place? Polling by Morning Consult and Politico suggests Title 42 might be popular, but polling experts say it’s difficult to make declarative statements about the law without more data. A separate poll conducted by an immigrant rights group found support for Biden’s position, but experts said it had its own shortcomings. To support Tillis’ claim, his office pointed to the Morning Consult poll, which was released April 6. The survey of 2,003 registered voters was conducted between April 1 and 4 and had an unweighted margin of error of plus-minus 2 percentage points. Morning Consult, a market research company, reported that 56% of respondents oppose the decision to remove the border controls implemented by the Trump administration. The group has a ""B"" rating with FiveThirtyEight, a website that conducts opinion poll analysis and grades political pollsters. A ""B"" rating means the company is generally reliable but its polling methodology isn’t as good as firms with ""A"" ratings. Polling experts told PolitiFact North Carolina that, due to the way the question was phrased in that poll, they’re not confident the results offer a clear reflection of people’s beliefs about Title 42 specifically. Here’s how Morning Consult phrased its question about Title 42: ""As you may know, the Trump administration implemented border controls at the U.S.-Mexico border in March 2020 in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. These controls allowed border officials to quickly expel migrants seeking to enter the U.S. for protection. The Biden administration will remove these border controls on May 23rd. Do you support or oppose the Biden administration removing these border controls?"" The inclusion of Trump and Biden’s names may have caused some voters to skip over consideration of the rule and side with their preferred politician, polling experts said. David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C., said he was ""troubled"" by the wording of the question ""because it does not reference the CDC Title 42 directive, instead making it appear to be more of a political issue between Trump and Biden."" Andrew E. Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire’s Survey Center, doubted whether many respondents had much knowledge of the Title 42 policy before they were asked the question. ""But they do know Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and it is no surprise that Biden voters support the change and Trump supporters oppose it as the names are cues to how they should respond,"" he said in an email. Polling experts noticed a pattern between support for Title 42 and support for Biden more generally. Asked whether they approve or disapprove of the job President Joe Biden is doing, 55% of respondents said they disapprove — almost the same number of respondents who said they want to keep Title 42 in place. ""Since almost everything now is just a surrogate for ‘us’ or ‘them,’ I’d argue that question is essentially another form of asking about presidential approval,"" Janine Parry, a University of Arkansas political science professor, said in an email. Smith noted that the poll didn’t ask voters questions to determine if they were familiar with the Title 42 policy. ""So there is no way of assessing, in my opinion, what Americans know or don’t know about the original policy, let alone their support for changing it."" PolitiFact NC reached out to Morning Consult seeking comment on the experts’ criticisms, but didn’t receive a response. The group conducted another poll on the issue between April 8-11, after Tillis’ comment. It found that 54% of respondents support Title 42. But, again, the question included references to Biden and Trump. A poll released on Feb. 22 by the National Immigration Law Center’s Justice Fund omitted the names of politicians when asking about Title 42. The poll, which surveyed 802 likely voters, asked if respondents supported or opposed ending ""the practice of using COVID as a reason to deny asylum seekers entrance to the U.S."" Fifty-two percent said they supported ending the policy. But experts found issues with that poll too. McLennan noticed that the respondents included a higher percentage of women and people with higher education levels than one would expect. Smith said the Justice Fund poll, like the Morning Consult poll, failed to determine whether people were familiar with the policy before asking about it. Questions from both polls ""assume a level of knowledge about the topic that is likely not there, certainly among most people.""  Tillis said ""Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place."" One poll of 2,003 registered voters found that 56% of them want to keep Title 42 in place. However, polling experts say the phrasing of the question wasn’t ideal in that it invoked the names of Trump and Biden. Another poll, which did not use such names, found that 52% of respondents opposed Title 42. Tillis’s statement has some truth to it but lacks key information about the issue that would leave a different impression.

Trump is wrong about Marjorie Taylor Greene legal challenge and Georgia officials
","A day before a court hearing on whether U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., should be removed from the ballot in her bid for reelection, former President Donald Trump accused two prominent Republican officials of trying to unseat the congresswoman. Greene is an ally of Trump. ""The Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, and Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, perhaps in collusion with the Radical Left Democrats, have allowed a horrible thing to happen to a very popular Republican, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene,"" Trump wrote in an April 21 statement. ""She is now going through hell in their attempt to unseat her, just more of an election mess in Georgia…""  Trump appears to be referencing a challenge filed by Free Speech for People, a group of voters seeking to remove Greene from the ballot. Greene, who has promoted falsehoods that Democrats stole the 2020 election, faces multiple primary challengers in the Republican-leaning district. The group says that Greene’s statements before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol should disqualify her under a section of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which says that public officials cannot serve in future federal, state, or military office if they engaged in ""insurrection or rebellion.""  As secretary of state, Raffensperger is required under state law to forward any such voter challenge to an administrative law judge. A judge held a hearing on the matter on April 22, which was underway as of this writing.  We asked Trump’s spokesperson for their evidence that Kemp and Raffensperger colluded with Democrats to remove Greene and did not receive a response by our deadline. We found no evidence to support that theory. Trump has targeted the Georgia Republican officials after they didn’t go along with his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Raffensperger and Kemp certified the results, as required by state law. Trump is backing Republican challengers to both officials — former U.S. Sen. David Perdue is running against Kemp, while U.S. Rep. Jody Hice is running against Raffensperger in the May 24 primary.  Greene has not been charged with any offenses stemming from the Jan. 6 attack. The challenge filed by the voters relies on statements Greene made, such as the day before the Capitol attack, calling for a ""1776 moment"" — a nod to the American Revolution.  During the April 22 hearing, Greene said she was calling for a ""peaceful"" demonstration and not violence.  A judge rejected a similar effort to bar U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., from running for reelection, but the case is under appeal. Challenges have also been filed related to the candidacy of some Arizona Republicans.  Under Georgia law, a voter may file a written challenge with the secretary of state. The official must then refer the matter to an administrative law judge, who reports their findings to the secretary of state. Then the secretary of state ""shall determine if the candidate is qualified to seek and hold the public office"" and can remove the candidate’s name from the ballot. If the ballots have already been printed, notices are placed at polling places advising voters of the disqualification of the candidate.  So far, then, Raffensperger has followed the process required under state law. It doesn’t mean he agrees with the challenge; he’s simply obligated to pass the complaint on to a judge. In fact, state law would have allowed Raffensperger to challenge Greene’s candidacy directly — but he didn’t do that. ""In sum, we have had no active role in the challenge to (Greene’s) candidacy at this point,"" said Raffensperger’s spokesperson, Ari Schaffer. ""Considering we make the final decision, it would be inappropriate to comment early on in the process."" Meanwhile, we found no evidence that Kemp would play a role in this process at all. We emailed a spokesperson for Kemp to ask if he had taken any action and did not receive a response by our deadline. Attorneys for the voters who filed the challenge told PolitiFact they had no evidence to support Trump’s charge of collusion.. ""The governor has no role in the process,"" Ron Fein, legal director for Free Speech for People, told PolitiFact. ""Counsel for petitioners have not interacted with Kemp at all, or Raffensperger except through the bureaucratic technicality that the complaint was filed with him."" Trump said Kemp and Raffensperger ""perhaps in collusion with the Radical Left Democrats"" are attempting to ""unseat"" Greene. A group of voters filed a challenge with Raffensperger to remove Greene from the ballot. Under state law, Raffensperger is required to forward that challenge to an administrative law judge, and he did so. As governor, Kemp has no role in this process.  We rate this statement False.

Fact-checking Joe Biden on being a full professor for four years
","During a visit to North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro, N.C., President Joe Biden broke the ice with his audience by saying he shared some common ground with members of the university community. ""I've been to a lot of university campuses,"" Biden said April 14. ""Matter of fact, for four years, I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And this is really an impressive place with a lot of impressive students."" A reader asked us to fact-check whether Biden really was a full professor for four years.  Biden served as Benjamin Franklin Presidential Professor of the Practice at the University of Pennsylvania between his tenure as vice president and the start of his presidential campaign. However, the duration of the position was closer to two years than four, since he was on leave while running for president. Also, his duties might not conform to the full range of activities that the public might associate with the term ""full professor,"" including teaching semester-long classes, conducting independent research, and handling administrative responsibilities. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. According to the university’s faculty handbook, the rank of practice professor ""is confined to a small number of untenured full-time professorships"" in certain schools at Penn that permit the addition to the faculty of ""distinguished, highly experienced individuals who have achieved success in their fields and whose skills and knowledge are essential to the educational process at both the undergraduate and graduate levels."" The handbook describes the ""primary"" activity of a practice professor as teaching, though they may also ""supervise independent studies and internships, serve on committees and attend school faculty meetings."" According to the tax forms he has released, Biden received more than $900,000 from the university for holding the position between 2017 and 2019. His post ""involved no regular classes and around a dozen public appearances on campus, mostly in big, ticketed events,"" the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.  Specifically, the Inquirer reported, Biden’s appearances included ""three Q-and-As with Penn president Amy Gutmann, panel discussions on immigration and cancer, a talk about his book, a lecture to a Wharton class, and public conversations with former Mexico President Felipe Calderon and former United Kingdom Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, according to a tally by the student newspaper, the Daily Pennsylvanian."" As part of the post, Biden also established the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington for the university. Biden’s professorship included affiliations with the Annenberg School for Communication, Penn’s School of Arts and Sciences, and the Wharton School. However, shortly after Biden’s appointment was announced in 2017, Kate Bedingfield, a Biden spokesperson, told The Daily Pennsylvanian that Biden would not be teaching regular classes. Joe Biden at a forum on the opioid epidemic at the University of Pennsylvania on April 11, 2019. (AP) Biden was the first individual to hold the Franklin professorship, and his tenure overlapped with the second holder: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican. Biden and Bush held at least two joint events on campus, the Inquirer reported. Biden went on an unpaid leave of absence in April 2019, when he became a presidential candidate, meaning that his time as an active holder of the professorship was about two years, not four as Biden said in his North Carolina speech. PolitiFact asked the University of Pennsylvania about the differences between Biden’s position and those of a rank-and-file full professor. ""Penn has many different models of professorships,"" Ron Ozio, the university’s director of media relations, told PolitiFact. ""Not all are tenure-track and involve teaching regular classes. Some are clinicians, some are researchers, and others are professors of the practice, the category that applied to President Biden."" Ozio added that the university was satisfied with Biden’s tenure. Biden was ""phenomenally successful,"" Ozio said. ""He helped to expand the university’s global outreach, while sharing his wisdom and insights with thousands of Penn students through University-wide events, talks and classroom visits."" Biden said, ""For four years, I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania."" Biden served as a ""professor of the practice"" at the University of Pennsylvania. However, the duration of his position was closer to two years, since he was on unpaid leave while running for president. His duties of his particular professorship did not include the same degree of teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities that some would associate with someone holding a position as ""full professor.""

In Senate race, JD Vance’s call for higher taxes is only for certain corporations, corporate leaders
","Early voting is under way in Ohio, and Republican-on-Republican attacks continue in the U.S. Senate race, with Mike Gibbons hitting J.D. Vance over taxes. ""J.D. Vance called for higher taxes,"" the narrator said in a Gibbons TV ad. Vance is an author and venture capitalist. He has not called for tax increases broadly, only for certain corporate leaders and corporations.   The ad is based on a tweet that Vance posted in April 2021 in reply to CBS News reporter Ed O’Keefe. Gibbons’ campaign did not reply to our request for information, but Vance’s tweet is cited in the ad. O’Keefe tweeted about a ""first-of-its-kind call between more than 100 top corporate leaders"" on ""how to respond to proposed changes in state voting laws."" On the call were top leaders of airlines, media, law and investment, O’Keefe said. Vance replied: ""Raise their taxes and do whatever else is necessary to fight these goons. We can have an American Republic or a global oligarchy, and it’s time for choosing. ""At this very moment there are companies (big and small) paying good wages to American workers, investing in their communities, and making it easier for American families. Cut their taxes. No more subsidies to the anti-American business class."" Vance, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has also embraced tax increases for certain corporations.  ""By all means, let’s cut the taxes of the companies that invest in our country,"" Vance says on his campaign website: ""But we’re going to raise taxes on companies that ship jobs overseas and use their money to fund anti-American radical movements. If these companies are going to wage war on America, it’s time America wages war on them."" Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told PolitiFact that Vance ""has advocated for cutting taxes on companies who create jobs in America and wants to raise taxes on companies who are anti-American and who ship out jobs to China."" We didn’t find any instances of Vance calling for other tax increases. The Ohio Senate seat is opening because Republican Rob Portman, who was elected in 2010, is not seeking reelection.  Besides Gibbons, a businessman, and Vance, the Republican candidates include Ohio state Sen. Matt Dolan, former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel and former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken.  As of April 19, the Real Clear Politics polling average put Mandel in the lead at 21%, followed by Gibbons at 19.3% and Vance at 14%. In a poll of likely GOP voters conducted April 13-14 by Trafalgar Group, Mandel led with 28%, followed by Vance at 22.6% and Gibbons at 14.3%. The leading Democratic candidates are U.S. Rep.

In Ohio US Senate race, Gibbons levels misleading attack against Mandel about China
","When verbal sparring between candidates nearly gets physical, you wouldn’t expect it to let up as primary election day draws near. In the race for the U.S. Senate in Ohio, you’d be right.  During a debate in March, Republicans Mike Gibbons and Josh Mandel literally got toe-to-toe after Mandel accused Gibbons of making millions from business dealings related to Chinese companies. Now, with early voting underway for the May 3 Ohio primaries, Gibbons accused Mandel of being ""weak on China"" — a theme common in 2022 campaigns across the country.  In a video ad on Facebook and Instagram, the narrator said:  ""As Ohio treasurer, Josh Mandel loaned your money to Chinese business interests, and Mandel opposed a bill holding Communist China accountable when they cheated and stole American jobs.""  On the money lending part of the claim, Gibbons cites the investment of Ohio public funds in companies such as U.S.-based Exxon and Apple, which many Americans are invested in. The companies do business in China, but they are multinational corporations, not Chinese companies. Mandel indicated in 2012 that he opposed tariffs on China as proposed in 2011 federal legislation, saying he preferred diplomacy to dissuade China from manipulating its currency. To back the first part of the ad’s claim, Gibbons’ campaign cited to PolitiFact investments made by the State Treasury Asset Reserve of Ohio while Mandel was treasurer, from 2011 to 2019.  STAR Ohio is a fund consisting of pooled assets from Ohio government subdivisions, including counties, municipalities and school districts. The fund is administered by the treasurer. Citing STAR Ohio’s 2018 annual report, Gibbons’ campaign pointed to investments the fund made in Toyota Motor Credit Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., JPMorgan Securities, Credit Suisse AG, MetLife Funding Inc. and Apple Inc. The campaign argued that at the time, each company had business operations in China or did business with companies in China. The companies or the parent companies are multinational corporations based outside of China, not ""Chinese business interests.""  Toyota is based in Japan; Credit Suisse AG is based in Switzerland; and Exxon, JPMorgan, MetLife and Apple are based in the United States. David Dollar, an expert on China's economy and U.S.-China economic relations at the Brookings Institution, said the companies ""cannot be characterized as Chinese business interests. Their shareholders would mostly be from the USA and other developed countries, not China."" On the second part of the ad’s claim, the Gibbons campaign referred to a 2011 federal bill that would have pressured China to allow its currency to appreciate.  By manipulating the value of its currency, China can gain a competitive advantage over American manufacturers by keeping its export prices low. A weaker yuan, relative to the U.S. dollar, means Chinese goods can be exported more cheaply to the United States, because each dollar in sales revenue translates to more yuan back in China.  Supporters argued that Chinese ""cheating"" on the issue cost the United States more than 1.6 million jobs. The Gibbons campaign cited a 2012 Cleveland Plain Dealer story in which Mandel, in his first run for U.S. Senate, indicated opposition to the bill. The bill would have moved the U.S. toward imposing tariffs on countries that manipulate their currency, but more hurdles would have had to have been cleared, said Derek Scissors, an expert on the Chinese economy and trade policy at the American Enterprise Institute. The newspaper reported that Mandel believed China manipulated its currency and should be held accountable through diplomatic means.  ""We must be vigilant in taking them on and making sure they play by the rules. At the same time, my approach would be a diplomatic approach, not a legislative approach,"" Mandel said. The bill passed the Senate but was not taken up by the House.  Mandel’s campaign did not reply to our requests for comment. The Ohio Senate seat is opening because Republican Rob Portman, who was elected in 2010, is not seeking reelection.  Besides Mandel and Gibbons, the Republican candidates include Ohio state Sen. Matt Dolan,  former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author J.D. Vance. The leading Democratic candidates are U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. Overall, the race is rated by campaign watchers as ""leans"" Republican, ""likely"" Republican and ""solid"" Republican. Gibbons claimed in an ad that Mandel, as Ohio’s state treasurer, ""loaned your money to Chinese business interests and Mandel opposed a bill holding Communist China accountable when they cheated and stole American jobs."" Mandel led a state fund that invested public money in multinational corporations such as U.S.-based Exxon and Apple that do business in China, but are not based there. Mandel indicated he did not support a 2011 bill that would have allowed for imposing tariffs on countries that manipulated their currency. But he suggested holding China accountable through diplomatic efforts. Gibbons’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist says he ‘always’ supported abortion access. But his record shows inconsistency
","The political career of U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, a Democratic candidate for Florida governor, spans three decades, three party affiliations and multiple positions on sensitive issues. On April 12, Shannon Cake of WPTV in West Palm Beach quizzed Crist on his political evolution, specifically where he currently stood on LGBTQ rights and abortion.  While Crist readily admitted that he had changed his position on gay marriage, he said his stance on whether women should have the right to obtain an abortion hadn’t changed.  ""I believe in a woman’s right to choose. I always have,"" Crist said. ""I am still pro-life — meaning I am for life. I hope most people are, and I think it’s important to understand the distinction."" Cake pushed back at his use of ""pro-life,"" because it doesn’t precisely describe the political discourse surrounding abortion. Crist maintained that he was ""for life"" and also supported women’s right to choose.  PolitiFact has fact-checked claims related to Crist’s view on abortion more than five times. It’s difficult to condense to a sound bite.  Crist’s stance has been consistently inconsistent. He’s called himself both ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice"" throughout his career, defining them on his own terms.   As a raft of new abortion laws take hold in Republican-led states across the U.S. — including Florida — we wanted to take a fresh look at Crist’s record. Let’s examine the evidence.   When Crist arrived on Florida’s political scene in 1992 — then a Republican from St. Petersburg, running for the state Legislature — his stance on abortion was less murky: the decision should rest with women, not the government.  Crist told the Miami Herald that he did not support state-funded abortion.  Such rhetoric reappeared throughout much of his early career in the Florida Senate. In 1995, Crist broke from party lines to vote down a measure that would have imposed a 24-hour waiting period for women to obtain an abortion.  At the time, Crist argued that his position fell in line with Republican tendencies to favor small government involvement. As he began to eye a national office, his support for abortion rights grew more conditional.  In March 1998, Crist expressed opposition to late-term abortion and voted with the Senate to override former Gov. Lawton Chiles’ veto of a bill aimed at prohibiting the procedure.  Later, in a bid for a U.S. Senate seat in 1998, Crist wrote in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times that he was ""pro-choice, but not pro-abortion."" Thus began the argument that though he didn’t personally favor the procedure, he didn’t aim to strike it down.  This position was further cemented when Crist said he wouldn’t back a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortion. He lost that race.  As he geared up to run for Florida governor in 2006, Crist re-cast himself more simply as ""pro-life."" During the Republican primary, one of Crist’s opponents cast doubt on his position on abortion, releasing a campaign ad that labeled him ""pro-choice."" Crist’s campaign called it false and fired back with an ad that claimed Crist was ""pro-life."" Still, Crist’s remarks on abortion continued to puzzle ""activists on both sides of the abortion debate,"" according to the Miami Herald.  On the one hand, he publicly expressed opposition to the procedure. On the other, he said he wouldn't support repealing the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that made it legal. In 2006, Crist routinely said politicians shouldn’t put ""themselves in the place of physicians."" However, during that campaign, Crist also told a priest he would sign a bill prohibiting abortions except when the mother’s life was at stake.  Crist won the Republican nomination and became governor of Florida for four years. His second bid for the U.S. Senate introduced more flexibility on abortion. In the 2010 Republican U.S. Senate primary, Crist’s campaign released a statement that he would ""fight for pro-life legislative efforts."" When his primary chances soured, Crist left the Republican Party and continued an unsuccessful run for the Senate seat with no party affiliation. Before he left the governor’s office, Crist vetoed legislation that would have required women to get an ultrasound before opting to have an abortion, saying he found it ""punitive."" Out of office in 2012, Crist endorsed former President Barack Obama for re-election in an op-ed for the Tampa Bay Times and complained about the Republican Party pitching ""so far to the extreme right on issues important to women."" A few months later, Crist officially signed papers to become a Democrat for an unsuccessful bid for governor against Republican Rick Scott. On the now-defunct website for his 2014 campaign, Crist stated: ""Charlie supports a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions — as governor, he vetoed a measure that required women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound, a law that Rick Scott signed. Charlie believes that government should stay out of personal health decisions between a woman and her doctor."" Recently, when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, Crist denounced the move, using a similar rationale. Crist’s campaign also pointed to his congressional record. In 2017, Crist voted against legislation that aimed to prohibit abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.  He also voted against efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization that provides health care services, including abortion.  Crist is one of multiple Democrats running in the Aug. 23 primary for governor. The winner will face DeSantis in November. Crist said in a TV interview that he has ""always"" believed ""in a woman’s right to choose.""  That’s wrong. It’s difficult to summarize Crist’s views on abortion over three decades in a nutshell, because he has expressed conflicting statements. But he has made some remarks that went against the choice to have an abortion, including in 2006 when Crist told a priest that he would sign a bill prohibiting abortion except when the mother’s life was at stake. In 2010, his campaign said that Crist would ""fight for pro-life legislative efforts."" There are other times when Crist made statements in favor of abortion access, such as when he said he would not be in favor of repealing Roe v. Wade. But on the whole, he takes it too far when he says he ""always"" supported a woman’s right to choose an abortion. We rate this statement False.

Fauci's comment about lockdowns, vaccination twisted out of context
","A social media post misleads by showing a truncated version of a comment from Dr. Anthony Fauci that is missing context. An April 19 post on Facebook suggests that Fauci said lockdowns are a method for coercing people to comply with COVID-19 vaccinations. The post shows a screenshot of a headline that says, ""Fauci: ‘You use lockdowns to get people vaccinated,’"" from conservative news site the Daily Wire. The caption says, ""That's called tyranny."" The post also includes a meme showing the character Fred from Scooby Doo unmasking Fauci to reveal the emblem of the Chinese Communist Party. The meme gives the disturbing appearance of resembling a beheading. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But Fauci’s comment was taken out of context — in an MSNBC interview, he was talking specifically about vaccine efficacy and uptake in China, where there is an ongoing lockdown. And he did not indicate at any point in his 90-second reply that lockdowns should be used as a tool of coercion, as the post implies. He made the remark during an April 14 interview with Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC, in reply to a question about China’s current approach to COVID-19. At the 6:54 mark in the video, Mitchell asked, ""How concerning is the outbreak in China?"" and mentioned the ongoing, near-total lockdown in Shanghai. Part of Fauci’s reply was, ""You use lockdowns to get people vaccinated so that when you open up, you won't have a surge of infections, because you're dealing with an immunologically naive population to the virus, because they've not really been exposed because of the lockdown."" He went on to say, around the 8:25 mark, that people in China are not well-protected by vaccines — in part because China is using less effective vaccines than many other countries — and that its most vulnerable population, older people, are not vaccinated. His observations about vaccinations in China are borne out by recent reporting. China ""is struggling with two problems as it faces its worst COVID-19 surge since the start of the pandemic,"" according to an April 20 story in the Financial Times. The problems are ""the sluggish take-up of booster doses — authorities said this week that only 57 per cent of people over 60 have been fully vaccinated with three jabs — and homegrown vaccines that are much less effective than foreign-produced jabs."" But the first portion of Fauci’s comment — that ""you use lockdowns to get people vaccinated"" — was seized upon by people such as Dr. Simone Gold, a founder of America’s Frontline Doctors, which became famous for voicing coronavirus conspiracy theories. Gold tweeted on April 19, ""Fauci is essentially admitting that lockdowns were used to condition and control the public—putting people in such a heightened state of desperation for freedom as to compel us to take the vaccine."" The story that the Facebook post references, from the Daily Wire, gives a more complete accounting of Fauci’s comments, but it also gives the misleading impression that Fauci is a supporter of China’s style of lockdowns. For example, the story quotes a fragment of one of Fauci’s comments — that China’s type of strict lockdowns would never be able to be implemented in the United States, ""although that prevents the spread of infection"" — even though Fauci never said or implied that the U.S. should employ those types of lockdowns. A Facebook post suggests that Fauci said lockdowns are a method for coercing people to comply with COVID-19 vaccinations. The claim includes a truncated version of Fauci’s comments that was taken out of context.  In his 90-second reply, he talked specifically about vaccine efficacy and uptake in China, where there is an ongoing lockdown. And Fauci did not indicate at any point that lockdowns should be used as a tool of coercion, as the post implies.

Yes, inflation is at a 40-year high, and rates have been climbing throughout Biden’s time in office
","Prices are increasing for everything from gas at the pump to the chicken at the grocery store.  That means the reason driving those increases – inflation – has become a major talking point, especially for politicians. And especially for Republicans, who want to pin the blame for rising prices on Democrats and President Joe Biden. U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, weighed in on the matter, and framed the increases around Biden’s time in office.  ""Inflation has gone up every month of the Biden presidency and just hit another 40-year high,"" he said in an April 12, 2022 news release.  Is he right? When asked for more backup for the claim, Gallagher’s office shared a link to an April 10, 2022 article from NBC News, which noted that inflation has risen every month since Biden took office – and that the inflation rate is the highest it’s been in 40 years.  His office also shared a link to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showing the Consumer Price Index (which serves as a measure of inflation) for the last 20 years. The graph shows that the index started climbing in April 2020, with a steep increase in January of 2021.  That, of course, is when Biden took office. Before we dig deeper, it’s important to note two things.  First, economists and experts say inflation is driven by a wide variety of factors, including a surge in demand for services and goods, and consumers who are willing to pay more for them.  In this case, it includes supply chain issues prompted by COVID-related problems such as a drop in the production of items such as cars, couches and even gas, according to a Jan. 10, 2022 New York Times article. But inflation can also be driven by consumers spending more money, as people are doing following the stimulus checks received during the coronavirus pandemic.  ""The indefatigable shopping is helping to keep price increases brisk,"" the NYT article said.  Second, inflation has been creeping up for quite a long time, and continued that trend under former President Donald Trump, just as it has under Biden. As an April 20, 2022 factcheck noted, inflation did increase after Biden took office, especially following the passage of the American Rescue Plan, which included $1,400 payments to every American, $360 billion for state and local governments and $242 billion in expanded unemployment benefits, among other funding.  Jim Johannes, an emeritus professor of banking and finance and the director of the Puelicher Center for Banking Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said looking at charts from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website shows that the inflation rate is indeed at its highest point in 40 years, sitting at about 8.5% as of March.  That is, prices in March 2022 were 8.5% higher than in March 2021.  The last time the rate was that high was in 1981.  As far as the inflation rate rising every month of Biden’s presidency, Gallagher’s claim deserves an asterisk on that point as well.   Here is the breakdown: February 2021: 1.7% March 2021: 2.7% April 2021: 4.2% May 2021: 4.9% June 2021: 5.3% July 2021: 5.3% August 2021: 5.2% September 2021: 5.4% October 2021: 6.2% November 2021: 6.8% December 2021: 7.1% January 2022: 7.5% February 2022: 7.9% March 2022: 8.5% According to FRED data, there was a slight plateau between June 2021 and September 2021, but other than that, inflation has indeed increased every month since Biden took office.  ""I think the factual statement as in the inflation rate going up every month of the Biden administration, the answer would be, with a slight exception of a few months in 2021, the answer is yes,"" Johannes said.       In a news release, Gallagher claimed: ""Inflation has gone up every month of the Biden presidency and just hit another 40-year high.""  Looking at economic data, it’s true that the rate of inflation is the highest it’s been since the 1980s. And inflation has, indeed, been on the rise under Biden – though Gallagher glosses over a slight plateau in mid-2021.  What’s more, the increase – which, to be sure, has gotten much steeper – began before Biden was sworn in, under Trump. That leaves us with a claim that is accurate, but needs clarification or additional information. That’s what we call Mostly True.   ",/factchecks/2022/apr/22/mike-gallagher/yes-inflation-40-year-high-and-rates-have-been-cli/

As of March 27, the U.S. total stood at $8.2 billion, far oustripping the total for all Eureopean Union countries combined, which was around $3.2 billion.

Another important indicator that the U.S. is not orchestrating a takeover: The U.S. has not sent combat troops to Ukraine. By comparison, when the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 to oust its leader, Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of U.S. troops were deployed to Iraq. Recently, the U.S. has sent troops to Europe — increasing the number there from 60,000 to more than 100,000 — ""as a result of Russia’s military buildup around Ukraine and subsequent invasion,"" the Washington Post reported in early April. The newspaper noted that in the 1950s, during the Cold War, the U.S. had more than 400,000 troops in Europe.  The goal now ""is to make sure that we continue to reassure our allies and partners, especially those that are on the eastern flank and especially our allies that are in the Baltic area, the Baltic region,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in early April.  The U.S. has provided weapons, ammunition, vehicles and protective equipment to Ukraine since August 2021, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. That has included anti-armor and anti-aircraft missiles; drones that can ""crash into a target with explosives;"" and counter-artillery radar systems and counter-mortar radar systems, according to the Washington Post.

Gaetz’s diagnosis of what’s driving insulin costs misses the root cause
","At the end of March, after the House passed a bill that would cap the cost of insulin at $35 per month for insured consumers, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., tweeted about why he voted against the legislation. ""Insulin price increases have more to do with increased consumer demand than the bad behavior of Big Pharma, which I am quick to condemn,"" Gaetz wrote. He continued, in a 10-part Twitter thread, to offer weight loss as a potential solution to insulin costs rather than capping prices: ""90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which ‘can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active.’ Arbitrary price controls are no substitute for individual weight control. Since 2000, the number of diabetes cases in the U.S. has nearly doubled. The demand for insulin has increased and the requisite price increase has followed suit. In other words, the price of insulin increases as waistlines increase."" The tweet picked up attention on social media and from news outlets, but we wondered whether there was any connection between demand for insulin and the rising cost of the drug. One economic principle states that, for some products, if demand increases, prices will follow. Does that hold true for insulin, a drug that millions of Americans need to survive? We reached out to Gaetz’s office to ask for the evidence to back up his claim but received no response. So we asked the experts to explain what’s going on with insulin prices. Insulin was first discovered in 1921 and patented two years later. The hormone is essential for people with Type 1 diabetes because their pancreas no longer makes natural insulin, needed to regulate blood sugar. An extremely high blood sugar level can be deadly. These patients make up about a tenth of the total number of people with diabetes in the country. Some patients need to inject insulin often, at least twice a day. The majority of people with diabetes, however, have Type 2, which has been linked to obesity. Excess weight may interfere with the body’s ability to effectively use insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. ""As obesity increases, diabetes increases as well,"" said Dr. Paresh Dandona, a professor at the University at Buffalo’s medical school who studies diabetes. But many of these patients are not prescribed insulin as a treatment. Around 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes use insulin when other drug options are not successful in treating the disease, Dandona said. For some Type 2 patients, exercising and a healthier diet ""may help reduce the insulin dose, but it doesn't eliminate its use."" Drug pricing experts said there’s no question that insulin’s list price (the amount charged to consumers and their health plans) has risen over the past decade. A 2020 study found that the list price of insulin products increased by 262% from 2007 to 2018, while a 2021 study found that from 2014 to 2018 the list price of insulin products increased by 40%. Is there a reason the price has ballooned? Not really, said the experts, except that the manufacturers and other stakeholders benefit from higher list prices. For example, pharmacy benefit managers – which manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of health plans – are paid based on the rebate amount they get from insulin manufacturers. If they can negotiate a more favorable spot for a manufacturer’s insulin on a drug formulary list (a plan’s list of covered drugs), they receive a bigger rebate. Insurance companies also benefit from higher prices, because they collect a higher amount from a patient’s portion of cost sharing and can also reap rebates from the pharmacy benefit managers. In addition, consumers have little bargaining power because insulin is typically an essential purchase. ""The insulin manufacturers set prices based on whatever the market will bear, not based on demand for their products,"" said Dr. Jing Luo, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh whose research focuses on drug pricing and use. However, the pharmaceutical industry disagrees with this assessment. PhRMA, the trade industry group representing pharmaceutical companies, told KHN that while it acknowledges drug manufacturers are responsible for raising the list price of insulin, the manufacturers aren’t reaping the benefits of the price increase. Instead, manufacturers are forced to raise the list prices to provide bigger discounts and rebates to the insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. But PhRMA argues that manufacturers are not receiving higher profits because of higher list prices. ""Rebates lower what health plans pay for insulins by roughly 84% and these savings should be shared with patients at the pharmacy,"" said Brian Newell, a spokesperson for PhRMA. ""Until we fix this broken system, patients will continue to face high costs for insulin."" Although in general economic terms, high demand can cause prices to rise because it is difficult to push out enough of a product, production isn’t an issue with insulin because it’s easy to ramp up supplies and there’s not a set amount of insulin that can be made, said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow at the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. So demand for insulin shouldn't affect prices. ""Production costs are unlikely to change very much when more people buy insulin since production can be scaled up fairly easily, at least in the long run,"" Fiedler wrote in an email. ""In fact, production costs could conceivably fall when more people buy insulin if manufacturers respond by developing more efficient production techniques."" At the end of the day, the list price for insulin is set by the manufacturers, and they along with every player in the drug pricing system benefit from higher prices, except for the consumers who have to purchase it to survive, said the experts. ""As we are all aware, increased demand does indeed drive up prices. This is especially true for commodities,"" said Luo. ""Unfortunately, brand-name prescription drugs like insulin are priced far differently than simple commodities."" In his Twitter thread, Gaetz said that diabetes cases have almost doubled since 2000. That is true. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 12 million Americans were diagnosed with diabetes in 2000. In 2018, the number of new diagnoses had risen to about 27 million. But a diabetes diagnosis is not always related to a person’s weight or overall health, especially for those with Type 1 diabetes, who are dependent on insulin treatment for life. ""In fact, those with Type 1 diabetes are usually very thin,"" said Dr. Eron Manusov, a professor in the medical school at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley. In addition, most people with diabetes have Type 2, which is linked to weight gain but not always treated with insulin. Other factors can play a role in the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, such as genetics, lifestyle, and age, Manusov said. Alleviating and treating diabetes is not as simple as eating healthier and exercising more, Dandona said.  If everyone ate the same healthy diet and exercised the same amount, some people would still become diabetic because a person’s genes and the environment they grew up in matter, he added. ""To expect that somehow magically that insulin requirements will vanish if patients lose weight is really talking in cuckoo land,"" Dandona said. The experts concluded that while both insulin list prices and diabetes cases have risen along the relatively same timeline, they’re not related. ""While higher obesity rates have likely increased diabetes prevalence, it is doubtful that this has had much effect on insulin prices,"" said Fiedler, the health economist. ""Also, obviously none of this is to say that reducing obesity or reducing diabetes is a bad thing. It just does not have much to do with insulin prices one way or the other."" The House bill would cap the cost of insulin at $35 per month for individuals who have private insurance or for those on Medicare. However, the bill does nothing to help the uninsured who need insulin. Democrats unanimously supported the legislation, as did 12 Republicans. But there was significant opposition, with 193 Republicans voting against it, including Gaetz. The bill now goes to the Senate, where members are considering other strategies to control insulin prices. Details are in the works. Gaetz said the reason for the rising cost of insulin was because more people were being diagnosed with diabetes, thus increasing demand for the product. And he pegged that rise in diabetes cases to the increase in the number of people who are overweight in the U.S. Health economists and diabetes experts told us that though he is right that diabetes cases are on the rise, Gaetz’s overall point is not accurate. His statement is based on a cause-and-effect argument that doesn’t exist. They said the increase in insulin prices is not tied to great demand for insulin or to production problems that pressure creates. In addition, although the rising prices come as more cases of obesity are reported, medical experts said they are not necessarily related. Many people who are overweight and develop Type 2 diabetes are not treated with insulin and the experts point out that many other factors help determine whether an individual will develop diabetes.

"['National', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
What about Tommy Thompson?
","In the TV ad Rudy Giuliani debuted in Florida this week, the announcer makes the claim, ""He reformed welfare before others tried.""
 
It's unclear who ""others"" are — everyone, or just Giuliani's Republican opponents? So let's consider both possibilities.
 
Giuliani can certainly lay claim to being out front on welfare reform, and his overhaul of the New York City welfare system is nothing short of astounding considering he did it ""in the teeth of the most intense opposition"" from nearly all of the most significant political forces in the city, said Lawrence Mead, professor of Politics at New York University.
 
One of the cornerstones of Giuliani's controversial plan was a requirement that able-bodied people work or perform community service in order to receive welfare payments (at its peak in 1999, there were over 35,000 people in the Work Experience Program). Welfare rolls during his two terms as major dropped more than 50 percent.
 
But Giuliani can't claim New York was the first in the country.
 
One of the first effective welfare-to-work programs was initiated in San Diego in the early 1980s, Mead said. And Wisconsin instituted an ambitious welfare-to-work program prior to New York City (which is why some people have called former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a onetime presidential candidate, the father of welfare reform). In fact, Giuliani hired one of the architects of the Wisconsin plan to help create changes in New York City.
 
""Giuliani was not absolutely first,"" said Mead, author of

Government Matters: Welfare Reform in Wisconsin.

 
""There is a long history of gradual movement to more and more radical reform,"" said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution and author of the book

Welfare Over Work.

 
Politicians in lots of states had dabbled in welfare reform before Giuliani, Haskins said, but Giuliani's program may have been the most remarkable due to the political opposition.
 
Both Mead and Haskins say that if the ad was comparing Giuliani just to his Republican opponents, it's right. Giuliani began making changes shortly after being elected mayor, so 1994. That predates the governorships of Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney. As for Sens. John McCain and Fred Thompson, the federal welfare reform laws passed in August 1996.
 
But the ad doesn't narrow the field at all, so we can only deduce it means he reformed welfare before

everyone

else. And that is False.

Hard to measure, but he's a tax cutter
","The statement made in a TV ad Rudy Giuliani debuted this week in Florida couldn't be more straightforward. It says Giuliani ""delivered more tax relief than the other Republicans combined.""
 
As any economist or tax expert will tell you, comparing the candidates on tax issues is a bit like trying to hug a greased pig.
 
Background material provided by the campaign for the ad claims that by the end of Giuliani's term as mayor, New Yorkers' ""tax burden"" was reduced nearly 20 percent. Under Mike Huckabee, it states, Arkansas residents' state tax burden increased nearly 19 percent; and under Mitt Romney, Massachusetts residents' state tax burden increased about 8 percent.
 
The Giuliani campaign said those numbers were based on the Tax Foundation's method of calculating the percentage of the state income being taken in state tax.
 
The Tax Foundation, which was kind enough to analyze tax burden figures for PolitiFact, came up with slightly lower figures for the increases under Huckabee and Romney: 14 and 7 percent, respectively.
 
But here are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, the Tax Foundation doesn't do those calculations for cities, so the Giuliani campaign's 20 percent figure is one they arrived at themselves. Also, as Bill Ahern of the Tax Foundation points out, the statewide tax burden his group calculates includes local taxes that a governor doesn't control.
 
Ahern also warned that tax burden numbers don't tell the whole story. Each person led in different situations. For example, he said, Huckabee was under court order to increase education spending in Arkansas. ""Is that him raising taxes?"" Ahern asked. ""Well, he signed it.""
 
Consider as well, Ahern said, that Romney fought hard to decrease the income tax rate in Massachusetts from 5.3 to 5 percent, but he couldn't persuade the Democrat-controlled legislature to go along with him. ""Any honest reading of the record would show he's a tax cutter,"" Ahern said.
 
The Tax Foundation does not analyze cities, so the Giuliani campaign ran some numbers themselves and came up with the 20 percent decrease in ""tax burden."" Here's the math, from city controller reports: taxes increased from $18.1-billion to $21.7-billion; the nominal gross city product went from $286-billion to $428-billion; so the total taxes as a percentage of gross city product went from 6.33 percent to 5.07, a 19.88 percent decrease.
 
""By some measure, I'm sure they are correct,"" said E.J. McMahon, a senior fellow for tax and budgetary studies at the Manhattan Institute.
 
Under Giuliani's watch, the city tax burden fell to its lowest point in three decades, McMahon said. It's an achievement for which he deserves credit, McMahon said, but not all of it. For example, he said, one of the largest tax cuts of the Giuliani era — the elimination of a 12.5 percent income tax surcharge — was actually opposed by Giuliani.
 
As for federal legislators like Sens. John McCain and Fred Thompson, Giuliani's team discounted them altogether. Neither were executives in a state, city, municipality, county or other government, ""and thus could not deliver tax cuts.""
 
Nachama Soloveichik of the Club for Growth spent months analyzing the candidates' records on taxes. Not an easy task, she said. How do you compare executives like Giuliani to a senator like Thompson? Does he get credit if he voted for a tax cut?
 
There are so many ways to measure budgets, it's hard to get a handle on, Soloveichik said. How do you factor in fees? Nevertheless, the Club for Growth prepared reports on each candidate's record on economic issues.
 
Her conclusion: ""It is clear that Giuliani did successfully push through more tax relief than Romney or Huckabee.""
 
Given the many confirming sources, it's clear Giuliani has a strong record on tax cutting. However, his claim of delivering ""more tax relief than the other Republicans combined"" is next to impossible to accurately judge, so we rate the statement in Giuliani's ad Mostly True.

Campaign is ankle-deep in lobbyists
","At a news conference at a Staples store in Columbia, S.C., Mitt Romney got into an argument with an Associated Press reporter over his ties to lobbyists.
 
""I don't have lobbyists running my campaign,"" said Romney.
 
AP reporter Glen Johnson challenged the statement and noted that one of Romney's top advisers is Ron Kaufman, a prominent Washington lobbyist.
 
But Romney insisted that neither Kaufman nor any other lobbyists were ""running"" his campaign because they were not paid for their work.
 
""Ron is a wonderful friend and adviser. He's not paid. He's an adviser, like many others. But I do not have lobbyists running my campaign,"" Romney said. He added that Kaufman did not attend the campaign's regular strategy sessions.
 
Johnson kept challenging Romney, noting that Kaufman had traveled on the campaign plane and then he got Romney to acknowledge that Kaufman had provided advice during strategy sessions for debates.
 
To examine the truth of Romney's statement, let's first address his point that you must be a paid staffer to be ""running"" the campaign.
 
Because of the dynamic nature of a political race and the uneven flow of money, campaigns routinely rely on volunteers to play key roles. So it's common for unpaid professionals to be involved in tasks such as helping with strategy, organizing volunteers and acting as a spokesman. Indeed, lobbyists Barbara Comstock and Al Cardenas have acted as media spokesmen for Romney, carrying out the same task as campaign aides who happened to receive paychecks.
 
So we don't accept the idea that you must be on the payroll to be involved in ""running"" the campaign.
 
And there's no question that some key people in the Romney campaign are well-connected lobbyists:
 
• Kaufman, a senior adviser to Romney, is chairman of Dutko Worldwide, which has lobbied for American Pacific Corp., American Trans Air, Amgen, AT&T; – and that's just some of the As.
 
• Ben Ginsberg, the campaign's national counsel, is a partner in the firm Patton Boggs, a large lobbying firm that has represented Kaiser Aluminum, Lucent Technologies, the Venetian Casino Resort and many others. His bio on the firm's Web site boasts that ""Mr. Ginsberg represents a variety of clients on Capitol Hill on a wide range of issues including appropriations, trade, broadcasting and health care.""
 
• Cardenas is chairman of the Romney Hispanic Steering Committee, a finance co-chairman for the campaign and a frequent spokesman for Romney. He is a partner in Tew Cardenas, a lobbying firm with offices in Washington, Miami and Tallahassee. Records show he has lobbied for Progress Energy, Bell South, the Florida Association of Realtors and the Recreational Fishing Alliance, among others. His Web site boasts that ""He has been named as one of Washington, D.C.'s top lobbyists by

The Hill

newspaper.""
 
• Comstock, an adviser and frequent spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, is a founding partner of Comstock Corallo, which has lobbied for the Hearst Corp. and the National Association of Broadcasters.
 
• Vin Weber, the Romney campaign's policy chairman, is considered one of Washington's premier lobbyists. He is chief executive of Clark & Weinstock, which has represented Microsoft, Pfizer, Texas Instruments, General Electric and many others.
 
During the standoff in the Staples, Romney said, ""I don't have lobbyists at my elbows that are arguing for one industry or another industry.""
 
They may not be at his elbows, but his campaign sure looks ankle-deep in them. And so we find his claim to be False.

Exelon staff supports Obama
","When candidates debate in Nevada, you can bet Yucca Mountain will be mentioned. And Hillary Clinton had her facts in order during a Jan. 15, 2008, debate in Las Vegas.
 
Yucca Mountain is the proposed site for a controversial proposal to store much of the nation's nuclear waste in one place. Predictably, most Nevadans oppose this. The original opening date for the site was in 1998, but opposition has prevented the project from going forward and its fate is unclear.
 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is a powerful opponent. Both Clinton and Obama have urged that the project be shelved.
 
A prominent supporter of Yucca Mountain, though, is Exelon Corp., an electric utility based in Chicago.
 
Exelon operates the largest nuclear fleet (17 reactors) in the United States and the third-largest commercial nuclear fleet in the world, according to Exelon's Web site.
 
In a speech to nuclear energy executives in May 2007, Exelon CEO John Rowe said permanent disposal at Yucca Mountain or a similar facility remains ""a long-term imperative"" for the industry, even while he acknowledged it would not happen soon.
 
We asked a spokesman for Exelon if they've spent ""millions"" promoting Yucca Mountain. We were told they don't track their spending by project. Public records, though, indicate the company has spent more than $10-million on lobbyists between 2002 and 2007, with Yucca Mountain listed among its top issues. That doesn't count previous years; the Yucca Mountain project has been debated for more than 20 years.
 
Meanwhile, campaign finance records confirm Exelon is one of Obama's top contributors. The Center for Responsive Politics found that Exelon employees were his sixth-largest corporate donor group. (No. 1 was Goldman Sachs.)
 
The Obama campaign points to several mitigating factors: Obama opposes Yucca Mountain. Exelon is one of the largest companies and employers in Obama's hometown of Chicago. Obama has sponsored legislation specifically targeting Exelon after unplanned waste releases in Illinois. Obama has not accepted any money from Exelon lobbyists or Exelon's political action committee; rather, the contributions are from people who work at Exelon.
 
Of all these points, it's the last we find most compelling. Obama is not taking money from Exelon as a corporate entity or PAC, rather he's accepting contributions from Exelon executives and employees. (Clinton, by contrast, accepts federal PAC money, though she hasn't accepted any from Exelon.) It's a small but real difference, so we rate her claim on Obama's ties to Exelon to be Mostly True.

"['National', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
Strong supporter? Yes. The only fan? No.
","In a television advertisement aimed directly at Florida voters, Rudy Giuliani tried to differentiate himself from the crowded Republican field.
 
""And he's the only candidate who will fight for a national catastrophe fund to reduce insurance rates,"" says an announcer during the spot, which debuted Jan. 16, 2008.
 
The topic is a right of passage for presidential hopefuls who visit Florida because it's an issue on the minds of many homeowners hit with rising insurance costs. It's also a political calculation: A major proponent of the fund is Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, a much-sought endorsement.
 
It's true, Giuliani is a strong supporter — the strongest in the GOP field. But other candidates have also expressed support, or at least an open mind.
 
Giuliani aside, the other Republican candidates want to see the fine print first. On a spectrum — from supportive to skeptical — this is how they appear to fall: Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Fred Thompson. Ron Paul and Duncan Hunter go unranked because they haven't spoken about it.
 
Florida political reporters have asked this question to just about every candidate. For your consideration, below are their full statements to the question of whether they support a national catastrophe fund:
 
• Giuliani, at a speech to Florida lawmakers in Tallahassee in April 2007: ""... I think it is a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea not just for Florida, it's a very good idea for the whole country. We all need it. You need it for hurricanes, California needs it for earthquakes, somebody else needs it for tornadoes. New York needs it for ice storms and for hurricanes. ... The parts of the country that think it only helps Florida, I think are missing all the other natural catastrophes and disasters and maybe they are not hurricanes, but they are all the other things I mentioned.""
 
• McCain, during a September 2007 interview with the

St. Petersburg Times:

""If people are going to build homes where hurricanes hit, they have to assume a great part of that liability. We don't have that many hurricanes that hit Arizona, as you know. We need to all work together and see if the present unacceptable situation can be remedied, and if that requires some federal action, I'm for it — but not just insuring anybody for any circumstance. I'm not going to do that. I would not support such a thing.""
 
• Romney from a town hall forum in Orange Park in September 2007: "" ... I would devote energy and time to understanding why it is that the private insurers are not providing insurance to people who live along the coastline or in hazardous areas. If we need federal support of some kind, that's something I'm open to. But I certainly want to talk to the insurers to understand: do they have capital sufficient for this responsibility; if not, why not? What role could the government play? But I'm not going to at this stage give a final answer to that. It's something that I would make a priority in my administration: to identify the needs of homeowners in places which are high-risk areas.""
 
• Huckabee, during a May 2007 interview with the

Times:

He said he was receptive but rebuilding people's beach homes doesn't appeal to him. Still, he said, ""I come from a state that's prone to tornadoes and floods. I understand how devastating it can be, so I'm very sympathetic.""
 
• Thompson during an September 2007 interview with the

Times:

""No, I don't know enough about it yet. I know that it's an issue, I know that it's being talked about. That's one of the things I want to talk to people about while I'm down here, make sure I understand what's being proposed. But I'll give it serious consideration ..."" (Campaign spokesman Jeff Sadosky added in a Jan. 16, 2008, interview that Thompson believes a fund ""is something worth looking at"" but he also wants to explore the idea of a ""regional compact."")
 
• Paul, the congressman from Texas, hasn't commented directly on the issue.
 
• Duncan Hunter, the congressman from California, has not commented on the issue directly.
 
So when an announcer says Giuliani is ""the only candidate who will fight for"" a national fund, he has a case. He pledges to be a strong advocate, unlike the other candidates. But some others in the field are open to a federal role in securing homeowner insurance in high-risk areas, so we rate his claim Mostly True.

'Songbird John' McCain? No evidence McCain helped enemy in Vietnam
","In an echo of the attacks from the 2000 South Carolina primary that dealt a critical blow to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, a new flyer says the Arizona senator is a traitor. It says that when he was a POW, McCain was a ""Hanoi Hilton songbird"" who collaborated with the enemy. But it provides scant evidence to back up this claim and it is strongly contradicted by many other accounts reviewed by PolitiFact: interviews with other POWs, an author who has written a McCain biography and the senator's own accounts. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! Robert Timberg, author of  John McCain: An American Odyssey  , who has interviewed many POWs who served with McCain, said there's no evidence that he ever collaborated with the North Vietnamese. ""I've never known of any occasion in which Sen. McCain provided the North Vietnamese with anything of value,"" Timberg said. The flyer was sent to about 80 media organizations in South Carolina and is posted on the group's  Web site.  The flyer probably would have been ignored, but the McCain campaign issued a statement calling it ""a vicious attack."" The flyer has a caricature of a surly-looking McCain in a prison cell under the words, ""Hanoi Hilton Songbird."" The second page is headlined ""FACT SHEET: Military Record of John Sidney McCain III"" and it begins with some accurate biographical information. The flyer contains 1 pages of criticisms of McCain, but only a few support the accusation that he was helping the enemy: • That he told his captors ""Okay, I'll give you military information if you will take me to the hospital."" • That the Hanoi news media reported he had given information about his flight, rescue ships and the order of U.S. attacks. • That he broke the military code because he answered questions from a Spanish psychiatrist who had apparently been cooperating with the North Vietnamese. There is some truth to these claims, but collectively they do not prove McCain was involved in ""collaborations with the enemy,"" as the flyer alleges. In his memoir  Faith of My Fathers,  McCain says that he initially offered the information because he was badly injured and afraid of dying. But, he wrote, ""I didn't intend to keep my word."" When he was later interrogated, McCain gave his ship's name and squadron number and confirmed the target of his failed mission, he wrote. He also gave the names of the Green Bay Packers' offensive line and said they were members of his squadron. Asked to identify future targets, he mentioned North Vietnamese cities that U.S. planes had already bombed. George ""Bud"" Day and Orson Swindle, fellow POWs, told PolitiFact that POWs sometimes were forced to talk when they were tortured, but they tried to tell lies to mislead their captors. ""We were all tortured and we wrote confessions under the pressure of torture,"" said Swindle, who was a cellmate with McCain and is active in his campaign. ""John McCain never collaborated with the enemy. He, like every one of us, submitted to severe torture. John McCain did nothing dishonorable. He was heroic."" At one point, McCain broke down and signed a confession. But Timberg, the biographer, said McCain deliberately used misspellings, grammatical errors and Communist jargon to show he was writing under duress: ""I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life . . . "" Day, a Medal of Honor winner who also is supporting McCain's campaign, said the flyer is ""the most outrageous f------ lie I've ever heard."" The man behind the flyer is Gerard ""Jerry"" W. Kiley, 61, of Garnerville, N.Y., who says he served in Vietnam for about a year. He describes his group as a one-man operation unaffiliated with any political party or campaign. He says he opposes McCain because of the senator's efforts to normalize relations with the Vietnamese communist government and because, in his view, McCain has helped the U.S. government keep information about POWs classified. ""John McCain has made sure the information concerning the lives of Americans we clearly abandoned after the war remain in government files 40 years later,"" he says. He teamed with political activist Ted Sampley of North Carolina to distribute the fliers to South Carolina media outlets this month. Sampley did not respond to requests for comment. Sampley also is a longtime McCain opponent. In 2000, he gained attention when he called McCain a ""Manchurian candidate"" on his Web site and said that he was an agent of the Vietnamese. In 1993, Sampley was convicted of misdemeanor assault and sentenced to 180 days' probation for attacking a McCain aide, according to a 2004 article in the  New York Times.  McCain is not the first politician to draw the men's ire. In 2004, they formed Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry. Kiley has twice interrupted events featuring Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, forcing an American flag in his hand on one occasion and throwing red wine at him on another, according to a Secret Service agent who later arrested Kiley. He admits he threw the wine, but he was later acquitted in federal court of threatening Khai. Kiley says he bases his most damning charges against McCain — that McCain gave information about the schedule of U.S. attacks in Vietnam in 1967, the year his plane was shot down and McCain was captured — on the word of Earl Hopper, a retired Army colonel. In an interview, Hopper's wife, Patty, said that Hopper wasn't able to address the charges over the phone because of poor hearing. She said that Hopper has long been involved in the POW movement and that Earl Hopper's son, Earl Jr., is missing in action in Vietnam. She cited as evidence for Hopper's charges a 1973 article by McCain that ran in  U.S. News and World Report  and what she said were ""declassified U.S. military documents"" she claimed to possess describing McCain's collaboration. Patty Hopper said she was away from her Arizona home and could not fax those documents. But the 1973 article does not back up the charges made in the flyer. It provides the same basic account as McCain's book, corroborated by Timberg's book, which was based on interviews with many POWs. Timberg, Day and Swindle noted that McCain, the son of a Navy admiral, was offered an early release from the prison but refused so that he could adhere to the military's code of conduct. Timberg said he was perplexed by the allegations. ""Why do they hate him? There can be lots of issues you disagree with him about. But why try to destroy him?"" Because of the seriousness of the charge, the utter absence of evidence and the clear intention to harm McCain just days before a critical Republican primary, we find this claim to be Pants on Fire wrong.",/factchecks/2008/jan/17/vietnam-veterans-against-john-mccain/no-evidence-mccain-was-a-traitor/
"['National', 'Military', 'Barack Obama']","
His bill was more narrow
","During the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Jan. 15, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama complained about ""callousness"" for wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
 
""I went to Walter Reed to talk to the wounded warriors who had come back to discover that they were still paying for their meals and their phone calls while in Walter Reed, while rehabbing, which I could not believe,"" Obama said, referring to his April 2005 visit to the Washington, D.C., hospital. ""And I was able to gain the cooperation of a Republican-controlled Senate at the time and pass a bill that would eliminate that.""
 
Obama is correct that his bill passed, but he gives the impression its scope was broader than it really was.
 
It was actually Beverly Young, the wife of U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young of Indian Shores, Fla., who two years earlier called attention to the meal rules at Walter Reed. In the summer of 2003, she learned that the government was requiring wounded soldiers who were staying in the hospital to reimburse the government $8.10 per day for their food. The rule was based on a philosophy that soldiers would be double-dipping if they ate food at the hospital and got to pocket the $8.10.
 
She and Rep. Young raised a fuss about the rule and said it was wrong to charge wounded soldiers for hospital food. Rep. Young said it was especially silly to charge because ""the food probably isn't that good.""
 
The Youngs paid a $210 bill on behalf of Marine Staff Sgt. Bill Murwin, the first case the Youngs heard about, and Rep. Young introduced a bill to permanently end the rule. It passed in October 2003.
 
Young's law applied to inpatient care at Walter Reed. In January 2005, the month that Obama joined the Senate, Salon.com published an article that said soldiers who were visiting Walter Reed for outpatient care were also being required to pay for their meals.
 
About four months later, Obama visited Walter Reed and then introduced an amendment to a defense bill that expanded the definition of ""hospitalized"" soldiers to include those undergoing medical recuperation and therapy. Obama noted that the number of soldiers affected was ""small"" — about 4,000.
 
His amendment passed the Senate in May 2005 with bipartisan support: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was one of the co-sponsors and it passed when Republicans controlled Congress. The meal portion was included in a final conference report that passed both chambers that month.
 
Obama is correct that his bill passed and that it had Republican support. But at the Las Vegas debate, he gave the impression that its scope was broader than it was. Indeed, the main problem had been fixed two years earlier. So we find his statement Half True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'John McCain']","
More in the $8-billion range
","
One reason John McCain is so unpopular with fellow senators is his relentless, high-volume crusade against pork — specifically the earmarks for local projects that lawmakers are fond of tucking into annual congressional spending bills.
 
So it was hardly surprising that McCain chose to showcase his fiscally conservative credentials in the days before the Michigan primary by assailing Democratic congressional leaders for loading the year-end fiscal 2008 omnibus spending bill with money for local projects.
 
""Congress just passed another huge, pork-filled spending bill. The Democrats allowed less than a day to read all 3,400 pages and stuffed it with nearly 10,000 earmarks costing about $10-billion dollars,"" McCain said in remarks delivered to the Americans for Prosperity Michigan summit in a Detroit suburb.
 
The bill McCain cites is the $555-billion package of 11 unfinished spending bills that Congress bundled together and cleared in a crush of last-minute business in mid-December. While the general thrust of McCain's remarks are correct, he's exaggerating some facts to drive home his point.
 
It's technically correct that the Senate had less than a day to read the final version of the legislation; 10 hours and 11 minutes elapsed between when the House voted on a rule adding 10 spending bills to the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill the evening of Dec. 17 and when the Senate first voted on the package the next afternoon. But while McCain's point is well taken, it's not at all uncommon for major legislation to be completed and turned around on short notice at the end of a congressional session before lawmakers can read it line-by-line. Frequently, members and senators vote with the understanding their party leaders have negotiated or signed off on the most significant details.
 
The bill itself was 613 pages — hardly light reading, but nowhere near the 3,400 pages McCain depicts. In fairness, McCain might have been referring to accompanying conference reports and other documents that detail House-Senate negotiations on the package.
 
McCain also appears to be leaning on the scale in detailing the number of earmarked projects. A preliminary analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense, which makes a practice of closely tracking earmarks, puts the number of projects in the package at 8,983 worth $7.4-billion. If one adds a fiscal 2008 defense spending bill that Congress passed as a stand-alone measure, the total grows to 11,144 earmarks worth $15.3-billion. The group says it's still scouring conference reports and other documents to establish a final number.
 
But it's misleading to blame the pork just on Democrats. The Republicans learned how to pack the pork when they ran Congress and they got plenty in this bill, too.
 
Though earmarking remains hugely popular, lawmakers are being more discreet about their requests due to a new lobbying and disclosure law that changed Senate rules. It requires that all earmarks and their sponsors, including those in conference reports, be identified on the Internet at least 48 hours before the Senate votes. Earmarks added in conference — known as airdropped provisions — can be challenged through points of order.
 
Watchdog groups report Democrats have tried to make good on a pledge they made upon assuming control of Congress to limit the number of earmark-funded projects. Not surprisingly, McCain fails to note that his own party turned the appropriations process into a veritable earmark mill during the GOP's 12 years in power.
 
""There are a lot of self-proclaimed fiscally conservative Republicans who take earmarks,"" said Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, adding that McCain has walked his talk by refraining from making requests for local projects.
 
The gist of his charge is true about spending, but his numbers are off and it's misleading to suggest all the parochial spending is being done by Democrats. When we add it up, we get Half-True.

No, it was a boon to renewable fuel industry
","
Hillary Clinton may want some of the comments she made in Vegas to stay in Vegas.
 
During a televised MSNBC debate, the New York senator, who voted against the Energy Policy Act of 2005, called the law a ""Dick Cheney lobbyist energy bill"" that gave enormous tax breaks to the oil and gas industry. As president, Clinton said she would invest $50-billion in clean, renewable energy.
 
""So that 2005 energy bill was a big step backwards on the path to clean, renewable energy,"" said Clinton. ""That's why I voted against it. That's why I'm standing for the proposition — let's take away the giveaways that were given to gas and oil, put them to work on solar and wind and geothermal and biofuels and all of the rest that we need for a new energy future.""
 
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, who voted for the bill in 2005, had a different view.
 
""Well, the reason I voted for it was because it was the single largest investment in clean energy — solar, wind, biodiesel — that we had ever seen,"" Obama said.
 
While the Energy Policy Act of 2005 did give the oil and gas industry tax breaks and incentives to boost production, the law also mandated 7.5-billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels to be blended into gasoline by 2012 — the largest such mandate ever enacted and one widely credited with sparking an ethanol plant construction boom across the Midwest. The law also funneled hundreds of millions of dollars toward biomass research and the production of biofuels derived from the leaves, stems and stalks of a plant rather than corn kernels used to make ethanol.
 
""It obviously wasn't (a step backward),"" said Matt Hartwig, spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association. ""It created a meaningful market for renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.""
 
Clinton's comments are particularly interesting given that she returned to Washington from the campaign trail last month to vote for the passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act. The 2007 energy law raises fuel economy standards for the first time in 32 years and requires production of billions of gallons more ethanol and biofuel.
 
But Senate Democrats, facing a veto threat from the White House and opposition from oil-state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, did not succeed in rolling back oil and gas industry tax breaks to pay for $21.5-billion in incentives for alternative energies such as solar and wind. Obama voted for the bill, too.
 
Rolling back tax breaks for the oil and gas industry in this Congress, and with this administration, is as likely as winning big in Vegas. Clinton's best chance will come if and when she moves into the Oval Office. And despite being right when it comes to the 2005 Energy Policy Act's treatment of the oil and gas industry, we find her assessment of its impact on renewable energy False.

Obama rakes it in from small donors
","Barack Obama said in a debate that he has raised the most money from small donors.
 
For this question, we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics.
 
The center found that, based on available data, Obama has raised the most money from small donors, said spokesman Massie Ritsch.
 
Small donors are defined as people who donate less than $200; the Federal Election Commission requires candidates to itemize contributions from people who give more than that. Smaller donations get reported as a lump sum, and Obama has reported the most money raised under this category. (The donation limit for any individual donor is $2,300 per candidate.)
 
An important caveat: The center has only analyzed data compiled through Sept. 30, 2007, the last deadline for campaign finance data. Another report is due about two weeks from this writing, on Jan. 31, 2008. It's possible, though not likely, that fundraising during the last quarter of the year could change this analysis.
 
Here are the totals for individual donors calculated by the center so far, excluding PAC contributions and transfers from other accounts:
 
* Obama: $79.2-million total, $19.8-million small;
 
* Clinton: $79.6-million total, $10.4-million small;
 
* Edwards $30.1-million total, $8.4-million small.
 
Based on the center's analysis, we find Barack Obama's claim that he gets the most money from small donors to be True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Hillary Clinton']","
That's no typo, 100 years
","To highlight the different approaches between Democrats and Republicans on keeping troops in Iraq, Sen. Hillary Clinton pointed to remarks Sen. John McCain made in the days before the New Hampshire primary that indicated his support for a prolonged military commitment in the region. Clinton has said that, if elected, one of her first official actions would be to direct military leaders to draft a viable plan to begin a phased withdrawal within 60 days. Her goal is to have most troops out of Iraq by the end of 2013.
 
Clinton's account of McCain's position rings true. The Arizona senator was an enthusiastic supporter of President Bush's surge and opposes a timetable for troop withdrawal. He was somewhat glib about the issue during a Jan. 3, 2008, town hall meeting in Derry, N.H. When a voter asking a question made the point that President Bush raised the possibility American troops would be in Iraq for 50 years, McCain interrupted by saying, ""maybe 100.""
 
McCain went on to note the United States has maintained a military presence for decades in such places as Japan and South Korea. He said he supported such a commitment in a global hot spot like Iraq where al-Qaida continues to wield influence and recruit followers — as long as there aren't American casualties.
 
McCain expanded on those thoughts three days later during an appearance on NBC's

Meet the Press,

asserting that most Americans share his views. ""We have a base in Turkey. We have a base in Japan, Germany. We've had bases there. It's not American presence that bothers the American people, it's American casualties,"" McCain said. ""And if Americans are safe wherever they are in the world, Americans — the American people don't mind that. So what I believe we can achieve is a reduction in casualties to the point where the Iraqis are doing the fighting and dying, we're supporting them, and, over time, then it'll be the relation between the two countries.""
 
McCain skirted questions about what kind of troop levels are acceptable in coming decades.
 
Because McCain unabashedly entertains the possibility of an open-ended military commitment in Iraq — with little more than a proviso that American personnel should not come in harm's way — we rule Clinton's statement True.

that she gets the most money from the health industry, pharmaceutical companies, health insurance companies and defense companies. He was mostly right on those claims.
 
At the Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Edwards charged Clinton with raising the most money from the oil and gas industry.
 
But Edwards is a bit off here. Clinton is No. 1 among Democrats, according to the latest data analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics.
 
Analyzing contributions from political action committees and individuals filed through Sept. 30, 2007, the center found the following totals from oil and gas companies:

"['Immigration', 'National', 'John McCain']","
And it's no free ride
","Sen. John McCain's immigration record has been a red flag for Republican primary voters both because it proposes granting legal status to most of the estimated 12-million illegal immigrants in the country and because McCain collaborated with liberal icon Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in developing it.
 
During a Republican debate on Jan. 5, 2008, McCain accused Mitt Romney of mischaracterizing the plan by describing it as amnesty — defined as a general pardon of offenders by a government.
 
""The fact is it's not amnesty,"" McCain said. ""And for you to describe it as you do in the attack ads, my friend, you can spend your whole fortune on these attack ads, but it still won't be true.""
 
Now, understand that the word amnesty is freighted with implications that go beyond immigration policy. Throughout the immigration debate in Congress in recent years, opponents have routinely labeled as ""amnesty"" any provision that would give illegal immigrants a path to legal status. Many voters interpret it as giving criminals the equivalent of a ""Get Out of Jail"" card instead of diligently enforcing the law.
 
Experts say its use here is designed to raise questions about whether McCain is willing to let rules slide and give lawbreakers access to social services and, more broadly, the American dream.
 
""Amnesty means, 'He's not for America in the same way I am' … They're trying to reach the people who believe in America for Americans. It's almost a code word for something else: fear and uncertainty about the economy, the war, where America is in the world,"" said Audrey Singer, an immigration expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 
Back to McCain's charge that the immigration overhaul plan he and Kennedy introduced in 2006 is not amnesty: He's got a strong point, given the hurdles that plan contains.
 
It would have required illegal immigrants to apply for a six-year conditional nonimmigrant visa. They then could apply for legal permanent residence — a green card — on the condition that they pay $1,000 in fines, pay all back taxes, pass a criminal background check, stay employed and demonstrate an effort to learn English and civics. They would also pay a $1,000 application fee.
 
Because a green card holder must wait five years to apply for citizenship, this plan would make illegal workers eligible for citizenship 11 years after applying for the visa. Arlen Specter, senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and some other plan supporters have characterized the steps as ""gates"" that must be passed through before an illegal immigrant can qualify for citizenship.
 
This is in contrast to what President Ronald Reagan did in 1986, when he signed an immigration reform bill that legalized the status of 1.7-million people. In checking a previous claim on that plan, we found it did qualify as

amnesty.

 
So, while McCain is more receptive to giving undocumented workers a path to citizenship than most of his GOP rivals, the many hurdles included in his plan do not qualify as a general pardon. We rule his statement True.

There are a few blips on the record
","Responding to a question about the Bush tax cuts, Sen. John McCain boldly touted a perfect record against wasteful pork barrel spending at a Jan. 6, 2008, debate in New Hampshire.
 
""... If we're going to restore the confidence of the American people and our Republican base first, we're going to have to cut the spending, we're going to have to eliminate the pork barrel and wasteful spending,"" McCain said.
 
""And I'm proud to tell you, Chris, in 24 years as a member of Congress, I have never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork barrel project for my state and I guarantee you I'll veto those (spending) bills.""
 
McCain definitely holds claim to the title of pork-fighter, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. The Washington-based group watches for wasteful spending and has consistently lauded McCain as a champion of its causes, honoring him with its ""Treasury Guardians"" award.
 
But holding a perfect record during a quarter-century of congressional spending isn't easy. Even a cursory review shows a few blips in his background:
 
• In 2006, McCain co-sponsored with fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl a bill that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona named in honor of William Rehnquist, the former U.S. Supreme Court chief justice. The project died in committee.
 
• In 2003, he advocated and won authorization to buy property to create a buffer zone around Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, a project requested by the Air Force but not the president.
 
• In 1992, he wrote a letter to the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requesting that the ""EPA either reprogram $5-million out of existing funds or earmark the amount from an appropriate account"" for a wastewater project in Nogales, Ariz., according to documents obtained by the

Washington Post.

The EPA administrator, William K. Reilly, said it wasn't doable.
 
Whether these projects constitute earmarked pork depends on how you look at the issue. In its simplest form, pork barrel spending is a project designed to benefit a particular constituency, and an earmark is the designation of funds for a specific purpose.
 
""I find items that would certainly look like parochial spending to many folks but it's hard to call them earmarks in the traditional sense of the definition,"" said Pete Sepp, a spokesman with the National Taxpayers Union.
 
McCain has his own more nuanced definition, as do the various groups that track wasteful spending by Congress.
 
""I take the approach that Justice Potter Stewart did in the Supreme Court decision about pornography,"" said Steve Ellis, with Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""I can't quite define it but I know it when I see it.""
 
Ellis said McCain has a clear position against earmarks during his career. ""None of those really rise to the traditional, largely accepted definition of earmarks,"" he said. ""I think he's on pretty firm ground.""
 
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers defined congressional earmarks as ""the practice of legislators designating the appropriation of money to specific unauthorized projects without the scrutiny of the congressional authorization process,"" he wrote in an e-mail.
 
McCain's campaign points to the Rehnquist Center as the standard for how individual appropriations should be requested: stand-alone legislation that gets congressional study. ""The bill did not pass, John McCain did not seek an earmarked appropriation for the center and the result was no funding for this center,"" Rogers said.
 
With the Air Force base, McCain's camp said he argued for the authorization but the appropriations committee funded it.
 
Rogers said the wastewater facility McCain sought was in the president's fiscal year 1993 budget. When the administrator said the agency couldn't meet the need from existing funds, Rogers added, the senator did not seek an earmark in an appropriations bill.
 
However, McCain did write a letter with Kyl in October 2007 asking the EPA to include the money in its budget request. Again the EPA left it out, so Kyl — not McCain — put an earmark in the 2008 omnibus spending bill.
 
""Senator McCain has been a consistent opponent of unauthorized congressional earmarks and pork-barrel spending,"" Rogers concluded.
 
Such an assertion seems to rely heavily on interpretation — which runs counter to McCain's unequivocal statement at the debate.
 
""To the average person on the outside world, there might not be much of a difference with these things,"" Sepp said.
 
Indeed, we agree with Sepp that the narrow Washington definition of ""earmark"" is less important than the impression McCain has left. It appears he was seeking pork barrel projects for Arizona, which puts a few blemishes on an otherwise pure record against pork. And so while we find there is no question that McCain has been a leading congressional voice against pork, these three examples conflict with his bold claim. So we find that claim False.

Dad was a dinosaur hunter
","Republican Mitt Romney, speaking from the campaign trail in Michigan, recalled his father's legacy as the owner of American Motors Corp. and the car that changed the industry.
 
""But, you see, when I was growing up, the fact that we won the mileage championship year after year with the Rambler was a source of great pride for my dad,"" Romney said during an interview on the CBS

Early Show

. ""He used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs.""
 
Romney used a similar line in February 2007 when he launched his presidential campaign in Michigan, where he was born. It's the kind of claim that could, in our current energy climate, be dismissed as rewritten history. Campaigning against gas-guzzling cars in the '50s? Really?
 
And yet, this is not a case of inflated exuberance. George Romney took the helm at American Motors in 1954 and helped rescue the company from near financial ruin.
 
He succeeded in large part on the sales of the Rambler, the first American compact car. In doing so, he had to sell the concept and value of a compact car. In 1958, he traveled 700,000 miles in his crusade against what he called ""gas-guzzling dinosaurs,"" a reference to the large cars produced by Detroit's Big Three automakers.
 
""Who wants to have a gas-guzzling dinosaur in his garage?"" he told

Time

magazine in 1959, for a cover article that labeled George Romney ""The Dinosaur Hunter.""
 
He is credited with coining the term, even though other automakers cast doubts on just how economical the Rambler really was. Still, the nickname, and the George Romney legend, took hold. It appeared in prominent obituaries after his death July 26, 1995.
 
His youngest son, Mitt, gets it right.

Bill takes Obama out of context
","In the heat of the campaign for New Hampshire — a battle Hillary Clinton ultimately won — Bill Clinton attacked Barack Obama, saying the media hasn't thoroughly vetted Obama's record of opposing the war:
 
""It is wrong that Senator Obama got to go through 15 debates trumpeting his superior judgment and how he had been against the war in every year, enumerating the years — and never got asked one time, not once, 'Well, how could you say that, when you said in 2004 you didn't know how you would have voted on the resolution, you said in 2004 there was no difference between you and George Bush on the war. And you took that speech you're now running on off your Web site in 2004 and there's no difference in your voting record and Hillary's ever since?' Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen.""
 
Clinton's argument is that Obama's opposition to the war hasn't been consistent. Interestingly, this is similar to the argument the Republican National Committee made in September 2007 against Obama and Hillary Clinton, and we checked the RNC's allegations

here

.
 
We also checked Obama's statement, ""I opposed the war in 2002. I opposed the war in 2003. I opposed it in 2004 and 2005 and 2006."" We found that to be true. (Check it out

here

.) (Hey, Bill, aren't you reading PolitiFact?)
 
The former president and his wife have been on the offensive against Obama, trying to poke holes in his long opposition to the war. That opposition has thus far appeared to be an advantage for Obama because Hillary Clinton voted for the war authorization.
In this case, Bill Clinton is citing Obama's statement, taken from a

Chicago Tribune

interview on the eve of the 2004 Democratic convention to nominate John Kerry for president.
 
""On Iraq, on paper, there's not as much difference, I think, between the Bush administration and a Kerry administration as there would have been a year ago,"" Obama said. ""There's not much of a difference between my position and George Bush's position at this stage."" The ""at this stage"" is an important caveat, one Bill Clinton left out.
 
Taking the interview in its entirety, it's clear Obama is speaking about the need to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the Iraq invasion once it had commenced.
 
""How do you stabilize a country that is made up of three different religious and in some cases ethnic groups with a minimal loss of life and minimum burden to the taxpayers?"" Obama said later in the interview.
 
His overall sentiment seems to be now that the war has started, the United States should do the best job it can to steer Iraq toward stability. This position is not the same thing as condoning the invasion after the fact.
 
On the question of Obama saying his position on the war is similar to George W. Bush's, we find that Bill Clinton is quoting the essence of Obama's statement, but leaving out important context. We find his statement to be Half True. (For more on Clinton's comments and reaction to them, see our story

"['National', 'Mike Huckabee']","
The roads are better - but still rank near the bottom
 ","
Under fire for raising taxes, Mike Huckabee is citing benefits of the extra tax money: school improvements, health care and better roads.
 
At a debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Jan. 10, 2008, Huckabee repeated a claim he has made several times about how much Arkansas' roads improved.
 
""I took on the worst road system in the country, according to

Trucker's

magazine,"" Huckabee said. ""When I left, they said it was the most improved road system in the country.""
 
We find Huckabee glosses over some details but is right that his state made big improvements.
 
First, we couldn't find such an article in ""Trucker's magazine"" ... because we couldn't find a magazine by that name. It's clear he is referring to an annual survey done by

Overdrive

magazine (""The voice of the American trucker""), which asks truck drivers to name the best and worst highways.
 
When Huckabee took office in 1996,

Overdrive's

survey said Arkansas' roads were fifth worst in the United States. The state kept slipping in the rankings and by 2000 it was indeed the worst in the nation.
 
The shoddy highways persuaded the Arkansas Legislature to raise gasoline and diesel taxes in 1999, which paid for major repairs to the state's road network.
 
That helped.
 
By 2004, Arkansas was rated the state with the most improved roads in

Overdrive's

annual survey.
 
In 2006, Huckabee's last full year in office,

Overdrive

did not do overall rankings for the states, so it's a stretch for him to say they were most improved ""when I left."" However, the truckers that year listed Interstate 40 in Arkansas as the most improved road in the nation. Interstate 30 in Arkansas was No. 4 on the list.
 
Yet despite the improvement that occurred under Huckabee, the state's roads still rate near the bottom overall.
 
In the January 2008 issue, Arkansas is rated fifth worst – the same as when Huckabee took office.
 
""They have done a lot of work,"" said Andy Duncan, a senior editor for the magazine. ""Nevertheless, the consensus is that they have a ways to go.""
 
And so while Huckabee is right that the state earned the honor for the most improved roads at one point in his term, it's a stretch to say that was the case when he left office. And Arkansas still lags behind other states. So we rate Huckabee's claim Mostly True.
