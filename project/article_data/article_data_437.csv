Fact-checking claim about vehicle damage, Austin police funding
","Land Commissioner George P. Bush said a video from a parking garage used by state agencies showed more than a dozen vans with busted rear windows on the same night the Austin City Council voted to redirect $150 million in funding from the police department. The council’s recent funding decisions regarding the Austin Police Department have come under fire from state officials, who have threatened to freeze local governments’ property tax revenue if they cut police budgets. Bush said his video highlights the need for police funding and said the city is moving down a dangerous path. ""This was taken tonight in one of the parking garages used by (the Texas General Land Office) and other state agencies in downtown Austin, the same night the City of Austin voted to cut $150 million from (the Austin Police Department),"" he wrote in the tweet. ""The need for police funding is as clear as ever. This is a dangerous path to go down."" Bush did not return a request seeking more information about the video, including whether he recorded the footage himself, whether the incident had been reported and when exactly the damage occurred. Here’s what we know: The parking garage is under the jurisdiction of state law enforcement, not the city police. And the damage to the vehicles was reported five days before the City Council voted on police funding. Let’s dive in. Incident is under investigation The Texas Department of Public Safety is investigating the incident featured in the video on Bush’s Twitter account. Troopers with the agency discovered multiple vehicles with shattered windows during a ""routine early morning garage check"" at a parking garage near the Capitol on Aug. 8, according to a statement from the agency. The vehicles are owned by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Texas Department of Agriculture and the General Land Office. An ""investigation confirmed 14 vehicles had windows broken with what appears to be a bb or pellet air gun,"" reads the statement. ""At this time, no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing."" The Austin Police Department has no record of any incident that meets the description, and a spokesperson said the garage is under the Department of Public Safety’s jurisdiction. The DPS is responsible for security at the Texas Capitol and the surrounding buildings, according to an overview of its duties published online. ""On September 1, 1991, the Texas Legislature transferred all duties and responsibilities of the Capitol Security Police Division of the State Purchasing and General Services Commission to the Texas Department of Public Safety,"" reads the overview. ""The Capitol Complex includes the State Capitol and grounds, Capitol Extension, State office buildings, State parking lots and garages, and private office buildings and businesses,"" the DPS website reads. Austin City Council Vote The Austin City Council approved the city’s budget for the coming fiscal year during a meeting on Aug. 13. The $4.2 billion budget included about $150 million in planned cuts to the Austin Police Department, which was slated to receive $434 million in the initial budget proposal before the council. Of the $150 million in approved cuts, about $20 million will be immediately removed from the department’s funding by canceling three upcoming cadet classes, reducing overtime costs and pulling money from ""commodities and contractuals."" The money will be redirected to other programs and city departments, including violence prevention efforts and local emergency COVID-19 response. The other $130 million will be moved from the Police Department budget into two transitional funds aimed at moving certain services out from under the umbrella of the police department, including support services, recruiting and traffic enforcement. Our ruling Bush shared a video to his Twitter account purporting to show damage to state-owned vehicles parked at a garage in downtown Austin on the same night the City Council voted to cut funding from the Austin Police Department. While we don’t know for certain when the video was taken, we do know that the damage was discovered by state law enforcement officers at five days before the vote on cuts to the police budget. Plus, Bush’s attempt to connect the damage with the Police Department is misleading, as the parking garage is not within the Austin Police Department’s jurisdiction. The Texas Department of Public Safety discovered the damage and is conducting an investigation. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9E9700>],/factchecks/2020/aug/24/george-p-bush/fact-checking-claim-about-vehicle-damage-austin-po/

Is Cuomo directive to blame for nursing home COVID deaths as HHS official claims?
","Editor’s note, Feb. 16, 2021: In recent weeks, N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has faced increasing scrutiny regarding his handling of information related to covid-related deaths among nursing home residents. A recent report by N.Y. Attorney General Letitia James noted that the death count may be 50% higher than what Cuomo’s administration provided. The attorney general’s estimate includes deaths that occurred after residents were transferred to the hospital, for example, a potential for undercounting that was mentioned in this fact check. The fact check itself focused on a policy issued by Cuomo in March directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having covid-19. As long as they were medically stable, the notice said, it was appropriate to move patients in. Our ruling of Mostly False is unchanged by this new information. That rating was based on evidence that while the introduction of covid-19 positive patients into nursing homes no doubt had an effect on the spread of the coronavirus, Caputo’s statement suggested it was solely responsible. That’s not what the evidence showed, then or now. On the first night of the Democratic National Convention, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was among the first in a weeklong parade of speakers to issue scathing critiques of the Trump administration’s coronavirus response. Cuomo’s criticisms drew a quick reply in a tweet from Michael R. Caputo, an assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. ""Does the #DemConvention know @NYGovCuomo forced nursing homes across NY to take in COVID positive patients and planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers?"" he wrote. It was an easy jab: Cuomo has been dogged by criticism for months over his March advisory directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19. As long as they were medically stable, the notice said, it was appropriate to move patients in. Further, nursing homes were prohibited from requiring that medically stable prospective residents be tested for the virus before they arrived. Between March 25 and May 8, approximately 6,326 COVID-positive patients were admitted to nursing homes, according to a state health department report. While experts say this policy was flawed, is it fair to say that the governor’s directive ""forced"" nursing homes to take patients who were sick with COVID-19? And to what extent did that strategy sow the seeds of disease and death? When we examined the evidence, we found it was less clear cut than the statement makes it seem. The policy likely had an effect, but epidemiologists identified additional factors that fed the problem. What’s more the policy did not ""force"" nursing homes to accept COVID-positive patients. Nursing homes interpreted it this way.  We checked with HHS to find the basis for Caputo’s comment but got no response. As the virus tore through nursing homes, killing dozens at some of them, Cuomo came under withering censure. His administration’s policy, implemented with an eye toward freeing up hospital beds for an onslaught of COVID patients, seemed to disregard the risks to frail and elderly nursing home residents who were especially vulnerable to the disease. According to the COVID Tracking Project, 6,624 people have died of COVID-19 in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in New York, accounting for 26% of the state’s 25,275 COVID deaths. Some say the true number of deaths is much higher because, unlike many states, New York does not count the deaths of former nursing home residents who are transferred to hospitals and die there as nursing home deaths. Cuomo’s explanation for the policy — that he was simply following guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — didn’t cut it. A recent PolitiFact piece examining his claim rated it ""Mostly False."" In May, the governor amended the March order, prohibiting hospitals from discharging patients to nursing homes unless they tested negative for COVID-19. In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when New York was the epicenter and more than a thousand people were being hospitalized daily, there was genuine fear that hospitals would not be able to accommodate the influx of desperately ill patients. Moving people out of the hospitals and into nursing homes was one strategy to help hospitals meet these needs. According to the CDC guidance cited in the earlier PolitiFact story, there were two factors to consider when deciding whether to discharge a patient with COVID-19 to a long-term care facility: whether the patient was medically ready, and whether the facility could implement the recommended infection control procedures to safely care for a patient recovering from the virus. A document from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said nursing homes should accept only patients they were able to care for. Long-standing state guidance is based on the same condition. Still, nursing homes didn’t believe turning away patients with COVID-19 was an option. ""On its face it looked like a requirement,"" said Christopher Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, which represents medical professionals in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. ""The nursing homes we spoke to felt it was a mandate, and a number of them felt they had no choice but to take COVID patients."" While the overarching guidance not to take patients in unless they could be safely cared for may have been clear, nursing homes’ experience was often different, said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long-Term Care Community Coalition, an advocacy group for elderly and disabled people. ""There was little reason for nursing homes to think they should only take in patients if they have the ability to do so safely because those rules are not generally enforced on a regular basis."" Bottom line: State and federal rules didn’t force nursing homes to accept COVID-positive patients, but many of them believed they had no other choice. How much of the blame for the deaths of thousands of people in nursing homes from COVID-19 can be attributed to Cuomo’s March advisory? That is the 6,000-person question. In a July analysis of COVID-19 nursing home deaths, the state concluded that the deadly virus was introduced by nursing home staff members rather than sick patients. It noted that peak nursing home resident mortality from COVID-19 on April 8 preceded the peak influx of COVID patients on April 14. In addition, it found that nearly 1 in 4 nursing home workers — 37,500 people — were infected with the virus between March and early June. Based on these and other factors, the report concluded that the state admissions policy could not have been a driver of nursing home infections or fatalities. Epidemiologists and nursing home advocates beg to differ. ""To say that introducing patients [to nursing homes] who had COVID did not cause problems is ridiculous,"" said Laxton. Calling the study’s approach ""pretty flawed,"" Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at City University of New York School of Public Health, said he didn’t agree with the report’s conclusion that the policy had nothing to do with deaths. Others had the same view. ""I didn’t think they showed data to say [the policy] is not a ‘driver,’"" said Rupak Shivakoti, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. But Gary Holmes, assistant commissioner at the New York State Department of Health, had a different take. Critics of the report, he said, must be deliberately ignoring the rising death tolls in nursing homes in hot spots across the country. ""Public health officials in those states are experiencing (and acknowledging) what NY’s report indicated weeks ago: these facilities are microcosms of the community and transmission is occurring unknowingly by asymptomatic spread among staff members,"" Holmes said, in an email. While public health experts quibbled with the report’s self-serving claim that the governor’s policy wasn’t a factor in COVID-19 nursing home deaths, they nevertheless agreed with the report’s broader conclusion that nursing home staffers as well as visitors, before they were banned, were likely the main drivers of COVID-19 infection and death in nursing homes. ""Based on the timeline of the policy and deaths in the city, it is very unlikely that policy contributed to thousands of deaths,"" said Shivakoti. Infection control is a long-standing problem at nursing homes, Nash said, and the COVID deaths were a basic failure of infection control. That said, ""it’s unclear how many of the deaths the policy might have caused."" Also unclear: how many of the dead were grandmothers and grandfathers. In a tweet, the HHS assistant secretary for public affairs said that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""forced"" nursing homes across the state to admit COVID-positive patients and that this policy fueled the spread of COVID-19 that led to thousands of deaths in the nursing home population. Although nursing homes felt pressure to accept COVID-positive patients, they were not actually forced to do so. State regulations require nursing homes to accept patients only if they can care for them, and they could have refused them on those grounds. In addition, it’s unclear the extent to which the governor’s policy was responsible for nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Infection control is a longstanding problem in nursing homes that predates the pandemic and a report showed peak numbers of nursing home deaths came prior to the peak influx of patients as a result of Cuomo’s advisory. While the introduction of COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes no doubt had an effect on infection spread, Caputo’s statement suggests it was solely responsible. That’s not what the evidence shows. We rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8E4D40>],/factchecks/2020/aug/24/michael-caputo/hhs-official-blames-cuomo-nursing-home-covid-death/

Melania Trump’s $675,000 travel bill was to care for her son, not to get her hair done.
","In the lead-up to Melania Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention, a viral Facebook post portrayed the first lady as an spendthrift wasting taxpayer money.  ""In 3 months, Melania took 21 trips to NY, to get her hair done, at taxpayer cost of $675,000 or $32,143/trip,"" it claimed.  The post cited figures from a Wall Street Journal article, which used military records to show that the first lady took 21 flights between New York Florida, and Washington, D.C., in the first three months of Donald Trump’s presidency. The post accurately claims that the trips cost $675,000 and that American taxpayers footed the bill.  This spending level was far higher than what Trump’s predecessor as first lady racked up. Records obtained by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch revealed that Michelle Obama’s solo travel cost taxpayers an average of $350,000 a year, or about half of what Melania Trump accrued between January and April 2017.  However, the post falsely claims that Melania Trump took these trips ""to get her hair done.""  The first lady’s high travel expenses reflected her unusual living arrangements. For the first three months of the Trump presidency, she commuted between the White House and Trump Tower while her son, Barron, finished out fifth grade in New York.  As the Wall Street Journal notes, there have been no allegations that Melania Trump spent money improperly.  A viral Facebook post claimed that ""Melania took 21 trips to NY, to get her hair done, at taxpayer cost of $675,000 or $32,143/trip"" in a three month period.  Military flight records show that the first lady spent $675,000 on 21 trips between Washington,  Florida and New York.

Donald Trump says Joe Biden can only win by a 'rigged election.' That's wrong in several ways
","President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused the Democrats of using voting by mail as a way to ""rig"" the election. Speaking in Scranton, Pa., hours before his rival Joe Biden formally accepted his nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Trump revived many of his attacks on mail-in voting.  At one point, Trump said, ""So this is just a way they’re trying to steal the election and everybody knows that. Because the only way they’re going to win is by a rigged election,"" he said. When we reached out to the White House, they pointed to mainstream media outlets that have reported that mail delays and late ballots were a problem in some primaries. Trump himself has often pointed to New York as an example.  But these do not constitute evidence that Democrats, or anyone, are rigging the outcome. There are several other reasons that he could lose. For one, he faces the same challenges that any incumbent would face when running amid a pandemic that has killed more than 174,000 Americans and left millions unemployed. Here, we’ll look at more realistic scenarios that undermine Trump’s claim.  A big reason to doubt Trump’s assertion about a rigged presidential election is that the U.S. has a decentralized election system that is largely administered by county or city election officials. States set laws about policies such as early voting hours or voter ID, but it’s local election officials who handle the day-to-day tasks of administering elections such as registering voters, sending ballots to voters’ homes, checking in voters at local precincts, and overseeing the machines at early voting and election day sites.  There are more than 3,000 counties and 10,000 local jurisdictions spread across 50 states and D.C., said Paul Gronke, director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College. Each county produces its own ballots, and even within counties there can be various ballot versions with unique lists of federal, state and local offices, depending upon where a voter lives. Any attempt to rig a national election would pose multiple hurdles. Bar-coded envelopes for these ballots are ""just the first set of hurdles in trying to ‘rig’ an election,"" Gronke said. The next hurdle would be to fake each individual signature so well that it fools verification systems, and that voters don’t notice that someone else has cast their ballot before they did. Data scientists also track the returns closely and have sometimes been able to spot anomalies. A third complication for prospective election riggers is to figure out where to target their rigging efforts. In order to build a sufficient margin in the electoral college, they would have to guess in advance which states could tip the election.  All of this would have to be done in a coordinated but secret way, with hundreds of people willing to risk felonies for the same goal.  While mailed ballots pose a slightly higher risk of voter fraud than voting in person, fraud remains statistically rare. In the five states that have previously used all-mail elections, there have been very low rates of fraud, said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California-Irvine. And most of the time, voting fraud cases tend to be one-off events in local elections, not conspiracies capable of swinging a national election. White House spokesperson Sarah Matthews pointed to media reports showing problems in the primaries associated with the massive increase in voting by mail amid the pandemic, including late ballots. But administrative problems have occurred not just with the voting by mail that Trump often derides but also with long lines at in-person precincts, and these have often been in jurisdictions that tend to vote Democratic.  Using the term election rigging ""connotes some kind of fraud attempt to sabotage the casting of ballots,"" said Wendy Weiser, an elections expert at New York University’s liberal Brennan Center. ""Administrative snafus are a completely different thing."" Fundamentally, the possibility of a Trump loss could stem from political realities, not vote-rigging. ""It will not take a rigged election for Trump to lose, just the ordinary workings of electoral accountability in a democracy,"" said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. As of now, at least, Trump looks like an underdog for reelection, based on past history. ""When an incumbent president is running for a second term, the election is always largely a referendum on the president’s record during his first term,"" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Gallup has taken approval surveys for every president since World War II. Currently, Trump’s job approval of 42% is in the danger zone for an elected incumbent seeking a second term.  Six presidents since World War II have been reelected. In descending order of their Gallup approval rating, they were Dwight Eisenhower (68%), Bill Clinton (57%), Richard Nixon (56%), Ronald Reagan (54%), George W. Bush (51%), and Barack Obama (45%). The two presidents who had the lowest approval ratings did not win reelection: George H.W. Bush (35%) and Jimmy Carter (32%). Trump’s 42% puts him right in the middle of those two groups. Trump’s approval rating shows Trump’s level of public support has been relatively stable over time, despite the ebb and flow of positive and negative news events. At the same time, strengthened partisan polarization will likely make it hard for Trump to win the votes of people in the disapproving camp.  ""Partisan polarization has drastically reduced the ability of incumbent office-holders at all levels to appeal to voters across party lines,"" Kondik said. ""And unlike previous incumbents, Trump has made little effort to expand his base of support during his time in office."" Often, presidents are judged heavily on the state of the economy on their watch. For much of Trump’s term, unemployment was low, boosting his prospects of a second term. However, 2020 has been a bad year, rocked by coronavirus, economic problems, and a sharp focus on systemic societal problems, like racial inequities in policing. That’s why some analysts like Abramowitz believe the public’s approval or disapproval of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus could be an important metric in determining his electoral prospects in November. And that trend line has not looked good for the president. The RealClearPolitics polling average of the public’s approval of Trump in handling the coronavirus shows that as of Aug. 21, fewer than 40% of respondents approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, while more than 58% disapproved. FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average of national polls had Biden up by 8.6 percentage points nationally on Aug. 21. Perhaps equally important, Biden’s lead has been stable since he clinched the nomination and the pandemic hit. Trump has never come closer than four points during that period, and that was back in early April. In the states most likely to be decisive, Biden has also put together notable leads: 7.4 points in Michigan, 6.1 points in Pennsylvania, 6.8 points in Wisconsin, 5.4 points in Florida and 3.6 points in Arizona. Biden would need only the first three to reverse the 2016 result and achieve a Democratic victory. But Trump is not destined to lose, because intervening events could upset the status quo. The polls could be off; problems with the voting process during a pandemic could keep some voters’ ballots uncounted; and news events favorable to Trump or unfavorable to Biden could occur. But Trump said it was impossible for him to lose unless the election were rigged. That’s simply not the case. Trump said, ""So this is just a way they’re trying to steal the election, and everybody knows that. Because the only way they’re going to win is by a rigged election."" An actual conspiracy to rig the results of a national election would require hundreds or thousands of people working together to commit felonies across many critical jurisdictions. Experts do not consider this feasible, nor do we. Meanwhile, Trump is an incumbent facing several ongoing challenges: a major pandemic, high unemployment, civic unrest and future uncertainty. Those are significant political hurdles that would be challenging for any president.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9DE1C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-joe-biden-can-only-win-rigged-el/

Pennsylvania Democrat correct about uncertainties of Donald Trump’s payroll tax plan
","Pennsylvania’s 10th congressional district election pits an incumbent Republican, Scott Perry, against a competitive Democrat, Eugene DePasquale. The 10th is one of a group of toss-up races we are tracking ahead of the Nov. 3 election. DePasquale runs the state’s Auditor General Office, the agency that keeps an eye on how the state spends its money. As Pennsylvania’s bean counter in chief, DePasquale waved a red flag when President Donald Trump announced that he was deferring workers’ Social Security payroll tax for a few months. ""The President’s temporary payroll tax holiday … could leave American workers liable for thousands of dollars during tax season and could potentially leave programs like Social Security and Medicare weakened — or worse,"" DePasquale tweeted Aug. 8. 2/4: I strongly disagree however with the President’s temporary payroll tax holiday which could leave American workers liable for thousands of dollars during tax season and could potentially leave programs like Social Security and Medicare weakened - or worse. Trump’s announcement left some big questions, such as whether workers would still be on the hook for the payroll tax. DePasquale’s carefully worded tweet left room for the uncertainty of the moment. Trump issued a memo that told employers they didn’t need to send Washington the 6.2% out of each employee’s paycheck that helps fund Social Security. So, someone making $1,000 a week — the national median pay — could see an extra $62 every week. The tax break applies to people making up to $2,000 a week and would be in place for four months, September through December. The more a person makes, up to the maximum, the more money they would keep. At the high end, a person could see a tax cut of $1,984 over those 16 weeks. That’s pretty close to DePasquale’s ""thousands of dollars."" Trump had the power to defer collecting the tax, but as written, his order provided only temporary relief. At some point, the missed payments would need to be made up or count as foregone revenues to the Social Security trust fund. The memo said the administration will look for a way to let people keep the money, but that decision rests with Congress, not the president. Trump announced the tax deferral after negotiations with Congress to pass another coronavirus economic relief package broke down. When he rolled out the payroll tax holiday, Trump said something that portended a much bigger move — canceling the payroll tax altogether, pending the outcome in November. ""If I win, I may extend and terminate,"" Trump said. ""In other words, I’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax."" Trump’s meaning was ambiguous. Later that day, a campaign legal adviser tweeted that he meant full elimination of the payroll tax. Taken literally, that would mean a loss of over $1 trillion for the two main programs funded by payroll taxes: over $900 billion for Social Security and over $275 billion for Medicare.  Both employers and employees pay the payroll tax, and it was possible that Trump was referring only to the worker portion or, for that matter, only to the Social Security portion, or only to the workers under the $2,000-a-week income threshold. Or he may have meant eliminating the payroll tax entirely. DePasquale sent his tweet on Aug. 8. Over the next week, in a ping-pong pattern, Trump would repeat his desire to fully eliminate the payroll tax, and top administration officials would say he didn’t mean that. That back and forth took place after DePasquale’s tweet, so it plays no role in this fact-check. On the day that Trump announced a temporary deferral of employees’ Social Security payroll taxes, DePasquale said that the move could cost people thousands of dollars during next year’s tax season and could potentially threaten Social Security and Medicare. DePasquale’s dollar estimate of the deferred tax liability fits for the highest-paid workers affected by Trump’s plan, but those making less would see a smaller impact. He was correct that the repayment of the tax was an open question. He was also correct that, taken at full face value, Trump’s words described a plan that would undermine the finances for Social Security and Medicare. Congress would have the final say, and Trump’s meaning was ambiguous. But DePasquale bracketed his concerns with the words ""could"" and ""potentially could."" DePasquale gave due regard to the uncertainties, but his dollar estimate applied only to the best-paid workers. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDCE1200>],/factchecks/2020/aug/24/eugene-depasquale/pa-democrats-tweet-correct-uncertainties-donald-tr/

‘Liberals’ did not deny Kanye West access to the November ballot
","The saga over Kanye West’s ""Late Registration"" continues. Not the rapper’s old CD. His presidential ballot attempt. West made a last-ditch effort to land a spot on Wisconsin’s presidential ballot, a move that made Democrats squirm and Republicans willing to lend a hand.  But the state Elections Commission dealt a blow to West’s planned campaign on Aug. 20, 2020 when it decided that he filed his nomination papers too late. And Republicans, naturally, blamed Democrats for the outcome. In an Aug. 20, 2020 news release, the Republican Party of Wisconsin issued a news release with a headline that said West’s ballot access was ""denied by liberals.""  ""Wisconsin Democrats successfully fought to deny ballot access to an African American because he was seconds late with his paperwork, but they want to override Wisconsin law by delaying the deadline to accept absentee ballots because six weeks of ballot harvesting may not be enough for them to win,"" executive director Mark Jefferson said in the statement. ""Let that sink in."" Setting aside the rhetoric, we’re looking at a particular claim — the one the party chose as its news release headline. Is it true that Kanye didn’t get on the ballot because of liberals?  First, let’s get up to speed on West’s effort in Wisconsin.  On Aug. 4, 2020, the rapper made a last-minute attempt to appear on Wisconsin’s Nov. 3 ballot as a member of the ""Birthday Party."" Wisconsin was among several states West targeted, but the effort here gained heightened attention because of the state’s crucial role in the presidential contest.  From the beginning, it appeared that West’s campaign failed to deliver his nomination papers in time. Matt Smith, a reporter for WISN-TV in Milwaukee, tweeted a video of Lane Ruhland, an attorney President Donald Trump has used in another matter, walking into the state Election Commission’s building with West’s paperwork just after the 5 p.m. deadline. The state Democratic Party subsequently filed a complaint saying West submitted his papers late, used bogus signatures such as ""Mickey Mouse"" and duped people into signing on his behalf. West’s campaign acknowledged it filed the papers 14 seconds past 5 p.m., but argued he wouldn’t have been ""late"" until 5:01 p.m. and should still appear on the ballot. The campaign’s attorney also argued West was hindered by Democrats, the media and state elections officials.  That brings us to Aug. 20, when the state Elections Commission followed a staff recommendation and decided to keep West off the ballot. On a 5-1 vote, the commission determined that West didn’t file his paperwork in time.  ""I regret it's the case,"" said Dean Knudson, a former Republican state lawmaker appointed to a GOP slot on the commission. ""I do not feel they filed timely."" When asked for evidence to support the GOP’s claim, party spokesman Alec Zimmerman accused Democrats of being ""hypocritical"" and argued their claim focused on the actions of Democrats, not the commission.  ""The candidate was presumed ballot access until the Democrats filed the challenge,"" Zimmerman said. ""He would not have been denied access had the complaint by the Democrats not been filed."" But Zimmerman’s assertion is not correct.  Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said the commission routinely denies ballot access to candidates without a challenge when there are issues with the paperwork, such as not securing the minimum number of signatures required.  What’s more, the complaint filed by the state Democratic Party was one of two before the board. The second complaint was submitted by Joseph Santeler, an attorney for a Milwaukee bank. Little is known about his political involvement outside of $50 donations to Gov. Tony Evers’ campaign and to former Gov. Scott Walker.  In the end, when it came time for a decision, two Republican appointees joined the Democratic appointees in voting to keep West off the ballot.  Only Republican Commissioner Robert Spindell thought West should be on the ballot.  Of note, Spindell had this to say in June 2020 when a challenge to nomination papers for state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, came in past the deadline: ""There’s been a long tradition over many, many years and I know personally many candidates that for various reasons or challenges or whatever didn’t get it in on time. They went to the wrong location. They had a flat tire. They didn’t catch the elevator. They were two minutes late. The situation with this type of problem is pretty clear in our past history, and I would suspect that two minutes is two minutes past the deadline."" In a statement, the Republican Party of Wisconsin said West’s access to the ballot was ""denied by liberals."" Democrats led the charge to remove him and arguably had the most to lose if he appeared on the November ballot. But the final decision was bipartisan, with both Democrats and Republicans on the Elections Commission agreeing with a staff recommendation that he filed the paperwork too late. Our definition of Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""

Old photos of Barack Obama misused to fuel baseless child sex-trafficking conspiracy
","A collage of three images being shared on Facebook suggest that former President Barack Obama was caught acting inappropriately with a child. But that’s not the case, and such claims feed into a bigger, unfounded conspiracy pushed by QAnon that he and other powerful people are part of a global child sex-trafficking ring.  One of the photos shows a child who appears to be bound and gagged with tape. Obama is not in this picture.  Another shows a grid of smaller shots of Obama and the actor George Clooney on a boat with a child. The words, ""exposing herself"" and an arrow have been scribbled in red on top of one of the images..  The third shows Obama with his arms wrapped around a young child who is smiling while seated on his lap.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We don’t know the origins of the first image, though as early as 2017 it appeared online in connection with a hoax about dead Malaysian children found without organs.  We’ve already fact-checked claims about the photo of Obama and Clooney, which was taken on Lake Como in 2019. Though the angle of the photo only shows the two men and a girl, other photos from that day reveal there were many people aboard, including Michelle Obama, Amal Clooney, the president’s daughter, Malia, and other guests. Several media outlets covered the boat ride and nothing nefarious was reported.  The third image was taken in 2015 by Pete Souza, the White House photographer during the Obama administration. The caption: ""The President snuggles with his niece Savita Ng, after his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng, and her family dropped by the Oval Office."" The Baltimore Sun among other news organizations published the image, and Souza posted it on Medium.  By posting these images of Obama in connection with a photo that’s hard to look at — of a child seemingly in distress — innocuous photos of the former president take on a new, insidious meaning. But claims connecting him to sexual misconduct with children are completely baseless. This post is consistent with a wide-ranging QAnon conspiracy theory that falsely claims that a cabal of prominent Democrats and movie stars are Satan-worshipping pedophiles.  We rate this post Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB96D440>],/factchecks/2020/aug/21/viral-image/old-photos-barack-obama-misused-fuel-baseless-chil/

The DNC did not omit ‘one nation under God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance
","A former U.S. senatorial candidate says the virtual Democratic National Convention left the word God out of the nation’s most famous and solemn oath.

Hubbard’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s similar to other claims we’ve seen on Facebook, so we wanted to check it out. Some Democratic caucus members omitted ""one nation under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance during DNC meetings. But the line was not excluded from any of the convention’s primetime televised spots. On each night of the DNC, ""under God"" was included in the Pledge of Allegiance. Conservative news outlets like the Washington Examiner have pointed out that, during the livestreamed Muslim Delegates Assembly on Aug. 18, one participant omitted ""under God"" from the Pledge. A delegate at an Aug. 18 LGBTQ Caucus meeting also abstained from saying it. There were 30 caucus and council meetings during the DNC, according to the party’s website. They were not the scripted, highly produced sessions that aired on television. The Pledge of Allegiance has existed in some form since the late 19th century, but in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill that officially added the words ""under God."" There is a long history of legal challenges and religious objections to the inclusion of the phrase, particularly in public schools, where students are often asked to say the pledge. We reached out to Hubbard for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Her Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Donald Trump repeats false claim that Obama spied on his campaign
","On night three of the Democratic National Convention, former President Barack Obama charged that President Donald Trump has shown ""no interest"" in taking his job seriously. ""Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,"" Obama said. As Obama spoke, Trump tweeted. ""He spied on my campaign, and got caught!"" Trump wrote Aug. 19. HE SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, AND GOT CAUGHT! Trump has often said that Obama had a hand in the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The FBI operation, called Crossfire Hurricane, targeted four men within the Trump campaign orbit, including campaign manager Paul Manafort and national security adviser Michael Flynn. That FBI investigation itself has been the subject of investigations by the Justice Department and Congress. Not one found that Obama initiated or meddled in the FBI’s work. Not one concluded that the FBI lacked good reason to launch the investigation. ""There is not a shred of evidence that it was directed by the White House,"" said Robert Litt, former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration. A recent Senate Intelligence Committee report, approved by both Republicans and Democrats, said bluntly that the Russian government interfered with the goal of seeing Trump win. One key Russian tactic was the hack into the Democratic National Committee email server and the release through WikiLeaks of material to embarrass the Hillary Clinton campaign. ""Moscow's intent was to harm the Clinton Campaign, tarnish an expected Clinton presidential administration, help the Trump Campaign after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, and undermine the U.S. democratic process,"" the report said. The Senate report said that Manafort ""sought to secretly share internal campaign information with (Konstantin) Kilimnik."" It called Kilimnik ""a Russian intelligence officer."" The report also concluded that Trump spoke with political operative Roger Stone about Stone’s access to WikiLeaks, something Trump denies ever took place. (Trump commuted Stone's sentence.) ""Trump and the campaign believed that Roger Stone had known of the release and had inside access to WikiLeaks, and repeatedly communicated with Stone about WikiLeaks throughout the summer and fall of 2016,"" the report said. The Senate did not directly assess the origins of the FBI’s investigation. The Justice Department Inspector General did. The inspector general looked at whether the FBI followed department rules for opening investigations and whether politics had played a role. ""We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced (the) decision to open Crossfire Hurricane,"" the Inspector General’s 2019 report said. The report criticized the FBI and Justice Department for having a low threshold of evidence to trigger a counterintelligence investigation, but given the rules at the time, the facts were sufficient. ""The FBI had an authorized purpose when it opened Crossfire Hurricane to obtain information about, or to protect against, a national security threat or federal crime,"" the report said. It cites former FBI director James Comey as saying that he did not brief Obama about the investigation in detail, although Comey did say that the agency was looking at whether any Americans were helping the Russians, and he might have said there were people with ""some association or connection to the Trump campaign."" According to the report, the White House did not follow up after that briefing. The investigation was marred — an FBI lawyer recently pleaded guilty to falsifying the paperwork to justify electronic surveillance. But American University law professor Jennifer Daskal said any missteps were the FBI’s alone.   ""By all accounts, President Obama did not — and would not, per at the time well-established protocol — dictate the nuances of the FBI investigation,"" Daskal said. The Trump White House pointed to an article on the conservative Federalist website that said during the transition in early 2017, Obama intervened in the FBI’s investigation of national security adviser Flynn’s contacts with a Russian diplomat. According to secondhand notes from someone who wasn’t in the room, in a meeting with Comey, Obama indicated that the FBI ""should look at things and have the right people on it."" There is no legal definition of spying. The FBI investigated four people with greater or lesser roles in the Trump campaign. One of them, Carter Page, was the subject of electronic surveillance, which rates as highly intrusive in the FBI rule book. That didn’t happen until October 2016, after Page’s name was already in the news and the Trump campaign said publicly it had no connection with him. And the FBI had tracked Page before Trump announced his White House run. Litt said the closest the FBI came to spying was in August 2016 when it briefed the Trump campaign on its investigation into Russian interference. Among the briefing team was an FBI agent who went, as the Inspector General’s report noted, because he knew national security adviser Flynn would be there. And Flynn was targeted. For the rest of it, Litt said there is ""no indication that this was anything other than an adequately predicated counterintelligence investigation."" There is one more review in the works. Attorney General William Barr tasked Connecticut’s U.S. Attorney John Durham to dig into the origins of the FBI’s investigation. That report is expected before the election. Trump said Obama ""spied on my campaign, and got caught!"" Multiple independent investigations, including a series of bipartisan Senate reports, found no political influence over the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The FBI targeted four people with greater or lesser roles in the Trump campaign, but conducted that independently of the White House.  We rate this claim False. CORRECTION: Donald Trump commuted Roger Stone's sentence. A previous version of this story wrongly said that Trump pardoned Stone.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB4D680>],/factchecks/2020/aug/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-false-claim-obama-spied-his-c/

Texas Rep. Roger Williams offers one estimate of household costs from Biden energy policies
","As President Joe Biden attended the United Nations conference on climate change and promised to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions ""while making it more affordable for consumers to save on their own energy bills,"" a Republican congressman from Texas claimed the opposite. In a one-minute speech on Oct. 28 in Congress, Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, claimed: ""U.S. households are on track to spend $19 billion more on energy by 2030."" That CSPAN video footage of his one-minute speech was tweeted by Williams on Nov. 1. Is he right? And how will U.S. household energy costs change in the future? When asked about Williams' source, his office pointed to an analysis from the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying organization for the oil and gas industry. The analysis was prepared for the institute by an energy consulting company, OnLocation Inc. The analysis is specific to one Biden proposal from the campaign trail: a ban on oil and gas operations on federal lands and water. Williams highlighted this at the beginning of his speech. The $19 billion figure comes from a September 2020 report prompted by a then-campaign promise by Biden to ban leasing and development for oil and gas operations on federal lands. The prediction is that U.S. households would spend a cumulative $19 billion more on energy by 2030 (in 2018 dollars). The institute extrapolated from and modified the assumptions of a model by the U.S. Energy Information Administration under the U.S. Department of Energy, which tracks energy market data and develops outlooks for the future. After Biden took office, he banned by executive order new leases for oil and gas production on public land and offshore waters until a review of the permitting and leasing program could be completed. The 2020 analysis was based on the proposal to ban new leases and permitting on existing leases, while Biden's executive order was on just new leasing, a spokesperson from the American Petroleum Institute said. However, the actual pause on leasing was brief because a federal court ordered in June for new leasing to resume. The Department of the Interior issued a release in August about the steps it took to comply with the preliminary injunction. The Justice Department also is appealing the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A spokesperson from the Department of the Interior noted in a Nov. 17 email the pause on new leasing did not impact current oil and gas production. So, in criticism of Biden's policies, Williams used a statistic specific to a campaign promise which is currently not in effect. While the American Petroleum Institute does have an addendum to its analysis, the institute does not have a 2021 estimate of the potential effect on household energy costs if just new leasing remained on pause. A spokesperson from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, wrote in an email that under current laws and regulations, residential non-renewable energy expenditures are projected to increase by $18 billion (in 2020 dollars), from $247 billion to $265 billion. Ultimately, household energy forecasting is challenging — household energy prices depend on a range of hard-to-predict factors. The Energy Information Administration issued caution in its ""Annual Energy Outlook 2021"" that many events, as well as future technology and demographics, can ultimately affect energy markets. Williams said, ""U.S. households are on track to spend $19 billion more on energy by 2030"" because of Biden energy policies. The figure was specific to banning all new leasing and development for oil and gas operations on federal lands and waters. A ban of that scale did not go into effect; only new leasing was banned. And that ban is currently blocked by a federal judge. The statistic also speaks to only one Biden policy among many climate policies, some of which Biden claims aim to lower household costs. It's difficult to forecast household energy prices because a lot of factors affect them, and analysts have to hold a lot of factors constant to make predictions. For example, assuming laws and regulations remain the same, the Energy Information Administration estimates household expenditures will increase by $18 billion. We rate this as claim as Half True, which means the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB55DC0>],/factchecks/2021/nov/30/roger-williams/williams-presents-estimate-based-biden-campaign-pr/

For individuals, the maximum income would be $250,000, and for single-income households, the income limit would be $375,000.  The version proposed earlier, on Oct. 28, would have provided a tax credit for households up to $800,000, Watson said. A summary of the bill, from the House Rules Committee, states that plug-in electric pick-up trucks, vans, and SUVS up to $80,000, or other vehicles up to $55,000, would be eligible. The maximum credit would be $12,500, but the amount varies, with increased incentives for vehicles made in the United States and those manufactured by unionized workforces. Tesla vehicles under the price threshold would be eligible for some of the credit, but its workforce is not unionized.  The Senate has not voted on the bill. Negotiations on what to include in the Senate’s version are expected, and it’s possible that if this legislation becomes law, the electric vehicle tax credits could change.  Jacobs said the Build Back Better bill would provide tax credits to people making as much as $800,000 for their Tesla purchases. That's not right. The bill calls for tax credits for joint filers with incomes up to $500,000. An earlier version of the bill would have allowed for incomes up to $800,000, but Jacobs made his claim more than two weeks after the income threshold had changed. This is not some obscure piece of legislation followed only by interested trade groups, with few details trickling into the public sphere. The Build Back Better bill has been a story of national interest. The House minority leader for Jacobs and other Republicans had just given the longest House floor speech in history about the Build Back Better vote. The Wall Street Journal's coverage of the bill included a Nov. 3 report that Democrats had narrowed the income guidelines for the proposed tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles. While we don't expect members of Congress to read every Wall Street Journal article, we do expect them to be reasonably up to date on the facts and figures about legislation before they go on a radio show to talk to the public about it.   Since his statement is not accurate, but does contain an element of truth, we rate it Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC952C00>],/factchecks/2021/nov/26/chris-jacobs/jacobs-overstates-income-eligibility-electric-vehi/

Nadler wrong on claim Rittenhouse crossed state line with gun before shooting at Kenosha protest
","When Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of killing two men and wounding another in a series of shootings during a night of unrest in Kenosha in 2020, the verdict drew cheers and outrage. And bad information -- just as the case has from the very start. In condemning the Nov. 19, 2021 verdict, some pointed to the fact Rittenhouse, now 18, had come to Wisconsin that day, joining a group of other armed individuals who said they were there to protect property. In a post-verdict tweet, U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, called the outcome ""heartbreaking.""  ""Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest,"" he wrote. Part of that statement -- the claim Rittenhouse was armed when he crossed state lines -- was repeated by many in the wake of the verdict. But that information is wrong. When asked for backup, Nadler spokesperson Dan Rubin said the tweet was trying to make the point that Rittenhouse could be open to further review by the U.S. Department of Justice because he crossed state lines to be in Wisconsin for the protests.  The tweet, Rubin said, wasn’t meant to convey that Rittenhouse had taken the gun itself over state lines, arguing that the situation ""at least opens up the possibility of a broader review from DOJ."" But that’s not what the tweet says. It suggests Rittenhouse brought the gun to Wisconsin, when testimony said he did not. (To be sure, there was plenty of controversy around the fact he had a gun, and Rittenhouse initially faced a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully possessing the gun as a minor. Under Wisconsin law, anyone under 18 who possesses a dangerous weapon is guilty of a misdemeanor, unless they fall under an exception, such as for hunting. For months, Rittenhouse's attorneys pointed to one of those exceptions that they argued allows 16- and 17-year-olds to carry rifles and shotguns as long as they are not unlawfully short-barreled. Prosecutors acknowledged the gun was not short-barreled, after which the judge tossed the charge.) During the trial, Dominick Black, a close friend, testified that he agreed to purchase the gun for Rittenhouse, according to a Nov. 2, 2021 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report.  Black used money Rittenhouse gave him to make the purchase in Wisconsin, knowing the purchase was illegal. Rittenhouse and Black agreed that Rittenhouse wouldn’t get the gun himself until he turned 18.  Rittenhouse did shoot the weapon several times the weekend it was purchased while up north at Black’s family hunting property in May 2020, the Journal Sentinel report said.  Black testified that normally, the AR-15 was stored in Black’s home in Kenosha, locked up in a gun safe. The safe could only be opened by Black’s stepfather. But the night of the unrest, the guns were taken out of the safe and into the basement.  Some time after Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020, he retrieved the gun from Black’s basement and went into the downtown area.  (A final note: Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted, Black is asking that charges against him related to buying the gun be thrown out. A decision on that has been delayed.) Like many others, Nadler said in a tweet following Rittenhouse’s acquittal that the teen had traveled across state lines with a firearm.  But Rittenhouse never had his gun in Illinois, according to testimony in the trial. It was purchased in Wisconsin by Black and stored in Black’s home in a gun safe.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA5F840>],/factchecks/2021/nov/26/jerrold-nadler/nadler-wrong-claim-rittenhouse-crossed-state-line-/

Can taking vitamin D really eliminate all COVID-19 deaths?
","Vitamin D has been touted as a panacea for illness for nearly a century and, amid a pandemic, keeps making headlines. But could vitamin D provide a means to end COVID-19 deaths altogether? That’s what one image in a popular Instagram post suggests: ""Vitamin D levels of 50 ng/mL correlates to zero mortality rate from COVID,"" it says with the code ""PMID8541492"" written out below it.

The unit of measurement is nanograms per milliliter. And the ""PMID"" code references a specific study accessible on PubMed.gov, a database of published health and science research. In this case, the research cited was a meta-analysis — an analysis of previous studies — that examined research and data on vitamin D levels in patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19. A close reading of the research shows this Instagram claim is misleading in that it oversimplifies the findings. It also ignores that, overall, research has been murky on the impact vitamin D has on immunity, and, more recently, whether it improves COVID-19 outcomes.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The title of the original publication indicates that zero mortality is just theoretical. It uses the less definitive term ""close to zero"": COVID-19 Mortality Risk Correlates Inversely with Vitamin D3 Status, and a Mortality Rate Close to Zero Could Theoretically Be Achieved at 50 ng/mL 25(OH)D3: Results of a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. There is no doubt that vitamin D — a nutrient we consume and hormone our bodies produce — plays an important role in one’s skeletal system and overall health. Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health writes on its website that ""laboratory studies show that vitamin D can reduce cancer cell growth, help control infections, and reduce inflammation."" But COVID-era research on vitamin D’s impact has been mixed. In May 2020, Glenn Grothman, a Republican congressman from Wisconsin, said that research illustrated a correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and higher COVID-19 mortality rates. We rated that True, as early studies supported the claim.  But in March 2021, when PolitiFact looked into a claim that ""vitamin D, vitamin C, colloidal silver and black seed oil can kill the coronavirus,"" we found that research on vitamin D and COVID-19 had become less hopeful. Recent research points to growing skepticism about vitamin D’s effectiveness against COVID-19. An October 2021 meta-analysis in the Nutritional Journal that found ""vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was not significantly linked to susceptibility to COVID-19 infection or its associated death."" Researchers at the American University of Beirut also came to a similar finding in their meta-analysis published in the Metabolism Clinical and Experimental journal in March 2021.  ""There is insufficient evidence to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19,"" reads a page on a section of the National Institutes of Health website dedicated to explaining what research says about COVID-19 and various supplements.  Margherita T. Cantorna, professor of molecular immunology at Pennsylvania State University echoed this sentiment. ""I think the conclusions made and reported via Instagram are premature and not based on the science,"" Cantorna told PolitiFact. She said it’s still unknown whether an increase of vitamin D will help or hurt in terms of fighting COVID-19.  On the other hand, other researchers have come to more promising conclusions, including well-known vitamin D researcher Dr. Michael Holick, professor of medicine at Boston University and author of ""The Vitamin D Solution."" He and other researchers published a study in March 2021 using COVID-19 patient outcomes at Boston University Medical Center. Its findings showed a clear link between vitamin D sufficiency at 30 nanograms per milliliter, and a decreased risk of mortality among elderly patients without obesity. But Holick said the Instagram post oversimplified what research actually shows. ""I think that it is more realistic based on the literature, including ours, that vitamin D level concentrations above 40 ng/mL reduce risk of morbidity and mortality by about 50%,"" said Holick. He said his research has also observed a reduction in infectivity by about 50% when vitamin D levels are at least 34 nanograms per milliliter.  Lorenz Borsche, one of the authors of the study cited in the Instagram post, said that he believes there is a clear correlation between vitamin D and successful COVID-19 outcomes, but that zero mortality is unachievable.  An Instagram post claimed ""vitamin D levels of 50 ng/mL correlates to zero mortality rate from COVID."" The post references a review of research that determined that a ""mortality rate close to zero"" could be possible. An author on the study said the Instagram post oversimplifies the paper’s findings.

It also ignores the fact that research into how vitamin D levels affect mortality from COVID-19 is not conclusive.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA7AFC0>],/factchecks/2021/nov/24/instagram-posts/can-taking-vitamin-d-really-eliminate-all-covid-19/

No, Fauci did not admit that COVID-19 vaccines aren't working
","On Nov. 19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration expanded eligibility for COVID-19 booster shots to all adults. The plan to offer a third dose of the vaccine to all adults was openly discussed in the months leading up to the official announcement. But some are taking Dr. Anthony Fauci’s recent statements about boosters to suggest that the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the COVID-19 vaccines aren't working. ""Fauci Admits Covid Vax Doesn’t Work,"" reads the headline on a video circulating on Facebook. The video shows a clip from Infowars creator Alex Jones’ Nov. 14 show in which Jones cuts to audio from a Nov. 12 interview Fauci gave to The Daily, a popular podcast from the New York Times. In it, Fauci can be heard saying the following: ""We’re starting to see waning immunity against infection and waning immunity in the beginning aspect against hospitalization. And if you look at Israel — which has always been a month to a month-and-a-half ahead of us in the dynamics of the outbreak, in their vaccine response and in every other element of the outbreak — they are seeing a waning of immunity, not only against infection, but against hospitalizations and, to some extent, death, which is starting now to involve all age groups — it isn’t just the elderly. So, if one looks back at this, one can say, you know, it isn’t as if a booster is a bonus, but a booster is an essential part of the primary regimen that people should have."" But Fauci did not ""slip in"" any admission of the vaccines not working during the interview with The Daily host Michael Barbaro, as Jones asserts. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Jones cherry-picked from Fauci’s comments and distorted what Fauci said. In reality, Fauci was promoting boosters — along with a continued push to get the unvaccinated immunized — as a means to prevent continued surges in infection like the ones experienced as a result of the delta variant. ""I think it would be a misrepresentation to say that the vaccines don’t work,"" Fauci told Barbaro later in the podcast. ""I don’t think we’ve given that the full rein to prove what it is that you need to make them work. And that’s the reason why I say, again, it’s my scientific opinion and projection that boosters will be an essential part of the protection.""

Infowars has spread other vaccine misinformation. And Jones was recently found liable for defamation against the families of victims from the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which Jones has portrayed as a hoax. We reached out to Jones through Infowars but did not hear back before publication. Vaccines provide both short- and long-term protection against disease. The initial surge of antibodies experienced immediately after vaccination wanes naturally over time. But certain immune cells, like memory B cells, remain circulating for much longer and mount a more rapid response when they encounter the virus. The fact that a booster is needed does not mean that vaccines aren't working. Booster shots are a standard approach used to help the body achieve longer-lasting immunity. A booster for the tetanus vaccine, for example, is recommended every 10 years. Waning numbers of antibodies, moreover, doesn't mean that their protective effects have completely disappeared. ""Overall, antibody levels are decreasing, but their ability to protect against infection isn’t,"" said Ted Ross, director of the University of Georgia's Center for Vaccines and Immunology, in a press release. ""The quality is still there even if the total quantity has gone down."" Asked by Barbaro about the current state of the pandemic in the U.S., Fauci stated that it’s ""a mixed bag leaning towards the positive."" Vaccine implementation has been going well, he said, but the situation is also ""sobering"" because while cases have plateaued, over 70,000 new cases a day is a high baseline for a potential resurgence. With over 60 million people yet unvaccinated and vulnerable to infection from circulating variants, this puts even vaccinated people at risk.  In the interview excerpted by Jones, Fauci mentioned the waning immunity observed in Israel, a country that has been seen as a bellwether for the pandemic because of its earlier COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Given this observed decrease in protection, Fauci called boosters a necessary step to ensure lasting protection. An Oct. 23 study conducted in Israel found that a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines reduced COVID-19-related hospitalization by 93%, COVID-19-related death by 81% and severe COVID-19 infections by 92%, compared with only two doses. ""A booster might actually be an essential part of the primary regimen that people should have,"" Fauci said. Jones claimed in a video that ""Fauci Admits Covid Vax Doesn't Work."" Fauci's statements, however, were cherry-picked and removed from their full context. Fauci said that booster shots bolster the protections offered by vaccines. He did not say they are a sign that vaccines are failing. We rate this statement False. RELATED STORY: Bill Gates said we need vaccines that halt transmission.

Build Back Better bill wouldn’t parole criminal immigrants
","An image showing a bare-chested, heavily tattooed man attacks the Build Back Better bill by claiming:  ""Build Back Illegal: 'Parole' amnesty for millions of criminal illegal aliens."" The image, shared on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim gives the misleading impression that people who entered the U.S. illegally and were convicted of crimes would be paroled and allowed to stay. But parole has a different meaning in immigration law, and the parole provisions of the bill as they’re currently written would not be available to people convicted of crimes in the U.S. The viral image alludes to members of criminal gangs. The photo of the man in the image appears to be cropped from a photo of three men that appears with articles about the MS-13 gang, which grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods that housed many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua in the 1980s. In the United States, law enforcement officials have indicted MS-13 members for a wide range of crimes, including racketeering, murders, attempted murders, assaults, obstruction of justice, arson and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. The image was shared by the Great American Movement in a post that urges people to tell their congressional representatives to oppose the Democratic-supported Build Back Better bill. The slogan of the group, which has 135,000 Facebook followers, is: ""'America First' should not just be a political slogan. It should be a way of life for all Americans."" Great American Movement’s Facebook page lists GreatAmericanMovement.com as its contact information, but that link did not lead to a working website when we checked it on Nov. 23.  We’re fact-checking the claim, made Nov. 15, based on the version of the Build Back Better Act that passed the House on Nov. 19. The bill could be changed in the Senate. In the criminal context, the word ""parole"" typically is understood as the early release from prison of a person convicted of a crime who must abide by certain conditions after release. But the term ""parole"" is also used in immigration law to describe a process that gives people who are in the U.S. without legal authorization temporary permission to stay.  The permission is granted for humanitarian reasons or other reasons in the public interest, said Washington University law professor emeritus Stephen Legomsky, former chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Department of Homeland Security. Section 60001 of the Build Back Better bill would give a form of this parole to some 7 million immigrants who are in the country without permission, protecting them from deportation and formally admitting them into the United States if they file an application, pay a fee and pass criminal and security background checks.  To be eligible, the immigrants must have arrived before Jan. 1, 2011, and have lived here ever since. If approved, they could get work permits that would be valid for five years and could be renewed one time for another five years, expiring on Sept. 30, 2031. People convicted of crimes in the U.S. would not be eligible for immigration parole under this provision, said Theresa Cardinal Brown, managing director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.  The wording of the claim in the post may suggest that simply living in the U.S. without permission makes a person a criminal. But that’s not necessarily the case.  Entering the U.S. without permission is a crime — though it’s not always prosecuted on its own — but living in the United States without authorization is a civil violation, not a criminal offense. Many people who are in the U.S. without authorization entered legally but committed a civil violation by overstaying their visas or violating their conditions of admission, such as by working without authorization or dropping out of school, Cardinal Brown said.  Under the bill, people who entered illegally, or entered legally but have overstayed, would be eligible for parole, she said, but convicted criminals would not. Legomsky said that while ""almost every serious crime will disqualify you from the parole program under this bill, illegal entry will not."" A viral image shared on Facebook alluded to members of criminal gangs and stated that the Build Back Better bill provides ""'parole' amnesty for millions of criminal illegal aliens."" The post gives the impression that people who entered the U.S. illegally and committed crimes in the U.S. would be eligible for parole. But parole means something different in immigration law: temporary permission to stay for people who are in the country without permission.  Under the bill, immigration parole would be available to people who entered the country legally or illegally before 2011, but not to people convicted of crimes.

There is no evidence to support the claim she was singled out because of her protests — either against a school board or elections. Three other related searches were conducted on the same day, including at the home of Tina Peters, Mesa County clerk and recorder. Peters is accused of ""sneaking an outsider into Mesa County election offices to copy the hard drives of machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems"" a voting technology company, the Washington Post reported. Dominion is at the center of numerous unfounded claims that suggest the company helped sway the 2020 U.S. presidential election results for Joe Biden. The company has since filed a number of defamation lawsuits in response. Bishop was identified by media outlets as an associate and ""staunch supporter"" of Peters.

Bishop read aloud from warrants she said the FBI left at her home, during a Nov. 17 interview with Brannon Howse on WVW Broadcast Network, a conservative outlet. The warrants indicate that the agency is investigating potential crimes including intentional damage to a protected computer, wire fraud, conspiracy to cause intentional damage to a protected computer and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Bishop is a former campaign manager for U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and once made headlines for thanking God for the Proud Boys, a far-right group with members who have expressed white supremacist views. She runs a conservative group called America’s Mom and said during the interview with Howse that she started the organization to educate parents about legislation that ""would adversely impact them or their children."" Bishop said America’s Mom has gotten heavily involved in school board races and has been vocal about school board policies. The claim that the FBI is targeting and intimidating parents involved in local school boards is misinformation based on a misreading of an Oct. 4 memo sent by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland instructed federal agencies to address criminal threats against school administrators, board members, teachers and staff. Garland’s memo did not include the word terrorist or designate anyone as such, but the false claim has proliferated that parents who challenge school curricula are being labeled domestic terrorists. An article claims that the FBI targeted Bishop and searched her home because she ""protested local school board, elections."" Colorado authorities searched Bishop’s home and those of three others on Nov. 16. But the search was connected to an investigation into an alleged election system breach in Mesa County.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott off-base in claim that Medicare premiums are rising due to inflation
","Republicans blame President Joe Biden for this year’s historic surge in inflation reflected in higher prices for almost everything — from cars and gas to food and housing. They see last month’s 6.2% annual inflation rate — the highest in decades and mostly driven by an increase in consumer spending and supply issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic — as a ticket to taking back control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections. A key voting bloc will be older Americans, and the GOP aims to illustrate how much worse life has grown for them under the Biden administration. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., issued a press release Nov. 16 suggesting that rising general inflation was behind the large increase in next year’s standard premiums for Medicare Part B, which covers physician and some drug costs and other outpatient services. ""Sen. Rick Scott: America’s Seniors are Paying the Price for Biden’s Inflation Crisis,"" was the headline. The senator’s statement within that press release said, ""We need to be LOWERING health care and drug prices and strengthening this vital program for seniors and future generations, not crippling the system and leaving families to pay the cost."" The press release from Scott says he is ""slamming Biden’s inaction to address the inflation crisis he and Washington Democrats have created with reckless spending and socialist policies, which is expected to cause significant price increases on senior citizens and Medicare recipients."" Scott’s statement in that same press release also says the administration’s ""reckless spending"" will leave U.S. seniors ""paying HUNDREDS more for the care they need.""  We wondered whether these points were true. Was the climbing annual inflation rate over the past several months to blame for the increase in Medicare Part B premiums? We reached out to Scott’s office for more detail, but we received no reply. Upon further investigation, we found there is little, if any, connection between general inflation in the past few months and the increase in Medicare Part B premiums. Medicare Part B premiums have been growing steadily for decades to keep up with rising health spending. The U.S. inflation rate, for years held at bay, has been above 4% since April, hitting 6.2% in October, the highest rate in decades. On Nov. 12, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced that the standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B would rise to $170.10 in 2022, from $148.50 this year. The 14.5% increase is the largest one-year increase in the program’s history. Scott’s press release refers to the CMS report. CMS cited three main factors for the increase: rising health care costs, a move by Congress last year that held the premium increase to just $3 a month because of the pandemic, and the need to raise money for a possible unprecedented surge in drug costs. Inflation was not on that list. In fact, half of the premium increase was due to making sure the program was ready in case Medicare next year decides to start covering Aduhelm, a new Alzheimer’s drug priced at $56,000 per year, per patient. It’s been estimated that total Medicare spending for the drug for one year alone would be nearly $29 billion, far more than any other drug. Some Medicare beneficiaries won’t face a 14.5% increase, however, because a ""hold-harmless"" provision in federal law protects them from a decrease in their Social Security payments. But that rule won’t apply for most enrollees in 2022 because the increase in their monthly benefit checks will cover the higher monthly premium, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF. Several Medicare experts said the spike in the general inflation rate has little or nothing to do with the Medicare premium increase. In fact, Medicare is largely immune from inflation, because the program sets prices for hospitals and doctors. ""This is so false that it is annoying,"" Paul Ginsburg, a professor of health policy at the Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California, said of Scott’s claim that general inflation is behind the premium increase. ""The effect of the inflation spike so far on prices is zero because Medicare controls prices."" Medicare Part B premiums, he said, reflect changes in the amount of health services delivered and a more expensive mix of drugs. ""Premiums are tracking spending, only a portion of which reflects prices,"" Ginsburg said. ""I can’t see that the administration really had any discretion"" in setting the premium increase due to the need to build a reserve to pay for the Alzheimer’s drug and make up for the reduced increase last year, he said. Stephen Zuckerman, co-director of the Urban Institute’s health policy center, said a rise in wages caused by inflation could spur a small boost in Medicare spending because wages help determine how much the program pays providers. But, he said, such an increase would have to occur for more than a few months to affect premiums. Continued soaring inflation could influence 2023 Medicare premiums, not those for 2022. ""The claim that premium increases are due to inflation in the last couple of months doesn’t make sense,"" Zuckerman said. CMS faced the challenge of trying to estimate costs for an expensive drug not yet covered by Medicare. ""It is a very difficult projection to make, and they want to have enough contingency reserved,"" said Gretchen Jacobson, a vice president of the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund.  Scott said in a press release about the 2022 increase in Medicare Part B premiums that ""America’s seniors are paying the price for Biden’s inflation crisis.""  Though his statement contains a sliver of truth, Scott’s assertion ignores critical facts that create a different impression. For instance, Medicare policy experts said current general inflation has little, if anything, to do with the increase in premiums. CMS said the increase was needed to put away money in case Medicare starts paying for an Alzheimer’s drug that could add tens of billions in costs in one year and to make up for congressional action last year that held down premiums. We rate the claim Mostly False. CORRECTION, Nov. 24, 2021: A previous version of this story misstated the effect of a hold-harmless provision in federal law. That measure protects people from seeing a reduction in Social Security payments caused by higher Medicare premiums in years when the cost-of-living adjustment to Social Security is not enough to cover the premium hike. The earlier story’s reference to 70% of Medicare beneficiaries being protected in 2022 was incorrect. The rating remains the same.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF46700>],/factchecks/2021/nov/23/rick-scott/florida-sen-rick-scott-base-claim-medicare-premium/

Allred says fewer women are in the labor force because of the pandemic
","Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been deadlocked over President Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill, which would fund Democratic social and economic goals, including free preschool education. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she wanted to see the bill put to a vote this week, though as of Friday the Congressional Budget Office had yet to score the bill and determine a final cost. Congress passed Biden's separate $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which he signed Monday. Among the Democratic advocates for the $1.75 trillion bill is Rep. Colin Allred, D-Dallas, who has emphasized the devastating economic effects of the pandemic as a reason why Americans need some of the social safeguards guaranteed in the Build Back Better bill. While speaking on MSNBC on Oct. 25, Allred pointed out the pandemic's disproportionate economic effect on women. ""You've had over 2 million women drop out of the workforce during this pandemic,"" Allred said. He went on to highlight the provisions regarding pre-K and child care in the Build Back Better bill aimed to strengthen the workforce. Is Allred right? Did more than 2 million women drop out of the workforce nationally during the pandemic? When asked about the statistics, Allred's office pointed to an April Pew Research Center article that found, in an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, a net 2.4 million women dropped out of the workforce from February 2020 to February 2021. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the Current Population Survey indicates 77,534,000 women ages 16 and over were in the labor force in February 2020 and 75,149,000 women were working in February 2021. The difference between those numbers is nearly 2.4 million women. If you wanted to update those numbers, there were 75,737,000 women working in October 2021. The difference between that February 2020 value — before the March 2020 plummet — and October 2021 is nearly 1.8 million women. So, there were 1.8 million fewer women in the labor force in October than in February 2020. That shows a significant number of women have rejoined the workforce since February 2021, but the number of women working is still much lower than pre-pandemic levels. Experts say many women dropped out of the workforce to take care of their children at the beginning of the pandemic, when many schools closed and children learned virtually. Many economists have tied the September 2020 decline of women in the labor force to the start of school, when 865,000 women dropped out of the workforce compared with 216,000 men. Mothers have not seen the same economic recovery non-parents and fathers experienced. A February 2021 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that if recovery had been similar for mothers as it had been for non-parent women, the December labor force participation rate would have been 2 percentage points higher than the actual rate. About 700,000 more working-age women would have been in the workforce then. While economic conditions have changed since the pandemic's beginning, economist Kathryn Edwards at the RAND Corporation noted women still face pandemic-related challenges to rejoining the workforce. This includes waiting for guidance on and the opportunity to vaccinate their children, finding childcare after the pandemic brought exacerbated staffing challenges in the childcare industry, and schools temporarily closing that would require a parent to be home with their child. Allred said on Oct. 25 while advocating for spending bills like the Build Back Better bill, ""You've had over 2 million women drop out of the workforce during this pandemic."" He accurately cited a comparison of the number of women in the labor force from February 2020 to February 2021. However, the most recent data indicates many women have rejoined the labor force since February and the net number of women who dropped out of the workforce is a lower number, but not far off from Allred's 2 million. Roughly 1.8 million fewer women ages 16 and over are in the workforce compared to February 2020. We rate this Mostly True. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF77EC0>],/factchecks/2021/nov/23/colin-allred/says-over-two-million-women-dropped-out-workforce-/

DNA damage from COVID-19 spike proteins in lab study does not apply directly to COVID-19 vaccines
","The distinctive spike protein that covers the surface of the COVID-19 virus has inspired numerous misinformed claims about the vaccines that aim to prevent its spread. We have previously fact-checked claims on the purported toxicity of the spike protein relating to COVID-19 vaccines. An Oct. 13 paper claiming that the spike protein can cause DNA damage has circulated on social media, causing uncertainty about whether these findings are relevant to the COVID-19 vaccines. Without more context, the title of a YouTube video — ""Spike protein goes to nucleus and impairs DNA repair"" — may sound alarming. The lab-based context in which the study was conducted, however, limits its relevance to real life conditions outside the lab. And the study’s findings should not be directly translated to the COVID-19 vaccines, which use modified versions of the spike protein. A blog post about the claim was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Researchers from two Swedish universities introduced into isolated human kidney cells genetic material containing instructions to produce different proteins that make up the COVID-19 virus, including the spike protein. They then examined where these proteins are primarily located in the cell, and tested whether the proteins affected the cell's DNA damage repair system. The researchers found that spike proteins were present in the cell nucleus, the part of the cell that houses DNA. They attributed a reduction in DNA repair efficiency to hindered recruitment of specific proteins involved in the repair process. Their findings differ from previous studies that have found the spike protein to be located primarily outside the nucleus. Studies on the related coronavirus that causes SARS have also found its spike protein to be located in areas outside the nucleus.  There are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are currently available or being tested in the U.S. Each one involves introducing modified versions of the spike protein to the body in order to prime the immune system to recognize the COVID-19 virus and build defenses against it. This modified version of the spike protein prevents it from assuming the structure that would normally allow it to fuse with the membranes of other cells, unlike the spike protein coded for in the kidney cell study. Unanswered questions also remain. ""There are a lot of caveats before we can say there is a direct correlation between the vaccines and DNA repair,"" said Andre Hudson, head of the Thomas H. Gosnell School of Life Sciences of the Rochester Institute of Technology. One question, for example, is how the genetic material introduced into the kidney cells directed spike protein production: Was it the presence of the spike protein itself, or was it an overabundance of protein that led to their findings?  Another question is replication: Can these findings be reproduced in other cell types or viruses that also use spike proteins? Does the age of the cells matter? ""A lot of experimental details are still needed before you can make a definitive conclusion,"" Hudson said. The Swedish researchers conducted an in vitro study, meaning it was conducted in a test tube or petri dish in a controlled lab environment. In vitro studies do not necessarily translate directly to what would happen in the much more complex biological environment of the body.  Unlike the narrower parameters of an in vitro study, there are multiple cell types, immune responses and DNA repair mechanisms at play in people. ""Though they may have evidence that it happened in a cell line in an in vitro system, that doesn't mean that's the way it would act or behave in animals or people,"" said Hudson. ""Many studies have been done in vitro that don't translate to animal model systems."" Without replication in a study conducted on live animals or people, this study has limited clinical relevance to the COVID-19 vaccines. Blog posts claim that a recent paper shows evidence that the spike protein on the COVID-19 virus can cause DNA damage, raising concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety. The study, however, contradicts findings from previous studies that were also conducted on isolated cells in a lab environment. Until their results are replicated in human studies, this has limited bearing on COVID-19 vaccines. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9B92080>],/factchecks/2021/nov/23/blog-posting/dna-damage-covid-19-spike-proteins-lab-study-does-/

Bewley wrong that Legislative maps could be drawn to provide a statehouse of half GOP, half Dems
","Wisconsin’s Republican and Democratic lawmakers never agree on much, but nothing turns up the heat like redistricting time.  Redistricting is the once-a-decade process through which the state gets chopped into pieces based on new census numbers. That helps determine who represents you in local, state and national positions, so the stakes are high. In Wisconsin, Republicans controlled both the legislative and executive branches the last time these maps were drawn, in 2011. The gerrymandered districts approved by  former Gov. Scott Walker locked in GOP control of the state Legislature and slashed the number of competitive seats.  With a veto from Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, the maps are destined to head to the courts. Before the Nov. 18, 2021 veto, Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley, D-Mason, blasted the Republicans’ new maps as continuing to give them a major advantage.  During the debate on the maps, Bewley made an argument she later included in a Nov. 5, 2021 news release: that the Legislature should reflect the state’s partisan divide.  ""Wisconsin is almost equally divided on partisan lines,"" she wrote, therefore the new maps should be drawn to ""represent that fifty-fifty split.""  That may sound reasonable, but the political geography of Wisconsin dictates otherwise.  Let’s take a look.  Bewley is correct that the Badger State has split fairly evenly in a number of recent elections between Republicans and Democrats.  When asked for evidence of her claim, staffer Joseph Hoey sent a breakdown of votes in a handful of presidential, state Supreme Court, U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races in Wisconsin from 2014 on.  Closest, of course, were the margins between candidates in the 2020 presidential election and the 2018 race for governor.  In 2020, former President Donald Trump lost to President Joe Biden by a margin of about 20,000 votes.  In 2018, Evers bested Walker by less than 30,000 votes.  Other races Hoey cited, while their margins were less razor-thin, were all within a difference of a handful of percentage points.  But that doesn’t mean seats can be drawn to generate a roughly even number of Republicans and Democrats in the state Legislature. When their votes have to be split into districts for state lawmakers, Republicans have a geographical advantage.  Democratic voters are disproportionately concentrated in blue cities like Milwaukee and Madison. This confines their voting power to fewer districts. Republican voters, on the other hand, are distributed across a wider area, giving them a larger number of favorable seats. In effect, those votes are distributed more efficiently, an Oct. 7, 2021 analysis from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found.   Voters in Wisconsin are also more sorted now than in the past into politically one-sided communities, which often result in one-sided districts, according to the same analysis.  Some of this is impacted by gerrymandering. The 2011 maps made some districts redder and safer for the Republicans holding the seats. They made others much more blue — which ""packed"" Democratic voters into a smaller number of seats, reducing their voting power.  The GOP’s natural advantage is reflected in a Feb. 11, 2021 analysis by research fellow John Johnson of the Marquette Law School Lubar Center: Even prior to the 2011 redistricting, Democrats needed to win the state by roughly two or three percentage points at the top of the ticket to have a shot at winning legislative majorities.   ""Any plausible Assembly map for the 2020s would probably still create a system where Republicans would win a majority of the seats even when Democrats win 51% of the vote statewide,"" Johnson wrote. ""But a non-gerrymandered map would increase, at least somewhat, the number of seats that either party could realistically win. A fairer map would also lower the size of the statewide victory Democrats require to win control of the Assembly.""  Bewley claimed the state’s fairly even partisan split should be represented in the state Legislature.  She gives proper nod to Wisconsin’s general purpleness, but misses widely on her broader point. Because Republicans tend to be more spread out while Democrats tend to be more clustered, the GOP has a natural advantage in elections for state lawmakers. A non-gerrymandered map could increase the number of competitive seats, but it still wouldn’t create an even split.  A rating of Mostly False indicates that the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  That fits here. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD29B80>],/factchecks/2021/nov/23/janet-bewley/bewley-wrong-legislative-maps-could-be-drawn-provi/

Contrast in Rittenhouse, Maxwell trial coverage due to state and fed court rules, not hidden agenda
","A social media post claims that two high-profile trials are being presented differently by the media because of the nature of the crimes and the people involved. A viral Facebook post reads, ""Rittenhouse’s trial was streamed live for the world to see because he is a ‘white supremacist shooter,’ yet the one that is connected to Epstein and a global child trafficking ring for the elite and all we get is some cartoon drawing?"" The caption says, ""What are they hiding?"" The post includes a screenshot of an article from The Guardian, a British newspaper, with a courtroom artist’s sketch of Ghislaine Maxwell and her attorneys at a hearing. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Media access to the two trials is vastly different. But that’s because the federal court system and the state court system have different rules regarding cameras and recording devices. Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who was acquitted on Nov. 19 of homicide and other charges in a 2020 shooting that left two people dead, stood trial in a state court in Wisconsin, where cameras and recording devices are allowed in most proceedings.

Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse minors over several years beginning in the 1990s, is being tried in federal court, where in most instances cameras and recording devices are not allowed. Rittenhouse did not face any federal charges. In Wisconsin, the state’s Supreme Court has authorized cameras and recorders in all courtrooms since 1979, with some limited exceptions. Rittenhouse’s trial was broadcast on air and online. A jury deliberated for 26 hours before finding him not guilty of all charges.  Maxwell, 59, is accused of luring young girls and grooming them to engage in sexual acts with Epstein, and also of participating in the abuse herself. She has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of ​​sex trafficking a minor, sex trafficking conspiracy, transporting a minor for the purposes of criminal sexual activity and conspiring to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Jury selection is underway for Maxwell’s trial, which is in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In most federal courts, cameras and recording devices are not allowed — and have not been allowed for decades. A very small number of federal courts participate in a pilot program to evaluate the effect of cameras in district court courtrooms. Courtroom artists are allowed to draw the proceedings in federal court, and their work is used by the media, including TV stations, websites and newspapers, since cameras aren’t allowed. A Facebook post says, ""Rittenhouse’s trial was streamed live for the world to see because he is a ‘white supremacist shooter,’ yet the one that is connected to Epstein and a global child trafficking ring for the elite and all we get is some cartoon drawing?"" The claim implies that coverage of the trials was handled differently because of the nature of the crimes and the people involved. There’s no indication that’s the case. Rittenhouse was tried in state court in Wisconsin, where cameras are allowed, while Maxwell is on trial in federal court, where in most instances cameras and recording devices are not allowed. Limitations on cameras and other recordings of federal court proceedings have existed for decades. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
