Jordan didn’t say Schiff is finally being impeached
","Former President Donald Trump said in 2019 that Rep.

Looking online we found no support for this claim. And news stories concerning impeachment, Jordan and  Schiff regard old impeachment hearings against Trump, not Schiff.  One of the videos shows Jordan addressing lawmakers on Oct. 21, 2021, when the House voted to hold former Trump adviser Steve Bannon in contempt for failing to respond to a subpoena from the select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

Why Trump is wrong to call Alaska’s ranked choice voting 'rigged'
","Alaska voters this year are using a new method to elect members of Congress that former President Donald Trump dismissed in remarks in Anchorage as ""ranked choice crap voting.""  Trump has perpetuated dangerous falsehoods for years that elections are ""rigged."" Now he says the use of ranked choice voting in Alaska is another part of rigged elections.  Ranked choice voting is a system by which voters rank candidates in order of preference, rather than choosing a single candidate. Election democracy experts say the system is not rigged; instead, it maximizes voter satisfaction by elevating the most widely supported candidates, rather than extreme candidates who are able to win races with large fields of candidates based on small bases of support. Trump held a rally July 9 to promote Kelly Tshibaka, the state’s former Department of Administration commissioner, who is running against fellow Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. He offered this description of ranked choice during his speech: ""So-and-so had five votes for fifth place so we are going to give them the victory. It’s crazy, it’s crazy. And you know who got it put in? Lisa Murkowski got it put in…She knew she could not win a straight-up election. So she went for crazy ranked choice. You never know who won in ranked choice. You could be in third place. They announced that you won the election. It’s a total rigged deal just like a lot of other things in this country."" Trump is free to dislike ranked choice voting, and he isn’t its only critic. Some say ranked choice voting hasn’t lived up to its ideals, but supporters say it encourages candidates to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters and increases voter participation.  Either way, Trump is wrong to characterize ranked choice voting as a ""rigged deal."" Ranked choice voting is a legal and secure way to hold elections — and it lets voters’ preferences drive the results. Trump also said Murkowski ""put"" in ranked choice voting. That’s wrong, too — the voters put in ranked choice voting through a 2020 ballot referendum that passed with slightly more than 50% of the vote.  We emailed a Trump spokesperson to ask for his evidence and received no reply.  In Alaska’s U.S. Senate primary Aug. 16, voters will each choose one candidate among more than one dozen. The top four vote-getters, no matter their party, will advance to the November election. Tshibaka and Murkowski are both expected to advance.  For the general election, voters will rank the candidates by their first, second, third and fourth choice. The lowest-finishing candidates are eliminated, with their voters’ second, third and fourth choices reallocated to those candidates’ totals. The candidate who wins 50% plus 1 vote, wins the election, going as many rounds as it takes. Trump wrongly suggested that someone in fifth place could win. First, voters only rank four candidates. And while it’s theoretically possible, it’s highly unusual for a bottom-of-the-pack candidate in the first round to end up winning. Of the 522 single-winner ranked choice voting races since 2004, the candidate with the most first-choice support has won 502 times, or 96% of the time, according to FairVote, an organization that supports ranked choice voting. Eighteen of those ""come-from-behind"" winners were in second place while two were in third place.  Ranked choice voting has been upheld by the courts and has been used around the country and the world, said Rob Richie, president of FairVote. It was used by Republicans to nominate now Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in 2021. It has also been used statewide in Maine, in New York City and in cities in Utah. Alaska’s approval of ranked choice voting in 2020 ""was widely and correctly seen as a very fair election,"" said Glenn Daniel Wright, a political science professor at the University of Alaska Southeast. Rigging an election would require multiple officials to agree to break the law across multiple jurisdictions, an impractical plot. Alaska’s structure of election administration includes multiple security measures, and those remain in place under ranked choice voting. ""Alaska has a long history of clean and professionally run elections and there’s no reason to suspect that’s changing now,"" Wright said. Election administration in Alaska is handled through the state Division of Elections, which sits inside Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer’s office. And Alaska has several rules requiring bipartisan oversight of elections on the state, regional and local level. Citizens are appointed to the bipartisan State Review Board that tests election tabulation equipment prior to the certification of results. Similar bipartisan election boards exist on regional and precinct levels, and a board is involved in the review of absentee ballots. Alaska uses other best practices for election security; it is a member of the Electronic Registration Information Center, a consortium that helps states share and update voter registration information, including death records. Alaska also has a paper trail for every ballot cast that allows voters to verify that their ballot is accurate. Alaska’s elections are transparent and allow for poll watchers to be on-site throughout the voting process and the public and media can observe review of absentee ballots. Jason Grenn, executive director of Alaskans for Better Elections, which spearheaded the ranked choice voting referendum, said that in 2020, after recounts, the review boards found no examples of widespread fraud or intentional misconduct by election officials.  University of Alaska political scientist Jerry McBeath said there have been cases in which ballots were lost or not delivered on a timely basis to rural areas. But they weren’t intentionally diverted. ""Almost all questions of elections in Alaska pertain to logistic questions,"" he said. ""They don’t pertain to perceived corrupt election officials who are ditching ballots,"" he said. Despite Trump’s assertion that the incumbent senator was behind the new voting process,  Murkowski’s campaign said she didn’t take a position on the 2020 ballot referendum. Some of the referendum’s organizers had ties to Murkowski, including Shea Siegert, who was formerly campaign manager for Alaskans for Better Elections and who now works for Murkowski’s campaign. Lawyer Scott Kendall, who served as campaign coordinator for Murkowski’s 2016 reelection campaign, litigated on the ballot measure campaign’s behalf. But none of this means that Murkowski ""put"" in ranked choice voting, as Trump said.  Political observers said ranked choice voting should benefit Murkowski, and candidates like her, because as a moderate, she gets a lot of cross-partisan support from independents and Democrats. She would have a harder time winning the Republican nomination in a primary; in fact, in 2010, she lost the GOP nomination but returned to Congress after running as a write-in candidate. ""Her positions accord with moderate voters in Alaska,"" said McBeath, including her support for abortion rights.  Trump’s remarks are ""mostly hooey, in my view,"" McBeath said. Trump said ranked choice voting in Alaska is a ""total rigged deal.""  Trump is free to dislike ranked choice voting, but his characterization is wrong. Ranked choice voting is a legal way to conduct elections, and the voters’ choices rule. Alaska has a history of secure and transparent elections run by bipartisan teams, and that structure doesn’t go away with ranked choice voting. In 2020, Trump laid the groundwork for blaming his loss on a ""stolen"" and ""rigged"" election — statements we found ridiculous. He is using a similar approach here in his efforts to denounce a senator who supported his impeachment after the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

Charlie Crist’s ad attacks Ron DeSantis on gun background checks
","U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist warned in a new TV ad that another term for Gov. Ron DeSantis could bring lax background checks for gun purchases in Florida. ""Think about what’s at stake in Florida,"" Crist said in the July 14 spot, before referencing the governor's stance on abortion and his comments to high school students who wore masks to a March press conference.  Then Crist moved on to guns, ""Gov. Ron DeSantis ... opposes any background checks on guns, even for violent criminals."" Like federal law, Florida law requires licensed firearm dealers to conduct criminal history checks on prospective buyers. Someone convicted of a felony is prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Although DeSantis is a self-described ""big Second Amendment guy,"" PolitiFact could find no record of him condemning such statutes in Google search results or the Nexis news database.  When we asked Crist's campaign about his claim, a spokesperson said DeSantis hasn’t expressed support for background checks for anyone, ""let alone violent criminals."" But the campaign couldn’t point to a specific statement that suggested DeSantis opposes all background checks, either. Further, DeSantis hasn’t tried to remove such measures, though it’s not clear he could.  Asked about Crist’s characterization of DeSantis' stance, DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw said, ""Florida is a law and order state. Law-abiding citizens have the right to protect themselves."" PolitiFact found at least two occasions when DeSantis rebuffed efforts to expand background checks.  In 2020, Joe Gruters, a Republican state senator from Sarasota, introduced legislation that aimed to close the ""gun show loophole."" The bill would require a background check and a three-day waiting period on private-party sales at ""public places,"" such as gun shows.  While it garnered the support of then-state Senate President Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, the bill faced staunch opposition from the National Rifle Association, or NRA. DeSantis, whom the NRA endorsed in the 2018 governor’s race, questioned the need for the legislation during a press conference.  ""The fact of the matter is that anyone who is selling firearms is going to have to do background checks, unless it’s just a private sale,"" DeSantis said. ""But you’re not going to have a table at a gun show on a private sale."" DeSantis misrepresented the ""gun show loophole,"" which zeroes in on unlicensed attendees who perform private firearm sales at gun shows. Gruters' bill didn’t pass.  After the May 24, 2022, school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Democratic lawmakers in Florida called for a special session to address gun violence and tackle background check expansion. None of Florida's Republican legislators signed onto the effort.  In June, DeSantis criticized calls to hold a special session to address gun violence. ""With all due respect to these leftists, they just want to come after your Second Amendment rights.""  But he said criminals should not bear firearms. ""You focus on the criminal. You focus on the lunatic. You don't kneecap the rights of law-abiding citizens,"" DeSantis said in a June 8 press conference. In lieu of gun regulation, DeSantis said April 29 that he intends to sign a bill allowing ""constitutional carry,"" or the permitless carry of firearms.  ""We used to be a leader on the Second Amendment,"" DeSantis said during a news conference in Williston, Florida. ""There’s like 25 states that have already done it."" Twenty-five states, including Alabama, Idaho, Georgia and Texas, no longer require residents to obtain a permit from a law enforcement agency to carry a concealed gun. Florida is one of the more restrictive states when dictating how people can carry firearms, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Under existing state law, people who wish to carry hidden guns in public must obtain a ""concealed carry license"" from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which requires passing a fingerprint-based background check.  Floridians are generally barred from purchasing guns under state or federal law if they have been convicted of felonies or domestic violence misdemeanors. But concealed license applicants may also be denied under Florida law if they have been convicted of other violent misdemeanors.  A permitless carry law wouldn’t change federal law, which requires licensed gun sellers to check buyers’ backgrounds. Private sellers without federal licenses wouldn’t have to meet the same requirement for background checks. Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group with offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., told PolitiFact that a permitless carry law could allow people who dodged background checks through private sales to carry guns in public. ""The law would likely make people convicted of violent misdemeanors newly eligible to legally carry firearms in public spaces and also make it easier for people with felony convictions to do so,"" said Ari Freilich, state policy director at Giffords Law Center. Crist said DeSantis ""opposes any background checks on guns, even for violent criminals."" That’s misleading. PolitiFact found no record of DeSantis opposing existing federal and state laws that require licensed gun dealers to check prospective buyers' backgrounds. But we did find DeSantis speaking out against criminals possessing firearms.  However, he hasn’t supported efforts to expand the criminal background check requirement to include gun sales by unlicensed sellers. DeSantis also promised to sign a ""constitutional carry"" bill. If passed, the law may allow people who evaded background checks through private sales to carry firearms publicly.  Crist’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E677C0>],/factchecks/2022/jul/22/charlie-crist/charlie-crists-ad-attacks-ron-desantis-gun-backgro/

No, 100 corporations do not produce 70% of total greenhouse gas emissions
","If you're on the climate doom side of the internet, you may have seen claims that blame 100 corporations for producing 70% of all the harmful emissions that are driving climate change, otherwise known as greenhouse gas emissions. ""If every person on earth just recycled, stopped using plastic straws, and drove an electric car, 100 corporations would still produce 70% of total global emissions,"" says a 2021 tweet from self-described socialist @GoodPoliticGuy that was shared on several other accounts.  These social media users aren't the first — and they probably won't be the last — to place the majority of the climate change burden on 100 companies. The claim originates from a widely shared 2017 report from Climate Accountability Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group and the nonprofit charity Carbon Disclosure Project. Headlines from The Guardian, CNBC, Fortune and more claiming 100 companies are responsible for 71% of all emissions quickly followed. But the report found that 71% of global industrial greenhouse gases can be attributed to 100 companies from 1988 to 2015. Keyword: industrial, which represents a part of total global emissions, but not all of them. Total global emissions account for the greenhouse gases that are released from food production, burning gasoline, deforestation, oil production and more. The study focused on just the carbon dioxide and methane emissions from fossil fuel and cement production, which still make up a majority of global atmospheric greenhouse gases. It's wrong to suggest that consumers don't factor in global warming. Research shows the human activities driving climate change the most are from heating buildings, electricity use, agriculture, farming and fossil fuel-burning facilities and vehicles. The original study did not include emissions from land use, land use change or forestry, or from sources such as landfills, agriculture and farming. It also did not include data on indirect emissions, which come from purchased energy such as heating and electricity, citing concerns about double-counting emissions attributable to corporations. The study relied on data collected by the Carbon Majors Database, which focuses on greenhouse gas emissions data from the largest company-related sources. In other words, The data derives from records of carbon dioxide and methane emissions relating to fossil fuel (oil, gas and coal) and cement producers dating back to 1854. Richard Heede, the Climate Accountability Institute's director and the study’s co-author, leads the Carbon Majors Database. It contains operational and product-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions related to 100 fossil fuel producers, aka the ""carbon majors,"" which include ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Peabody and BHP Billiton. It’s difficult to discern how much total global emissions can be attributed to the top 100 polluting corporations, but there are ways to get a ballpark idea.  If you use the total global emissions calculated by the Climate Analysis Indicators Tool, an average of around 60% of global emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies from 1990 to 2015. But CAIT's research includes emissions from agriculture, land use and electricity that wasn't considered in the 2017 study. If you use the total global emissions excluding land use and land-use change and forestry emissions from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, then an average of around 63% of those emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies from 1988 to 2015. But Potsdam's research includes nitrous oxide and F-gases — fluorinated gases used in industrial applications — and considered only fossil fuel-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Heede said in an email to PolitiFact that his recent research — not yet published — indicates that the emissions the study considered (carbon dioxide and methane from fossil fuels and cement production) account for 70.4% of total human-made emissions from 1988-2018. That could mean that about half of total global emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies. But the timelines are not equal, and it's not peer-reviewed. There are many ways to categorize where greenhouse gas emissions come from, such as by country, by economic sector or, in Heede's research, by corporation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the United Nations body responsible for human-induced climate change data and the internationally trusted source for global emissions statistics. The panel divides total human-made greenhouse gas emissions into different economic sectors, including ""industry."" That's not to be confused with Heede's definition of ""industrial greenhouse gases,"" which includes all fossil fuel use and cement process emissions. Additionally, the 71% figure from the study that focused on 1988 to 2015 has become outdated. Heede said recent research from the Global Carbon Project now attributes 69.5% of global fossil fuel and cement emissions from 1751 to 2018 to the top 100 fossil-fuel producers. So, 100 corporations are not responsible for 71% of total global emissions. The study found that 71% of global fossil fuel and cement emissions can be attributed to 100 companies, and Heede was intentional with careful wording.  Heede also said direct emissions that come from company operations, such as extracting and refining oil, typically account for around 12% of a ""carbon major"" company's total emissions. The other 88% comes from the consumption of the products. For example, Chevron, the top emitter of U.S.-tied fossil fuel companies, directly emits harmful greenhouse gases when it explores new areas to drill oil or when it refines that oil into gasoline. But of the approximate 48,267 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent Chevron emitted from 1965 to 2018, around 42,474 of it (or 88%) is estimated to come from the cars burning gasoline, the airplanes burning fuel, etc. ""I hold the companies accountable for producing and marketing harmful products and for deceptively perpetuating the carbon age for fun and profit,"" Heede said. Climate activists have used the study to push for tighter emissions regulations and counter the argument of increased individual responsibility, like cutting out plastic straws or driving electric vehicles. Heede is doubtful either of the climate activists' calls will be answered. Without regulations forcing corporations to produce less, there is little reason to believe consumers will reduce their consumption enough to dramatically slow climate change. ""It is unlikely that human behavior will change enough to avert serious climate damages,"" Heede said. ""We love our stuff, we love to eat high on the food chain, we keep getting into wars over resources, we like the way we live: big houses, big cars, lots of material goods. Yet only a fraction of U.S. emissions are within our immediate control."" Retrofitting houses to be more energy- and carbon-efficient, driving an electric car and composting waste can help, Heede said, ""but industry and commerce and landfills and transportation will still have a large carbon footprint."" An Instagram post claimed, ""If every person on earth just recycled, stopped using plastic straws, and drove an electric car, 100 corporations would still produce 70% of total global emissions."" No, 100 corporations do not produce 70% of total global emissions. The 2017 study that is often cited found that 100 corporations could be attributed to 71% of fossil fuel and cement emissions. The difference between the two claims is in the denominator of the corporation emission equation: it's not all emissions, just industrial greenhouse gas emissions from 1988 to 2015. Research that accurately compares the total global emissions to the data collected from the 100 most-polluting corporations worldwide does not exist yet. The study tied emissions from consuming ""carbon major"" products to the companies that produced those products. So, in theory, everyone driving an electric car would create less demand for gasoline and decrease companies' emissions.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7DA00>],/factchecks/2022/jul/22/instagram-posts/no-100-corporations-do-not-produce-70-total-greenh/

Did Biden stop domestic oil drilling, as Herschel Walker said? Hardly
","Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for a hotly contested Georgia Senate seat, took a page from the GOP midterm playbook by accusing President Joe Biden of sabotaging the U.S. ability to produce oil, driving gasoline prices to near record highs. In a July 13 tweet attacking both his opponent, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, and Biden, Walker wrote, ""Gas is more expensive because you and Senator Warnock cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline and stopped domestic drilling, sending American jobs and energy overseas."" Gas is more expensive because you and Senator Warnock cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline and stopped domestic drilling, sending American jobs and energy overseas. https://t.co/ED5U0b4jEJ Biden’s move to stop the Keystone XL pipeline would not have affected the current shortage of supplies, because it would have taken years to build, though it could have an impact on oil supplies further into the future. In this analysis, we’ll focus on Walker’s other contention — that Democrats, including Biden, ""stopped domestic drilling"" for oil. Critics may not approve of Biden’s efforts to turn the United States away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. However, the assertion that Biden ""stopped domestic drilling"" is wrong on multiple levels, according to experts who study the oil industry.  ""The whole idea that Biden has reduced oil drilling or oil production is completely upside-down,"" said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Walker’s campaign did not respond to inquiries for his article. 1. Biden never acted to end domestic drilling; he sought the more limited goal of pausing new leases to drill specifically on federal lands. In an executive order issued about a week after taking office, Biden said his administration would ""pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters,"" pending a review of current policies, ""including potential climate and other impacts."" This order was far more limited than stopping all domestic drilling. It would not have blocked any drilling on private land, and it would not have stopped any drilling that stemmed from federal leases already in force. ""Stopping drilling on private lands was never on the table,"" Williams-Derry said. In fact, Biden couldn’t have stopped drilling on private lands even if he’d wanted to.  ""The federal government has no ability either to restrict or to mandate oil and gas drilling on private land,"" Williams-Derry said. ""Those decisions are made by private oil and gas companies, as regulated by states, not by the federal government."" 2. A court blocked Biden’s executive order. Within six months, a federal judge in Louisiana blocked Biden’s order on federal leases, saying that Congress alone has the authority to pause oil and gas leasing. This put those leases back on track. On April 15, 2022, the Interior Department announced its first onshore lease sale since Biden's moratorium, involving about 144,000 acres for drilling. Nearly all of that — 132,000 acres — is in Wyoming, with the remainder in Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Nevada and Oklahoma. The Interior Department applied new standards in picking the sites for its auction. It aimed to cluster new wells close to existing drilling to reduce disruption on new lands and make full use of existing roads and other infrastructure. It estimated the greenhouse gas emissions that would come from the new wells. It also increased the royalty rate from 12.5% to 18.75%. 3. Even if the court had let Biden’s leasing pause stand, oil companies already have a backlog of more than 9,000 approved permits that they are not yet using. From a federal regulatory standpoint, once a permit is approved, industry can proceed. But companies don’t have to immediately begin drilling, since their leases last 10 years and can be extended beyond that.  Once a company has a lease in hand, it can take a while to start drilling, since companies have to contract rigs to drill the wells and build a sufficient inventory of permits before rigs are contracted, said Jennifer Pett, a spokesperson for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a trade group representing oil and natural gas producers. Because capital investments are involved, companies want to feel confident that their upront outlays will be paid back with sufficient revenues. In a sector with prices as volatile as energy, this sometimes leads them to adopt a wait-and-see attitude rather than jumping right in. Still, it’s not as if private companies had nothing to work with. They were sitting on a lot of unused leases. 4. Oil production on federal lands has risen on Biden’s watch.  The bottom line is that oil drilling on federal lands has expanded on Biden’s watch. The number of federal drilling permits granted hit a new high, for instance. ""Even as the administration attempted to pause issuing new leases, it continued to issue permits to drill on already-granted leases,"" said Mark Finley, a fellow at Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies.     Production on federal lands has risen as well.   5. Under Biden, overall domestic oil production in 2021 came close to a record high. Beyond federal lands, domestic oil production has risen overall as well. Production under Biden has exceeded that in two of the four years under President Donald Trump. And the Energy Department’s official projection for 2023 shows domestic oil production hitting a new high.   6. The number of oil rigs in use domestically has risen steadily on Biden’s watch, following a low point during the coronavirus pandemic. Another measure of drilling intensity — the number of oil rigs in use — has risen consistently on Biden’s watch.   That said, oil rig counts have not quite caught up to the number in use prior to the pandemic. They are also well below the highs of 2014. There’s a reason for that, said ​​Hugh Daigle, associate professor at the University of Texas’ Hildebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering. ""Wall Street and other investors are looking for producers to be more disciplined with their capital expenditures to give a better return on investment,"" Daigle said. ""Unless investors see a long-term case for high commodity prices and robust demand, this situation will probably not change in the near term."" As with much else involving the private-sector oil industry, Biden’s ability to change this situation is limited. ""Streamlining the permitting process and helping alleviate supply chain bottlenecks could help, but this would only make a small difference"" in alleviating high gasoline prices, Daigle said. ""Releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve similarly help the global market, but only by a little due to the relatively small volumes compared to global demand."" Walker tweeted that Biden ""stopped domestic drilling"" for oil, driving gasoline prices higher. This is wrong on many levels. Biden never sought to bar all domestic drilling. He did try to pause future leasing on federal lands, but this was blocked in court. And even if it had been allowed to proceed, Biden’s plan wouldn’t have affected drilling on private lands, nor would it have impacted the use of existing leases on federal lands, of which there are some 9,000 that companies are sitting on without initiating drilling. In fact, oil production has risen under Biden, both on federal lands and on U.S. lands overall. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809688CE00>],/factchecks/2022/jul/22/herschel-walker/did-biden-stop-domestic-oil-drilling-herschel-walk/
"['Abortion', 'Virginia', 'Dave LaRock']","
No, Virginia does not have 'the most liberal abortion laws in the world.'
","Delegate Dave LaRock, R-Loudoun, recently put Virginia’s abortion laws into a global perspective. ""Virginia now has the most liberal abortion laws in the world,"" he said at a July 9 rally on Capitol Square, urging Gov. Glenn Youngkin to back banning abortions in the state. We fact-checked LaRock’s claim and found that although Virginia does some of the most lenient abortion laws on the planet, they’re not the most lenient. We examined LaRock’s statement by comparing the gestational ages at which abortions are allowed in Virginia, other states and other nations. Those ages have been the focus of debate since the U.S. Supreme Court in June overruled its 49-year-old Roe v. Wade decision, saying abortion rights are protected by the Constitution. The court, in its new decision, said each state should make its own abortion laws. Virginia allows abortions through the first two trimesters of pregnancy — about a 26-week time frame. About 98% of the state’s abortions occur during the first 15 weeks,  according to 2019 data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Extremely rare third-trimester abortions are legal if three physicians agree that continuing a pregnancy is likely to kill a woman or ""substantially and irremediably impair (her) mental or physical health."" You don’t have to go far on the globe to find a place with a more lenient law. New Jersey is one of six states that puts no limits on when abortions can be performed. The others  are Vermont, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon and Alaska. That’s according to Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion research organzation, and the Anchorage Daily News. Outside of the U.S., we were unable to find a nation that allows basic abortion rights as long as Virginia’s two-trimester limit. In Canada, each province and territory sets its own abortion laws and gestational limits, ranging from 12 weeks in Yukon and Prince Edward Island to 24 weeks and six days in British Columbia.   European nations generally allow abortions on request during the first trimester or slightly later. For example, Britain has a 12-week limit; Spain, 14 weeks; and France, 16 weeks. They all allow later abortions in special circimstances, such as when a woman’s health is in danger. Russia allows abortion on demand until 12 weeks of pregnancy. India has a 20-week limit. China’s abortion laws vary in different regions. Although LaRock was focused on the gestational age of fetuses, there are other facets of abortion laws that can be compared. Virginia, for example, only allows public funding of abortions in cases when low-income people are victims of rape or incest,or if the woman’s health in endangered. The state requires parental consent before a minor can have an abortion, and it allows some abortions to be conducted by nonphysician health care specialists. Guttmacher made a wide comparison of U.S. abortion laws as of July 20 and categorized each state’s receptiveness to the procedure. Eleven states were rated as more protective of abortion rights than Virginia.  We couldn’t find a similar rating of abortion laws around the world. But it should be noted that countries with nationalized health care systems — including Canada — publicly fund abortions while Virginia does so in a limited way.  LaRock did not quibble when we spoke to him. ""I should have said Virginia is among the most liberal states,"" he said. LaRock said, ""Virginia now has the most liberal abortion laws in the world.""  Virginia doesn’t even have the most lenient abortion laws in the U.S. Six states set no limits on when women may have elective abortions while Virginia puts its cap at the end of the second trimester — or about 26 weeks. The Guttmacher Institute considered additional aspects of abortion laws and found 11 states to be more protective of the procedure than Virginia.  LaRock’s has a point, however. Virginia’s abortion laws are among the most lenient in the world. We couldn’t find another nation that allows abortions on demand beyond Virginia’s two-trimester limit.  LaRock acknowledges his error. We rate his statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C147A80>],/factchecks/2022/jul/22/dave-larock/no-virginia-does-not-have-most-liberal-abortion-la/

No, a Tennessee court did not approve ‘No Jews allowed’ signs
","A panel of Tennessee judges dismissed a lawsuit from a Jewish couple who said they were denied foster care training by a Christian adoption agency. But the ruling led some social media users to misleadingly suggest that the decision gave establishments the right to legally erect ""No Jews allowed"" signs. ""Chancery Court in Davidson County, Tennessee, has ruled that taxpayer funded establishments can place signs that say ‘No Jews allowed’ ... as long as there is at least one establishment where services for Jews are provided,"" read a July 17 Instagram photo shared by actress Rosanna Arquette and others.  The photo is a screenshot of a July 6 tweet from the account @MaricopaAAPI. That tweet links to a Christian Post article from the same day about the court ruling.  The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post exaggerates what a recent court ruling in Tennessee said. The claim ""is misleading,"" said Breana Staten, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, whose executive director in 2020 urged Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee not to sign the state law that was challenged.  ""The court did not rule on the constitutionality of this law, but rather dismissed the couple’s lawsuit due to a lack of standing, as they were able to receive adoption services directly through the state,"" Staten said. In January, a Jewish couple — Elizabeth and Gabriel Rutan-Ram — in Knox County, Tennessee, sued the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services and Jennifer Nichols, the department’s commissioner, after a Christian adoption agency denied them services. Six other parties, including an official from Tennessee’s chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, joined the plaintiffs. The lawsuit challenged a 2020 state law that protected private religious foster placement or adoption agencies against lawsuits and gave them access to taxpayer funds. The law was criticized by some people, who argued that it would allow agencies to discriminate against LGBTQ families and others hoping to adopt, according to news reports. The plaintiffs argued partly that the law violates the Tennessee Constitution, which states in Article 1, Section 3, ""that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship."" The Rutan-Rams had sought to foster and potentially adopt a boy with a disability in Florida. To do so, they had to complete a foster parent training program and get a home study certification, which the Tennessee department required, the lawsuit said. The couple scheduled the training with the Tennessee-based Holston United Methodist Home for Children, a Christian child-placement agency that receives state taxpayer funding. Before the training began, however, Holston told the couple that it provides adoption services only to families that share its religious beliefs, according to the lawsuit. Holston is not a defendant in the lawsuit. ""I felt like I’d been punched in the gut,"" Elizabeth Rutan-Ram said, according to a January news release that Americans United for the Separation of Church and State sent out announcing the lawsuit. ""It was the first time I felt discriminated against because I am Jewish. It was very shocking. And it was very hurtful that the agency seemed to think that a child would be better off in state custody than with a loving family like us."" The couple said they had to abandon efforts to foster the Florida boy because no other agency in the area could provide them with the training needed to adopt an out-of-state child. Since June 2021, they have been foster parents to a girl from Tennessee and hope to foster another child, they said. Holston President and CEO Brad Williams told The Washington Post in January that forcing his agency ""to violate our beliefs and place children in homes that do not share our faith is wrong and contrary to a free society."" A three-judge panel in Davidson County’s Chancery Court dismissed the couple’s lawsuit in late June. The court did not decide on the constitutionality or merits of the Tennessee law. Instead, the court said the plaintiffs lacked standing. According to the panel’s ruling, in Tennessee a plaintiff must show a ""distinct and palpable"" injury, show a causal connection to the challenged conduct and show that the injury can be ""redressed by a favorable decision of the court."" The panel dismissed the lawsuit on several grounds, including that it was now ""moot"" because the couple had since been given training by the state and was approved as foster parents for a child in Tennessee’s custody.  Among the reasons for the dismissal, the judges said there was no increased taxpayer burden for the couple because of Holston’s rejection and that Holston’s contract with the state applied only to children in state custody, not children from another state. The panel also said the plaintiffs didn’t show that the state wouldn’t contract with a Jewish agency that had the same policy as Holston, ""therefore the Act does not single out people of the Jewish faith as a disfavored, innately inferior group."" One judge dissented, writing that the couple ""need not demonstrate that they would have been completely foreclosed from fostering/adoption ― only that they cannot compete for the right to adopt on the same footing as everyone else."" Americans United for Separation of Church and State said it plans to appeal the ruling. An Instagram post said a court ruling allows taxpayer-funded Tennessee establishments to put up ""No Jews allowed"" signs. The post exaggerates what judges said when they dismissed a lawsuit by a Jewish couple denied services by a Christian adoption agency because of their faith. The lawsuit challenged a 2020 state law that provides legal protections for private religious foster placement or adoption agencies that receive state funding and choose not to provide services to people who don’t share their faith. The court did not rule on the law’s constitutionality or merits, or say ""no Jews allowed"" signs are permitted if the establishment’s services were available elsewhere. The judges said the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue on several grounds, including that the lawsuit was moot because the couple had since received services from the state and fostered a child, and that the agency’s contract with the state did not apply to out-of-state children.

There’s no evidence that shooter at Indiana mall was a CIA asset
","On July 17, an armed bystander returned fire and ended a mass shooting by killing an assailant who fired into a crowd at a Greenwood, Indiana, shopping mall. The gunman killed three people and wounded two others before he was killed, but the actions of the armed civilian who intervened and stopped the attack are fueling online speculation that the shooting was a planned Central Intelligence Agency operation. One meme showed someone smiling with the caption, ""CIA bois activating their Indiana asset."" It was followed by an image of the same person looking crestfallen with the words, ""CIA bois when he gets clapped by a legally armed civilian less than 30 seconds into his assignment.""  (Screen grab from Facebook.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There’s no evidence that the gunman at Greenwood Park Mall was a CIA asset or that the CIA planned the attack. The 20-year-old shooter had spent a little more than an hour in a bathroom before emerging with a rifle and opening fire, CNN reported. He was stopped within minutes, when a legally armed bystander, Elisjsha Dicken, 22, returned fire, the Indianapolis Star reported. Greenwood Police Chief Jim Ison praised Dicken for his actions.  Police are still investigating the shooting and the motive of the gunman, who had a juvenile record, including a fight at school, but no criminal history as an adult, according to news reports. He’d quit his job at a warehouse in May and recently received an eviction notice, The New York Times reported. We found nothing that linked the gunman to the CIA.  The meme falsely suggests the shooting was a ""false flag,"" a harmful attack that is designed to look as if it were perpetrated by one person or group, but was committed by someone else. Following mass shootings, we frequently see unfounded claims that the attacks were ""false flags"" devised by government officials seeking to enact gun control laws. It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for an armed bystander to intervene during a shooting or attempted shooting.  After the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting in May, Pete Blair, the executive director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University, told PolitiFact that active shooter incidents are most often resolved by an attacker fleeing.  That happened in about 25% of 434 active shooter incidents from 2000 until 2021, according to annual FBI data. The FBI defines an active shooter as ""one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area."" In 22 of those cases, the shooting was stopped when an armed citizen, security officer or off-duty police officer shot the attacker. ""People at the scene did intervene, sometimes shooting the attackers, but typically physically subduing them,"" said The New York Times in its analysis of active shooting incidents. ""But in about half of all cases, the attackers commited suicide or simply stopped shooting and fled."" In May, for example, a woman shot and killed a man who started firing an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd of people at a party outside an Charleston, West Virginia, apartment complex, The Associated Press reported. No one in the crowd was injured. That an armed bystander stopped the mall shooting on July 17 is unusual. But it doesn’t show that the attack was part of a CIA operation. A viral post shared on Facebook suggested the Greenwood Park Mall shooter was a CIA-activated asset. The suggestion is tied to ""false flag"" claims, which happen frequently after mass shootings like the one in Indiana. Police are still investigating the shooting, but we found no evidence that the CIA planned Greenwood Park Mall shooting and an armed bystander’s intervention doesn’t show the attack was a ""false flag.""

No, the flu shot was not designed to spread cancer
","Amid a severe flu season, an inaccurate story on Facebook said that the flu shot is laced with cancer-causing ingredients but provided no credible evidence. ""Doctor blows whistle on flu shot: ‘it’s designed to spread cancer,’"" said a Feb. 28 headline on Meddaily, an alternative medicine website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We interviewed scientists who disputed the claim that the flu shot is linked to cancer. The story largely focuses on comments by Dr. John Bergman. We were unsuccessful in reaching Bergman. We messaged him on Facebook and received an automated message back that he no longer answers private messages. We searched for any credible newspaper articles that quoted a Dr. John Bergman about flu shots and found nothing. Meddaily wrote that Bergman ""has revealed the influenza vaccinations being used to combat the latest H3N2 strain, are virtually ineffective and being forced onto the public through fear tactics to spread cancer."" Meddaily also links to a video that has circulated for years by Dr. Joseph Mercola, who argues that the flu vaccine is ineffective. Mercola has been criticized by scientists and federal agencies for many years. The Meddaily article offers no credible evidence that the flu shot causes cancer. We sent the Meddaily article to three well-respected scientists who agreed the claims about the flu shot having ""cancer-causing ingredients"" or being ""designed to spread cancer"" were wrong. ""What does this even mean?"" said Aaron Carroll, a pediatrics professor at Indiana University. ""Wouldn’t you need evidence that it’s ‘designed to spread cancer’ to make such a claim? I mean, you’d have to think the absolute worst about humanity, including pediatricians, to believe that."" William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said that about 120 million to 150 million doses of the flu vaccine are given in the United States alone, in addition to millions of doses in other countries. ""Would the World Health Organization be promoting a cancer-promoting product? No,"" he said. U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a Feb. 26 statement that the flu this year has ""resulted in a record number of hospitalizations."" The federal government continues to research why the effectiveness is lower this year, however, a preliminary finding suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. The overall estimated effectiveness of the 2017–18 seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was 36 percent, as of mid February. The CDC continues to recommend the flu shot because it can prevent some infections with currently circulating flu viruses. ""Even with current vaccine effectiveness estimates, vaccination will still prevent influenza illness, including thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. Persons aged ≥6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated,"" the CDC wrote in February. Meddaily stated that the flu shot is ""designed to spread cancer.""

Donald Trump is wrong about wage trends
","Before meeting with his Cabinet, President Donald Trump held court with the reporters assembled at the White House. Among other topics, Trump discussed some of the economic achievements on his watch: ""Wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade, something that people have been waiting for, as you know. When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years, and wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they're starting to go up for people."" Previously, we rated  a similar statement by Trump about rising wages ""finally"" coming ""after years of wage stagnation"" as Mostly False. Trump’s recent statement is more problematic. We looked at the data for what economists say is the best measurement — median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, 16 years and over. This is a measure that tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment and it is adjusted for inflation. This figure has been calculated quarterly since 1979. It might be reasonable to describe the overall wage pattern from the mid 1990s to the mid 2010s as ""stagnant"" or ""unimpressive,"" but it’s not the case that they ""effectively went down"" over those two decades. In July 1994, median inflation-adjusted wages stood at $314. They peaked at $345 in early 2009, right before the Great Recession fully hit wages. That’s an increase of about 10 percent — not very strong over 15 years, but not a downward path, either. Even after weekly wages bottomed out in mid 2014, they still stood at $330, or 5 percent higher than the decade before. Again -- wages didn’t go down over that two-decade period. It is wrong for Trump to say wages are ""now, for the first time in a long time"" increasing under his watch. Wages had already been going up for nearly three years while Barack Obama was president, at a faster pace than the previous two decades. The significant upward trend in wages began in 2014, almost three years before Trump was inaugurated (and even before he had declared his candidacy for president). During the roughly three years before Trump was sworn in, median real wages rose from $330 a week to $351, or an increase of more than 6 percent. On Trump’s watch, wages initially went up and then fell enough to wipe out the accumulated gains. A few quarters of data can be subject to statistical noise, so there is not much we can say for certain about how Trump’s actions have or have not affected wages. . Trump said, ""When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years (when) wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they're starting to go up for people."" Wage growth during the two-decade period Trump is referencing was modest, even sluggish, but wages didn’t go down over that period, even accounting for inflation. As for wages finally going up now, they rose for almost three years before Trump took office, so it’s not credible for him to imply that he deserves credit.

Bernie Sanders, stumping for Paul Ryan opponent Randy Bryce, says Koch brothers gave Ryan $500,000
","At or near the top of liberals’ love-to-hate list are ""the Koch brothers"" -- billionaire industrialists and funders of conservative causes, Charles and David Koch. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders took a swipe at them with an eye-popping statement about campaign cash during his most recent visit to Wisconsin. The Vermont independent, who won the Badger State during his 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination for president, was keynoting a Feb. 24, 2018 rally in Racine for Randy Bryce. Bryce is one of two Democrats running for the southern Wisconsin congressional seat held by Republican U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan, who was first elected to the seat in 1998, has repeatedly said he won’t decide until spring whether he’ll run for re-election in November 2018. Sanders said: And this particular election could not be clearer in terms of the competing visions for America. It is not an accident that Paul Ryan now has, I think, $10 million in his campaign war chest. It is not an accident that the Koch brothers have given him $500,000 in campaign contributions. It had been reported a month before Sanders’ visit that Ryan had $10 million in cash on hand in his campaign account as of the end of 2017. But did $500,000 of it come from the Koch brothers? It may not seem like it sometimes, but there are still limits on how much individuals can give to candidates. We found Sanders’ claim is partially accurate, but takes things out of context. The money To back Sanders’ claim, his campaign directed us to page 364 of a January 2018 Federal Election Commission report filed by something called Team Ryan. The report shows that in November 2017, Team Ryan received $247,700 each from Charles Koch and his wife, Elizabeth Koch, of Wichita, Kan. That’s a total of almost $500,000 ($495,400). But were those campaign contributions given to Ryan? Not exactly. To ‘Ryan’ Team Ryan is a joint fundraising committee that raises and transfers money to three groups: 1. Ryan for Congress -- that is, Ryan’s own campaign fund. 2. Prosperity Action, a leadership political action committee run by Ryan that gives money to other politicians. 3. National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm for House Republicans. In disputing Sanders’ claim, Ryan’s campaign said the vast majority of the Koch money goes to the National Republican Congressional Committee, given that there are federal limits on what an individual can give to Ryan’s campaign ($5,400 per election cycle) and to Ryan’s leadership PAC ($5,000 per calendar year). Campaign finance experts from three nonprofits, the Center for Responsive Politics, the Campaign Finance Institute and Common Cause, confirmed to us that those limits apply to the Koch donations. That means the $495,400 in Koch money to Team Ryan would break down this way: Ryan’s campaign $10,800 Ryan’s leadership PAC $10,000 National Republican Congressional Committee $474,600 Two points worth noting as we close: 1. Team Ryan raised $44 million in 2017, a record for a House speaker in a non-election year.  In announcing the $44 million in January 2018, Team Ryan said it would be transferring $32 million to the NRCC. 2. The contributions by Charles and Elizabeth Koch were made 13 days after the House passed the Ryan-backed GOP tax reform that was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Both Charles and David Koch were major advocates for the tax plan, which cuts the corporate tax rate and estate taxes. Our rating At a campaign rally for one of the candidates running for Ryan’s U.S. House seat, Sanders said ""the Koch brothers have given"" Ryan ""$500,000 in campaign contributions."" It wasn’t the two Koch brothers but rather one of the brothers, and his wife, who contributed $495,400. The money was given to a joint fundraising committee controlled by Ryan. But it primarily funds campaigns of other Republicans because, by law, only $10,800 could go to Ryan’s own campaign fund.

Villaraigosa neglects key facts in claim single-payer ‘forces seniors off Medicare’
","Would seniors in California really be forced off Medicare by the single-payer health plan backed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom? That’s the allegation from former Los Angeles Mayor and fellow Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa, Newsom’s top rival in the crowded gubernatorial campaign. Two other Democrats and two Republicans are also vying to succeed termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018. At issue is Healthy California, or Senate Bill 562, introduced last year by Democratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara. It would establish one central government health insurance provider to cover all Californians. Supporters say the plan would save money by eliminating the need for private insurance and reduce prescription drug costs. But even some who back the idea question how the key details will work, including how to pay for it. The bill passed the State Senate last year but was shelved in the Assembly, where Speaker Anthony Rendon called it ""woefully incomplete."" Heated issue Despite stalling out, the plan has become among the most debated issues in the governor’s race. Newsom has offered support for SB 562, though he’s been nuanced about it. He has been attacked by other Democratic gubernatorial candidates, chiefly Villaraigosa, for backing a proposal that’s still light on details. In turn, the California Nurses Association and National Nurses United, which supports Newsom, has called Villaraigosa’s claims ""fear mongering"" and ""disgracefully intended to alarm seniors about their Medicare coverage."" Here’s Villaraigosa’s claim about the plan in a March 5, 2018 press release: ""Newsom calls any attempt to demand details of his $200 billion tax increase and plan to force seniors off of Medicare as ‘defeatist.’ I call refusing to say how you will successfully persuade Californians to more than double their taxes while taking away their Medicare simply deceptive."" This is not the first time Villaraigosa has made some version of the claim, and lumped Newsom in with it. ""Seniors have earned the right to Medicare as we know it. We should start the discussion with protecting this effective single-payer system, not with the Newsomcare plan to demolish it,"" Villaraigosa said in a campaign email on Jan. 25, 2018. Villaraigosa again criticized SB 562 at a gubernatorial candidates forum in Sacramento on March 8, 2018, saying: ""It would end Medicare as we know it. … Everybody that has an insurance program would be off of it."" Villaraigosa added that he still favors a single-payer system ""in concept,"" just not this specific bill. In this fact check, we focused on Villaraigosa’s claim the plan would force seniors off Medicare. We’ll save an examination of whether the plan is really a $200 billion tax increase for another time.  Visit PolitiFact California's Tracking the Truth series here to see all of our 2018 governor's race fact-checks.  Our research Health policy experts told us there’s a lot of uncertainty about what the single-payer proposal will do, if it’s ever passed. They said Villaraigosa’s statement is accurate to a point, but also leaves out much of the story. The text of the bill says it would honor the rules and benefits of federal health plans such as Medicare, which covers more than 5 million Californians. ""I think it is correct to say that the bill aspires to fold Medicare into the California single payer, Healthy California,"" Joy Melnikow, director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, said in an email. Laurence Baker, professor of health research and policy at Stanford University, added: ""It’s probably technically correct to say it (SB 562) intends to get rid of Medicare. It’s also fair to say we don’t know what it would be replaced with."" Partially true?  Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, agreed there’s some truth to Villaraigosa’s claim. ""I would rate this assertion by Villaraigosa as partially true. SB 562 would replace Medicare with a more comprehensive state program that would make Medicare beneficiaries better off, because it would be more inclusive than Medicare, and dramatically reduce out-of-pocket payments for supplement insurance and deductibles and copayments. The press release uses negative language to describe this change, which in my opinion is misleading,"" Kominski said in an email. All three expressed a degree of skepticism that the federal government would allow  California to incorporate Medicare recipients into a statewide single-payer plan. ""Whether a federal waiver would be granted to do this is speculative,"" Melnikow wrote. Evidence from Villaraigosa We asked Villaraigosa’s campaign for evidence supporting the claim. A spokesman responded with links to news articles that describe the plan and issued the following statement, which adds a bit more detail than the initial claim that caught our attention: ""Under SB 562, California seniors would no longer receive healthcare through Medicare. All federal funds currently going towards Medicare beneficiaries in California will be redirected to an unknown, state-run plan."" Villaraigosa has challenged Newsom to an in-depth debate on the single-payer proposal. Response from Newsom  In a statement, Newsom’s spokesman rejected the idea that the candidate supports any plan that would harm Medicare coverage: ""It’s outright fiction to suggest Gavin Newsom would ever advocate for a reduction in Medicare coverage. He will never support a bill that ends Medicare for anyone -- full stop.  Gavin strongly believes we need to double down on Medicare in California and was the first candidate in this race to support a federal Medicare for All bill. Under a Newsom state health plan, anyone eligible for Medicare would keep their Medicare, and Gavin will fight hard to guarantee comprehensive health care for anyone not covered under Medicare."" Newsom’s spokesman added that the lieutenant governor supports SB 562 moving through the legislative process, noting that changes will take place as it advances. The bill’s author, State Sen. Ricardo Lara, said SB 562 would ""equal or exceed the coverage"" of Medicare and other federal healthcare programs, through his spokesman. Our ruling Candidate for governor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed a single-payer health plan backed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom would force seniors off Medicare. That plan, also known as SB 562 or Healthy California, proposes to create one central government health insurance provider in the state by folding in all other plans, including federal coverage such as Medicare. So, in this sense, Villaraigosa has a point. If successful, the plan would eliminate Medicare in the state and create a brand new, untested system. Villaraigosa’s claim, however, ignores the fact that the single-payer proposal at least intends to honor all rules and benefits under Medicare and improve upon the system. His statement gives the impression that seniors would be forced off Medicare and left without healthcare, which is far from the plan’s stated goal. Notably, California would need federal approval to bring Medicare and other federal plans into its new system. Experts say this approval is, at best, a long-shot. Newsom, the frontrunner in the race for governor, has expressed support for SB 562, though he’s said it’s not complete and still needs to move through the legislative process. In the end, there is much that’s unknown about the California proposal, including whether it will ever pass the Legislature.   What we do know is that Villaraigosa’s statement about taking away Medicare is partially accurate, but leaves out key context and tells only part of the story. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Does Florida prohibit a gun registry? By law, yes
","In the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting, a Florida senator called for the reversal of a key restriction in current law over gun purchases. Florida's ban on a statewide gun registry ""leaves law enforcement in the dark"" as they try to figure out if a threatening person has a weapon or not, said Sen. Perry Thurston, D-Fort Lauderdale. ""Florida is one of only 10 states that totally prohibit a registry,"" Thurston said at Senate Rules Committee meeting where members discussed a school security and gun safety bill.   PolitiFact Florida wanted to look into his statement. Florida law does prohibit a firearm registry, based on Florida Statute 790.335: ""No state governmental agency or local government, special district, or other political subdivision or official, agent, or employee of such state or other governmental entity or any other person, public or private, shall knowingly and willfully keep or cause to be kept any list, record, or registry of privately owned firearms or any list, record, or registry of the owners of those firearms."" The rule was added in 2004 when former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush signed HB 155 into law. Then-Rep. Lindsay Harrington, R-Punta Gorda, sponsored the bill because of concerns from the National Rifle Association, according to a July 2004 St. Petersburg Times (now Tampa Bay Times) article. The story said Harrington was troubled when he heard that law enforcement agencies were collecting data on gun transactions at pawn shops, saying ""I don't think we, in America, want that type of thing."" The law echoes this concern. It says such a registry could ""become an instrument for profiling, harassing, or abusing law-abiding citizens based on their choice to own a firearm."" The statute also says if a registry fell into the wrong hands it could be a ""shopping list"" for criminals. The rollout of the law, however, was a bit shaky the summer after it passed. Spokesmen for law enforcement agencies in Tampa Bay told the Times they had many questions about the broad ban on any ""list, record or registry,"" and said they may need to hire additional workers to go through various paper and electronic records for deletion. The law required agencies to delete electronic data of pawnshop sales within 60 days, which could also make searches for gun information more onerous. ""It's a mess,"" Sherman Smith, the St. Petersburg Police Department's legal adviser, told the Times. ""This has really got me flummoxed."" There are exceptions to the gun records ban. Records can be kept on firearms used in a crime or people who have been convicted of crimes. Aaron Keller, a Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services spokesperson, wrote in an email these records would likely be kept by local law enforcement. Even in cases where firearm records are kept by dealers, those records are prohibited from being compiled into any list by any state employee or private person, according to the statute. So how does Florida’s ban on private firearm records compare to the rest of the country? A Thurston spokeswoman said his information came from the Giffords Law Center. The center, which supports gun restrictions, says seven states, including Florida, prohibit any registry of private firearms. The seven states are Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Vermont. Pennsylvania prohibits registries of long guns. Only one state, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia require registration of all firearms. Thurston said, ""Florida is one of only 10 states that totally prohibit a registry."" Florida law does explicitly say a registry of firearm purchases cannot be maintained. Thurston was close but not precise about the number of other states that prohibit registries. It’s seven, not 10. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E96C0>],/factchecks/2018/mar/08/perry-thurston/does-florida-prohibit-gun-registry-law-yes/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'PunditFact', 'Noah Smith']","
Has automation driven job losses in the steel industry?
","As President Donald Trump weighed imposing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, some commentators have warned that this would be a misguided approach. Noah Smith, a columnist for Bloomberg View and a former finance professor, wrote a column in which he noted, among other things, that a crucial issue facing metals-producing industries isn’t foreign competition — it’s automation. Tariffs, Smith wrote, won’t ""bring back good jobs at steel and aluminum factories. Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily."" That’s due to technological improvements, he wrote: ""Productivity has improved, even as demand has stayed more or less constant. Mathematically, that means fewer jobs for steel and aluminum workers. Tariffs won’t change that equation. If anything, by hurting downstream industries like car and equipment manufacturers, the new import taxes will probably kill more factory jobs than they save."" We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but we wondered whether Smith is right about the trend lines for production and employment in the American metals-producing sector since 1990. And when we took a closer look, we found that he’s on target. We found data for employment in the primary metals-producing sector, which incorporates five subcategories: iron and steel mills, steel product manufacturing from purchased steel, aluminum production and processing, production and processing of metals other than iron and aluminum, and foundries. Employment levels in this sector have declined reasonably steadily since 1990, despite a period of stable employment during the late 1990s, a sharp but temporary fall during the Great Recession, and a modest uptick over the past year or two in which metals employment growth has outpaced that of the overall economy, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com. Overall, since 1990, employment has declined by about 42 percent. At the same time, production in primary metals has remained roughly the same since 1990 except for the Great Recession. For most of that period, production has ranged between 90 percent and 110 percent of the benchmark level (the amount produced in 2012): If you put these two statistics together, the overall pattern becomes clear: As production stays roughly the same and as fewer workers make it happen, productivity rises over time. The idea that steel in particular has experienced a productivity revolution due to technology ""is the same story I have been telling since the early 1990s,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""The basic story is that one person can produce a lot more metal today than he or she could produce"" a few decades ago.   Burtless said he has a brother who’s been working in the coke oven of a steel plant since the mid 1970s and who has ""seen first-hand the dramatic reduction in person-power needed to keep integrated steel mills running at full capacity"" — as well as improvements in quality. Michael J. Hicks, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, agreed that Smith’s analysis is on target. ""I would agree that the most likely cause of the productivity gains are technology, though I would interpret technology broadly to include not just machinery but the way that factories organize production, such as internal logistics and the reduction of redundant operations that might be enabled by technology,"" Hicks said. And J. Bradford Jensen, a professor of international business at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, added that ""imports did have something to do with the loss of employment in steel and aluminum, but the more important factor is technological change and productivity growth,"" he said. ""Tariffs won't change that, much like relaxing regulations on coal and pollution will not bring back many coal-mining jobs,"" he said. Smith wrote, ""Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily."" His numbers are solid, and experts agree that automation has done significant harm to employment levels in the metal industry. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DEE440>],/factchecks/2018/mar/08/noah-smith/has-automation-driven-job-losses-steel-industry/
"['National', 'China', 'Foreign Policy', 'Trade', 'Angus King']","
How much steel does the U.S. import from China?
","President Donald Trump said his administration would slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States, the latest in a series of moves to reorder the country’s trade arrangements along lines Trump believes are more favorable to American interests. The Trump administration has long criticized China for flooding the U.S. market with cheap commodities, and the 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum Trump announced March 1 seemed calculated in part to rein in what the administration considers unfair Chinese trade practices. But some critics, like Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, have charged that a steel tariff would do more harm to U.S. allies like Canada, and American small businesses, than it would do to China. Following Trump’s announcement, King said he heard complaints from constituents who run steel-reliant small businesses. King said one business owner reported an 8 percent increase in steel costs, and another worried about cost increases on steel imported from a nearby Canadian partner. While Trump may have a point about unfair trade practices, King said, Beijing would hardly bear the brunt of an import tax on steel, given its relatively small U.S. market share. ""China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S,"" King said during a March 4 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. So how much does China account for U.S. steel imports? We decided to mine for answers. Measuring U.S. steel imports by country is not as straightforward as it might seem. The American steel industry has argued that China has a backdoor to U.S. markets through a practice known as transshipment, whereby countries buy Chinese steel and modify it before exporting to the United States. Trump drew attention to this practice during March 6 remarks at the White House. ""If you talk China, I’ve watched where the reporters have been writing 2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that’s not right. They transship all through other countries,"" Trump said. ""It doesn’t look good when it all comes out of China, so they send it through other countries, and it comes to us. And it’s putting our steel mills out of business."" Experts we spoke to said there’s no hard data on transshipment, which makes the scale of this practice difficult to gauge. Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted the Commerce Department was unable to quantify the problem in a recent investigation — known as a Section 232 report — that probed the effect of steel and aluminum imports on U.S. national security. The report said only that an ""unknown portion"" of Chinese steel is further processed in third-party countries before entering the United States. ""It’s at least fair to say that the president is making a strong claim without solid evidence to back that claim up,"" he said. Alden added that the biggest targets of Trump's steel tariff would be the European Union, Japan, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Korea. (The White House is reportedly considering granting an exemption Canada and Mexico.) ""Except for Korea,"" he said, ""none of the others seems to be a transshipment concern."" Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the amount of Chinese steel that enters the United States through transshipment is not enough to call into question the reliability of the Commerce Department’s import data. He also pushed back on how Trump characterized transshipment. ""China sells raw and semi-finished steel to other countries, which then make more highly valued products. (But Trump's use of) the word 'transshipment' implied that the same piece of metal arrives, for example, in Veracruz and then is shipped to Houston with no transformation,"" Hufbauer said. ""This is Trump’s imagination.""   So let’s set the issue of transshipment to one side and focus on the steel products the Trump administration has eyed for tariffs. According to Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the only steel imports subject to Trump's proposed tariffs are those which have been identified by the Commerce Department. The department measures U.S. steel imports in two ways: quantity and U.S. dollar value. Under each yardstick, China’s share is relatively small. In terms of quantity, China accounts for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports, according to 2017 data. That’s far behind traditional U.S. allies like Canada (roughly 18 percent), the European Union (about 21 percent) and South Korea (nearly 10 percent). Expressed another way, the United States imported 740,126 tons of steel from China last year, compared to nearly 5.7 million tons from Canada and just over 5 million tons from European Union countries.  China’s share is slightly larger in terms of dollar value, but still relatively small. The United States imported just shy of $1 billion in Chinese steel in 2017, or 3.35 percent of the United States’ nearly $30 billion annual steel import market, according to Commerce Department data.  An aide to King pointed us to an interview with Bown, of the Peterson Institute, from September 2017, in which Bown said 4 percent of U.S. imports of steel come from China. But its proportion of U.S. steel imports, relative to other countries, has shrunk since then. In any case, he wasn’t too far off China’s 3.35 percent market share in 2017, in terms of dollar value. Experts largely backed up his broader point about the limited impact of steel tariffs on China. ""The numbers show that the tariffs will hurt trading partners — which are allies — much more than China,"" said Mac Destler, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland. Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg in Beijing, wrote that China’s total exports of steel and aluminum are equal to about 0.5 percent of GDP, with most of that from steel. ""Relative to fears from Trump’s campaign trail rhetoric, in which he threatened an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on all imports from China, these measures are extremely limited,"" Orlik wrote of Trump’s proposed tariffs. King said, ""China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S."" There are different ways to measure U.S. steel imports by country. In terms of dollar value, Chinese steel made up 3.35 percent of the United States’ nearly $30 billion annual steel import market in 2017. But in terms of quantity, China accounted for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports that year. King’s claim tracks closely to one of two measures. But in either case, King does not stray too far from the Commerce Department’s 2017 data. We rate this Mostly True.

""You can’t get any worse."" Are 49 other states really ranked higher on startups than Wisconsin? Let’s ask the experts. Study supports startup claim Startup research is a niche field that experts say is only addressed in detail by one group — the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Olivia Hwang, a spokeswoman for Wachs’ campaign, said that is the research the candidate was referring to in the radio appearance. The foundation, one of the country’s leading entrepreneurship advocacy and research organizations, has put out an annual report for years ranking each state’s ""startup activity."" It’s a customized metric that combines number of startup firms per capita, percentage of the adult population that become business owners in a given month and percentage of new entrepreneurs starting businesses because they saw market opportunity (i.e. that weren’t previously unemployed). Their latest study, released in May 2017, ranked Wisconsin dead last for the third straight year. Nevada, Oklahoma, Wyoming, California and Texas topped the list, while New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Alabama joined Wisconsin at the bottom. We should note other measures of Wisconsin’s business climate place Wisconsin closer to the middle of the pack, as we noted in a 2017 fact check on Gov. Scott Walker’s claim that Wisconsin was a ""Top 10"" state for business. Wisconsin is 15th among all states in business survivability, with 51% of businesses remaining in operation at least five years. And Kauffman rated Wisconsin second in the nation for Main Street Entrepreneurship, another combined metric that looks at the survival rate and the per capita number of businesses and business owners. Wachs, a member of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. board, is one of 16 Democrats vying for a spot on the November general election ballot opposite Walker. Major opponents include state schools Superintendent Tony Evers; Milwaukee businessman Andy Gronik; state firefighter union President Mahlon Mitchell; Sen.

Jeff Sessions’ misleading claim: California bans police cooperation with ICE
","Does California ban local law enforcement from transferring prisoners to and even communicating with federal immigration agents? U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions made that claim in a speech in Sacramento on March 7, 2018, one day after the Department of Justice announced it’s suing California over allegations the state’s immigration laws obstruct federal authorities. Here’s what Sessions told a group of local and state law-enforcement officials in downtown Sacramento: ""California won’t let law enforcement officers like you and your people to transfer prisoners to ICE custody or even to communicate with ICE that you’re about to release them from your custody — people that ICE is looking for."" California has enacted laws — SB 54, AB 103 and AB 450 — that limit cooperation with federal immigration agents, largely in response to the Trump administration’s aggressive stance on immigration enforcement. But do those state laws really prevent local police from transferring prisoners to and talking with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents? We set out on a fact check. Our research Experts on immigration told us Sessions’ statement includes some truth, but exaggerates the limits on local law enforcement. Police and sheriff’s officials are prohibited from cooperating with ICE agents in cases where undocumented immigrants are in jail for minor crimes — unless they are presented with a federal warrant or criminal removal order. ""What the attorney general did is leave out important qualifying language,"" said Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the UC Davis Law School. ""It’s not as if state and local law enforcement never have to cooperate with ICE."" Senate Bill 54, often referred to as California’s sanctuary state law, says, in part, California law enforcement agencies shall not ""transfer an individual to immigration authorities unless authorized by a judicial warrant or judicial probable cause determination."" Notably, local law enforcement can cooperate with ICE when undocumented immigrants are convicted of about 800 serious misdemeanors and felonies, said Louis DeSipio, a political science professor at UC Irvine who studies immigration. ""ICE is also able to enter county jails to question immigrants,"" DeSipio said in an email. ""Transfers to ICE are authorized after conviction of 30 or so serious crimes. So, clearly, it allows for communication and transfers. State law does, however, seek to protect immigrants in jails for minor crimes and after conviction for those minor crimes."" 'Sessions is wrong' One expert took an even stronger stance: ""Sessions is wrong,"" said Bill Ong Hing, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and its director the university’s Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic. ""Under Senate Bill 54, communication between ICE and state and local law enforcement agencies allows passing on information about inmates who have previously been deported for a violent felony, or are serving time on a misdemeanor or felony and have a prior serious or violent felony conviction."" Gov. Jerry Brown said at a news conference following Sessions’ speech that he is still willing to cooperate with the U.S. attorney general on immigration enforcement targeted at criminals. That’s possible, the governor added, because of the limitations he demanded on SB 54. When we asked for evidence supporting Sessions’ claim, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department cited in an email three ""real examples of declined detainer requests and the release of criminal aliens back onto the streets of California since the implementation of SB 54."" They include three separate cases of undocumented immigrants arrested in California for a range of alleged crimes, from sexual abuse of a minor to vehicle theft to felony drug possession. Our ruling U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed California prevents local law enforcement from communicating with and transferring prisoners to federal immigration agents. There are limits on cooperation under California’s SB 54. Local law enforcement are prohibited from working with immigration agents in cases where undocumented immigrants are charged with minor crimes, unless they are presented with a federal warrant.  Notably, the law does not limit cooperation in cases involving 800 serious misdemeanor and felony crimes.

Are Democrats 'nowhere to be found on DACA,' as Donald Trump claimed?
","A deadline imposed by President Donald Trump for a legislative solution for so-called Dreamers has come and gone, yielding no solution. Trump blames Democrats, saying they have been absent from and uninterested in a deal. ""It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA,"" Trump tweeted March 5. ""Gave them 6 months, they just don’t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!"" It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months, they just don’t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal! The Trump administration in September began phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. That’s the Obama-era program that protected from deportation immigrants in the country illegally who arrived when they were children, often called Dreamers. On March 5, a federal judge in Maryland said the Trump administration had the authority to rescind DACA. In a separate case, a federal judge in California in January ordered the administration to resume accepting DACA renewal applications and to keep the program on the same terms and conditions in effect, pending a final court judgment. The question in this fact-check is  have Democrats been on the sidelines, as Trump claimed? We found Trump’s tweet ignores Democratic and bipartisan efforts to find a solution. And it also downplays the president’s own posturing that has impeded a deal. The White House did not provide an on-the-record response to our queries. Meetings with Trump: Trump and several lawmakers, including Democrats, met Jan. 9 to discuss a permanent law to benefit Dreamers, funding for the border wall and additional changes to the country’s legal immigration system. In the televised meeting, Trump expressed a willingness to work with Democrats and even to help the broader population of millions of immigrants in the country illegally. ""What about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive immigration reform procedure?"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Trump, since there is broad support for DACA but not for other immigration measures. ""I would like to do that. Go ahead. I think a lot of people would like to see that, but I think we have to do DACA first,"" Trump said. Republican lawmakers, however, rejected that idea, saying border security had to be part of the deal and not come at a later date. Toward the end of the meeting, Trump said he’d rely on the people at the meeting and approve their future proposal. ""I have a lot of respect for the people on both sides. What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with,"" Trump said. ""I have great confidence in the people. If they come to me with things that I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it because I respect them."" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and other Republican lawmakers met again with Trump on Jan. 11 to continue DACA talks. But negotiations took a step back after reports that Trump used disparaging language to describe some countries. Durbin told reporters that Trump ""said things that were hate-filled, vile, and racist."" Trump tweeted that Durbin ""totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting"" and that ""Durbin blew DACA."" Legislative attempts: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Feb. 28 sent a letter to Trump listing several bipartisan bills they said Trump has rejected. ""You have thwarted every bipartisan, narrow agreement that seeks to provide relief to Dreamers and instead have attempted to force a deeply unpopular, anti-immigrant agenda through Congress,"" the letter said. ""We cannot expect Congress to make any headway on protecting Dreamers until the White House and Republicans, who control every branch of government, choose to work with Democrats on a bipartisan DACA fix."" Two Senate bills dealing with Dreamers failed to get 60 votes. Both proposals included Democratic support. One proposal was sponsored by Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and John McCain, R-Ariz., the other by Sens. Mike Rounds, R-N.D., and Angus King, I-Maine, (most Democrats voted for it). The Trump administration opposed both proposals. On Jan. 11, a group of six senators — three Republicans and three Democrats — said they had reached a bipartisan agreement on immigration that addressed border security, the diversity visa lottery, ""chain migration"" and Dreamers. Trump also opposed that deal. ""The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime....."" Trump tweeted Jan. 12. A proposal from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, supported by Trump, was the least popular of four proposals voted on in mid-February, failing 39-60. Bipartisan groups of House lawmakers have also looked at ways to help Dreamers, including the Uniting and Securing America (USA) Act introduced in January and referred to a subcommittee. Despite repeated Twitter claims that Democrats are absent from efforts to help Dreamers, Trump has also acknowledged their involvement. ""While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!"" Trump tweeted Feb. 15. The next day, he tweeted that it was only Republicans working and that Democrats had abandoned DACA recipients. Willing to compromise on the wall: A major sticking point in the debates has been Trump’s demand for a border wall in exchange for a DACA deal. Some Democrats, in order to get a DACA deal, said they would discuss the border wall. ""The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!"" Trump tweeted Dec. 29. On Jan. 23, he tweeted again that ""if there is no Wall, there is no DACA."" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in January said he had ""reluctantly put the border wall on the table for discussion"" in exchange for strong DACA protections, but later rescinded that offer. Also in January, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said that while the border wall was ""a monumental waste of taxpayers’ money,"" he would be in favor of it if that’s what it took to help Dreamers. January government shutdown: In January, Senate Democrats demanded a solution for the Dreamers in exchange for their votes on a bill that would keep the government running. When the Senate took up a House measure that excluded a deal for Dreamers, many Democrats rejected it. With a failed bill, the government on Jan. 20 entered its first shutdown since 2013. (Democrats received criticism for supporting a previous short-term spending bill in December that did not address Dreamers.) As the January shutdown loomed, Trump bashed Democrats for withholding votes because of DACA. ""Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA. Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST!"" Trump tweeted Jan. 12. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s hours-long speech: Pelosi spoke for more than eight hours on the House Floor on Feb. 7, sharing stories about Dreamers and demanding a Republican commitment to vote on an immigration bill. Pelosi’s hours-long speech came as Republicans sought to pass another short-term government funding bill, opposed by Pelosi because it did not include protections for Dreamers. Congress eventually passed a budget deal after a few hours of a government shutdown. ""Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!"" Trump tweeted on Feb. 9. Trump tweeted, ""Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA."" This fact-check isn't about assigning blame to a political party for the lack of a DACA deal. In reality, both political parties likely bear some responsibility. But Trump underplays and ignores the efforts of Democrats to reach a solution to help Dreamers, including meetings with Trump, bipartisan proposals, and a stated willingness to discuss border wall funding.  We rate Trump’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1D4D80>],/factchecks/2018/mar/07/donald-trump/are-democrats-nowhere-be-found-daca-donald-trump-c/

Fake news claims that Michelle Obama has made hateful comments about America
","A fake news story says that former First Lady Michelle Obama has been diagnosed by a doctor with having a habit of making disparaging remarks about America in order to save her husband’s presidential legacy. ""Michelle Obama just received life-shattering news from the doctor"" read the headline on March 4, 2018 on NY FOX News, a blog with no real affiliation to Fox News, a Fox News spokesperson confirmed. The post was flagged on Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found many things wrong with this post. The story begins by accusing Obama of staying out of the public eye only to appear when slamming President Donald Trump. It goes on to say that she has been unofficially diagnosed by Dr. Lauren A. Wright, a public affairs professor at Princeton University and a board member of the White House Transition Project. The ""diagnosis"" referred to is the analysis of first ladies Wright gives in her book, On Behalf of the President. In the book, Wright describes the ways in which Obama helped shape her husband’s legacy from a personal place as a mother and wife, focusing on her use of social media. While Wright notes that Obama has made more speeches and major public appearances in her first six years in office than any first lady in recent history, she writes that they were in support of her husband’s policy agenda, not slams toward Trump and America. The NY FOX News post contradicts itself by claiming that Obama has remained out of the public eye yet tries to remain ""the center of everyone’s attention"" by making public remarks against America. The article notes that one of the biggest claims made by Obama was that America was a racist nation that needed her husband in office. Obama has spoken out about racially motivated remarks that were made against her appearance while she was in office, but she has never claimed that America is ""a racist nation."" The other claim made is how Obama was never proud of America until her husband had been elected to the White House, a statement made in 2008 that was taken out of context and was debunked as False by PolitiFact in 2017. The motivations of NY FOX News are unclear. The website appears to have started publishing stories on Feb. 28, 2018, most of which appear to be false. The website includes no contact information, has no ""About us"" page that we could find, and does list any authors. It does not appear to display advertising. The website is registered in Panama.

Are Oklahoma teachers the lowest paid? Nearly
","Oklahoma is drawing national attention as its teachers, often with the backing of administrators, edge toward a strike for better pay and benefits. A group that tracks corporate tax breaks chimed in on Twitter. ""Oklahoma teachers are close to striking,"" said the Washington-based group Good Jobs First on March 6. ""They are the poorest paid teachers in the US, in a state that gives nearly $500 mil in tax handouts to energy companies."" We looked at both the teacher pay and tax breaks in that tweet, and, with some minor caveats, both largely check out. Scott Klinger of Good Jobs First told us the group relied on a news report that used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data we downloaded from the BLS website confirmed that in 2016, the average annual pay of Oklahoma’s elementary, middle school and high school teachers all ranked last among the 50 states. Depending on grade level, the states ranked just above Oklahoma at the bottom are South Dakota, Mississippi and Arizona. The average across all three grade levels in Oklahoma was $41,834. Nationally, the average was $59,978. Those numbers, however, included private school teachers. Data gathered solely on public school teachers for 2017 by the National Education Association, an advocacy group for public school educators, tell a modestly different story. Oklahoma’s public school teachers stood slightly above those in South Dakota and Mississippi. The NEA separated teachers into two groups, elementary and secondary. But taken together, teachers in South Dakota made $42,668, those in Mississippi made $42,925, while Oklahoma teachers made an average of $45,245. The national average was $58,950. This table compares the salaries for secondary school teachers based on the NEA and BLS data. Secondary school teachers average yearly salary NEA 2017 BLS 2016 Mississippi $42,925 Oklahoma $42,460 South Dakota $43,145 Mississippi $43,950 Oklahoma $46,217 South Dakota $44,210 The cost of living varies between states and within states. Especially for Oklahoma where a third of the population lives in rural areas, cross-state comparisons of teacher pay become tricky. We explain that in depth in this article. By and large, the most detailed comparisons include factors that go well beyond cost of living and reach the same general conclusion that Oklahoma’s teachers are among the lowest paid nationally. Every two years, Oklahoma’s Tax Commission reports on tax expenditures. Those are dollars that the state didn’t collect in order to give some group or industry a leg up. For example, low-income residents get a refundable tax credit of $40, and there’s a tax break for people who buy electric cars. The tweet from Good Jobs First singled out energy companies as getting ""nearly $500 million,"" and we found a total of $493 million in the 2016 report. The single largest amount was $402 million to investors in horizontally drilled wells. Coming in second was $29 million for drillers of new wells. A break for the costs of marketing and transporting natural gas reduced state revenues by about $14 million. Approximately $500 million is large enough to make a difference. Total annual teacher pay for the three grade levels is about $1.5 billion, or about three times the value of the tax breaks. Which says nothing about the policy implications, but the amount is enough to matter in the overall state revenue and spending picture. Good Jobs First tweeted that Oklahoma's teachers are the poorest paid in the country. By one measure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that’s accurate. But that includes private school teachers, and the current issue of teacher pay in Oklahoma is all about contracts for those in public schools. A survey from the National Education Association that looks only at public school staff found that Oklahoma ranks third from the bottom in average teacher pay. That’s very low, but it’s not the lowest. The tweet also said the state provides nearly $500 million in tax breaks for energy companies. State data backs that up. The teacher pay data is the only wrinkle in this fact-check. We rate this claim Mostly True. Update: After we published, we explored the issue of cost of living in greater depth in a separte article. The current version links to that article.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097568580>],/factchecks/2018/mar/07/good-jobs-first/are-oklahoma-teachers-lowest-paid-nearly/

Claim about Donald Trump, federal judge and Sharia law is Fake News
","The first line of an online hoax about a federal judge, President Donald Trump and Sharia law is all you need to read to figure out the entire post is fake. ""22nd Circuit Court of Appeals Justice Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith made headlines this week when he overturned a ruling out of Dearborn, Michigan,"" said the opening line to the Feb. 28 webviners.com story, headlined ""BREAKING Trump Removes Muslim Federal Judge For Trying To Implement Sharia Law In America."" The problem is, there is no 22nd Circuit Court of Appeals. There are only 13 appellate courts below the U.S. Supreme Court — 12 Circuit Courts of Appeals and the Federal Circuit Court. And there is no Judge Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith. Overall, the story claims that a judge ""allowed two critical and violent tenets of Sharia Law"" to be practiced in the United States and that Trump used his executive power to remove him from the bench. Here’s a breakdown of the story and how separated it is from reality. ""When asked why the feds have the right to allow a man to brutalize his wife for speaking with another man and to beat her nearly to death if she were to act on her impulses, the judge mentioned the systematic infusion clause and said the Sharia Law should be allowed because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states,"" the story claimed. But as fellow fact-checkers have noted, there is no ""systematic infusion clause,"" and the 14th Amendment largely deals with citizenship rights. ""President Trump used an old precedent and an executive order to remove al Allalawaralahali-Smith from the bench, citing gross negligence of his duties and wanton disregard for the United States Constitution, reports As American As Apple Pie,"" the story continues. However, the website asamericanasapplepie.org is not a source of accurate news. That website’s About page claims everything posted on its site is fiction. ""It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical."" Webviners.com’s story also uses different names for the supposed judge, at times calling him ""Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith,"" ""al Allalawaralahali-Smith"" and ""Alallaha-Smith."" The Feb. 28 post is a variation of other stories debunked in 2017. Previous fake news posts claimed it was ""Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith"" who ruled in favor of Sharia law in the United States. PolitiFact Texas reported that in November 2017, the Facebook page for Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, shared a post from a website called trumpsolidsupporters.me, which made the same fake news claims as webviners.com did in February 2018. The link to trumpsolidsupporters.me remains on Miller’s Facebook page, yet an amended description for the link says: ""Well it looks like I may have been duped. This may be fake news, but I still think Sharia law has no place in the United States of America."" A webviners.com post claimed Trump removed a Muslim federal judge for trying to implement Sharia law in the United States. But the post is riddled with inaccuracies and cites as a source a purveyor of fake news.

Governor candidate Mahlon Mitchell didn't initially fight Scott Walker's Act 10 union-curbing law
","A Madison firefighter touted his anti-Act 10 credentials on Twitter while seeking to distinguish himself among the 16 Democrats looking to take on Gov. Scott Walker in the November 2018 election. Mahlon Mitchell, who is also president of the state firefighters union, boasted of his group’s response to Walker’s signature legislation in a Jan. 17, 2018 tweet: ""When @ScottWalker told firefighters we didn’t need to worry about Act 10, we said hell no, we stand with working Wisconsinites everywhere,"" Mitchell wrote. ""I’m not just against Act 10: I’m pro-worker. I believe that together we can rise as Wisconsin when we stand up for our working families."" Act 10 limited collective bargaining for public employee unions across the state, but exempted police and firefighters unions from the changes. So, did Mitchell and the union he leads give Walker the equivalent of a ""hell no,"" or is this revisionist history? Mitchell opposed Act 10… eventually Mitchell is part of a historically crowded Democratic field vying for a spot on the November general election ballot. It’s the second time he has pursued a statewide office, having lost the 2012 recall race against Republican Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. This time around, he joins a group that includes -- among others -- state schools Superintendent Tony Evers; Milwaukee businessman Andy Gronik; state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire; state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout of Alma; former state Democratic Party Chairman Matthew Flynn; Madison Mayor Paul Soglin; former state Rep. Kelda Roys; and political activist Mike McCabe. Mitchell — who took over as head of the state firefighters union in early 2011 — was a prominent figure in the Madison protests that accompanied the legislation, leading firefighters in and around the Capitol. When asked for backup for the claim, a Mitchell spokeswoman highlighted various YouTube videos that showed Mitchell at the protests. But that wasn’t Mitchell’s first reaction to Walker’s proposal. Mitchell was effusive in his praise of Walker in a statement he issued on Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin letterhead on Feb. 11, 2011, a week before he protested Act 10 in Madison: We are pleased that Gov. Walker recognizes the critical work that we do protecting the residents of our communities. We are there 24 hours every day, 7 days every week. We do our jobs regardless of conditions that we face. We also know that all public employees across this great state are hardworking, dedicated individuals. We all make sacrifices every day but the Governor recognizes that what we do is unique and we applaud him for recognizing that. Governor Walker from the time he was a State Representative has demonstrated that he understands what we do and why we do it and why it is so important to our communities. We know that state and local governments are facing tough economic times. We look forward to working with Gov. Walker, state legislators of both political parties, local officials, and other public sector unions in an effort to help solve the severe economic problems that our state is facing. Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for Mitchell’s campaign, said in an email that the statement came before union officials ""understood the full consequences of the legislation and the devastating effect that it would have on Wisconsin's workers."" ""As soon as the bill came out and they saw really what the effects would be, they came out against it,"" Smith said. ""You can’t say he wasn’t one of the leaders against Act 10 when he was out there day after day after day fighting it."" Eleven days after the statement, Mitchell said at a Capitol news conference that firefighters would be willing to take the same pension and health care changes as other unions if the governor would drop his push to limit collective bargaining rights. Our rating In a tweet, Mitchell said the first response of him and his union to the Walker proposals that became Act 10 was to reject them and ""stand with working Wisconsinites everywhere."" Mitchell did ultimately join the other union leaders in opposing the measure, leading marches and even bunking in the Capitol to protest the legislation. But his first response was to ""applaud"" Walker for recognizing that firefighters were ""unique"" among public employees. That’s a lot closer to ""yes, please"" than ""hell no.""

Donald Trump is correct about record-low ratings for 2018 Oscars
","President Donald Trump -- who has often invoked television ratings either as a sign of his own strength or of his rivals’ weakness -- appeared to take pleasure in the disappointing performance of the 2018 Oscars, which aired on ABC on March 4. Two days after the show aired, Trump tweeted, ""Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)!"" Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)! Was Trump right that 2018 marked a low point for the Oscars? Since the beginning of Nielsen TV audience ratings in 1974, yes. The 2018 show attracted 26.5 million viewers, down almost 20 percent from the 2017 show. (Both were hosted by ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.) Adweek noted that the 2018 Oscars ""won’t end up as the year’s highest-rated entertainment telecast,"" since it has already been beaten out by the post-Super Bowl episode of the prime-time drama This Is Us. This is not a one-year downward blip, either. Oscars viewership in 2018 fell by 39 percent from its level just four years earlier, in 2014, when Ellen DeGeneres hosted for ABC. The previous low of 31.8 million viewers came in 2008, when Jon Stewart hosted not long after a lengthy writers' strike ended. Here’s a summary of viewership totals since 2008: The all-time high for viewership came in 1998, when Billy Crystal hosted the ceremony and 55 million viewers watched. In 1998, the blockbuster Titanic won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture. Experts say the connection between high box office grosses and high viewership is more than coincidence. This year’s nominated films earned far less than Titanic, which had grossed north of $300 million by the time of the 1998 awards ceremony. The top earner among 2018’s best picture nominees was Dunkirk with $188 million, and only two other nominees this year made in excess of $60 million domestically. (All made additional money overseas.) Movie Domestic gross Dunkirk $188 million Get Out $176 million The Post $80 million The Shape of Water $57 million Darkest Hour $56 million Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri $52 million Lady Bird $48 million Phantom Thread $20 million Call Me by Your Name $17 million ""Most of the movies up for Oscars in multiple categories are films that average moviegoers have not seen,"" said Eric Deggans, NPR’s television critic. ""That's a function of our fragmented media landscape."" Among the widely seen films that were shut out of high-profile Oscars nominations were Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Wonder Woman, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Beauty and the Beast and The Fate of the Furious. Still, Deggans added that movie grosses aren’t the only factor to blame for low viewership. In fact, The Shape of Water -- this year’s Best Picture winner -- was the highest grossing film to win Best Picture since 2013, when Argo won. Rather, the longer-term -- and more intractable -- problem for the Oscars is the fragmentation of the television audience. And this goes beyond the impact of digital streaming, which isn’t tabulated in the Nielsen ratings. ""Every awards show on television has seen erosion, and many are notching record lows in viewership,"" Deggans said. ""There are more things than ever competing for an audience's attention, and more alternatives for people who might not want to sit through something as conventional as an awards ceremony."" Ratings for the most recent Grammys fell by almost one-quarter in just one year, while the Screen Actors Guild Awards fell by 30 percent and the Golden Globes fell by 5 percent. This year’s Super Bowl had the lowest audience since 2009. Trump said the 2018 Academy Awards show was the ""lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY."" He’s right, at least going back to 1974, when Nielsen started reporting ratings.

Is Florida’s plan to arm teachers the first of its kind?
","Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O' Lakes, is following President Donald Trump’s lead by supporting legislation that would arm teachers in the classroom. On The Ingraham Angle on Fox News, Corcoran said that Florida’s proposal to arm teachers, known as a marshal program, is unlike anything else in the country. The voluntary program would train teachers under the direction of local law enforcement. ""One of the things that we are doing in Florida is we have instituted, as President Trump has suggested, the most robust first-of-its-kind marshal program,"" Corcoran said Feb. 27 on Fox News. Corcoran may have spoken too soon, however. The Senate amended the House proposal on March 5 and removed the ability for schools to arm teachers. Instead, school official such as custodians, principals, librarians and counselors would be eligible for training to carry guns. The bill is now moving back to the House. Still, at the time of Corcoran's claim, the House and Senate were considering plans that would include teachers. So, we wondered whether Florida’s proposal was really a ""first of its kind"" like Corcoran said. At the time of Corcoran's claim, the House and Senate proposed school safety packages that established a ""marshal program,"" which would provide training to teachers so they can be armed on school campuses. The program would be optional, and school districts and law enforcement would have to agree to adopt the program. A school employee, who voluntarily enters the program, must get a mental health screening and receive 132 hours of training for firearms safety, firearm precision and discretionary shooting. Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said the one-of-a-kind aspect is the comprehensive nature of the program. ""I think the key word he used is ‘robust,’ "" Piccolo said. ""At 132 hours of required tactical training we have been unable to find a more rigorous system in the country."" According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least five states — Georgia, Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas — passed legislation allowing school employees to carry firearms at K-12 schools in the aftermath of Sandy Hook. Of those states, the closest plan to Florida’s proposal is in Texas, which has had its own marshal program since 2013. Out of the other four states, Texas requires the most training. South Dakota also has a similar program, just with a different name. In Texas, districts that choose to enter the program select a volunteer — a teacher, a coach, an administrator with the right to carry guns on school campuses. There aren’t solid numbers on the size of the program, since the identities of marshals are anonymous, but Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, told Trump that in more than 100 school districts in Texas, teachers and other personnel carry a weapon and are trained to respond to an attack. The Dallas Morning News reported that there has not been any reports of incidents involving marshals at schools. We sent the two pieces of legislation to researchers at the National Conference of State Legislatures to see if there were any major differences between the two programs. ""In my assessment, the programs are not all that different,"" said Jennifer Palmer, a research analyst, National Conference of State Legislatures. ""Both programs are designed to provide additional training for school employees for emergencies including active shooter situations."" That said, there some minor differences that Palmer pointed out, including the amount of training each program requires and where the firearm must be kept. Storage of weapon: Florida marshals can carry firearms concealed in holsters approved by the sheriff. If a marshal in Texas is in ""regular, direct contact"" with students, their firearm must be stored and locked. Training: Texas marshals are required to undergo 80 hours of training, whereas the Florida program would require 132 hours of training. Number of marshals allowed: In Texas, each school can appoint one marshal per 400 students, whereas Florida’s House bill would allow school districts to recommend ""school faculty and staff members"" with no maximum listed. Authority to act: Texas marshals are authorized to make arrests, however only ""as necessary to prevent or abate the commission of an offense that threatens serious bodily injury or death."" Florida marshals are only able to exercise authority with the ""limited purpose of responding to an active assailant incident."" Another similar proposal to Florida’s marshal program is in South Dakota where schools have the option to allow individuals to carry guns in school under the sentinel programs that was established in 2013. State law requires that sentinels be trained for at least 80 hours. The Florida marshal program closely resembles a sheriff-initiated program in Polk County, Fla. According to the Lakeland Ledger, Southeastern University, a private school in Florida, implemented a sentinel program that allows teachers to serve as trained special deputies authorized to carry weapons. Corcoran said the marshal program to arm teachers is the ""first of its kind."" Texas established a very similar program in 2013. South Dakota also has a similar program, just under a different name. Both Texas’ law and Florida’s house proposal have the same goal, which is to provide training to teachers and school employees to carry guns on school campuses.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
