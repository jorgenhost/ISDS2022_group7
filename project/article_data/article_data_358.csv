Wisconsin State Rep. Chris Taylor on the mark with prison claim
","Wisconsin’s prison system has been in the headlines, from problems at the Lincoln Hills School for Boys, the state’s juvenile facility, to an incident in which a Department of Corrections sergeant exposed the names of confidential informants at the prison in Redgranite. The agency’s troubles have attracted plenty of comment from state lawmakers, including State Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, who tossed in some numbers in a May 21, 2019, tweet. ""Our corrections system didn’t become a mess overnight. It is a result of the last 8 years of neglect where we saw the prison population expand and vacancy rates for correctional officers go from 2.9% to 15.2%."" Is Taylor correct that Wisconsin has seen an expanded prison population -- and more openings for correctional officers -- over the past eight years? Digging into the numbers As with other criticism from Democrats, there is no coincidence to the eight-year marking point -- that mirrors the time Republicans had total control in Madison. Let’s start with the prison population, and a May 2019 report from the Legislative Audit Bureau. The nonpartisan audit bureau noted the prison population declined from 2009 to 2011 (from 22,672 to 21,941), but has grown since then. As the report notes, ""the inmate population grew from 21,941 in 2011 to 23,675 in 2018, or by 7.9 percent."" So, Taylor is on track with the prison population What about correctional officer vacancies? According to the May 2019 audit bureau report, the turnover rate for correctional officers increased from 17.8 percent in fiscal year 2013-’14 to 26.1 percent in fiscal year 2017-’18. ""We found that employee turnover for adult corrections increased from 18.6 percent in fiscal year 2013-’14 to 24.0 percent in fiscal year 2017-’18,"" the report said. ""The turnover rate for correctional officers increased the most, growing from 17.8 percent to 26.1 percent and varied substantially among institutions."" That’s fine for what it is, but Taylor’s claim was for an eight-year period. For those numbers, we turned to data from the state Department of Corrections. The department’s data on correctional officer and sergeant vacancies (excluding Wisconsin Correctional Center System sites) from 2011 to 2019 shows steady increases, except for a dip in 2017, in vacant positions: 2011 -- 2.87% 2012 -- 5.49% 2013 -- 6.43% 2014 -- 6.46% 2015 -- 7.62% 2016 -- 11.25% 2017 -- 10.97% 2018 -- 12.36% 2019 -- 15.27% (through May 11, 2019) So, Taylor is on target on that part of the claim as well. What’s behind the numbers? Corrections officials have said the state’s low unemployment rate makes it hard to hire and keep workers. As a result, overtime continues to increase. According to a May 2, 2019,  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report, state agencies spent $80.9 million on overtime in 2018, with most of it — nearly $50 million — going to Department of Corrections workers. Daniel Meehan, a retired sergeant at Waupun Correctional Institution, blamed the worker shortage and rising overtime on Act 10, the 2011 law that dramatically curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. Raising wages won't fix the staffing problem on its own, he told the Journal Sentinel. ""In corrections, the job is undesirable,"" said Meehan, who worked for the Department of Corrections from 1981 to 2015. ""Nobody wants to do it anymore. Nobody’s applying for the job, and the ones that do, quit."" What’s ahead? On May 2, 2019, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced temporary raises of $5 an hour to workers at six prisons in hopes of curbing long-running staff shortages at those institutions. Until at least June 2020, officers and sergeants will get additional pay for shifts at Columbia, Dodge, Green Bay, Taycheedah and Waupun correctional institutions. The bonus will also be paid to workers at Lincoln Hills.   These institutions will now pay new workers $21.65 an hour — 30% more than the $16.65 an hour paid to those starting at most Wisconsin prisons. Veteran employees at the six institutions will also get pay boosts of $5 an hour -- an increase of more than $10,000 a year. The move was criticized by some since it leaves out officers and sergeants at more than a dozen other prisons and raised concerns that staff shortages at some institutions would widen if workers decided to transfer to the prisons that are paying more. Meanwhile, under a plan adopted May 22, 2019, by Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee, starting wages for Wisconsin prison guards would go up by more than 14% over two years — from $16.65 an hour to $19 an hour. More senior officers would also get raises of $2.35 an hour by 2021. Most other state employees would get 2% raises in each of the next two years, as Evers recommended. Our ruling Taylor claimed ""We saw the prison population expand and vacancy rates for correctional officers go from 2.9% to 15.2%"" over the last eight years. The Legislative Audit Bureau said the adult inmate population has increased in the last eight years, from 21,941 in 2011 to 23,675 in 2018, or by 7.9%. And Corrections Department numbers show she is correct about the staffing vacancies as well. We rate the claim True.

"['National', 'Transparency', 'Donald Trump']","
Is Donald Trump the most transparent president ever? No
","Time and again, President Donald Trump has asserted that his administration has achieved championship-level transparency. He did it in a tweet on Aug. 18, 2018, focusing on the White House’s cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller: ""I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion, No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!"" More recently, during a May 20 exchange with reporters on the White House lawn, Trump said, ""There has never been, ever before, an administration that’s been so open and transparent."" Then, four days later, Trump reiterated the point in another White House lawn exchange with reporters: ""I was the most transparent — and am — transparent president in history."" Trump specifically cited providing Mueller with 500 witnesses, testimony by his attorneys, 2,500 subpoenas, 1.4 million pages of documents. But does his administration live up to the hype? It does not, whether one looks at his relations with Mueller’s team, his refusal to release his tax returns, or his unwillingness to cooperate with subpoenas from Congress. In fact, several experts we contacted said they laughed out loud when they first heard Trump make this claim. One of those was Jeffrey A. Engel, the founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. ""This might not be the most dangerous"" of Trump’s questionable claims, ""but it is the most laughable,"" Engel said. ""It’s not as though Trump is the only president with a problematic record on transparency, but he has expanded the range and scope"" of those problems. (President Barack Obama, for instance, made 35 promises to improve transparency, and we rated 12 of those Promise Broken.) The White House did not respond to inquiries for this article, but White House spokesman Steven Groves did offer a statement to Politico. ""The president was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation,"" the statement said. ""He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations. The White House and the administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting executive branch rights and privileges. In addition, the president and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day."" However, our look into the Trump administration’s transparency record suggested that the current administration has been less -- not more -- transparent than other recent presidents. The Trump White House was partially, but not fully, cooperative with the investigation. It did turn over 1.4 million papers, and it didn’t stop some two dozen administration officials from testifying to Mueller. But in other ways, White House cooperation fell short. As we’ve reported, Mueller and his team sought for more than a year to personally talk to the president, but they were ultimately rebuffed. The special counsel eventually agreed to accept Trump’s written answers to questions, but his responses were ""inadequate,"" Mueller said, and contained dozens of instances where Trump claimed not to recall the information sought. Mueller also noted that Trump declined to answer questions about obstruction of justice, or questions on events that occurred during the presidential transition. In addition, Mueller documented instances of Trump trying to impede the investigation or directing his staff to do so, including firing Mueller. ""The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful,"" the Mueller report notes, ""but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."" While Trump campaign officials have testified in the past to congressional investigative committees, the White House has prevented officials — and even former officials — from testifying or submitting documents to Congress since the Mueller report’s release. These include former White House counsel Don McGahn, former White House communications director Hope Hicks, and one of McGahn’s top aides, Annie Donaldson. Trump has also sued to block subpoenas for his business records by the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and he’s sued to stop two banks he worked with — Deutsche Bank and Capital One — from cooperating with congressional subpoenas. Fighting over congressional subpoenas is not new. President Bill Clinton asserted executive privilege during the investigation into his affair with Monica Lewinsky, as did President Barack Obama during the investigation into the ""Fast and Furious"" program, in which federal agents allowed guns to be sold and brought into Mexico so they could trace the weapons. But experts say that Trump is well on his way to meeting or exceeding the scale of opposition by President Richard Nixon during Watergate, when non-cooperation with congressional subpoenas became a crucial element of impeachment articles against him. ""Trump has resisted oversight to a greater extent than typical, with blanket refusals to cooperate, as opposed to the usual give-and-take,"" said Eric Schickler, University of California-Berkeley political scientist and co-author of the book ""Investigating the President: Congressional Checks on Presidential Power."" Trump broke a precedent that went all the way back to Nixon of presidential candidates releasing a copy of their tax returns, usually for multiple years. House Democrats have demanded that the IRS release his returns, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has refused to do so. The dispute is expected to go to court. Trump regularly stops to take questions from reporters on the White House lawn or while he’s traveling from event to event. His aides do, too. But the regular, institutionalized and usually lengthier briefings by his administrations have slowed almost to zero. On June 2, 2019, the Washington Post reported that the last time press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders showed up for a regularly scheduled briefing ""was 83 days ago, a record period for not briefing the press. She established the previous record (43 days) in March — which broke the record she set in January."" And it isn’t just the White House. The Post reported that May 31, 2019, marked one year since the last Pentagon press briefing, which for years had been held at least weekly. Trump reversed a practice begun under Obama of publicly releasing White House visitor logs. After a lawsuit, the Trump White House agreed to a settlement in which a portion of those logs are released. Meanwhile, some White House staffers have been required to sign nondisclosure agreements, even interns, according to the Daily Beast. More broadly, the Associated Press released an analysis in March 2018 showing that ""the federal government censored, withheld or said it couldn't find records sought by citizens, journalists and others more often last year than at any point in the past decade."" And in November 2018, the pro-transparency FOIA Project released data showing that Freedom of Information Act lawsuits reached a record high in fiscal year 2018. (FOIA is a 1967 law that gives the public the right to request access to records from federal agencies.) ""I can’t think of an area where President Trump has been more transparent"" than Obama was, said John Wonderlich, executive director of the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation. Even one area that might be considered heightened transparency -- Trump’s Twitter feed -- actually serves to undermine scrutiny and openness. Trump’s tweets do provide an almost stream-of-consciousness report of what’s on his mind -- the kinds of insights that would normally emerge after a president left office and released diaries or wrote memoirs, said Laurie L. Rice, a political scientist at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville. The downside, though, is that Trump’s tweets often contain inaccuracies, contradictory information, or unclear arguments -- and unlike the give-and-take of press conferences, tweets cannot be immediately vetted by reporters. Twitter allows Trump to claim, without immediate pushback, that U.S. consumers won’t pay the cost of tariffs (False) or that past presidents always got high approval ratings when the economy was strong (Pants on Fire). Trump’s tweets are ""a form of government-to-public communication that circumvents the free press,"" said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. Trump said, ""There has never been, ever before, an administration that’s been so open and transparent."" Trump cited his cooperation with the Mueller investigation, but Mueller himself found several major shortcomings in the Trump White House’s efforts. Beyond that, the Trump administration has assembled a record of aggressive opposition to congressional subpoenas, a longstanding refusal to share his tax returns, a near-zeroing-out of press briefings, and larger numbers of lawsuits demanding the administration release information under FOIA. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971AEF80>],/factchecks/2019/jun/04/donald-trump/trump-administration-most-transparent-ever-no/

Barack Obama wrong on limits of US gun laws, machine gun sales
","When Barack Obama was asked at a recent event in Brazil about the most difficult moment of his presidency, he talked about the slayings of 20 young children at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. ""I had to go comfort the parents,"" the former president said May 30. ""Some of you may be aware that our gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, any time without much, if any, regulation. They buy it over the internet. They can buy machine guns."" Obama’s summary of American gun laws drew a quick rebuttal in the conservative press. Readers asked us to see how well his words match current law. We found some significant lapses. His characterization of regulation as ""without much, if any,"" is too loose to be fact-checked, but we can check out what he said specifically about U.S. gun laws. His comment on machine guns is especially off the mark. No, not anybody. Federal law bans many kinds of people from buying weapons. A list by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives includes: anyone convicted in any court and sentenced to a year or more in prison; anyone with a dishonorable military discharge; anyone convicted of domestic violence or subject to a court order against harassing or threatening an intimate partner; anyone addicted to a controlled drug or has been committed to a mental institution. An article in The Federalist, a conservative website, noted that people ""under 21 years of age may not purchase handguns from a gun dealer,"" and those under 18 can’t buy rifles or shotguns. There is a loophole with the age restriction, though. Informal sales within the same state create the opportunity for a young adult to buy a handgun. As the ATF guide notes, ""an individual between 18 and 21 years of age may acquire a handgun from an unlicensed individual who resides in the same state."" The bottom line is, people can buy firearms over the internet. Under federal law, it’s all the same, whether a person sells a weapon over the counter or over the web. The same rules apply. If the seller is in the firearms business, he or she must have a federal license and submit all sales for a federal background check. It is not legal to sell a gun to someone who is not allowed to buy one, but not every sale requires a background check that would alert the seller. If two people live in the same state and the seller isn’t in the firearms business (and federal rules define what that means,) then a gun can change hands without a background check. This issue lies at the heart of the push for universal background checks. As the Government Accountability Office described it in a 2017 report, potential gun buyers can shop from the websites of ""major retailers, online retailers, online auctions and marketplaces, online classified listings, online forums and social media networks, and Dark Web websites."" Most of the internet transactions are perfectly legal, with both parties going through all of the standard regulatory steps. There have been illegal sales over the web. In 2010 for example, a former FBI agent was convicted of selling over 50 firearms online without a license. But except for clandestine ""dark web"" transactions — operations set up to evade the law  — the GAO found that even informal sellers followed federal rules. Sellers ""on gun forums and other classified ads were unwilling to sell a firearm to an individual who appeared to be prohibited from possessing a firearm,"" the GAO reported. This is highly inaccurate. A machine gun is a fully automatic weapon, meaning one simple motion to squeeze the trigger releases multiple rounds. (See our work on how so-called bump stocks can blur this distinction.) Under federal law, no one can own or sell a machine gun, with one exception: ones owned before May 19, 1986, which are grandfathered in. And as UCLA law professor Adam Winkler told us, any sale or transfer of an old machine gun requires a special background check and a special license. Winkler called Obama’s sweeping language on this, ""absurd."" ""Plenty of weapons are not for sale to just anybody, including the machine guns he refers to, plus hand grenades, shoulder-launched missiles, etc.,"" Winkler said. Illegal transactions can occur. The GAO reported that someone sold one of its investigators an ""Uzi that the seller said was modified so that it would fire automatically."" But Obama was talking about what the law allowed, not whether criminals are able to skirt the law. People sometimes mistake a machine gun, which is an automatic weapon, for a semi-automatic weapon like an AR-15. CNN’s Don Lemon, for instance, made that error while talking about Second Amendment issues in 2014.  Obama said that in the United States, ""anybody can buy any weapon, any time without much, if any, regulation. They buy it over the internet. They can buy machine guns."" The assertion that anybody can buy a weapon flies in the face of the many types of people, from felons to drug abusers to spouse abusers, who may not buy weapons. Internet sales are legal, as he said, and they take place under the same rules that govern other gun sales. As for machine guns, they are strictly illegal, with the exception under legal controls of models from 1986 and earlier. Taking the elements of his statement together, we rate this claim Mostly False. Update: Initially, we did not hear from Obama's office, but after publication, Obama spokesman Eric Schultz sent us links to articles, including one from PolitiFact, that described how people circumvent gun laws. But a plain reading of Obama's words, by us and the firearms legal specialists we reached, is that he was describing current laws, not whether people were breaking them. Our rating remains Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BE4B40>],/factchecks/2019/jun/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-wrong-limits-us-gun-laws/

Northam wrongly says report confirms he wasn't in racist photo
","Gov. Ralph Northam says an investigation has ""confirmed"" he didn’t appear in a racist photo on his personal page in his 1984 medical school yearbook. ""I think it confirmed what I said all along, that I’m not in that offensive picture,"" Northam, a Democrat, said during a May 23 television interview on WHSV of Harrisonburg. We fact checked the governor’s statement, examining his two assertions: • He ""said all along he wasn't in the picture; and • The report ""confirmed"" he wasn't in the photo.  Northam’s governorship was rocked  Feb.1 when a conservative blog posted a photo on Northam’s yearbook page of a person in blackface standing next to someone in a Ku Klux Klan robe and mask. He issued two apologies that night. ""Earlier today, a website published a photograph of me from my 1984 medical school yearbook in a costume that is clearly racist and offensive,"" he said on his gubernatorial website. ""I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now,"" Northam tweeted, ""That photo, and the racist and offensive attitudes it represents does not reflect that person I am today or the way that I have conducted myself as a soldier, a doctor, and a public servant. I am deeply sorry. I cannot change the decisions I made nor can I undo the harm my behavior caused then and today. But I accept responsibility for my past actions and I am ready to do the hard work of regaining your trust."" The next day, during a nationally televised news conference, Northam recanted. ""When confronted with the images yesterday, I was appalled that they appeared on my page,"" he said. ""But I believe then and now that I am not either of the people in that photo."" Northam said he’d never seen the photo before, had no familiarity with its setting, didn’t know how it got on his page or the identity of the people in the offensive costumes. Northam confessed to wearing blackface at a different occasion that year, to look like Michael Jackson in a dance contest. ""...You remember these things,"" he said. Northam’s changed story added fuel to calls for his resignation from fellow Democrats. ""In light of his public admission and apology for his decision to appear in the photo, he has irrevocably lost the faith and trust of the people he was elected to serve,"" the General Assembly’s Black Caucus said. ""Changing his public story today now casts further doubt on his ability to regain that trust."" Since the news conference, Northam has denied being the photo. He’s said he told his advisers from the start that he wasn’t in the photo - an account backed by Clark Mercer, his chief of staff. Northam told investigators his original statements - that he was in the picture - were written by his staff and released with his approval under mounting media pressure for a response. Northam graduated from Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. On Feb. 2, EVMS hired McGuireWoods, a large Richmond law firm, to investigate the racist photo. A  54-page report by the firm was released May 21. Contrary to Northam’s assertion, the report did not confirm he was ""not in the picture."" ""With respect to the photograph on Gov.Northam’s personal page, we could not conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph,"" the report said. ""The governor himself has made inconsistent public statements in this regard."" Northam has said the photo appeared on his page by some unknown mistake. The report said, ""While we have identified no information that the photograph was placed on Gov. Northam’s personal page in error or by any other means not at his direction, we could not conclusively determine the origin of the photograph."" We asked the Northam’s office to show us the part of the report that, in the governor’s words, ""confirmed"" he’s not in the picture. Press Secretary Alena Yarmosky noted that investigators spoke to many of Northam’s former classmates. She pointed to a page in the report that says, ""No one we interviewed told us the governor was in the photograph, and no one could positively state who was in the photograph.""   That ""is in line with the governor's own assertion that he is not in the photograph,"" Yarmosky wrote in an email. ""I think it confirmed what I said all along, that I’m not in that offensive picture,"" Northam said about an investigation into how a racist picture appeared on his page in his 1984 medical school yearbook. But Northam has not said ""all along"" that he’s not in the picture. To the contrary, he originally issued two apologies saying it was him, then reversed course the next day. And an almost four-month investigation has not ""confirmed"" Northam isn’t in the two-person picture. ""... We could not conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph,"" the investigators reported. ""The governor himself has made inconsistent public statements in this regard."" The report offers scant cover for Northam.

Kevin McCarthy falsely says Justin Amash votes more often with Nancy Pelosi than him
","In the aftermath of his tweets referring to the Mueller report as evidence for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., has been called a ""total lightweight"" and ""loser"" by the president and will now have a Republican primary challenger. When House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was asked about Amash’s principal conclusions on the Mueller report on Fox News, he attempted to distance himself and the Republican Party from the Michigan representative. And McCarthy made a statement about Amash that caught our attention: ""He votes more with Nancy Pelosi than he ever does with me."" In an age of polarization — when rank and file members rarely deviate from their party leaders — we wondered if a Republican representative who breaks from the party still votes consistently with it. We used ProPublica’s Represent app to find out. (We also reached out to McCarthy's office but didn't receive a response.) ProPublica tracks every House and Senate member’s voting record and has a feature that enables users to compare representatives head to head. The database extends from the 112th to the current Congress, so we were able to compare Amash and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Amash and McCarthy, for nearly the past decade. Amash has voted against his party more than all House members this session — 32.6% of the time. But he has agreed with McCarthy for 65% of the roll call votes. ""Out of 220 votes in the 116th Congress, they have disagreed on 76 votes, including 3 major votes,"" the ProPublica article reads. However, the same comparison can’t be made between Amash and Pelosi for this session, because Pelosi is speaker of the House, said Derek Willis, news applications developer at ProPublica. In fact, ProPublica doesn’t even have a page to compare Pelosi to any other House representative in the 116th Congress because she has missed nearly nine in 10 votes. It’s not that Pelosi has been AWOL. Rather, there’s a tradition that speakers of the House do not typically vote. (Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, referred us to this precedent when we asked about it.) Richard E. Cohen, chief author of The Almanac of American Politics, said that there have been ""occasional exceptions"" to this informal rule, but that most speakers don’t regularly vote. ""On the other hand, Pelosi — like most speakers — almost always supports the legislative agenda of her party, at least rhetorically,"" Cohen said. ""So, it’s possible to match up many of Amash’s votes with Pelosi’s informal views. Even from that perspective, Amash often — but certainly not always — sides with the views of McCarthy and most Republicans."" Still, we were able to compare Amash to McCarthy and Pelosi using past voting records, when Pelosi wasn’t House speaker. We found that Amash has voted with McCarthy more than Pelosi for every term he has been in office. For example, in the last Congress, Amash voted with McCarthy 65% of the time and with Pelosi 29% of the time. McCarthy said that Amash votes more frequently with Pelosi rather than himself. But Amash has voted more frequently with McCarthy than Pelosi for every session Amash has been in Congress.

No, California won’t teach all kindergarteners that there are 15 genders
","Conservative critics have pounced on a new health guidance in California schools about gender. ""California to teach kindergarteners there are 15 genders,"" states the text on a Facebook video created by the Freedom Project Media’s Dr. Duke Show, a podcast that focuses on education. The show features University of Wisconsin Oshkosh English professor Duke Pesta, who describes himself as an education reformer. ""The state of California is now moving to mandate that kindergarten teachers teach 5-year-olds 15 different genders in every single California kindergarten school,"" Pesta says. The post has been circulating since Freedom Project Media first posted it in January. One video we found, shared by another group May 28, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the video’s claim outdated and misleading. Duke’s video stems from the California Department of Education’s health education curriculum framework, which provides guidance for K-12 school districts. In 2018, the department released draft revisions and opened it up for public comment. Hundreds of pages long, the document provides guidance on many health topics, such as nutrition and physical activity, injury prevention, alcohol and drugs, and yes, gender. While the LGBTQ community praised the new recommendations, sections on sex education and gender drew some criticism. Pesta’s video, for instance, zeroed in on a section about gender lessons for kindergarteners through third graders. But it does not interpret the guidance correctly. The framework states that many children have encountered gender stereotypes by kindergarten. ""The goal is not to cause confusion about the gender of the child but to develop an awareness that other expressions exist,"" the framework states. The framework suggests lessons and activities, such as showing images of children who don’t conform to stereotypes and inviting adults who might be a stay-at-home dad or a female firefighter to visit the classroom. The lessons are intended to dispel myths and link families with resources to help prevent bullying. The document mentions several books that can help, and The Dr. Duke Show focused on one in particular. The book, titled, ""Who Are You?: The Kids Guide to Gender Identity,"" reads: ""Some people say there are only two genders. But there are really many genders. I am … girl boy both neither just me! You are who you say you are, because YOU know best. For some people, the grown-ups guessed right about their body and their gender. This is called cisgender — when someone’s identity matches their sex assigned at birth. And for some people, there are more than just two choices. These are just a few words people use: trans, genderqueer, non-binary, gender fluid, transgender, gender neutral, agender, neutrois, bigender, third gender, two-spirit … and there are even more words people are using to describe their experience. This is called the gender spectrum."" Melina Sevlever, a psychologist with the Columbia Gender Identity Program, said there are actually more than 15 terms to describe gender identity, and some overlap. The suggested book idea didn’t last. On May 8, following objections by some parents about the sex education or gender lessons, the State Board of Education removed several recommended books about sex or gender, including ""Who Are You?"" While the book is still mentioned in the framework document from April, a spokesman for the state Department of Education told us that it will add a disclaimer stating that it is in the process of revisions expected in a couple of months. But even when the book was included in the document, there was nothing stated suggesting it was a mandatory lesson for kindergarteners statewide. That wasn’t the point. The book was mentioned as a potential resource that could be shared with parents and caretakers: ""Parents, guardians, or caretakers receive a handout with suggestions on how to initiate a conversation on growth and development with their child. Books such as It’s Not the Stork! A Book About Girls, Boys, Babies, Bodies, Families and Friends by Robie H. Harris (2008) or Who Are You?: The Kids Guide to Gender Identity by Brook Pessin‐Whedbee (2017) can be shared together."" Freedom Project Media went further than the draft suggested reading list, writing that the gender lesson was mandatory and pointing to the state policy that parents can’t opt their children out of programs about gender identity. But that isn’t right either. Under the California Healthy Youth Act, parents can opt out of sex education. The law doesn’t provide a way for parents to opt out of general instruction related to LGBTQ people if the lesson itself does not fall under the umbrella of sex education, which is education about sexual activity itself. For example, a lesson on Harvey Milk, who was California’s first openly gay elected official, would not be described as sex ed. A video Facebook post said, ""California to teach kindergarteners there are 15 genders."" The recently shared video from January criticized California’s draft health curriculum framework. At the time, the state document included some recommended books for parents including ""Who Are You?: The Kids Guide to Gender Identity."" The book listed various gender identity terms. But it was not included in the state guidance as a mandatory lesson for teachers of all kindergarten students in California. The controversy is also out of date, which some Facebook groups may not know about. On May 8, the California Board of Education decided to remove the book, among others, and the state is in the process of updating the document that lists the book.

There's no evidence Chris Jacobs is a 'Never Trumper'
","Rep. Chris Collins responded to the news that state Sen. Chris Jacobs, a fellow Republican, plans to run for his seat in 2020, by criticizing Jacobs on several fronts and repeating the claim that Jacobs is a ""Never Trumper."" ""With the radical Left laser-focused on resistance and obstruction, President Trump needs allies in Congress now more than ever,"" Collins wrote in a fundraising email on May 21, 2019. ""Chris Jacobs may act like he’s that type of ally – but in reality, he’s a Never-Trumper who will say and do anything to get elected to his next office."" Collins, of Clarence, is facing federal charges of insider trading and has been stripped of his committee assignments by Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. A trial is scheduled for early 2020. Collins hasn’t said whether he will run in 2020, but he is playing up his strong support for President Trump in the face of Jacobs’ announcement that he will seek the seat. Collins was among the first members of Congress to endorse Trump and has appeared many times on national television to support the president. Since Collins has several times repeated his claim that Jacobs is a ""Never Trumper,"" we wanted to know whether it was true. Jacobs says that he voted for Trump and supports his agenda, but Jacobs didn't trumpet his support during the 2016 campaign. At the time, Jacobs was running for New York Sate Senate in the 60th District, where Democrats had a significant enrollment advantage and only 26 percent of voters were registered Republicans.   We reached out to a Collins staff member seeking evidence supporting the claim, but over two days they did not respond. The Collins fundraising email contains a clip of a September 2016 interview with Jacobs on the state political television show Capital Tonight. In it, host Liz Benjamin asks Jacobs whether he is supporting Trump. Jacobs ducked the question.  ""I am 100 percent focused on my campaign,"" he said. ""I’m running for state office and that’s what all my efforts are going on right now. I just finished the primary and as you said, this is going to be a steep hill to run this year, and that’s all I’m focused on.""     During the 2016 primary campaign, Jacobs, of Buffalo, donated to several Republicans, but not Trump. He gave to the presidential campaigns or political action committees supporting former New York Gov. George Pataki, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, according to federal election data. He also gave to Collins for Congress, the same campaign that is now attacking him, as well as the New York Republican Federal Campaign Committee and former House Speaker John Boehner. Late in the 2016 campaign, after the now-famous Access Hollywood tape was released in which Trump referred to grabbing women's genitalia, Jacobs said Trump’s remarks were ""not presidential."" Nick Reisman at the blog New York State of Politics quoted Jacobs saying ""I’m appalled and disgusted at these statements made by Mr. Trump. They are unacceptable and most certainly not presidential,"" he said. ""There is never any excuse for objectifying or demeaning women."" In 2017, after Trump took office, Jacobs was critical of Trump’s response to the opioid abuse crisis, saying the president should declare a national emergency. Collins called Jacobs a ""Never Trumper,"" using the present-tense.  While Jacobs dodged questions of whether he supported Trump during the 2016 election and has been occasionally critical of him, there is no evidence that he is or was a ""Never Trumper,"" a label given typically to Republicans and conservatives who are outspoken that they opposed Trump’s candidacy and are opposed to his campaign for re-election. Jacobs today says that he supports Trump and his agenda. We rate Collins’ claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F9CBC0>],/factchecks/2019/may/31/chris-collins/collins-claims-jacobs-never-trumper/

No, undocumented immigrants aren’t impacting the waitlist for public housing in Houston
","Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson spent several hours in a congressional hearing answering questions about his department’s plan to evict unauthorized immigrants from government-subsidized housing. After the May 21 hearing, Carson tweeted at U.S. Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Democrat from Houston, about the lack of public housing available in her city. ""There are more than 100,000 American citizens waiting for public housing in Houston, TX,"" Carson wrote. ""Do you think they should continue to wait while people here illegally are taking their space?"" Carson’s claim is off base. He is right when he says there are more than 100,000 people waiting for public housing opportunities in Houston, but the delay is not because people who are not legal residents are taking up space in public housing. Housing assistance is limited to legal residents Carson did not return a request for comment, but information provided by the Houston Housing Authority shows that his claim leaves out important details. People in the country illegally are not eligible to receive housing subsidies or live in public housing. However, ""mixed-status"" families — those with family members of different immigration statuses — are allowed to live in public housing, as long as at least one member of the family is eligible to receive assistance (including children born in the U.S. or a spouse). Nationally, about 25,000 households of the 1.2 million living in public housing units (about 2%) have at least one family member who is ineligible to receive assistance, according to an analysis by HUD. In Houston, 42 households of the 22,500 that receive housing assistance from the city’s housing authority are ""mixed-status."" Put another way: 0.19% of households receiving assistance in Houston include at least one family member lacking legal immigration status. Tory Gunsolley, president and chief executive officer of the Houston Housing Authority, said assistance offered to these households is prorated, meaning anyone within a household who is not in the country legally would not be receiving any government dollars. ""This is what the rules have been and we have families that have followed the rules to their own detriment,"" Gunsolley said, noting that these families pay higher rents and report information about their family’s immigration status to the government. If they don’t report this information, they could be evicted. In the past year, the housing authority has had two evictions from public housing units and 17 ""terminations of assistance"" in the voucher program, but none were due to undocumented immigrants staying. Although rent is prorated for mixed-status families, they still have to meet the same benchmarks for eligibility as other households seeking assistance. The first benchmark is income-based. Gunsolley said earnings for the entire household are taken into account — including any income received by a family member who is in the country illegally. Income eligibility limits are set by HUD based on the median income in the area and the number of family members applying for assistance. Many factors contribute to Houston waitlist Gunsolley said more than 100,000 people were waiting for public housing at the end of March and more than 26,000 people were on the wait list for housing vouchers at the end of March, the latest available count. The public housing program provides affordable housing options to lower income families and the voucher program offers vouchers for rent to low-income families for units they have selected themselves. The waitlist has become so large that the Houston Housing Authority has temporarily closed it and stopped accepting new applications for public housing, Gunsolley said. ""We have fewer affordable housing units per person who needs them than most large cities,"" Gunsolley said, referencing data maintained by the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. The coalition, which advocates for more affordable housing options, listed the Houston metropolitan area as one of the ""most severe"" when it comes to shortages of rental homes available for extremely low income households, in a 2018 report. The Houston area, which includes The Woodlands and Sugar Land, has 19 ""affordable and available"" rental homes per 100 ""extremely low income renter households."" Other areas on the ""most severe"" list include the Dallas area, which also has 19 homes available per 100 households, as does Sacramento, Calif. Orlando, Fla., and Los Angeles both have 17 homes available per 100 households and Las Vegas has the least number of homes available, with 10 per 100 households. The Houston Chronicle, a PolitiFact Texas partner, reported that the problem in Houston has existed for decades, due in part to the city’s reliance on the market to provide affordable housing options as opposed to government subsidies. The crisis has only worsened in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which hit the city in 2017. In 2016, there were more than 27,000 people waiting for housing and in 2017 there were nearly 43,000 on the waitlist. In 2018, 107,800 households were waiting for public housing options in the city. A report from the Greater Houston Flood Mitigation Consortium published in March found that the ""damage caused across Harris County by Hurricane Harvey amplified the affordable housing challenge by rendering thousands of multi-family units unlivable and tightening an already competitive rental market."" Our ruling Carson said on Twitter: ""There are more than 100,000 American citizens waiting for public housing in Houston, TX. Do you think they should continue to wait while people here illegally are taking their space?"" There are more than 100,000 people waiting for public housing (or public housing vouchers) in Houston, but this waitlist doesn’t exist because individuals in the country illegally are taking up spots in public housing. Houston has struggled with a lack of available public housing for decades, a problem that has become worse in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Fact-check: Joe Biden’s defense of his 1994 crime bill and mass incarceration
","Joe Biden is getting criticism from both sides over the 1994 crime bill. The sprawling $30 billion package included money for drug treatment and community policing, along with billions for prisons and tougher sentences for criminals. As Senate Judiciary chairman, Biden was a prime mover, promising that ""there will be fewer people murdered,"" and ""fewer children will be turning to crime."" Times have changed. So far, two Democratic presidential candidates, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, have criticized Biden for shepherding a law that they say fueled mass incarceration. As the nation nearly doubled its prison population in the 1990s, blacks and Hispanics made up a growing fraction of men behind bars. Sensing vulnerability in the top-polling Democrat, Republican President Donald Trump tweeted, ""African Americans will not be able to vote for you."" It’s on the mind of the electorate, too. A voter at a May 14 Biden campaign event offered a question in response to Biden bringing up the bill and its gun control measures. (The law banned 19 types of assault weapons.) The voter was more interested in its punishment side: Audience member: ""So I’m going to bring up the bad part of the crime bill that you sort of referenced. So, I’m curious how you’re going to really repair a lot of the black and brown communities that have been ravaged by the war on drugs and mass incarceration, and not necessarily high-level policies aimed at all people living in poverty, but specifically people who are institutionally and structurally in poverty because of mass incarceration and the war on crime. ..."" Biden: ""Folks, let’s get something straight: 92 out of every 100 prisoners end up behind bars are in a state prison, not a federal prison. This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration — it did not generate mass incarceration."" Over the decades, no credible analyst has cast the 1994 crime bill as the trigger for mass incarceration. The evidence does show that the 1994 bill was part of a trend that was already underway. To vet Biden’s statement, we have to ask if the bill’s role was as small as he suggests. We found many factors drove mass incarceration, including trends in the states that predated the 1994 law. But the law was in sync with those trends and may have encouraged them.   Formally known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Biden’s bill reshaped American federal criminal justice in several controversial ways. It imposed mandatory life sentences for people with three or more federal convictions on violent crime or drug-trafficking charges, known as the ""three strikes"" provision. (Biden pushed back against efforts to broaden that provision to nonviolent felonies.) The law also dangled federal funding to states who passed ""truth-in-sentencing"" laws for state-level convictions. To get the money, states had to require violent offenders serve out at least 85% of their sentence. This was the product of political horse-trading between Democrats who wanted more money for drug courts and other programs to keep people out of prison, and Republicans who wanted to add more prison space. During the 1994 debate, Biden said it wasn’t enough to build prisons, because ""the prison population keeps growing to fill new spaces."" The Senate agreed to spend $6 billion, but the total spending rose to win votes in the House. The bill authorized $9.7 billion to add prison beds for states that met the 85% standard. But by the end of the decade, Washington had doled out only about a third of that — $2.7 billion to increase capacity by about 90,000 beds nationwide. (That’s a generous estimate that includes beds in juvenile detention facilities, medical beds and prison beds partially funded by federal dollars.) Taken as a percentage of the total jump in the adult prison population, based on how many prison beds were actually added, we can say the crime bill increased capacity, at most, by about 15% by the end of the decade. But focusing on the 1990s would overlook that the U.S. prison population exploded in the decades before Biden’s bill became law and continued after President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1994. ""The act didn’t cause mass incarceration,"" said Hadar Aviram, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings. ""Prison populations started rising two decades earlier, in the early 1970s, and by 1994 had already more than tripled, from 300,000 to over 1 million."" The U.S. prison population continued to rise after the 1994 act took effect. But the overall rate of growth actually slowed down. 4. The rate of growth of prisons SLOWED over the 1990s. As crime dropped over the 1990s, our punitive push was slowing. In a clunky way, we were learning that crime was fading.Until 2001. pic.twitter.com/W2thupoA7C Biden’s campaign staff said the lower growth rate showed the bill didn’t drive mass incarceration. Biden’s questioner asked specifically about blacks and Hispanics. Historic federal data is most complete for black prisoners, and there, the numbers show that the black incarceration rate was different from the overall trend. Based on annual reports by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the black incarceration rate rose from about 1,200 per 100,000 in 1985 to about 2,450 per 100,000 in 2000. (This is for both men and women. The rate for black men in 2000 was 3,457 per 100,000.) The white incarceration rate declined a bit between 1995 and 2000, falling from 319 to 281 per 100,000. It’s impossible to draw a straight line between any of these changes and the crime bill. Many factors play a role. ""Criminal policy is driven mostly by state and local decisions, not federal,"" Fordham University professor John Pfaff noted. Also, crime fell during the 1990s, and that relieved the pressure to put more people behind bars. At the same time, there’s an argument to be made that Biden’s bill helped to solidify the tough-on-crime attitude at the heart of mass incarceration, an attitude that some say Biden had a role in shaping. Udi Ofer of the American Civil Liberties Union argues that Biden's bill was part of a bidding war between Democrats and Republicans to be seen as the party that took crime control more seriously. ""The 1994 crime bill was perhaps most consequential in that it was arguably the moment when both parties, at a national level, fully embraced the policies and political posturing that resulted in the mass incarceration crisis we are trying to fix today,"" Ofer said. But the broader cultural and political impact of Biden’s crime bill is debatable. While Biden’s bill incentivized states to adopt truth-in-sentencing laws that would effectively extend the amount of time offenders’ served on average, most states had already passed such measures by the time the federal law took effect. Almost all states that adopted them afterward said that the bill didn't really influence their decisions, Pfaff said. A 1998 congressional study found that out of 27 states that got grants, 11 said the federal money played only a partial role in changing state law, and just 4 said it was a key factor. The Biden campaign pointed to that report, and another from the Urban Institute, a Washington-based policy group, that reached a similar conclusion. ""I remain skeptical that the 1994 bill shaped the public narrative,"" Pfaff said. ""I think it is much more likely that, in general, the bill reflected the already punitive attitudes in the early 1990s."" Some criminal justice activists note that Biden had a hand in at least some of the earlier measures that helped mass incarceration take root. ""Biden was a sponsor and in many cases the primary architect of every significant federal bill in the ‘80s and ‘90s that exacerbated and continued mass incarceration,"" said Ed Chung of the progressive think tank Center for American Progress. He cited the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, as well as anti-drug abuse acts of 1986 and 1988 as examples. Biden co-sponsored that 1984 bill which, among many other changes, imposed mandatory minimum sentences. The U.S. Sentencing Commission reported in 2001 that ""whites are more likely than non-whites to be sentenced below the applicable mandatory minimum."" Biden also co-sponsored 1986 legislation that treated crack cocaine, which was ravaging black communities, far more harshly than powdered cocaine, which was more common among white drug users. Selling 5 grams of crack triggered the same penalty as 500 grams of cocaine powder. The Sentencing Commission reported that ""blacks accounted for 88.3% of federal crack cocaine distribution convictions in 1993."" In 2007, Biden introduced a bill to treat crack and powdered cocaine the same. The sentencing disparities remained until 2010, when Congress, with the backing of the Obama administration, passed the Fair Sentencing Act. (Read more about Obama’s efforts.) Biden said his 1994 crime bill ""did not generate mass incarceration."" In the strictest sense, the law did not launch the massive rise in the prison population. But it was in keeping with pre-existing trends at the state level, and in a limited way, provided funds to expand and keep policies in place that would increase the number of people behind bars. At the same time, the crime bill funded other programs and made changes aimed at keeping people out of prison.

Pocan says Trump tweet “directly contradicted” Mueller comments
","In a long-awaited public statement on the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said — and didn’t say — a lot. Mueller leaned heavily on his previously released report in describing the two-year investigation, which left some elements open to interpretation. President Donald Trump was quick to provide his own analysis, tweeting after the May 29, 2019 news conference, ""Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you."" U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, took issue with that characterization. ""The President’s claim that ‘There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed!’ is incorrect and in direct contradiction to what Special Counsel Mueller said earlier today,"" Pocan tweeted. Is Pocan — who has called for Trump to be impeached — right that the President contradicted Mueller’s comments? These are murky waters, but let’s dive in. The core of Trump’s tweet — and therefore Pocan’s claim about it — is the reference to ""insufficient evidence."" Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you. What did Mueller say about that? ""The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election,"" Mueller said, reading from notes at the Justice Department news conference. ""This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign’s response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy."" So Mueller made a vague reference to ""insufficient evidence"" of a conspiracy related to Russian interference. Trump’s tweet, meanwhile, implies a much more specific and far-reaching meaning — that there was no evidence Trump himself committed any crime. Mueller said no such thing. In fact, Mueller addressed a potential interpretation like Trump’s in his comments. ""After that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,"" Mueller said. ""We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime."" What’s more, Mueller said his office didn’t assess whether Trump committed a crime — because it could not issue any such charges against a sitting president anyway. ""Under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional,"" Mueller said. ""Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider. … It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge."" He went on to refer to impeachment as the only way to address such a matter. ""The (Department of Justice) opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" Mueller said. ""Those were the principles under which we operated. And from them, we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime."" Ron Boehmer, a spokesman for Pocan, said the congressman’s tweet was referring to this limitation. ""Special Counsel Mueller did not reference insufficient evidence, but rather a restriction on being able to charge the President and made it very clear that he could not be cleared,"" Boehmer said in an email. So, Pocan’s ""direct contradiction"" claim isn’t exactly cut and dried. Trump did use the same term as Mueller. But it’s clear Trump over-reached in his summary of Mueller’s comments, claiming a level of vindication that Mueller didn’t offer. Pocan said Trump’s response to Mueller — that there was ""insufficient evidence"" and therefore Trump is innocent — is ""in direct contradiction"" to what Mueller said. Mueller did use the term ""insufficient evidence,"" but that was in a generic reference to proof of a broad conspiracy involving Russian election interference. Trump’s tweet treats that statement as a commentary on his own guilt or innocence. In actuality, Mueller was very clear that he cannot charge a sitting president with a crime, and therefore out of fairness couldn’t even accuse him of one. And Mueller was careful to note, ""if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That fits here.

Fact-checking presidential hopeful John Hickenlooper on beating NRA with 'tough' Colorado gun laws
","The field of candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 is about as crowded as advertising on a NASCAR racecar. Aiming to stand out, John Hickenlooper made claims on ABC’s ""This Week"" about getting things done during his time as Colorado’s chief executive. ""We've achieved almost universal health care coverage, and we beat the NRA with tough, tough gun laws,"" the former governor said. We’ve already rated as Mostly True Hickenlooper’s claim about universal health coverage. Now let’s see about beating the National Rifle Association. Hickenlooper’s campaign told us the candidate was alluding to two gun measures he signed into law in 2013, eight months after dozens of people were shot at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. 1. Requiring universal background checks Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers to obtain background checks on people they sell firearms to. One of the Colorado laws extends that requirement: Before anyone transfers possession of a firearm, including through private or online gun sales, he or she must arrange for a licensed dealer to obtain a background check. There are some exceptions, such as gifts between immediate family members. The law is tough in that Colorado is among only 11 states that require universal background checks, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. 2. Limiting magazine sizes Another law prohibits the sale, transfer or possession of magazines with more than 15 rounds of ammunition. Currently, Colorado is one of only nine states that ban large-capacity ammunition magazines, according to the Giffords center. The Denver Post reported in 2013 that California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts still had tougher gun laws than Colorado. But the new laws made Colorado stricter than other states in the Mountain West. So, did Hickenlooper and the Colorado Legislature, then controlled by fellow Democrats, defeat the NRA in getting those laws passed? We found that most news coverage described the legislation as a loss for the NRA. The New Yorker headlined a 2018 article, ""How Colorado Gun-Control Advocates Beat the NRA."" There’s more evidence of the opposition: The NRA established a website aimed at mobilizing opposition to the bills and took out print advertisements in Colorado newspapers attacking Hickenlooper, the Huffington Post reported at the time. A month before Hickenlooper signed the bills, an NRA spokeswoman told the Denver Post that the NRA opposed the bills because they would ""severely restrict your rights to keep and bear arms in Colorado."" The day before the signing, the NRA issued a statement saying that although Hickenlooper ""seems intent on signing this deeply flawed legislation into law, please contact him NOW and strongly urge him to veto"" the bills. In a statement on the signing of the legislation, the NRA said: ""The fight in Colorado to protect and now restore your individual rights is anything but over.  In the coming days, weeks and months, the NRA will be using every available resource at its disposal to rectify this situation."" For this fact-check, the NRA did not deny to us its opposition to the measures or say that the Colorado legislation is not ""tough."" It’s worth noting, however, that it’s not entirely clear how important the NRA’s opposition was. In news reports about Hickenlooper signing the bills, the Denver Post, the Colorado Gazette, the Associated Press and the New York Times did not cite opposition from the NRA. At the same time, the NRA wasn’t exactly toothless. It touted the fact that two other bills considered at the time did not become law. One bill would have repealed Colorado’s law allowing individuals with a concealed carry permit to carry a firearm on a college campus. The other bill would have held manufacturers, distributors and owners of guns they produce, sell or use, liable if that gun is misused to harm another person. In both cases, the sponsors of the bills pulled them from consideration amid opposition, according to news reports. Moreover, two Democratic lawmakers who provided crucial support to the legislation were recalled from office in special elections six months after the measures were signed, with the NRA spending nearly $362,000 in the effort. Hickenlooper, however, won re-election to a second term in 2014. The NRA continues to oppose expanding background checks, saying in part that the checks ""don’t stop criminals from getting firearms."" (We’ve rated as Half True a claim that background checks ""have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence."") And the NRA continues to oppose magazine limits, including currently fighting California’s ban on gun magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds. Hickenlooper said, ""We beat the NRA with tough, tough gun laws"" in Colorado. The National Rifle Association did oppose two bills Hickenlooper signed as governor of Colorado in 2013. One, requiring universal background checks, is law in only 11 states; the other, banning high-capacity magazines, is law in only nine states. We rate Hickenlooper’s statement True.

But he said D.A.R.E. has never listed so-called ""gateway drugs,"" nor removed cannabis from such a list. But back in 2016, some news outlets reported that D.A.R.E. had delisted cannabis as a gateway drug. The headline on a February 2016 Teen Vogue story, for example, said, ""It’s official: marijuana is no longer a gateway drug."" The story says that a Reddit user ""noticed that mysteriously, marijuana was no longer listed among D.A.R.E’s other, arguably more harmful counterparts of tobacco and alcohol."" The Reddit post links to a dead page, but the url says: dare.org/keeping-kids-drug-free/. Using the Wayback Machine, which takes snapshots of web pages over time, we were able to find archived versions of when the web address worked. The earliest is from Aug. 14, 2013. ""What is a gateway drug?"" the site asks in bold near the top of the page. ""A gateway drug is a drug that opens the door to the use of other, harder drugs. Gateway drugs are typically inexpensive and readily available."" The page includes sections on the dangers of tobacco and alcohol, but not cannabis. The only mention of marijuana is in the tobacco section. According to a federal report, the page says, ""tobacco use is associated with alcohol and illicit drug use and is generally the first drug used by young people who enter a sequence of drug use that can include tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and harder drugs."" We asked Mahan about the page and he pushed back on the idea that it ""lists"" gateway drugs. ""I think the way it reads is it says there is the potential for leading to the use of other drugs, and yes, I know the word ‘gateway’ is in there,"" he said. He noted that the page has been removed, and he said the D.A.R.E. curriculum today doesn’t teach about ""gateway drugs,"" for which he said there’s no single definition. Mahan also said he doesn’t know if cannabis was ever highlighted on the page like tobacco and alcohol were. If it was, ""there was no conscious decision to remove it."" Frank Pegueros, D.A.R.E.’s chief executive officer, offered this explanation about the ""gateway drug"" page to Forbes in March 2016. The confusion, he said, is ""based on what appears to have been a partial posting of a document on our website."" That part that was posted discussed alcohol and tobacco as gateway drugs, Forbes reported. Another part discussing marijuana as a gateway drug was on a subsequent page that wasn’t posted. ""It’s obvious from looking at the document that the entire document was not in fact posted, because it only addressed tobacco and alcohol,"" Pegueros told Forbes. ""It didn’t address marijuana or inhalants, the typical substances considered to be gateway drugs."" Earlier that year, D.A.R.E. responded to reports that it had changed its position on marijuana. ""Had nominal research been conducted by the author(s) substantial reference on the D.A.R.E. website would have been found in support of D.A.R.E.’s position that marijuana is both an illegal and harmful drug to the youth of this nation,"" the post says. ""D.A.R.E. considers marijuana to be a dangerous drug for youth of the United States and the world!"" Mahan said this later Feb. 2, 2018, post on the D.A.R.E. website reflects the organization’s position on marijuana, including the answer to the question: ""What is D.A.R.E.’s position on marijuana as a gateway drug?"" The post continues: ""After decades of studies, the research is still inconclusive regarding whether or not marijuana is a gateway drug and, if so, what other variables may contribute to an individual who has repeatedly used marijuana being drawn to experiment or use other types of illicit drugs. D.A.R.E.’s curricula focus on providing students with the knowledge, skills, and tools to make decisions for safe and healthy living and the avoidance of high risk behaviors. Without question, a student’s use of marijuana is a high risk behavior with unhealthy consequences."" The Facebook post says that ""D.A.R.E. removed cannabis from its list of gateway drugs."" That claim seems to stem from a 2016 Reddit post about a page on D.A.R.E.’s website discussing gateways. The page has since been removed, but an archived snapshot of the website reveals that cannabis was not given the same attention as tobacco and alcohol. The problem is that cached versions of the page from as early as 2013 also don’t highlight marijuana as a gateway drug. Though it’s unclear if cannabis ever appeared on the page, D.A.R.E. says it was not removed from any gateway drug list and today it still considers marijuana a dangerous drug for youth.

Gary Johnson tells Jon Stewart he has 8 percent support nationally
","
During the June 5, 2012, edition of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico now running for president as a Libertarian, discussed how much support he needs to secure a spot on the debate stage this fall.

""How do you get onto the debate? How can you become like Ross Perot did and get included in the national debate?"" Stewart asked, referring to the third-party candidate who was invited to the 1992 presidential debates with President George H.W. Bush and his Democratic challenger, Bill Clinton.

Johnson responded, ""The notion here is to actually win the race. I mean, that’s the pie-in-the-sky notion. To do that, I have to poll at 15 percent to get on the national debate stage with Obama and Romney. Right now, I’m polling at about 8 percent against the two of them. … The biggest ingredient in my being at 8 percent is the fact that I’m the third name being listed, not so much me."" 
We wondered whether Johnson is really pulling down 8 percent support. (After all, he never broke 1 percent in a Republican primary.)

We first turned to the presidential polling archive at RealClearPolitics.com. We found nearly three dozen nationwide presidential polls taken since the beginning of April, but only one of them specifically offered Johnson’s name along with Obama and Romney during its interviews. That poll was taken by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm. PPP uses automated calls, a method that has historically been considered inferior to live interviewers. But polling experts have found its results in recent years to be credible.

The PPP poll, taken April 12-15 with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, found support for Johnson at 6 percent.

An earlier PPP poll, taken March 15-17 with an equivalent margin of error, found Johnson’s support at 7 percent.

These are the only two national polls we found that included Johnson among the candidate options. (We asked the Johnson campaign for any other public polls that offered his name, but we did not hear back.)

The other polls in the RealClearPolitics database offered only the names of Obama and Romney. Anyone responding to these polls who said they supported the former New Mexico governor would have seen their response categorized under ""other (volunteered)."" And ""other"" typically ended up below 6 percent or 7 percent.

Here is the level of ""other"" support in a few recent polls:

• CNN/ORC, May 29-31, 2012: 1 percent

• ABC News-Washington Post, May 17 to 20, 2012: 1 percent

• Fox News, May 13 to 15, 2012: 3 percent

PPP director Tom Jensen said he thought the results in his poll exaggerated Johnson's real standing and predicted he won't sustain that level into the fall.

""It’s common for third-party candidates to poll higher months out from the election date,"" he said. ""Eventually folks decide to vote for a candidate with a serious chance of winning.""

Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed.

""Polls outside New Mexico and perhaps a few other states are unlikely to be showing Johnson strength,"" Bowman said. ""They are much more likely to be showing dissatisfaction with Obama and Romney.""

It’s worth noting that Johnson acknowledged this point in the Daily Show interview when he said that ""the biggest ingredient in my being at 8 percent is the fact that I’m the third name being listed, not so much me.""

Bowman is correct that some state polls have shown higher levels of support for Johnson than national polls have. PPP polls have shown Johnson at 15 percent in his home state of New Mexico, 9 percent in Arizona, 8 percent in Montana and 7 percent in New Hampshire. A poll conducted by ORC International for the libertarian magazine Reason found Johnson taking 6 percent in Wisconsin.

However, we aren’t factoring single-state polls into our rating, because Stewart and Johnson were discussing the threshold for securing a place in the debates -- something that can only be achieved through national polls. Officially, this requires that the candidate ""have a level of support of at least 15 percent of the national electorate as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organizations, using the average of those organizations' most recent publicly-reported results at the time of the determination.""

Our rating

Johnson said that ""right now, I’m polling at about 8 percent"" against Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.

Two national PPP polls show Johnson topping out at 7 percent, which is close to 8 percent. Still, Johnson’s claim has plenty of holes. He said ""right now,"" yet the most recent PPP national poll was taken in April, nearly two months ago.

Also, viewers probably got the impression Johnson has consistently polled at that level in many polls. But the vast majority have not offered Johnson’s name to respondents; the percentage of respondents volunteering ""other,"" a measurement that may be seen as a rough approximation of Johnson’s core support, has ranged between 1 percent and 3 percent in these polls. Finally, experts say they believe Johnson’s showing in the PPP poll exaggerated his level of support. On balance, we rate Johnson’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809759ABC0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/06/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-tells-jon-stewart-he-has-8-percent-su/

New Pinellas redistricting maps trip up Jack Latvala
","
Sen. Jack Latvala wants to be president of the state Senate in a few years. To do it, the Clearwater resident needs the support of two kinds of people: a majority of his Republican colleagues and a lot of new voters in his re-election bid.

Latvala, who returned to the Senate in 2010, tried to explain to his constituents just how many new voters he would face in two ""sensible-looking"" Pinellas County-dominated districts drawn by the Legislature during the redistricting process.

""District 22 includes about 80% of the district I have represented since 2010,"" he wrote in a June 2012 newsletter to constituents. ""District 20 includes about 20% of the area I have represented since 2010 as well as much of the area in North Pinellas County that I represented in the Florida Senate from 1994 to 2002."" 
Latvala decided on June 6, 2012, to enter the District 20 race. 
A reader asked us to review his comments from the newsletter. We decided a graphic -- a first for PolitiFact -- could do most of the talking. 
Latvala’s current District 16 sprawls across Tampa Bay and includes the west coast of Tampa, the northwest corner of Hillsborough County and the eastern half of Pinellas County.

In all, 431,916 residents live there, according to our analysis of Senate redistricting data.

This year, the Legislature operated under new voter-approved restrictions to draw districts that are compact and more in line with county boundaries. So lawmakers divided District 16 into four new districts around Tampa Bay -- 17, 19, 20 and 22.





About 277,692 of those District 16 residents, or 64 percent, are now in District 22, which covers central Pinellas County, the southern Pinellas beaches and hops the bay to encompass south Tampa. It’s not 80 percent, as Latvala claimed.

About 19 percent of District 16 residents are now in District 20, which blankets the northern Pinellas County cities of Largo, Clearwater (where Latvala currently lives), Safety Harbor and Oldsmar. This part is in line with what he told newsletter recipients.

The point Latvala was trying to make, he told us, is that he has one of the highest percentages of taking on new territory as a result of redistricting. Basically, he knew that District 20 included only 20 percent of the population of his old District 16, which is correct. But he wrongly assumed that the remaining 80 percent of his old district would be moved into new District 22. (We're talking about people here, not land area.) 
Latvala’s newsletter is wrong about District 22 but right about District 20. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A29F480>],/factchecks/2012/jun/06/jack-latvala/new-pinellas-redistricting-maps-trip-jack-latvala/

New Jersey Democrats claim PolitiFact said it was True that Chris Christie is a fiscal phony
","
As Democrats proved recently, use PolitiFact New Jersey as a weapon to slam Gov. Chris Christie and you could be the one getting bruised.

In the June 1 ""Week In Review"" on its website, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee suggested that we issued a True ruling on the claim by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman that the Republican governor is a ""fiscal phony.""

Under the headline ""New York Times Calls Christie a Fiscal Phony,"" the post read as follows:

""Paul Krugman, a columnist with the New York Times, called Governor Christie a ‘fiscal phony’ this week for Christie’s willingness to borrow money in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest New Jersey residents. Politifact found the Krugman’s claims about Christie to be TRUE.""

But our True ruling was based on Krugman’s claim about how the state’s job growth during Christie’s tenure has been less than the gains in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole. We did not rule on Krugman's ""fiscal phony"" statement, and our fact-check never addressed Christie's plans to borrow money and cut taxes. 
Alicia D'Alessandro, communications director for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, acknowledged the Democrats’ mistake in a statement. The website post was later changed to accurately reflect our fact-check.

""We did not mean to imply that Politifact was calling Christie a fiscal phony, although we wish you had done so, because he is,"" D'Alessandro wrote. ""We do recognize that our language should have been more precise and that the sentence in question should have read: 'Politifact found Krugman's claims about anemic job growth under Christie to be TRUE.’""

Let’s review what our story was really about.

In his May 28 column, Krugman said Christie ""proved himself just another standard fiscal phony."" The liberal columnist criticized the governor’s ""Jersey Comeback"" message in light of the job growth since Christie took office in January 2010.

""Here’s the story: For some time now Mr. Christie has been touting what he calls the ‘Jersey comeback,’"" Krugman wrote. ""Even before his latest outburst, it was hard to see what he was talking about: yes, there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison.""

As we explained in our May 31 ruling, Krugman’s analysis was correct.

In terms of the percentage increases in total jobs and private-sector jobs as of April 2012, New Jersey’s growth since the beginning of Christie’s tenure has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the time of Krugman's statement, the April figures were preliminary. 
But we never said Krugman’s critique of Christie as a ""fiscal phony"" was accurate.

Our ruling

In the June 1 ""Week In Review"" on its website, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee claimed ""Paul Krugman, a columnist with the New York Times, called Governor Christie a ‘fiscal phony’"" and ""Politifact found the Krugman’s claims about Christie to be TRUE.""

But our True ruling was based on Krugman’s claim that New Jersey’s job growth since Christie took office has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole. ""Fiscal phony"" is a catchy phrase, but it had nothing to do with our ruling.

Reed: Airport terminal opened ""on time and on budget”
","
To hear airport boosters tell it, the story of the recent completion of the new international terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson airport ends with a Happily Ever After.

The Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal is one of the largest in the country, and it takes advantage of expected growth in international travel at the world’s busiest airport. Passengers will receive the best in service inside its glistening corridors, they say.

When city leaders announced its opening date, they could not contain their enthusiasm.

""I am . . . pleased to announce today that the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal will open for global business and travel on Wednesday, May 16, on time and on budget,"" Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said during a speech in the weeks before the terminal’s opening.

The audience applauded. PolitiFact Georgia grew concerned.

""On time and on budget""?

PolitiFact Georgia recently gave airport spokesman John Kennedy a Pants on Fire rating after he said the terminal was completed ""within budget.""

So what about the mayor’s ""on time and on budget"" claim?

We found that airport boosters have made a habit of describing what was a daytime drama as a fairy tale.

As we’ve said before, planning for the international terminal began more than a decade ago, well before Reed took office as mayor in January 2010. Leaders hoped to double the size of the international complex.

Stories printed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in November 2000 pegged the cost at $719 million.

Leaders said it could be finished as early as 2004, according to AJC stories.

Those plans soon went awry. Construction prices rose, and after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, so did the price of security measures.

Delta Air Lines went into bankruptcy, and the terminal’s original design team was fired because the then-general manager of the airport said its plans would bust the proposed $700 million budget.

By May 2006, auditors concluded that at an estimated cost of $1 billion, the international terminal’s price tag was spiraling out of control. A year later, the expected price was as high as $1.5 billion, even though it would be 400,000 square feet smaller than planned.

Now on to Reed’s ""on time and on budget"" claim.

Reed spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs argued that the mayor’s statement is accurate because the terminal met goals established during his time in office.

""Mayor Reed’s statement is true and accurate in that it reflects the city’s management of the  international terminal since his inauguration on Jan. 4, 2010,"" Jacobs said.  

One month after he took office, the airlines set a budget of about $1.413 billion, an amount Jacobs said was the only true budget for the terminal.  

If Reed specified that the terminal met a budget goal set while he was mayor, Jacobs would have a point. But that’s not what he said.

Furthermore, when top leaders say in public that they expect an airport terminal to cost $700 million, taxpayers expect it to cost $700 million -- regardless of the technicalities.

Now let’s consider whether the terminal opened on time. The following account of airport delays comes from years of stories published in the AJC:

The Atlanta City Council voted to name the terminal after former Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson in 2003, soon after his death. That year, it was expected to open in 2006.

In May 2005, airport officials said that costs were rising for the new terminal, and its opening would be delayed until 2009.

After the design team was fired, the terminal opening was delayed until 2010.

But by 2009, planners projected an early 2012 opening. This date was just about right. The airport opened May 16.

Reed’s claim that the terminal opened on time was correct because it began operating as the mayor promised, Jacobs said.

""Mayor Reed and his administration never veered from saying that under our leadership, the international terminal would open in spring 2012. We did so,"" Jacobs said.

It’s true that the delays did not take place under Reed’s watch, but no matter how you slice it, the terminal opened years later than originally planned. If officials say it will open in 2006, taxpayers expect it to open in 2006.

Reed doesn’t deserve blame for the delays, or the cost overruns.

But the mayor is accountable for the highly inaccurate claim that the terminal was finished ""on time and on budget.""

Reed earns our lowest rating on this one, Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966CCA00>],/factchecks/2012/jun/06/kasim-reed/reed-airport-terminal-opened-time-and-budget/

Josh Mandel says as state treasurer he ""cut the budget""
","
Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican hoping to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown from the U.S. Senate in November, makes at least five separate claims in a attacking Brown or promoting his own candidacy.

Among the ad’s claims: Mandel ""cut the budget.""

Cut the budget? How did Mandel cut it? Setting the state budget is the job of the governor and General Assembly.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look and put the question to Mandel’s campaign. They backed up the statement by citing a report released by the treasurer's office last July after a self-described ""top to bottom review"" from his first six months in office.

""By targeting waste and improving operations,"" it says, the treasurer’s office ended the 2011 fiscal year with a $400,000 surplus that was returned to the general fund.

The general revenue fund operating budget for the 2012-13 biennium was reduced by $1.2 million, the report says.

The reductions in expenses range from $2,000 that had been used for an outside contract for a plant-watering service to $850,000 saved by reducing budgeted full-time employees from 140 to 127.

We looked at supporting documentation from the Legislative Service Commission and Office of Budget and Management, and at news coverage of treasurer's office operations.

The coverage included reports that the treasurer’s overall budget had actually increased, from $38.3 million in fiscal 2011 to $41 million in 2012, the current fiscal year.

Looking more closely, however, we found that the treasurer’s overall budget includes state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer's office. The general revenue fund total, the portion of the budget that covers operating expenses, does decrease from the 2010-2011 biennium to 2012-2013, according to the Legislative Service Commission.

The amount appropriated by the General Assembly for operating expenses -- the spending over which the treasurer has the most direct control -- decreased from $8.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $7.7 in fiscal 2012 and 2013, according to the legislative Service Commission.

So where does Mandel’s claim that he ""cut the budget"" rate on the Truth-O-Meter?

His statement is accurate. His office finished the last fiscal year with a surplus and his office cited specific steps it took to spend less money. Also, the money appropriated for operating expenses for this fiscal year and the next fiscal year is reduced from the FY 2011 total.

There is additional information, though, that provides clarification.

As seen in the ad, some listeners might interpret his bare claim that he cut the budget as meaning he trimmed the state budget. Money for the state budget, including the treasurer’s office, is set by the General Assembly and the governor.

And the overall total appropriated for his office in FY 2012 and FY2013, when including state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer's office, is actually greater than FY 2011.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel’s claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A351AC0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/06/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-state-treasurer-he-cut-budget/

Mitt Romney campaign says job growth in Massachusetts accelerated as gubernatorial term went on
","
Both presidential campaigns are using job statistics to attack each other. President Barack Obama and his allies have spent months criticizing Mitt Romney’s job-creation record as governor of Massachusetts. Now, Romney and his surrogates are arguing that job creation in Massachusetts actually improved on Romney’s watch.

So who’s right?

We’ll start by looking at a claim that senior Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom made on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on June 3, 2012.

""If you throw D.C. into the mix,"" Fehrnstrom said, ""we were 51 out of 51 (in job creation). By the time Mitt Romney left four years later, we were in the middle of the pack. We were 30th in the nation in terms of job growth. That's the trend line that you want to see.""

We are separately checking a competing claim made by top Obama adviser David Axelrod on CBS’ Face the Nation. Axelrod said Massachusetts ranked 47th in job creation during Romney’s tenure as governor.

For this fact-check, we'll follow our usual approach of looking at the claim in two parts: first, are the numbers correct, and second, how much is the change because of Romney's policies?

First, we confirmed the Romney camp’s methodology, which relied on state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. The Romney campaign used figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted, as tracked by the government’s payroll survey. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, the campaign used the data for December of each year as a baseline.

According to a spokesman, the Romney campaign calculated the yearly percentage increase or decrease in job growth for each of Romney’s four years in office. So from December 2002 to December 2003, the job growth in Massachusetts was 51st highest nationally out of 50 states plus the District of Columbia -- in other words, dead last. The following year, it was 46th, then 40th, then in Romney’s final year in office -- December 2005 to December 2006 -- it was 30th in the nation.

Looking at the statistics in this way advances the Romney camp’s argument that, while Massachusetts’ overall job growth under Romney was among the lowest of any state, the trendline over time puts his tenure in a more favorable light. A state that was a doormat in job growth at the beginning of his tenure rose into the broad middle of the rankings by the end of it.

We did our own math and found the exact same results as the Romney camp. So we agree that the numbers back up Fehrnstrom’s general argument that job growth rates in the state improved over the course of Romney’s governorship relative to other states.

But does Romney deserve credit for the job growth? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy.

Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state, warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put to much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly.

""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered.""

(As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Our rating

The Romney camp’s year-by-year numbers are correct: Job growth was sluggish early in Romney’s gubernatorial term, and then less so by the time he was ready to leave office. However, Romney -- like the Obama campaign before it -- is exaggerating Romney’s influence on the state job market. Governors simply don't have that much impact.

On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3C7DC0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/05/eric-fehrnstrom/mitt-romney-campaign-says-job-growth-massachusetts/

David Axelrod repeats claim that Massachusetts under Mitt Romney ranked 47th in job growth
","
Over the weekend, the Obama campaign repeated a talking point it’s been making for at least a year.

Obama adviser David Axelrod said on the June 3, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation that Massachusetts ranked 47th in job creation during Romney’s tenure as governor. He said something similar a year earlier during a CNN interview -- that ""people have a right to say, why is it that your state was 47th in the country in job creation when you were governor?""

Separately, we're checking the Romney camp’s rebuttal to Axelrod -- that year by year under Romney, the job growth rate in Massachusetts improved, from 51st in his first year in office to 30th in his final year.

Who’s right?

For both fact-checks, we'll follow our usual approach of looking at the claim in two parts: First, are the numbers correct, and second, how much is the change because of Romney's policies?

We used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. We used figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, we used the data for December of each year as a baseline.

We found that from December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth. (We calculated that by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states.) Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse.

So the number is correct.

Does Romney deserve credit for the job situation? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy.

Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state, warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth.

""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered.""

(As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Our rating

It’s correct that Massachusetts ranked 47th of 50 in job creation on Romney’s watch. However, the Obama camp -- like the Romney camp in its rebuttal -- exaggerates Romney’s influence on the state job market. We rated Axelrod Half True a year ago, and today, we still think it merits a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A292E80>],/factchecks/2012/jun/05/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-repeats-claim-massachusetts-under-mi/
"['Oregon', 'Transportation', 'John Charles']","
Does TriMet really pay out more for benefits than wages?
","
After a recent story in The Oregonian looked at TriMet’s high-cost union contracts -- and the way they’re draining the transit authority’s budget -- John Charles of the Cascade Policy Institute jumped into the discussion.

He added this statement: ""Due to the compounding effect of these contracts, TriMet now spends $1.63 in benefits for every $1.00 spent on wages.""

This isn’t the first time that Cascade has taken a critical look at the way TriMet spends money, but after Charles’ post was sent out as a tweet, we couldn’t help but wonder if he was right.

We went to Charles directly and he pointed us to TriMet’s 2011 annual financial report. On Page 7, there’s a chart that lays out the figures clearly.

In 2011, labor expenses accounted for $123,482,000 of spending. Fringe benefits, meanwhile, accounted for $200,875,000. Those numbers do indeed show that TriMet spends about $1.63 in benefits for every $1 on wages.

We followed up with TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch. She verified the numbers that Charles had pointed out. But she also pointed out that ""fringe benefits"" includes a number of different categories: medical coverage, disability payments, workers comp and unemployment, time off and some others.

It’s unlikely the average person would consider payouts to workers comp and unemployment coverage to be benefits in the traditional sense. They’re not the sort of thing you negotiate before taking a job -- they’re the cost of being an employer.

It’s also worth pointing out that the money being spent on fringe benefits doesn’t just go to current employees. As our own Joseph Rose pointed out in his initial story, the authority’s benefit plans follow workers and their families into retirement -- and medical coverage for spouses and dependents continues even after a former employee’s death.

Mary King, a professor of economics at Portland State University, said lumping those sorts of costs in with this discussion may be misleading. ""I think it's really a huge red herring to start talking about what TriMet might be paying for past employees,"" she said. ""That's an attempt to make it look like they're paying a lot.""

Now, Charles didn’t specifically decide to throw those sorts of things into the benefits category -- that’s just the way TriMet lays out the budget. Still, the best way to get at whether benefits seem high in comparison to wages would be to look at the average salary of a represented employee and their average benefit payout.

Fetsch was able to give us the figures budgeted for fiscal year 2013. According to her data, TriMet will pay out an average of $67,000 in wages for each union employee and about $33,500 in benefits. If you consider these numbers rather than the aggregate figures Charles used, TriMet pays about 50 cents in benefits for every dollar it spends on wages. But that leaves out the current portion of the union pension, which most people would consider a significant benefit.

Going back to the 2011 numbers, another caveat here is that, in a strict sense, TriMet didn’t pay out the full $200 million. About $70 million of that went unpaid -- but it still remains a future obligation. Eventually TriMet will have to pay it. In  the meantime, it’ll keep incurring similar costs year after year.

Charles said ""TriMet now spends $1.63 in benefits for every $1.00 spent on wages"" and the budget bears this out. While the statement is accurate, some of that $1.63 is going to past employees as well as other basics -- like unemployment -- that most would not consider part of their benefit package. That’s the clarification that affects our ruling.

We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2BC140>],/factchecks/2012/jun/05/john-charles/does-trimet-really-pay-out-more-benefits-wages/

Bill Nelson compares Rick Scott's voter purge with a 2000 attempt
","
An effort ordered by Gov. Rick Scott to purge Florida’s voter rolls of noncitizens had Sen. Bill Nelson feeling a sour case of déjà vu.

Nelson, a Democrat, links the hunt for illegal voters with the 2000 election -- before anyone even uttered the word ""recount"" -- and Florida’s botched attempt to remove felons from the rolls ahead of election day.

He warned Scott about repeating the ordeal in a May 29, 2012, letter.

""In the 2000 Florida election, at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons,"" Nelson wrote. ""Many of those who were dropped showed up to vote and were told they could not. And in a presidential election decided by 537 votes, that erroneous purge may have been a factor.""

PolitiFact Florida wanted to compare the millennial purge with the most recent one, which the Obama administration ordered the state to halt on grounds it violates two voter laws.

We’ll examine the parallels and determine if Nelson offered an accurate recap of the number of voters affected by the infamous 2000 purge.

2000
As part of their 1998 elections reforms, state lawmakers told the Department of State to remove felons and other ineligible voters from the rolls after thousands of corrupt votes, including 100 votes by felons, were cast in a Miami mayoral election.

The agency hired Boca Raton-based DTS Technologies, a subsidiary of ChoicePoint in Atlanta, for about $4 million to produce a list of probable and possible felons before the election. (Unlike most states, in Florida a felon’s civil rights are not restored unless he or she is granted clemency by the governor and Cabinet.)

The company warned the state that many people on the list would not be felons, but officials wanted DTS to use broad parameters -- that meant more felons off the rolls.

People whose names appeared on the list of more than 50,000 names had to prove their innocence or automatically be dropped from the rolls within several weeks of receiving written notice. Twenty counties ignored the state’s directive because they found the data unreliable, including the Madison County elections supervisor, who found her own name among suspected felon voters.

News organizations unearthed numerous accounts of law-abiding citizens turned away at the polls because they could not prove their innocence. Several thousand people appealed to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and half were found to not be felons.

The precise damage is pretty hard to calculate.

""I’ve seen numbers all over the map,"" said Myrna Perez, senior counsel in the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which is investigating the purge ordered by Scott.

Nelson’s figure comes from a 2001 Palm Beach Post investigation, the crux of which asserts at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly purged before the 2000 election -- ""the collateral damage from an aggressive and ill-conceived state plan to prevent felons from voting.""

The Post’s count included at least 108 citizens who were cleared after the election and 996 people who committed felonies in other states (they were supposed to retain their civil rights even in Florida).

Other tallies put the number of bad targets 11 or 20 times higher.

The NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union sued the state in 2000 partly over the felon voter purge, arguing it disenfranchised black voters. A consent decree from the lawsuit settlement required the state to run its old felon lists with new standards.

The exercise resulted in 12,023 fewer Floridians making the felon list, meaning these people could have been targeted as felons and denied the right to vote, reported the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) in 2003.

Some caveats: This figure does not mean 12,000 people were purged without cause. It means they could have been. Plus, some people within this class might not have been affected anyway because some supervisors decided not to enforce the purge.

A massive story about the 2000 election by Vanity Fair identified 20,000 people who were wrongly included. We don’t know where that number comes from and will update this story if we find out.

Nelson should have used that much bigger figure, said Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho.

""I read the letter from Nelson and I laughed,"" Sancho said. ""How come you didn’t vet this better? You could have had a way bigger number.""

We asked the state department for any data it might have but did not hear back.

2012
Twelve years later, Gov. Scott, who campaigned on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigrants, ordered state officials to clear the rolls of noncitizen voters.

The state department whittled a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens to about 2,700 by comparing driver’s license data, which contains some citizenship data, against voter rolls. County supervisors, again, were told to notify those listed by mail of the need to urgently prove their citizenship. And also like last time, some supervisors decided to sit out the purge.

Already, a Pasco County woman and a 91-year-old World War II veteran from Broward County have made headlines for being wrongfully targeted. In fact, elections supervisors found that most names on the list belong to citizens -- probably because the motor vehicle department’s citizenship information is out of date, the Miami Herald reported.

Thirteen Miami-Dade residents have disclosed they are not citizens and ineligible to vote as a result of the purge, the Herald reported. It’s for reasons like this that Republicans stand by the clean-up efforts.

""The implication of Nelson's letter is that eligible voters will not be able to vote, yet there is no evidence of this,"" said Kristen McDonald, RPOF spokeswoman.

Still, voter-rights advocates and some elections supervisors share Nelson’s ominous sentiment.

""It’s distressing and disheartening that this is happening again in Florida given the history of inaccurate voter purges of the past,"" Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project, which is a program within the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

Rolling Stone waded into the issue with a scathing report, quoting Sancho as saying, ""The state’s supervisors of elections are very, very disturbed.""

""This was dumped into our laps at the 11th hour. Those of us who have been here long enough get this eerie similarity to the flawed felon databases of 2000 in Florida,"" he told the magazine.

Our ruling

Nelson precisely cites a Palm Beach Post analysis that put the total number of people wrongfully dropped from the voter rolls in 2000 at about 1,100. Other estimates of wrongful targets are much higher, and experts about the 2000 election tend to go with those. Trouble is, we don’t have exact figures.

However, Nelson’s broader point -- that a significant number of people were wrongly tossed from Florida’s voter rolls -- is valid. And he did say at least.

We rate his statement True.

"['National', 'Income', 'Ed  Gillespie']","
Ed Gillespie says Massachusetts income grew by $5,500 under Mitt Romney
","
In the duel over economic records between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, a Romney surrogate this week took the fight straight to our wallets.

When Romney was governor, adviser Ed Gillespie said on Fox News Sunday, ""the average income for a family in Massachusetts went up by $5,500.""

High unemployment and stagnant wages are hurting Americans everywhere, so we decided to check whether Massachusetts families fared that much better during Romney’s 2003-07 gubernatorial term.

First, the data

The Romney campaign cited U.S. Census data when we asked for backup for Gillespie’s statement. Spokesman Ryan Williams pointed us to Massachusetts’ median household incomes from 2002, the last year before Romney became governor, through 2006, the final full year he was in office. Here are the figures:

2002: $49,855
2003: $50,955
2004: $52,019
2005: $56,017
2006: $55,330

So the hard numbers are accurate. The median income in Massachusetts rose $5,475 from 2002 to 2006.

Romney’s influence

When rating claims such as these, PolitiFact weighs not only whether the claim is numerically correct but also whether it’s appropriate for the speaker to assign credit or blame.

Said Fred Bayles, a former reporter who covered Romney’s administration: ""Any set of numbers related to the economy is kind of like reporting on the tides and ascribing an individual responsibility to a force of nature.""

Barry Bluestone, dean of the school of Public Policy and Urban Affairs at Northeastern University, said that ""governors, in general, have little direct impact on employment or income in the short run. They can set the stage for future growth in jobs and income if they invest heavily in education and in infrastructure, but this did not occur during Romney’s term in office.""

He also noted that the census income figures are not adjusted for inflation, a point echoed by Andrew Bagley, director of research and public affairs for the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.

Bagley crunched the numbers for us taking inflation into account. Using data from Moody’s Analytics, the median household income in Massachusetts increased by roughly 2.8 percent annual growth during Romney’s term, Bagley said. The nationwide consumer price index (CPI), which shows how much inflation grew during the same period, was 2.9 percent per year.

""So, the answer provided by Gillespie appears accurate. But, if someone said that ‘real’ Massachusetts median household income fell during Gov. Romney’s four years in office from 2002 Q4 to 2006 Q4, that would also be accurate because the average annual growth of 2.8 percent was below the inflation rate of 2.9 percent, so real incomes actually declined,"" Bagley wrote in an email.

When you factor that in with slow job growth -- Massachusetts private-sector employment grew by just 0.79 percent during Romney’s term -- Bluestone said the outcome is not surprising.

""There really was nothing that Romney accomplished as governor that would have increased jobs or income,"" he said. Bluestone has donated $700 to Obama's campaign since 2011.

Bayles, who now directs the Boston University Statehouse Program, also added that Massachusetts’ income gains lagged behind the national average, 11 percent compared with 14.2 percent.

""Does that mean Romney could be criticized for Massachusetts underperforming the national average? Probably not.""

He said outside economic forces made the biggest difference.

""The Massachusetts economy took a slightly bigger hit when the tech bubble burst and was a bit slower in recovering. There were forces much larger than a four-year term that impacted all these numbers,"" Bayles said.

Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University, summed it up this way: ""The macroeconomic changes instituted by the Romney administration were far too modest to be responsible for a change in average income of this magnitude. It's far more likely that most of the change in Massachusetts were a reflection of national policies and trends.""

Our ruling

Gillespie’s statement that median family incomes in Massachusetts grew by $5,500 during Romney’s term is numerically accurate.

However, that dollar figure is not adjusted for inflation, and two experts told us that after inflation is taken into account, real incomes in Massachusetts actually declined slightly. What’s more, governors in general have little impact on immediate-term gains in jobs and incomes.

Gillespie’s statement leaves out those important details, leaving the inaccurate impression that Massachusetts families were significantly better off under Romney. We rate it Half True.

Ga. candidate questions incumbent's donor list
","
Elected officials are often accused of being beholden to the folks who bankroll their campaigns.

In one Georgia race, a similar attack by one candidate for a seat on the state’s influential Public Service Commission against the current officeholder has sparked a verbal volleyball match between the two candidates. PolitiFact Georgia was eager to leap in.

It all began a few weeks ago when PSC candidate Pam Davidson launched her campaign against incumbent Stan Wise with a statement on her website.

""Over the past 18 years, the incumbent candidate has received about 95 percent of his campaign money from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating,"" she wrote. ""This fosters a cozy relationship with those utilities, and Georgia consumers, quite literally, have paid the price.""

The Public Service Commission regulates natural gas, telecommunications, electric power companies, limousines, bus carriers and towing companies. It does not regulate cable television, telephone service, propane gas and interstate transportation.

Davidson made a promise written in bold letters with the next sentence in her statement: ""I will not accept campaign contributions or gifts from the entities regulated by the PSC either before or after the election.""

Davidson nearly won the Republican Party primary race for a PSC seat in 2008 against Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald, despite Davidson’s 13-1 fundraising disadvantage.

We asked Davidson for information to back up her claim. The candidate said it was an estimate on her part and soon thereafter had a staffer compile data on Wise’s disclosures for one of those 18 years.

Before we review those contributions, PolitiFact Georgia had to examine the nuances of Davidson’s statement. The candidate said Wise received nearly all of his contributions ""from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating.""

Wise called that part of the statement incorrect and ""silly."" Georgia’s campaign finance laws prohibit PSC members from accepting contributions from businesses regulated by the agency, Wise noted. Those businesses can make contributions to members of the Georgia Legislature.

""[H]er claim on its face is completely false,"" Wise said. 
Wise said he’s ""proud"" of the contributions he’s received. He doubted that 95 percent of contributions he’s received came from individuals connected to companies regulated by the PSC, describing those donations as ""employees exercising their constitutional right to free speech.""

Davidson countered that Wise may be in line with the letter of the state law on contributions. But he’s fallen out of step with the spirit of the rules, she said.

""He’s getting money indirectly,"" she said. ""If the CEO or lobbyist gives me money, it’s for all intents and purposes from the utility.""

Davidson provided us a report on Wise’s disclosures in 2006. PolitiFact Georgia simultaneously did its own research and reviewed nearly 500 campaign contributions recorded by Wise from 2001 to 2012 that were available on state government websites.

Our analysis shows about 66 percent of the contributions were made by people who work for companies regulated by the PSC. An additional 25 percent came from attorneys who work for law firms with clients who do business before the commission. Some of those law firms are the largest in Georgia, and attorneys who work there regularly donate to political candidates in all sorts of campaigns.

About 9 percent came from donors we believe have no ties to any utilities. There were some contributions we could not determine whether or not the donors worked for or represented any utilities, and we did not include them in our analysis.

We discussed this with Helen O’Leary, senior counsel for Georgia Watch, an organization that advocates for pro-consumer policies at the state Capitol and the PSC. She said some PSC members receive a large percentage of their contributions from donors who work for utilities, particularly attorneys.

O’Leary said the organization wished those individuals would refrain from giving to PSC candidates. But there is nothing in current state law that prohibits those contributions.

""As an attorney who has appeared before the PSC in matters affecting ratepayers, it is frustrating to take positions against rate increases when you know that opposing counsel, members of his law firm, and employees of the utility he represents have made tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to the same elected officials that will decide these important cases,"" she said.

So where does this leave us?

Davidson would get a higher rating on the Truth-O-Meter if she had said that close to 95 percent of Wise’s contributions came from individuals and attorneys who work for or represent the interests of utilities. There’s no proof that her exact statement is accurate.

Her over-reaching point appears correct -- people associated with the utilities are contributing about 90 percent of PSC Commissioner Stan Wise’s campaign war chest. However, that money is not coming directly from the utilities, which is prohibited under the law. Many of the lawyers who donated to Wise have colleagues who’ve also given large sums of money to candidates in other races, so some context is necessary.

Davidson might be making a good political point, but her statement needs a lot of context to move any higher on the Truth-O-Meter.

Our rating: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976A4D80>],/factchecks/2012/jun/05/pam-davidson/ga-candidate-questions-incumbents-donor-list/

Ohio Democratic Party says Sen. Rob Portman got the fewest votes among Senate winners in Ohio since 2000
","
No one outside of Mitt Romney’s campaign may really know if Ohio’s Rob Portman is likely to become the running mate on this year’s Republican presidential ticket. But in case the freshman U.S. senator is picked, Democrats are preparing a dossier.

On June 3, the Ohio Democratic Party used it to take several shots at Portman, his experience and his popularity, including a claim that he’s really not a tremendous vote-getter in his home state.  ""In four Ohio Senate elections held between 2000 to 2010, Robert Portman garnered the least votes out of all the winners,"" the Democrats said in a news release.

If that’s the case, the party suggested, Portman would ""not significantly help Romney carry the Buckeye state."" This larger claim is prospective, although there is polling to support it. The polling could turn out to be right, or wrong, as it came out six months before the election. But what about hard data from Portman’s last election? Did he really get fewer votes than the previous three victors in Ohio’s U.S. Senate races, Mike DeWine, George Voinovich and Sherrod Brown?

The raw numbers tell part of the story. From the Ohio secretary of state’s office:

Portman won in 2010 by getting 2,168,742 votes.

In the previous Senate election in Ohio in 2006, Brown won with 2,257,485 votes.

In the Senate election before that, in 2004, Voinovich won with 3,464,651votes.

And in 2000, Mike DeWine (defeated by Brown in 2006) won with 2,666,736 votes.

So there you have it, if you use the raw numbers. Portman got the fewest votes among the victors in these last four Senate elections.

But wait. The number of votes a candidate gets not only reflects his popularity but also the dynamics of each election. Not all elections are equal.

DeWine and Voinovich, for instance, won in elections in which voters chose  a president as well as a senator. Political Science 101: Turnout in presidential years is always higher than in mid-term term elections. This has long been the case. It follows that if more people come to the polls because presidential candidates are on the ballot, the number of votes cast in the Senate race will rise too.

Think of it like religion. More people attend church on Easter Sunday than on a snowy late January. Is it fair, then, to criticize a particular church for its low attendance by using Easter as the yardstick?

A more telling comparison is a candidates’ margin of victory over his challenger. Of all the votes cast in any of these elections, who won by the highest percentage?

DeWine, a Republican, beat Democratic challenger Ted Celeste in 2000 by a margin of 24 percentage points (he got 60 percent of the vote, to Celeste’s 35.9 percent).

Voinovich, a Republican, beat Eric Fingerhut in 2004 by a 27.7 point margin.

Brown, a Democrat, defeated DeWine by a 12.3 percentage margin.

And Portman, running for an open seat after Voinovich decided to retire, beat Lee Fisher, then Ohio’s lieutenant governor, by a 17.5 percent margin.

So what’s this tell us?
It says that if you ignore the context, the Democrats are right about Portman’s election performance:   ""In four Ohio Senate elections held between 2000 to 2010, Robert Portman garnered the least votes out of all the winners.""

But two of those four elections were of a different nature, with presidential candidates pushing up the totals all around. Take away those two and simply compare 2006 and 2010, or use all four elections but consider the margins of victory rather than each winner’s raw vote total. Using the latter measure, Portman would rank third out of four in margin of victory. Brown garnered more votes in 2006 than did Portman in 2010, but Portman won his lower-turnout election by a wider margin.  

These matters -- presidential-versus-non-presidential elections, and margins of victory -- must be mentioned to fully understand the Democrats’ claim. That’s why despite its narrow accuracy, we reduce it a notch to Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C17EE80>],/factchecks/2012/jun/05/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-sen-rob-portman-got-few/

Recall challenger Tom Barrett says “Scott Walker has a plan to privatize state lands” and “wants to sell our deer to the highest bidder.”
","
Picking up on chain email and internet rumblings, Democratic gubernatorial recall challenger Tom Barrett is hunting for votes in the June 5, 2012 election by aiming for Wisconsin’s 600,000 deer hunters.

Here’s the pitch:

""Scott Walker has a plan to privatize state lands,"" Barrett says on his campaign web site. ""Don’t let Scott Walker take away your right to hunt deer on public lands!""

There’s even Facebook page called ""Save Wisconsin Hunting"" set up that is connected to an effort by the liberal Daily Kos web site to highlight the hot-button issue.

The Barrett campaign also bought a Google ad. Type ""James Kroll"" in the search box, and you get this message: ""Scott Walker wants to sell our deer to the highest bidder"" with a ""Join us!"" link goes to the campaign website.

The target is Republican Gov. Scott Walker, but the man at the center of the issues is James Kroll,  the Texas consultant hired for $125,000 by Walker to recommend improvements to the state’s deer management system. Kroll is known as ""Dr. Deer"" from his articles in hunting magazines and his appearances on hunting shows on TV.

His recommendations are expected in late June 2012.

So where does Barrett’s claim Walker wants to ""privatize state lands"" and ""sell our deer to the highest bidder"" come from?

Hunting on public land has long been part of our state’s deer hunting tradition. Of the 339,261 deer killed in 2011, about 60,012 were taken on public land, according to the Department of Natural resources.

The Barrett campaign did not respond to our request for their backup on the claim, but a return to Google shows an on-going back and forth between the two sides.

Many of the attacks on Kroll -- and Walker -- stem from Kroll quotes in a Feburary 2002 story in the Texas Monthly. The full story is behind the magazine’s pay wall, but here’s what the most cited portion says:

""Game management,"" says James Kroll, driving to his high-fenced, two-hundred-acre spread near Nacogdoches, ""is the last bastion of communism.""

And it continued:

""People who call for more public lands are ‘cocktail conservationists,’"" he says, who are really pining for socialism. He calls national parks ""wildlife ghettos"" and flatly accuses the government of ""gross mismanagement.""

But the article is 10 years old and there has been no public indication from Kroll that he advocates turning Wisconsin’s public lands into a game farm where you have to pay to hunt. Nor has there been any indication Walker supports such an approach.

This was made clear in a May 26, 2012 piece by Milwaukee Journal Sentinel outdoor editor Paul Smith: ""While he is a controversial figure among wildlife professionals for his extensive work in high fence deer management and captive deer breeding, at no point has Kroll advocated for privatizing deer hunting in Wisconsin.""

Kroll told Smith his comments were distorted by a liberal publication. But they’ve caught fire. In a chain email, those who receive it are asked to pass it along since it is sure to cause a wedge among Walker supporters.

Here’s one post from the Barrett site: ""Kroll has an extreme philosophy of turning public hunting grounds into profit-making entities. This would have dire consequences for average Wisconsinites, and make it far costlier to take part in this Midwestern tradition.""

Kroll responded with a lengthy blog post of his own:

""The blog reports of what I said about ‘communism’ is a distortion of my real feelings, as well,"" Kroll wrote, in part. ""We discussed how the top-down approach to game management was the wrong approach (sound familiar in regard to Wisconsin?), and if you give people the incentives and support to manage game animals on private and public lands, as well as a say in how these resources are managed, it is a ‘win-win’ for everyone.""

And he told Smith: ""The last thing I want is to make it harder for hunters to participate in the great sport of deer hunting in Wisconsin on public land.""

We asked Walker’s office about the governor’s plans for deer hunters.

""Governor Walker supports hunting on public land, always has supported hunting on public land, and will continue to in the future,"" Walker spokesman Cullen Werwire said in an email. ""Governor Walker will not enact ‘steep fees’ to hunt on public lands. That is crazy.""

Our rating

Barrett claimed ""Scott Walker has a plan to privatize state lands"" and ""wants to sell our deer to the highest bidder.""

The evidence for the claim goes back to a 10-year-old article that describes Kroll’s views about hunting in his home state of Texas, not Wisconsin. His final report has not been made, there is nothing about privatization in any preliminary recommendations, and Kroll has stated clearly he does not support private management of state lands for hunters. Walker has said the same.

Without any direct evidence, this claim looks like all heat and no light.

Caroline Casagrande says women have come through recession worse off than men

The recession and its aftereffects have been hard on millions of people across the country.

But it’s been especially hard on women, according to state Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande (R-Monmouth).

""Women have come through the recession worse off than men … the numbers bear that out,"" Casagrande said to My9TV’s Brenda Blackmon on the April 29 ""New Jersey Now"" program. ""We went from a 7 percent unemployment rate for women when he (President Barack Obama) was elected to an 8.1 percent now.""

Casagrande is correct about most of her data, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Obama was elected in November 2008 and took office on Jan. 20, 2009. Anita Velardo, Casagrande’s communications director, said in an e-mail that Casagrande’s statistic referred to the period from January 2009 to March 2012. But since Casagrande said elected, we’ll look at the unemployment rate for both periods.

From November 2008 to March 2012, unemployment among women rose to 8.1 percent from 6.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For men, the rate climbed to 8.3 percent from 7.4 percent.

From January 2009 to March 2012, unemployment for women rose from 7 percent to 8.1 percent. The rate for men, however, decreased from 8.6 percent to 8.3 percent. That’s because the male-dominated industries that lost jobs prior to January 2009 were starting to rebound.

Now let’s look at data for the recession, which the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research said occurred from December 2007 to June 2009.

During the recession, unemployment among women spiked from 4.9 percent to 8.3 percent. For men, the rate more than doubled, from 5.1 percent to 10.6 percent.

Men’s unemployment was higher than women during the recession, but women have had a tougher time getting work and living day-to-day during the ongoing economic recovery, according to a September 2011 report, ""Women and Men Living on the Edge: Economic Insecurity After the Great Recession,"" prepared by the Institute For Women’s Policy Research and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.

Economic and labor experts we talked with supported Casagrande’s claim.

Male-dominated fields such as construction and manufacturing often are hit first in recessions and tend to rebound first during an economic recovery, according to Elisabeth Jacobs, a Governance Studies fellow at the Brookings Institution; Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at Brookings; and Harry Holzer, a professor of Public Policy at Georgetown University. Female-dominated fields such as education, public sector jobs and retail often are hit later and rebound slower, they said.

""In terms of lost jobs, men suffered worse than women and have seen a bigger drop in their employment rate,"" said Burtless, who contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011 but also was an adviser on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). ""In terms of the number of adults who are still looking for work, women’s situation looks (proportionately) a bit worse than that of men.""

""The recovery has progressed more slowly for women than for men, and the unemployment rate for women is indeed higher today than it was when President Obama was elected president,"" Jacobs said in an e-mail.

But is Obama to blame?

Our colleagues at PolitiFact.com addressed this issue in April after Mitt Romney’s campaign claimed women were hit hard by job losses under Obama. Their report showed that women have had a more difficult jobs recovery than men, but Obama cannot bear all the blame, just as he couldn’t take the credit if jobs were booming when he took office.

Our ruling

Casagrande said, ""women have come through the recession worse off than men … the numbers bear that out. We went from a 7 percent unemployment rate for women when he was elected to an 8.1 percent now."" Labor statistics show and some experts told us that while men took the brunt of job loss during the recession, the industries they dominate – construction and manufacturing – tend to bounce back first during economic recovery. Women often are affected much later than men during a recession, meaning they are more likely to have a slower rate of gaining employment. Casagrande’s timeframe is off slightly for the statistic she cited, and Obama can’t be held completely responsible for the slow recovery among women. We rate Casagrande’s statement Mostly True.

Barrow: Congressional elections less competitive
","
Life for moderate Democrats has grown so lonely that Blue Dog U.S. Rep. John Barrow has taken to singing the blues.

Barrow warbled his lament in The Washington Post, where he blamed gerrymandering for squeezing moderates out of Congress in a May 17 op-ed.

Georgia Republicans drew the Blue Dogs’ co-chairman out of his district in 2011, putting him into heavily Republican territory. He has since moved from Savannah to Augusta as part of a bid to keep his seat in the upcoming election.

""Forty years ago, when I was an intern on the Hill, about half of congressional districts were genuinely competitive,"" Barrow wrote. ""Today, only about 10 percent of House races on Cook Political Report are listed as ‘toss-ups’ or ‘lean’ to one party.""

Congress has been unfriendly territory for moderates lately. The 2010 election culled half the Blue Dog membership, and the partisan fervor that helped kill those congressional careers shows no sign of letting up.

But have things changed that much in 40 years?

PolitiFact Georgia contacted Barrow spokesman Peyton Bell for more information. Bell said Barrow was going by memory on the statistics from 40 years ago. We searched for data to see whether we could confirm his claim.

But first, we checked Barrow’s take on the Cook Political Report numbers. Politicos use this publication widely for odds on political races nationwide. It classifies congressional races into three categories: lean, tossup and likely.  

""Tossups"" are races where either party can win. ""Lean"" races are competitive, but one party has an advantage. ""Likely"" races are the least competitive.

Cook lists 23 Democratic and 32 Republican seats as ""lean"" or ""tossup"" in its May 17 analysis. This means that nearly 13 percent of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives are in play. This is close to the 10 percent that Barrow used.  

Barrow’s statement about congressional races 40 years ago was much weaker.

Gary Jacobson is a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies Congress and congressional elections, especially voters and partisan polarization in Congress. The data he sent us stretches back to the end of World War II.

Jacobson assessed the competitiveness of House races by tabulating election results. He calculated the proportion of those that were won with less than 55 percent and 60 percent of the vote.

By these definitions, very few races are competitive. Forty years ago, in 1972, only some 15 percent of House races were won with less than 55 percent of the vote. Only 28 percent were won with less than 60 percent.

""By neither standard were anything like half the seats competitive,"" Jacobson said.

These rates have gone up and down in the past 40 years.

In the 18 years after World War II, the number of races won with 60 percent of the vote or less  hovered between 35 percent and 45 percent. The number of those won with 55 percent or less ranged between 20 percent and 28 percent.

Since then, the numbers have fluctuated greatly, according to Jacobson’s data. Races were particularly noncompetitive in 1988 and the early 2000s, but they show no clear trend, Jacobson said.  

The proportion of races won by 60 percent or less of the vote rebounded and broke the 35 percent mark within four to six years of those declines. Those won by 55 percent or less rose above 20 percent.

This isn’t to say that moderates are having an easy time. Congressional districts do appear to be getting more partisan, according to other data Jacobson has compiled. But this trend does not appear to be related to redistricting, he said.  

Half of Barrow’s statement is accurate and the other half isn’t.

Barrow’s assessment of Cook Political Report numbers is on target, but House races four decades ago were not as competitive as he recalled.

We therefore give Barrow a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4740C0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/04/john-barrow/barrow-election-competitiveness-down-congress/
"['Federal Budget', 'Veterans', 'Virginia', 'Jim Webb']","
Sen. Jim Webb says spending on veterans has grown dramatically since 1980
","
Sen. Jim Webb said funding for veterans services is much higher now than three decades ago.

""The president’s budget request for FY2013 veterans spending is $140 billion -- more than double the amount in constant dollars appropriated in 1980, when the veterans population was larger by a third,"" Webb, D-Va., said in a May 14 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Webb, who served as secretary of the navy under President Ronald Reagan, was referring to funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care and pensions to honorably-discharged service members who have been wounded or suffered illnesses in times of war.

Heather Fluit, a spokeswoman for Webb, said the senator got his data from a query to the Congressional Research Service, which provides non-partisan analysis of issues for Congress.

We checked whether Webb was right about the increase in funding and whether the number of veterans is indeed lower today than three decades ago.

Let’s start with the budget numbers. Webb claims the president’s 2013 spending request is more double the amount in 1980 after the figures are adjusted for inflation.

President Barack Obama proposed a $140.3 billion budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs for the 2013 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.

Josephine Schuda, a spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, told us Congress appropriated $20.6 billion to the agency in fiscal 1980.

We adjusted that for inflation using the Consumer Price Index calculator on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. The appropriation in 1980 comes to $57.5 billion in modern-day dollars.

So Webb is right; the $140 billion request is more than double the amount appropriated in 1980, even after adjusting for inflation.

Now, let’s look at how the size of the veterans population three decades ago compares to today.

Schuda said that in 1980, there were 30.1 million veterans. The most recent VA numbers show there were 22.2 million veterans in September 2011.

That means the number of veterans in 1980 was about one-third larger than today’s veterans population. So Webb is right on this score, too.

Why were there more veterans in the 1980s than today? Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said a big contributor is that there were more surviving World War II veterans back in 1980 than today.

Tim Tetz, legislative director for the American legion, said a key reason VA funding has increased is that Congress in 1996 expanded the number veterans eligible to receive health care from the agency.

The VA budget has significantly expanded over the last 10 years under Obama as well as former President George W. Bush.  

There are 5.5 million patients in the VA health care system today. In 1980, there was only a fraction of the amount, Tetz said.

Our ruling

Webb said the president’s $140 billion request for veterans services is more than double what it was in 1980, when the veterans population was a third larger than today.

He’s right. We point out that major increases to the VA occurred in the last decade under the Bush and Obama administrations.

That said, we rate the senator’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096716040>],/factchecks/2012/jun/04/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-veteran-funding-has-risen-dramatical/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Ron Gerberry']","
State Rep. Ron Gerberry says early voting picks up right before an election
","
A controversial new election law will prohibit boards of elections across Ohio from opening their offices the last three days before the Nov. 6 election to allow voters to drop in and cast an absentee ballot before Election Day.

That’s a different set of rules from the last presidential election in 2008, when Ohio voters could visit election offices in the final days before the election and cast an absentee ballot.

Democratic lawmakers vehemently protested the rule change. While debating the legislative repeal of a broader election law, House Bill 194, they argued that  the prohibition should be reversed.

The last three days of early voting ""happen to be the most populated days of voting that we have in early voting,"" said Rep. Ron Gerberry, a Youngstown-area Democrat, at an April 17 news conference.

Gerberry was one of three Democrats at the event to explain their views on the legislative repeal of HB 194 and the importance of allowing in-person early voting the three days before the election.

Ultimately, majority Republicans passed legislation to repeal HB 194 without reversing the restriction on in-person early voting.

We at PolitiFact Ohio were curious about Gerberry’s claim because it could shed light on whether the new rule will affect voter turnout this fall.

When we contacted Gerberry, he referred us to Rep. Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat from Kent and a former election official, who stood alongside Gerberry and Rep. Vernon Sykes, an Akron Democrat, at the April news conference.

Clyde turned over her research that examined early voting statistics from Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton counties, the state’s three largest. The research focused on the final days of in-person early voting before the 2008 presidential election.

We reached out to the elections boards in each of the three counties to confirm Clyde’s figures.

In all three counties, the number of voters who cast absentee ballots at election offices increased as the election neared. However, fewer voters voted the final three days – Saturday, Sunday and Monday – compared to the three preceding weekdays.

The fact more people voted early on Wednesday through Friday would suggest Gerberry’s statement is incorrect. But Clyde’s research also factors in how many hours the three elections boards were open for business.

When time was factored in – early voting operations were open for fewer hours on the weekend – there were more voters per hour during the final three days compared to the three preceding weekdays.

In Cuyahoga County, 10,938 absentee ballots were cast at the board’s offices on the Saturday, Sunday and Monday before the 2008 election. In those three days, the board was open for 18.5 hours for a ratio of about 591 voters per hour. Over the three preceding days – Wednesday, Thursday and Friday – 12,552 such ballots were cast and the board was open for 31.5 hours, resulting in a ratio of about 398 voters per hour.

The same situation – fewer voters over the weekend but fewer hours of operation, resulting in more voters per hour over the final three days before the election – was also seen in Franklin and Hamilton counties.

Clyde said it’s important to factor in the time crunch, adding that, as a director of Franklin County’s early vote center in 2008, she would know.

""I ran it for 35 days straight,"" she said. ""We were slammed those three days. Analyzing by the hour is the only way it makes sense.""

While the stats show the final three days were the busiest in Ohio’s three largest counties, Gerberry used the word ""populated"" when characterizing the situation, which suggests more voters on those days. The data shows more ballots were cast the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday before Election Day.

Despite that discrepancy, Clyde’s underlying point was correct: the final days were busier. And it is reasonable to assume more people would have cast in-person absentee ballots the weekend before the election if the boards had stayed open longer.

We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E671C0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/04/ron-gerberry/state-rep-ron-gerberry-says-early-voting-picks-rig/
