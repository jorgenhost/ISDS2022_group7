Alex Sink says Pinellas County voted for her to be CFO, governor
","Democrat Alex Sink’s bid for the late C.W. Bill Young’s vacant U.S. House seat hasn’t exactly been helped by the fact that she isn’t a Pinellas native, though she did rent a condo and move there while launching her campaign. Republicans have harped on this point for months, calling Sink a ""carpetbagger."" They ask how could she well represent an area she didn’t grow up in. So it was no surprise that Sink addressed this concern at Monday night’s debate at St. Petersburg College. ""One of the things that sets me apart is that I’ve actually been elected by the people of Pinellas County,"" she said, responding to a moderator’s question about how she differs from Jolly and Libertarian Lucas Overby, both of whom have never ran for elected office before. ""They elected me as their chief financial officer and I served them and their interests. And they actually elected me as governor four years ago."" PolitiFact Florida revisited 2006 and 2010 election results to see if Sink was right that a majority of Pinellas County voters supported her. Sink won her bid for chief financial officer in 2006, beating out Republican Tom Lee with 55.5 percent of the vote in Pinellas and 53.5 percent statewide. That’s different than what happened in 2010, when Sink lost a tight gubernatorial race to Republican Rick Scott. She netted 47.7 percent of the statewide vote, shy of Scott’s 48.9 percent. In Pinellas, though, the story was different. There, Sink came out on top, and by a bigger margin, with 50.7 percent to Scott’s 45 percent. We chose to focus on Pinellas County percentages because that’s what Sink referred to in her claim. But for the March 11 special election, not all Pinellas voters are eligible to weigh in. Florida’s 13th congressional district spans from Fort de Soto Park up to Dunedin, but excludes parts of downtown and southern St. Petersburg. Our ruling Sink claimed that Pinellas County voters supported her in both her 2006 run for chief financial officer and her 2010 bid for governor. On both counts, the election results support her point. We rated her claim True.","[('Florida Department of State Division of Elections, chief financial officer official results, Nov. 7, 2006', 'http://doe.dos.state.fl.us/elections/resultsarchive/DetailRpt.Asp?ELECTIONDATE=11/7/2006&RACE=CFO&PARTY=&DIST=&GRP=&DATAMODE='), ('Florida Department of State Division of Elections, governor official results, Nov. 2, 2010', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with David Bergstein, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman, Feb. 4, 2014', 'http://doe.dos.state.fl.us/elections/resultsarchive/DetailRpt.Asp?ELECTIONDATE=11/2/2010&RACE=GOV&PARTY=&DIST=&GRP=&DATAMODE='), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""GOP takes aim at Alex Sink while waiting on Rick Baker,"" Oct. 30, 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2014/feb/05/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-pinellas-county-voted-her-be-cfo-go/

John Boehner says Obamacare is “expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs”
","Ever since President Barack Obama shepherded the Affordable Care Act to enactment, critics have called the health care law a job killer. Now, many of the critics are saying that a new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office proves their point. The CBO estimated that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. Shortly after the report was released on Feb. 4, 2014, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, joined many Republicans and conservatives in highlighting this finding via social media. Boehner tweeted, ""Pres. Obama’s #hcr law expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs http://on.wsj.com/1kM33oN  via @WSJ."" (Wonk alert: #hcr is shorthand for ""health care reform.) In short order, Democrats and liberal commentators took issue with such characterizations, saying Obama’s critics were misreading the report. A full-fledged war of facts and spin ensued. We have addressed previous CBO projections of this sort and found reasons to be skeptical of interpretations like Boehner’s. The key problem here is that claims by Boehner -- and other critics -- overlook the difference between workers and jobs, and Boehner was misleading when he used the word ""destroyed."" He made it sound as if jobs are going away because businesses don’t create them or because they eliminate existing jobs. The CBO report, though, was referring to workers who decide on their own to leave the workforce. The CBO figured that, when presented with new options for purchasing health insurance outside their job, millions of people would decide they don’t need to work as much. ""Workers who now have access to less expensive health insurance through Medicaid or with refundable federal tax credits that help them pay for premiums will not want to work such long hours after the ACA becomes fully implemented,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would ""reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive."" This would equal a ""decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,"" the report continued. These changes, CBO said, would not result in ""an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week)."" To be clear, the report predicts that total employment will still rise. It just won’t rise as much as it would if the ACA did not exist. Another key point: The CBO did not specify how many of the 2 million figure would include full-time positions, as compared to cases of an employee keeping their job but working fewer hours, or keeping one job while quitting a separate, part-time job. In some ways, a drop in the number of people who feel the need to work actually could be a boon to the unemployed. As we’ve noted, there are about three job seekers for every job vacancy in today’s economy -- a high ratio by historical standards. Some of these people could pick up the slack once vacancies open up -- and they should be able to, since CBO said it didn’t expect a major change in companies’ demand for workers. In essence, you’d be trading workers unhappy to be working for those who are desperate to be working. ""Unemployed workers who really need to find jobs to support their families, rather than to obtain health coverage, will find it easier to get jobs,"" Burtless said. ""After all, they will not face as much competition from the workers who were mainly remaining in the labor force to get a job with health coverage."" We see a few problems with Boehner’s phrasing  -- that the law is ""expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs."" (We have no quarrel with the 2.3 million figure; it’s the mid-point between 2.0 million and 2.5 million.) The first problem is the word ""destroy."" It’s inaccurate because it suggests that CBO says employers will be making 2.3 million layoffs. That's not correct -- the reduction will come primarily from voluntary choices by workers, not by by employers, the CBO said. The second problem is the word ""jobs."" Using that word glosses over the fact that CBO didn’t cite a number of jobs that will be reduced; it referred to full-time-equivalents of jobs. That may sound like a technical distinction, but it’s important. These job equivalents will be made of a lot of bits and pieces of hours per week that people will choose to drop. Many of these people might be working two or three jobs, in excess of 40 hours a week, and will choose to cut back to a more reasonable one or two jobs. All this said, it’s also worth pointing out a few less positive conclusions of the CBO report. As more people choose to work less, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. Also, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to,"" Sinclair said. ""But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing."" Sinclair said Boehner has a reasonable point in terms of the larger economic impact of these changes, but adds that he’s largely wrong in how he framed the labor-market question. ""In a macroeconomic sense, this still means fewer people working, even if that is their choice,"" she said. On the other hand, she added, ""it also probably means relatively higher wages and better bargaining power for those who are looking for a job. This is very different than the short-run effects of employers cutting positions, where we would see unemployment rates go up, less bargaining power for workers, and potentially relatively lower wages. So, the description of the source of the cut -- whether it’s from supply or demand -- does matter, but not for the count of ‘jobs.’ "" When we checked with Boehner’s office, spokesman Brendan Buck reiterated that the CBO report shows that ""there will be that many fewer people working – that many fewer people in jobs. Whether a result of a change in supply or demand for labor, that’s still bad for the economy. If there’s an error, it’s for tweeting in English instead of ‘economist.’"" Our ruling In his tweet, Boehner said that Obama’s health care law is ""expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs."" Boehner’s use of the word ""destroy"" mischaracterizes what is going on, since the reduction will come from voluntary actions by workers, rather than layoffs by employers. The law would not push up unemployment. In fact, some people at the low end of the wage ladder would find it easier to find work as a result of the predicted shifts in the workforce. In addition, it’s misleading to refer to 2.3 million ""jobs,"" since CBO combined all incremental losses of hours worked into full-time-job equivalents. Under this scenario, we would expect many more than 2.3 million people to be affected, but many of them would cut their hours a few at a time, rather than quitting their jobs entirely. It can be easy to miss the distinction between jobs and workers -- and the CBO report is not all rosy for the nation’s economic future. But Boehner’s statement remains flawed. We rate the claim Mostly False.","[('John Boehner, tweet, Feb. 4, 2014', 'https://twitter.com/johnboehner/status/430803187948204032'), ('Congressional Budget Office, The budget and economic outlook: 2014 to 2024, Feb. 4, 2014', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, No, the CBO did not say Obamacare will kill 2 million jobs, Feb. 4, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/documents/obamcare-cbo-budget-economic-outlook-february-2014/'), (""Forbes, White House: It's A Good Thing That Obamacare Will Drive 2.5 Million Americans Out Of The Workforce, Feb. 5, 2014"", 'No link'), ('Washington Post, Yes, Obamacare will probably downsize the workforce.

Carlson: CBO says Obamacare will cut full-time jobs by 2.3 million
","Ever since the Affordable Care Act passed, Republicans and conservative talk show hosts labeled it as a job killer and in their view, the latest economic report proves their point. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers for Congress, estimated that 10 years from now, there would be about 2.5 million fewer workers than there otherwise would be. How was that conveyed by the pundits? ""The CBO now says the president's health care law will cut the number of full-time jobs in the United States by 2.3 million by 2021,"" said Gretchen Carlson of Fox News. In the interview that followed, interrupted by a live briefing on the report from the White House, Carlson noted that much of the change stems from people deciding not to work. Carlson then went onto interview U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, where they discussed workers who have a difficult time finding full-time work. But Carlson’s statement is missing an important distinction that the CBO report makes between workers and jobs. (And it’s a mistake we’ve spotted before.) Carlson makes it sound as if jobs are going away because businesses don’t create them or they eliminate existing jobs. The CBO report, though, was referring to workers who decide on their own to leave the workforce. Here are the key quotes from the report: ""CBO’s projections of hours worked represent a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024."" ""The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor."" The government analysts basically figured that millions of people will decide they don’t need to work as much because the law makes health insurance more affordable. ""It will not represent an increase in either the unemployment rate or the number of unemployed workers,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based academic research center. ""Workers who now have access to less expensive health insurance through Medicaid or with refundable federal tax credits that help them pay for premiums will not want to work such long hours after the ACA becomes fully implemented."" For economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California - San Diego, this result is no surprise. The law gives most of its assistance to people making less money. ""Subsidizing insurance for low-income households, and providing Medicaid to the poor, involves reducing the returns to work. As earned income rises, the benefits phase out,"" Clemens said. The CBO report tracks with that, noting that the voluntary decisions to leave the workforce would be concentrated among lower-paid jobs. Another key point: The CBO did not specify how many of the 2 million figure would include actual full-time positions, as compared to cases of an employee keeping a job but working fewer hours, keeping one job but quitting a separate, part-time job, or leaving the workforce. And to be clear, the report predicts that total employment will rise. It just won’t rise as much as it would if the health care law did not exist. A drop in the number of people who feel they need to work actually could even be a boon to those who remain in the labor force, especially with relatively high unemployment. ""Unemployed workers who really need to find jobs to support their families, rather than to obtain health coverage, will find it easier to get jobs,"" said Burtless. ""After all, they will not face as much competition from the workers who were mainly remaining in the labor force to get a job with health coverage."" Still, the CBO expects the current unemployment rate to remain elevated; it won’t drop below 6 percent until 2017. This is not to say there are no downsides woven into the CBO projections. The labor force participation rate is expected to decline, putting a larger burden on those who remain working. ""Bigger implicit and explicit tax distortions are reducing productive economic activity,"" said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California - Berkeley. As the economy returns to full employment, Burtless expects that there would be a shortage of low-wage workers. ""The remaining taxpayers will have to pay slightly higher taxes to finance public health insurance subsidies than they would otherwise have to pay if the work hours of low-wage workers remained unchanged,"" Burtless said. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to,"" Sinclair said. ""But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing."" Our ruling Carlson said that the CBO predicts that Obamacare will cut the number of full-time jobs by 2.3 million. The word ""cut"" sends the message that jobs are being taken away, but that's not the case. On top of that, the statement confuses the number of jobs with the number of workers, and more specifically, the number of hours worked. The CBO said the health care law will give more people an incentive to reduce their hours; some will limit their hours and some will stop working altogether by their own choice. The law would not push up unemployment. It can be easy to miss the distinction between jobs and workers, but the statement remains flawed.

IDEA schools serve many from disadvantaged backgrounds and 99 percent of graduates have enrolled in college, though that overlooks students who left the schools
","Visiting a Rio Grande Valley school run by a Texas nonprofit, Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott credited the program with thriving, according to a news story by the Rio Grande Guardian The story quoted Abbott, visiting IDEA Weslaco on Dec. 12, 2013, as saying that through competition, IDEA Public Schools, a tuition-free K-12 public charter system with more than 15,000 students in 30 schools, had forced nearby school districts to improve. The Dec. 17, 2013, story continued: ""Abbott pointed out that 85 percent of IDEA students come from low-income families, many from colonias. However, about 99 percent go on to college."" Abbott, the state’s attorney general, further said that his ""goal of seeing the Texas education system rise to the No. 1 ranking in the country is achievable. When you have a school (IDEA) that can have such a large population of low-income students, including students from colonias, be able to come to the school, get a great education, have the dream of going to college and actually go on to college at the rate of 99 percent of the graduates, you see that the No. 1 ranking is within our grasp."" A reader brought Abbott’s 85 percent/99 percent claim to our attention. Online, IDEA Public Schools describes itself as a growing network of tuition-free K-12 public charter schools serving schools throughout the Rio Grande Valley, San Antonio and Austin. IDEA Allan Academy and College Prep opened in Austin in 2012, offering kindergarten through grade two plus grade six, via an agreement with the Austin school district. The district then ended the partnership, but the school continued by moving to a temporary location and there are plans to build a permanent school in the Montopolis area in time to enroll students in kindergarten through fourth plus sixth and eighth grades in fall 2014, according to a Nov. 1, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. In its online history thumbnail, IDEA traces its founding to two Teach for America volunteers; IDEA is an acronym for Individuals Dedicated to Excellence and Achievement. The group also says: ""IDEA is committed to ‘College For All Children.’"" As the basis of Abbott’s statement, Abbott campaign spokesman Avdiel Huerta emailed us a one-page IDEA document with a chart indicating that of 950 program graduates from 2007 through 2013, 947 enrolled in college. The only year with a difference in high-school graduates and students entering college was 2013 when 429 of 432 graduates made that transition, according to the chart. By telephone, Tom Torkelson, founder and ceo of IDEA Public Schools, told us the group developed the document in December 2013 after Abbott started talking up its successes. He said far less than 10 percent of the students tabulated as going to college start at two-year community colleges. A background section of the document says the organization’s vision is to become the ""number one producer of low-income college graduates in Texas."" Starting in middle school, it says, students are taken on college field trips; parents go to college-centric workshops. High school seniors are coached on applying to, and enrolling in, college, the document states. ""We do not rest until every IDEA graduate sets foot on their college campus the fall following high school commencement,"" the section closes. We asked Torkelson how many of its students ultimately finish college. He said that to date, 55 percent completed a degree in six years. ""There is still some work to do,"" he said. And are most students from low-income backgrounds? By email, IDEA spokeswoman Vanessa Barry sent us a portion of IDEA’s state 2012-13 Academic Performance Report, also posted online by the Texas Education Agency. In  2012-13, according to the report, IDEA schools had 12,567 students in kindergarten through 12th grade, with 10,491 of them, or 84 percent, considered economically disadvantaged. State reports for previous school years, posted online, show the share of students deemed economically disadvantaged increasing from 72 percent of about 2,700 IDEA students in 2007-08 to 82 percent of about 9,500 students in 2011-12. By email, Michael Franco, IDEA’s chief of staff, said that as of Dec. 9, 2013, 87 percent of the IDEA students came from low-income households, though he cautioned such a figure would not be verified by the state until the end of the school year. Torkelson said the prevalence of students from low-income backgrounds is in keeping with where IDEA schools are located. He said students are not chosen based on family incomes. We also inquired into how many students choose not to remain in, or flunk out of, IDEA schools. Torkelson said that 5 percent of the IDEA students enrolled at the start of a school year have chosen to go to a different school by the start of the next year, not counting another 5 percent of students whose families move out of state. At our request, Julian Vasquez Heilig, a University of Texas associate professor of educational policy and planning, built a chart estimating the share of IDEA students who have left the school before graduation. His estimation, rooted in data reported by the IDEA schools to the Texas Education Agency, was that 508 students graduated from the schools from 2007 through 2012, while about 54 students left the schools before having a chance to graduate--a subset equivalent to 11 percent of the graduates over the six years. By telephone, Heilig said that generally, charter schools airing such notable success rates should acknowledge that they are describing solely the students who remained in the schools’ programs. IDEA’s 99-percent claim, Heilig said, doesn’t demonstrate that every student who attends its schools goes to college. We shared Heilig’s chart with IDEA’s leaders, who replied by email with a statement from Torkelson calling the school’s 99 percent figure ""a fact that stands alone without the need for an asterisk. IDEA has been very open and clear that this number pertains to graduating seniors. Like other schools, both public charter and traditional who serve K-12 populations, IDEA does lose some students each year to a variety of factors (e.g. relocation, programs like traditional football that we cannot offer). However, this does not diminish the exceptional work of our students."" Our ruling Abbott said 85 percent of IDEA students come from low-income families and about 99 percent of its graduates go to college. In 2012-13, 84 percent of IDEA’s students came from economically disadvantaged households and according to IDEA, more than 99 percent of 950 IDEA graduates since 2007 subsequently went to college. Then again, the 99 percent figure does not account for any of perhaps 50 IDEA students who left its schools without graduating from 2007 through 2012. We rate Abbott’s claim, which did not acknowledge this limitation, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Mary Burke says Wisconsin is not a high tax and fee state, but instead ranks in the middle
","Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke has walked a tightrope on the issue of taxes early in her bid to knock off Gov. Scott Walker in November 2014. The Madison Democrat has supported what she calls fiscally responsible and targeted tax relief while criticizing Republican Walker’s plan to send at least half of a projected $1 billion budget surplus back to taxpayers. The former Trek Bicycle executive has said Wisconsin’s tax rates should be competitive with other states, but adds that businesses consider other factors first when considering expansion or relocation. Speaking Jan. 19, 2014 to the East Side Progressives group in Madison, Burke outlined her view of where Wisconsin ranks vs. other states on collecting revenue from citizens. ""If you look at, overall, all the money that state and local governments bring in from the people of Wisconsin, we're more in the middle,"" Burke said, according to a story posted on Madison’s WKOW.com site. ""In terms of a state, we're not a high tax and fee state."" Let’s start by noting that if Burke had limited her remarks to taxes -- not taxes and fees -- she would have flown in the face of Wisconsin’s No. 10 ranking among states for total tax burden as a share of personal income. Indeed, property-tax and income-tax collections here run more than 25 percent above the national average. Instead, she chose a broader measure of government revenue collection. And as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, the picture changes when fees become part of the mix. Was Burke right that the bigger picture shows we are ""more in the middle"" than ""high""? When we asked for backup, her campaign cited a report by the Tax Foundation ranking Wisconsin 23rd in per-capita ""state and local revenue."" That ranking reflects U.S. Census Bureau-reported figures derived from state governments, local municipalities, school districts and other taxing authorities. They are the grist for state-by-state rankings computed by research groups nationwide. But there is a major problem with Burke’s reliance on this particular ranking, aside from the fact that newer data is available. The ""state and local revenue"" category reflects federal aid received by these governmental units, not just ""taxes and fees."" Two respected fiscal research groups in Wisconsin confirmed that for us. We consulted the Wisconsin Budget Project affiliated with the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, and the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Let’s look at how these two groups tally up a more accurate look at ""taxes and fees"" and where Wisconsin ranks. Their findings vary slightly from each other due to methodological differences, but are in general agreement: Rankings based on population Wisconsin was ranked 19th and 18th by the groups on taxes plus fees on a per-capita basis. The Wisconsin figure of $6,346 per person is just slightly above the national average, the Budget Project calculated. That’s higher than the U.S. mark by about 1 percent or less -- $34 to $70 per person, based on the two groups’ research. Those are the two strongest points in favor of Burke’s claim. Rankings relative to personal income Wisconsin was ranked 14th by one organization and 16th by another on tax and fee collections relative to the state’s personal income. Using this measure, Wisconsin’s take is between 4.8 percent and 6 percent higher than the national average. Wisconsin collects taxes and fees equivalent to 15.2 percent of the state’s total personal income,  the Taxpayers Alliance says. South Dakota is lowest, at 10.8 percent, while Alaska leads at 27.7 percent. Which approach is better? Researchers use both measures, we found. Many say the income-based measure introduces a valuable ""ability to pay"" perspective, notes the Federal Funds Information for States. Jon Peacock, director of the Budget Project, said his group uses both in part because Wisconsin’s personal income per-person trails the U.S. average. So using the income approach naturally yields higher rankings for Wisconsin than those based on population, he noted. On another research point, Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance, said ""it’s useful to talk national average but rank gives a better sense of where we fit."" Rankings have dropped There’s no debate that Wisconsin’s ranking on tax-and-fee collections has dropped from near the top 10 over the last decade. In the year 2000, it was 13th based on the burden on personal income, and 11th based on the population measure. On fees alone, Wisconsin ranked 30th in the latest data despite local governments relying more heavily on them to make up for a near freeze in property tax revenue they can collect, the Taxpayers Alliance noted. In the big picture, Wisconsin traditionally relies more on taxes than do other states, and leans less on federal aid and user fees, license revenue and other charges. It’s important to note that these rankings cover only through mid-2011, and therefore don’t include tax cuts approved by Walker and legislative Republicans in the last two state budgets. What she said But the question at hand is Burke’s specific claim on taxes plus fees. Burke said Wisconsin’ ranking was closer to the middle, no longer ""high."" There’s certainly fodder for Burke in the finding that Wisconsin is within $34 of the national average by one measure. But how do we characterize a range of rankings from 14th to 19th? Are those out of the ""high"" zone? The Tax Foundation has described as ""mid-ranked"" states that came in below 15 or above 35 in a study of state and local tax collections as a share of income. It did so because so many states in that group are bunched closely together in terms of tax burdens, while states in the high and low groups are not. So, depending on which type of ranking you prefer, Wisconsin is either in that middle tier or at the lower edge of the ""high"" rankers. Our rating Burke said Wisconsin is ""not a high tax and fee state,"" adding that, ""When ""you look, overall, at all the money that state and local governments bring in,"" Wisconsin’s ranking is ""more in the middle."" Burke’s careful wording signals she meant the combination of taxes and fees raised by the state and local governments in Wisconsin, not taxes alone. Her campaign cites a statistic that is too broad to apply to an analysis of Wisconsin’s ""taxes and fees"" burden. By one widely used measure, Wisconsin is very close to middle of the pack -- just a shade over the national average with a ranking as low as 19th. By the other, we remain significantly above the national average, with a ranking around 15th. This meets the definition of partially accurate.

O'Reilly denies accusing WH of political motives in early Benghazi response
","The real fireworks of Super Bowl Sunday happened long before the snoozer of a football game between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks. The matchup: Fox News host Bill O’Reilly versus President Barack Obama. For 10 minutes in the lead-up to the big game, O’Reilly grilled the president about the botched rollout of the government’s health care website, IRS officials who scrutinized conservative advocacy groups and the president’s reaction to the fatal attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, which left the American ambassador and three other Americans dead. On Benghazi, O’Reilly and the president had this testy exchange: O'Reilly:  Your detractors believe that you did not tell the world it was a terror attack because your campaign didn't want that out. Obama:  Bill, think about... O'Reilly:  That's what they believe. Obama:  -- and they believe it because folks like you are telling them that. O'Reilly:  No, I'm not telling them that. The exchange was taken by some as Obama lashing out at Fox News and others as O’Reilly grandstanding. O'Reilly, who has been with Fox News since 1996, drew more than 4 million viewers for his Feb. 3, 2014, episode, which included more of the Obama interview. As fact-checkers, we can’t address either notion. But we wondered about O’Reilly’s claim that he did not peddle a narrative that Obama withheld information about the Benghazi attacks in order to advance his presidential campaign. A Benghazi timeline To refresh your memory, ground zero in this part of the Benghazi debate came Sept. 16, 2012, when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said on national television that the attack on the compound began spontaneously and was not pre-planned. The reality is murkier than that statement would imply, though the exact nature of the attack remains at least somewhat unclear. O’Reilly didn’t press Obama on what happened on the ground in Benghazi. He focused on how the administration characterized the attack. Rice’s interview came less than two months before what looked to be a very tight presidential election. So let’s look at what the White House said in the days surrounding the attack. Sept. 11 - A mix of a mob and armed attackers launch grenades and set fire to the American compound. Sept. 12 -- Obama said ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation."" He repeats those words on Sept. 13 and 14. Sept. 13 -- White House spokesman Jay Carney referred to an inflammatory video and said, ""The protests we're seeing around the region are in reaction to this movie. They are not directly in reaction to any policy of the United States or the government of the United States or the people of the United States."" Sept. 14 -- A State Department spokeswoman said, ""We are very cautious about drawing any conclusions with regard to who the perpetrators were, what their motivations were, whether it was premeditated."" But she ended with this: ""Obviously, there are plenty of people around the region citing this disgusting video as something that has been motivating."" Sept. 16 -- Rice said, ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned."" Sept. 20 -- Carney told reporters, ""It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials."" Sept. 20 -- Obama told an audience at a town hall meeting, ""What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests."" Sept. 21 -- The administration as a whole stated publicly that the attack was planned and executed by a terrorist group. Based on that record, O'Reilly isn't 100 percent correct to say Obama ""did not tell the world it was a terror attack."" But our question is whether O’Reilly advanced that argument and said it was for political reasons. O’Reilly on the record We searched transcripts and videos of The O’Reilly Factor and found that O’Reilly did not exactly say he personally believes that political strategists intervened to shape what Rice and others said. However, for more than a year, O’Reilly continued to raise the question when other news networks had less interest. And O’Reilly consistently cast the question of what happened during those 10 days in the worst possible light. A conversation between O’Reilly and retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters on May 6, 2013, is a prime example. O'Reilly: You believe the Obama administration did not tell the truth to the world, not just the American people, on purpose, for political reasons. That’s what you believe? Peters: I believe that President Obama lied to the American people. O'Reilly: Himself. Peters: Himself. Sec. (Hillary) Clinton lied to Congress. Susan Rice lied to the U.N.. Jay Carney lied to the media. And the mainstream establishment media have protected this administration right down the line. O’Reilly then said, ""Those are very serious charges, impeachable charges, if proven. How likely are we to get proof this week or going onward about what you believe?"" Peters said the proof is already there for those who want to see it. O’Reilly didn’t challenge Peters to prove his case. He did say that concrete proof would be needed. Then he pivoted to another Fox News analyst who described an Israeli airstrike on a Syrian weapons compound. With this, O’Reilly raised the specter of American military intervention in Syria. ""You know what Bill Clinton did when he got in trouble with Monica Lewinsky. He started to bomb,"" O’Reilly said. ""To divert attention and the ‘wag the dog’ theory. But we’re not going to speculate on that. All we’re going to do is report the facts."" Presumed political interference A few days later on May 10, 2013 -- eight months after the Benghazi attack --  O’Reilly interviewed ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl on Fox News and posed a question in a way that assumed a cover-up. ""Here is the bottom line,"" O’Reilly said. ""We need to find out who in the White House drove this, whether it was the president or somebody else trying to protect him in a re-election campaign. That's the main story, is it not?"" In a November interview on ABC with George Stephanopoulos as part of a book tour, O’Reilly asked, ""Who told her (Rice) to mislead the American public?"" On other occasions, O’Reilly invoked Watergate and the impeachments of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. In 2012, during his Talking Points Memo segment, he asked if ""the Libya situation is another Watergate?"" While conceding that this could turn out to be a ""big nothing,"" O’Reilly pressed the comparison. ""Look at it this way,"" O’Reilly said. ""Back in 1972, Richard Nixon denied he had anything to do with a low-level political break in. If the press had not been aggressive, Nixon would have gotten away with it. And certainly the break in at the Watergate Hotel was not nearly as important as failing to define a terrorist attack that killed four Americans."" In addition, O’Reilly told his viewers that they would not get the complete story from other large news organizations. ""We all know the media is sympathetic to Barack Obama,"" he said in his May interview with the Fox analysts. ""We all know they nurture him. They root for him. And they even promote his policies. That is beyond a reasonable doubt."" Appealing to Fox viewers O’Reilly’s enduring interest in Benghazi fits with the Fox News audience. A May 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to follow the latest news about Benghazi and that over half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents regularly watch Fox News. This group voiced the greatest frustration with the Benghazi situation. ""Fully 79 percent of Republicans who regularly watch Fox News say the Obama administration has been dishonest,"" the report said. That O’Reilly might stick with the Benghazi story comes as no surprise to Mike Conway, a journalism professor at Indiana University. ""The Fox audience would like the news to reflect what they believe,"" Conway said. ""If it makes a Democrat look bad, that story will resonate stronger and if a story resonates with your core audience, that’s a reason to stay with it."" Our ruling O’Reilly said he didn't tell viewers that the Obama campaign hid news about the motives behind the attack in Benghazi because he was running for re-election. While O’Reilly did not use those exact words, he consistently said that someone was trying to mislead the American public. He repeatedly compared the situation to the impeachments of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. O’Reilly nurtured suspicion. We rate his claim Mostly False.","[('Fox News, Bill O’Reilly interviews President Barack Obama, Feb. 2, 2014', 'http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/02/transcript-bill-oreilly-interviews-president-obama/'), ('CBS News, Face the Nation, Sep. 16, 2012', 'No link'), ('Fox News, The O’Reilly Factor, May 10, 2013, via Nexis', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/rice-libya-attacks-spontaneous/'), ('Fox News, The O’Reilly Factor, May 14, 2013, via Nexis', 'No link'), ('Fox News, The O’Reilly Factor, Jan. 17, 2014', 'http://oreilly.foxnews.mobi/quickPage.html?page=14458&content=101438666&pageNum=-1'), ('Fox News, The O’Reilly Factor, Bill O’Reilly: Is the Libyan situation another Watergate?, Nov. 16, 2012', 'No link'), ('Fox News, The O’Reilly Factor, May 6, 2013', 'http://www.billoreilly.com/b/Bill-OReilly:-Is-the-Libyan-situation-another-Watergate/128910870208639833.html'), ('Fox News, The O’Reilly Factor, Jan. 17, 2014', 'No link'), ('Fox News, The Benghazi hearings in Washington today, \xa0Sept. 19, 2013', 'https://youtu.be/gT0xnrUnJG4'), ('ABC News, Interview with Bill O’Reilly, Nov. 27, 2013', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Romney says Obama waited 14 days to call Libya attack terror, Oct. 17, 2012', 'http://oreilly.foxnews.mobi/quickPage.html?page=14458&content=101438666&pageNum=-1'), (""PolitiFact, Jay Carney says Susan Rice didn't play down terrorist involvement in Benghazi, May 13, 2013"", 'No link'), ('Media Research Center, Benghazi blackout: How the big three networks have censored or spun the Obama administration’s deadly foreign policy failure, Sept. 9, 2013', 'http://oreilly.foxnews.mobi/quickPage.html?page=25809&content=92831049&pageNum=-1'), ('Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, Benghazi investigation does not reignite broad public interest, May 13, 2013', 'No link'), ('Interview, Mike\xa0Conway, professor, Indiana University School of Journalism, Feb. 4, 2014', 'https://youtu.be/07pYhSEB-4A'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2014/feb/04/bill-oreilly/oreilly-denies-accusing-wh-political-motives-early/

Barack Obama says it's up to Congress to change how feds classify marijuana
","The buck may stop at the president, but does the blunt stop at Congress? For the second time in recent weeks, President Barack Obama was asked to publicly weigh in on the debate over decriminalization and legalization of marijuana. During an interview aired Jan. 31, 2014, CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Obama whether he would consider changing marijuana’s status as a Schedule I narcotic, a distinction that bans the substance from sale or use for medicinal or recreational purposes. ""Well, first of all,"" Obama contended, ""what is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress."" ""I think it's the (Drug Enforcement Administration) that decides,"" Tapper offered. ""It's not something by ourselves that we start changing,"" Obama replied. ""No, there are laws undergirding those determinations."" The back and forth was emblematic of the confusion surrounding the federal government's position on cannabis, particularly in Washington and Colorado, where new state laws legalizing marijuana technically run afoul of federal bans. But in this particular case, who is right, Tapper or Obama? Congress, the White House and controlled substances As usual, Obama has chosen his words carefully. He says that determining the classification of marijuana is ""a job for Congress,"" not ""the job of Congress."" That could mean Obama philosophically believes that Congress should ultimately decide the fate of marijuana, even if his administration has some control over it. And to be clear, it does. But it’s complicated and not without roadblocks. First, a quick history lesson. Congress passed the Controlled Substance Act in 1970, and it was signed by President Richard Nixon later that year. The law set up guidelines to regulate and enforce the usage, production, sale and importation of various drugs and substances. In the law, Congress created five schedules to classify drugs and narcotics by medical use and potential to incite substance abuse. At one end of the scale is Schedule V drugs, which include substances like cough medicines with small amounts of the narcotic codeine. On the other end of the spectrum are Schedule I substances. These drugs have no accepted medical use and ""are considered the most dangerous class of drugs with a high potential for abuse and potentially severe psychological and/or physical dependence,"" according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Distribution, manufacturing or possession of a Schedule I substance is a federal offense. When Congress passed the Controlled Substance Act, lawmakers singled out several dozen drugs that fall under this category. Among opiates, like heroin, and amphetamines, Congress included marijuana. Congress could amend the law to reschedule marijuana or exempt the substance altogether, as it did for alcohol and tobacco products. But there is another way to lawfully reclassify marijuana and it does involve the executive branch. According to the Controlled Substance Act, the attorney general, through the Drug Enforcement Administration, has the power to change the classification of a substance or remove it entirely, but only if the drug meets certain criteria. First, the attorney general reviews eight factors to determine what schedule to assign a substance, according to the law. The drug's actual or relative potential for abuse Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the
drug Its history and current pattern of abuse The scope, duration, and significance of abuse What, if any, risk there is to the public health The drug's psychic or physiological dependence liability Whether the drug is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under the Controlled Substances Act. If the DEA feels a substance should be reclassified, the agency can request a scientific and medical evaluation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to determine if there are safe medical uses for the drug in question. Anyone from a drug company to a local government or even an individual citizen can also petition for review of a drug. Whatever conclusion HHS determines ""shall be binding on the attorney general as to such scientific and medical matters,"" according to the law. That means the DEA cannot change the classification of a drug unless HHS says there are medical uses and it’s safe for consumption. The Food and Drug Administration, the agency under Health and Human Services that handles these reviews, has continually reaffirmed that ""the scientific evidence to date is not sufficient for the marijuana plant to gain FDA approval."" While research continues, the FDA said because marijuana can be addictive and clinical testing on the benefits of marijuana are not conclusive, it won’t give the DEA the go-ahead to reclassify the drug. In 2001 and 2011 the DEA, citing FDA research, turned down petitions to reclassify marijuana, and in 2006, the FDA upheld that ""smoked marijuana has no currently accepted or proven medical use in the United States."" Guidelines updated as recently as 2012 reflected that opinion. Many scientists have debated the merits of the FDA’s ruling, but in an email to PolitiFact, the White House reiterated that the agency’s findings serve as the basis for any action from the Justice Department. So basically, there is a mechanism for the executive branch to change the schedules. But it’s an arduous process and not something Obama can change by decree. And while the FDA is an executive agency that includes presidential appointees, the FDA’s recommendations are supposed be based on science, not politics. But Obama has found other ways to get around the FDA’s unwillingness to concede the medical benefits of marijuana to appease states that have gone a different direction. Schedule I substances cannot legally be used for medical purposes; however, 20 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana. In 2009, the Obama administration told federal law enforcement agencies to stop targeting medical marijuana dispensaries, signaling a change from the approach of President George W. Bush. Similarly, last year the Department of Justice said it would not target new laws in Colorado and Washington legalizing recreational marijuana. So even though marijuana remains a Schedule 1 substance, the current administration, through various memorandums, has not always treated it as one under the law. Our ruling Obama said ""what is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress."" While Obama may feel that way philosophically, there is a process by which the executive branch can reclassify marijuana to allow for its medical use or completely remove it from the list of controlled substances. It’s not an easy process, but it’s there. And Obama’s Justice Department has often given tacit approval, or at least turned a blind eye, when states have taken steps to ignore the federal government’s classification.

"['Georgia', 'Legal Issues', 'Nan Orrock']","
Orrock questions drug testing plan
","Partisan sparring by state lawmakers in an election year -- who could imagine such a thing? But the gloves came off when state Rep. Greg Morris, R-Vidalia, and state Sen. Nan Orrock, D-Atlanta, appeared on a television newscast to debate Morris’ proposal to require drug testing of applicants for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly the federal food stamp program. Georgia currently has a law on the books that mandates drug testing of applicants for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or what most people think of as welfare. But it’s been on hold because of legal battles over the constitutionality of a similar Florida law. Morris said his bill, much like the TANF drug-testing laws, is designed to ensure that the tax dollars of working Georgians aren’t subsidizing drug use. Orrock said the bill, if enacted, would violate the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against warrantless and suspicionless searches. She also said it would not be a money-saver. The Atlanta lawmaker said Florida spent more money for drug tests once its TANF law was implemented than it saved denying benefits to people who tested positive for drugs. We decided that claim was worth putting to a test of its own -- a truth test, especially given that, as of October, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 1,883,966 Georgians were receiving food stamps. Orrock said she based her statement on a story in The Miami Herald about Florida’s program, which operated for four months before it was halted due to legal challenges. The newspaper reported that 4,086 welfare applicants were subject to drug testing, and 108 people, or 2.6 percent, failed. An additional 40 people scheduled but canceled their tests. State law required Florida to reimburse applicants who tested negative an average of $35 for the screening -- or a total of $118,140. The result was a net loss of $45,780, the newspaper reported. Those same statistics, which support Orrock’s statement, were repeated in The New York Times and other publications. We also reached out to the Florida Department of Children & Families, the agency that headed the four months of drug testing of TANF applicants. Michelle Glady, the agency’s press secretary, said the department spent $115,364.95 on drug-test reimbursements, a slightly lower number than others reported Glady said she did not provide the news media with the numbers that were reported on a net loss. But the department also didn’t deny any benefits and so saw no savings. ""Benefits were restored"" because of the lawsuit, Glady said. PolitiFact has done extensive research and reviewed several studies on the topic of drug testing of recipients of government assistance, including claims that these initiatives can save taxpayers’ money. The ones we found showed that the costs to the state exceed any savings. In Florida, the American Civil Liberties Union sued over the law requiring drug testing of TANF recipients, saying it constituted an ""unreasonable search"" by the government, a violation of the Fourth Amendment. U.S. District Judge Mary S. Scriven issued a temporary injunction in October 2011, saying the law ""appears likely to be deemed a constitutional infringement."" And this past December, she ruled that the 2011 law requiring Florida welfare applicants to undergo drug tests was unconstitutional. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who had made the drug testing a campaign issue, has filed an appeal. In a harshly worded, 30-page opinion, Scriven concluded that ""there is no set of circumstances under which the warrantless, suspicionless drug testing at issue in this case could be constitutionally applied."" Scott has insisted that the urine tests are needed to make sure poor children don’t grow up in drug-riddled households. Maria Kayanan, associate legal director for the ACLU in Florida, said the full costs of the drug-testing law in that state are unknown. The state hired outside attorneys, and their bills are not yet fully tallied, Kayanan said. She said she would expect Morris’ legislation, if passed, to face the same legal challenges and outcomes as Florida’s law to drug-test TANF applicants. Melissa Johnson, a policy analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, also predicted that there would be legal obstacles to Morris’ bill. Federal law prohibits states from adding requirements for participants in the food stamp program, Kayanan and Johnson said. ""It’s like a hammer looking for a nail,"" Johnson said. ""There is no evidence that a problem exists."" So where does this leave us? Orrock based her statement on news accounts about the Florida experience. Previous studies also suggest that similar measures elsewhere would not save taxpayers money.

Mitchell says Iran was 'more or less' a U.S. ally in 2002
","President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address fueled an extended political pre-game show that almost rivaled the chatter ahead of the Super Bowl. Every network fielded experts to assess what the president might say, why he would say it, and what could happen next. On the afternoon of the speech, MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell was deep in conversation with MSNBC political director Chuck Todd and Washington Post political reporter Chris Cillizza. The three agreed that despite the hype, these speeches deliver few surprises. But Mitchell said in her mind, the great exception came in 2002 when President George W. Bush named Iran, North Korea and Iraq as part of ""an axis of evil."" ""Up until that moment, Iran was cooperating with the United States on the border of Afghanistan,"" Mitchell, MSNBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent, said. ""Post 9/11, Iran was more or less an American ally. By being included in the axis of evil, it turned the Iranian government in a completely different direction. It was a turning point in American politics and in foreign policy."" To say Iran and American ally in the same breath drew ridicule from the conservative community. The website Townhall.com wrote of Mitchell’s stunning ""historical ignorance."" Breitbart.com called her claim ""a delusion."" For this fact-check, we go to the record to assess whether in January 2002 Iran qualifies as ""more or less an American ally."" A tortured relationship Ties between the U.S. and Iran have been troubled for over 50 years. With the help of the CIA and the British, a coup toppled Iran’s elected leader in 1953 and led to the autocratic control by the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. An Islamic fundamentalist revolution displaced the Shah in 1979, producing the famous hostage crisis with American embassy staff. The U.S. has had no embassy in Iran since. Over the decades, there have been episodes when tensions between the two countries eased, but the dominant climate has been one of profound distrust if not outright hostility. The U.S. backed Iraq’s Saddam Hussein in his war with Iran. Iran supported the Hezbollah in Lebanon as a military surrogate to strike at Israel. In recent years, the desire to shut down Iran’s nuclear program has defined American policy toward the Middle Eastern nation. With that background, it would come as a surprise to ever characterize Iran as anything approaching a partner of the United States. But if there was such a moment, it was immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks on American soil. The enemy of my enemy Iranian and American interests dovetailed in Afghanistan, which lies along Iran’s eastern border. Iran viewed the Taliban as a threat. ""For many, many years, the Iranians backed the Northern Alliance, the opponents to the Taliban,"" said Hossein Askari, a professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs. The Northern Alliance became America’s wedge into Afghanistan in an offensive that overthrew the Taliban in a matter of weeks. Askari said Iran had boots on the ground in those attacks. ""Iran had its military advisers within the Northern Alliance forces,"" Askari said. ""I was told they fought side by side."" To block a resurgent Taliban, both Iran and the U.S. wanted to establish a strong centralized government in Afghanistan. This required a partnership between two ethnic groups, the Tajik leaders of the Northern Alliance and the Pashtuns of Hamid Karzai. But the Northern Alliance was not interested. According to a RAND report prepared for U.S. Marine Corps, Iran brought the two sides together. ""Iranian political pressure on Northern Alliance leaders during negotiations in Bonn, Germany, persuaded them to reach a compromise and agree to the formation of the new government,"" the RAND report said. Soon after Sept. 11, Iran also helped the U.S. with al-Qaida. This also fit with Iran’s interests. Al-Qaida is on the other side of the religious divide that splits the Arab world. Al-Qaida is Sunni while Iran is Shia. Iran gave no harbor to members of the terrorist organization. ""They turned al-Qaida operatives out of their country,"" Askari said. A former Bush administration official told the Associated Press that Iran copied the passports of about 300 of those operatives and sent them to the United Nations where they were handed over to the Americans. Temporary partners, not allies While all of these moves put Iran and the U.S. on the same side, Askari would not goes as far as Mitchell suggested. ""I totally disagree that they were allies,"" Askari said. ""Their interests merged on this one issue, the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Iran wanted to have a say in what happened in Afghanistan. But on other issues, they kept their distance."" As an historical note, Askari believes the Iranians became most interested in a new relationship with the U.S. only when American forces rapidly drove Saddam Hussein out of power. ""They were shaking in their boots,"" Askari said. ""They really thought that if the U.S. could do that to Saddam Hussein so quickly, they could be next."" But whatever overtures Iran made at that moment were met with no response from the Bush administration. Our ruling Mitchell said that in 2002, Iran was almost an ally of the United States. While Iran provided critical assistance in the military defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan and helped undermine al-Qaida, this cooperation did not reflect deeper ties. It was a moment when both countries sought similar goals in one country. Mitchell’s point was the Bush administration squandered an opportunity. That might have merit, but there is no fact-checking a hypothetical situation. What we can assess is the degree to which Iran was ""more or less"" an ally. With due regard for the ambiguity in Mitchell’s words, we rate the claim Half True.","[('MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell Reports, Jan. 28, 2014', 'http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB435/'), ('National Security Archive, CIA confirms role in 1953 Iran coup, Aug. 19, 2013', 'No link'), ('RAND National Defense Research Institute, Iran’s balancing act in Afghanistan, 2011', 'https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/occasional_papers/2011/RAND_OP322.pdf'), ('American Foreign Policy Project, U.S. - Iran relations: Catalogue of missed opportunities, June 12, 2008', 'No link'), ('Townhall.com, Andrea Mitchell: Iran Was Basically an American Ally Until Bush Ruined Everything, Jan. 29, 2014', 'http://americanforeignpolicy.org/overview-how-to-deal-with-iran/a-short-history-of-us-iran-relations-post-revolution'), (""Breitbart, NBC'S Andrea Mitchell: Iran an American ally before Bush blew it, Jan. 28, 2014"", 'No link'), ('CBS News, Iran gave U.S. help on al Qaeda after 9/11, Oct. 7, 2008', 'http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/01/29/nbcs-andrea-mitchell-iran-was-basically-an-american-ally-before-bush-n1786025'), ('Middle East Policy Council, U.S.-Iran Engagement Through Afghanistan, Spring 2010', 'No link'), ('The National Interest, A broken engagement, Nov. 1, 2007', 'http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2014/01/28/nbc-andrea-mitchell-iran-an-american-ally-in-war-on-terror-until-bush-blew-it'), ('Interview with Hossein Askari, professor of international business and international affairs, George Washington University Elliott School of International Affairs, Jan. 31, 2014', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2014/feb/03/andrea-mitchell/mitchell-says-iran-was-more-or-less-us-ally-2002/

Surovell says 85 percent of states have stopped using their electric chairs
","The possibility that Virginia will return to its electric chair to execute all condemned prisoners is shocking to Del. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax. Since 1995, Virginia has given such prisoners a choice in their manner of death: lethal injection or electrocution. Seventy-nine inmates have died by injection; seven chose the chair. Drug manufacturers have stopped producing the products used to put people to death by lethal injection. Virginia’s supply ran out on Nov. 30. The House of Delegates, on a largely party-line vote on Jan. 22, passed a bill saying if drugs for the lethal injections are unavailable, electrocution will be used instead. Surovell led the Democratic debate against the bill, saying Virginia should seek a more humane form of capital punishment rather than return to the electric chair. ""Eighty-five percent of the states in the United States that had electrocution have now abolished it,"" he said. We wondered if that statistic is accurate. Surovell sent us two articles to back his statement. One was a 1994 study by Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University, which said  that 26 states have used electrocution dating to the 19th century. Surovell also sent us a December 2012 article in Virginia Lawyer that cited Denno’s number of 26 states once allowing electrocutions, but added that all but four ""have now moved away from it  -- either by legislative abandonment or judicial ruling."" That translates to an 85 percent drop in states. The four states that still allow electrocutions, the article said, are Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and Florida. Two more -- Kentucky and Tennessee -- permit prisoners convicted only before 1998 and 1999, respectively, to select electrocution. The U.S. Department of Justice has different numbers, but they’re misleading. The department issued a report last July saying that as of 2011, the 36 states with capital punishment all allowed lethal injections. Eight of those states, DOJ said, also allowed for the possibility of electrocutions. Two of the states really don’t belong on the list, however, because their laws do not currently permit use of electric chairs. Arkansas allows any inmate convicted of a capital offense on or before July 4, 1983 to request death by electrocution. But there are no prisoners left on the state’s death row that qualify for the option. Oklahoma’s law ""authorizes electrocution if lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional."" That hasn’t happened. Our Ruling Surovell said, ""85 percent of the states in the United States that had electrocution have now abolished it."" Academic research shows 26 states have allowed electrocutions since the 19th century. A review of laws today shows that six states may still use their electric chairs at a condemned prisoner’s request. That means 77 percent of the states that had electrocutions have ended the practice. Surovell is right that states are shutting down their electric chairs, but his percentage is slightly off. We rate his statement Mostly True.","[('Legislative Information System, HB 1052, accessed Jan. 27, 2014.', 'http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=141&typ=bil&val=hb1052'), ('Del.

"['Georgia', 'Medicaid', 'State Budget', 'Raphael Warnock']","
Ranks of uninsured high in Georgia
","A chorus of Democratic lawmakers and supporters has been increasingly vocal in pushing Gov. Nathan Deal to expand Medicaid in Georgia. One of those voices is the Rev. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, the former pulpit of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Warnock, the keynote speaker at this year’s MLK Commemorative Service at Ebenezer, used the occasion -- with political heavyweights of both sides of the aisle in the room -- to demand an expansion. He cited a statistic we’ve seen others mention to make his case. ""Georgia has the fifth-highest number of uninsured people of any state in the union,"" he said. Is this correct? PolitiFact Georgia was curious for a few reasons. U.S. census figures show Georgia has the eighth-highest population in the nation, so the Peach State’s ranking would be higher than some states that have more residents, if Warnock is correct. We’ve also heard similar claims in the past from others who support the expansion, so PolitiFact Georgia thought now is a good time to find out if they’re right. As part of the federal health care law, also known as Obamacare, the federal government pays for the full cost of newly eligible Medicaid recipients under expansion for the first three years. Its share then drops to no lower than 90 percent of the cost. In Georgia, it’s estimated that as many as 650,000 additional residents would be eligible for Medicaid. Deal, whose last vote as a congressman was against the health care law, has been adamantly opposed to the Medicaid expansion. The governor has said he’s wary of expanding coverage for fear that Uncle Sam will be unable to fulfill its funding pledge for the additional Medicaid recipients. Deal has estimated the expansion would cost the state $4 billion over a decade, but supporters of the health care law say the cost would likely be closer to half of that. Medicaid expansion supporters contend Georgia could get about $30 billion over 10 years from the federal government. Deal, who spoke at the MLK service, had left by the time Warnock addressed the audience. The pastor — who called Deal ""courageous"" for his position on other issues, such as prison re-entry — told us, ""I’d like to see the same courage on Medicaid expansion."" An Atlanta Journal-Constitution statewide poll done in September found nearly 60 percent of Georgians don’t like the health care law, but approximately the same percentage of respondents believe Medicaid should be expanded. Warnock said he had done some research on where Georgia ranked nationally in terms of uninsured residents and believed he was ""in the ballpark"" on his claim. He forwarded a two-page fact-sheet by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, which supports an expansion, that says Georgia ranks fifth in the number of uninsured residents. He shared a 2012 Kaiser Family Foundation report that ranked Georgia tied for fifth in the percentage of uninsured residents, at 19 percent, along with Alaska and California. In order, the top four states were Nevada, Florida, New Mexico and Louisiana. A 2013 Gallup poll found Georgia ranked sixth nationally in that category, with approximately 22.5 percent of its residents uninsured. The top five were Texas, Louisiana, Nevada, California and Florida. The results were based on telephone interviews conducted as part of a yearlong survey of a random sample of adults across the nation. Some interviews were done in Spanish. The Corporation for Enterprise Development, an organization that works to alleviate poverty, released a study that found nearly 22 percent of Georgians under the age of 65 were uninsured in 2011. That was the fourth-highest total in the nation, behind only Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. The corporation used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for its findings. The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey has a breakdown of uninsured residents by state. In 2012, Georgia ranked sixth, with about 19 percent of its residents uninsured, slightly above the national average of 16 percent. The top five states were Texas, Nevada, New Mexico, Florida and Louisiana. Georgia State University associate professor Bill Custer said there are several factors concerning why Georgia ranks consistently among the states with the highest percentage of uninsured residents. Georgia, he said, has a larger percentage of residents who cannot afford health insurance because their wages are low or they are unemployed. We recently fact-checked a claim by state Sen. Jason Carter, D-Atlanta, that the average Georgia family makes $6,000 less than the average family did 10 years ago when inflation is factored in. Carter’s claim was rated True. Another factor, Custer said, is many Georgians live in rural parts of the state and work in industries such as agriculture and retail where their employers cannot afford to provide health care. Custer wrote a report in February 2013 that concluded the expansion would support 70,343 jobs statewide over a 10-year span. About half of those jobs would be in the health care industry, Custer said. ""For us not to accept the Medicaid expansion is a barrier to economic growth,"" Warnock said in a telephone interview. ""You’ll produce jobs. If you provide that health care (to those additional Medicaid recipients), someone has to provide that health care."" To sum up, Warnock said Georgia has the fifth-highest number of uninsured residents. Our research showed he’s indeed in the ballpark. We rate his claim True.  ","[('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Hundreds gather to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. at Ebenezer Baptist Church,"" Jan. 20, 2014.', 'https://www.ajc.com/news/news/hundreds-gather-to-celebrate-martin-luther-king-jr/nctpW/'), ('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""NAACP, supporters call for Medicaid expansion,"" Jan. 13, 2014.', 'No link'), ('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Georgians Wary Of Health Law; AJC poll finds most view act unfavorably, but like some elements,"" Sept. 22, 2013.', 'https://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/naacp-supporters-call-for-medicaid-expansion/ncmmC/'), ('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Texas no model for Georgia,"" July 14, 2013.', 'No link'), ('American Community Survey, ""Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage,"" 2012.', 'https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/data/incpovhlth/2012/tables.html'), ('Corporation for Enterprise Development ranking of uninsured residents by state, 2011.', 'No link'), ('Gallup poll on state-by-state rankings of uninsured residents, March 8, 2013.', 'http://scorecard.assetsandopportunity.org/2013/measure/uninsured-rate'), ('Georgia Budget and Policy Institute fact-sheet, ""The Dollars and Sense of Expanding Medicaid in Georgia,"" February 2013.', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation report on uninsured residents by state, 2012.', 'http://www.gallup.com/poll/161153/texas-uninsured-rate-moves-further-away-states.aspx'), ('PolitiFact Georgia, ""The average Georgia family makes $6,000 less than the average family did 10 years ago when inflation is factored in,"" Jan. 24, 2014.', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview with the Rev.

NFL's Goodell says players live longer than average male
","Fox started its wall-to-wall coverage of Super Bowl XLVIII on Fox News Sunday, with host Chris Wallace interviewing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell live from MetLife Stadium. Goodell talked about the weather, and how it appears conditions will be fine for the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks. He addressed a proposal to eliminate extra points, saying they’re almost automatic (as we previously reported, they are). And he discussed the health of NFL players amid concern that the sport is too violent. Goodell offered a defense that we hadn’t heard before. ""Our players are living, on average, longer than the average male,"" Goodell said. After serious talk about concussions in the NFL and some prominent suicides in the sport, we wondered about Goodell’s claim. It’s accurate, it turns out, but requires some additional explanation. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a government research agency within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, studied the mortality rates of former NFL football players in a report released in 2012. The study included nearly all NFL players who played in the league for five or more years from 1959 to 1988 -- a pool of 3,439 men. Researchers said based on current mortality rates, they expected 625 players to be deceased. But by the end of 2007, only 334 were. ""We found the players in our study had a much lower rate of death overall compared to men in the general population,"" researchers wrote to the NFL players in a March 2012 letter. ""This means that, on average, NFL players are actually living longer than men in the general  population."" The former NFL players also had lower rates of heart disease and cancer compared to average males, the report found. There are a few important caveats to point out. NFL players aren't like your average male in a number of ways. They are professional athletes, many of whom might be wealthy, and they are likely to have access to quality health care. The report also raised red flags. Researchers found that men who were considered obese, those with a Body Mass Index of 30 or more when they played, had twice the risk of death from heart disease than other players. African-American players also had a higher heart disease risk than Caucasian players, the report found. Another important note: Because the study excludes modern-day players, it fails to account for the changing physique of today’s football player. Of the 3,439 men in the NIOSH study, only 1 percent had a Body Mass Index of 35 or more when they played, and 33 percent had a Body Mass Index between 30 and 35. Today’s NFL players are much bigger. To create an example, we looked at the current 53-man roster of the Denver Broncos and calculated each player’s Body Mass Index using a calculator from the National Institutes of Health. Of 53 Broncos players, 13 have a Body Index above 35 (24.5 percent) and another 14 have a Body Mass Index between 30 and 35 (26.4 percent). That’s an important distinction that may affect the results of future studies. Our ruling Goodell said that NFL ""players are living, on average, longer than the average male."" His claim is backed up by a government study that examined former NFL players who played from 1959 to 1988. But the study, which was released in 2012, did conclude that bigger players had an increased risk of dying from heart disease and did not evaluate more modern-day players. Modern-day players are bigger. We rate Goodell’s statement Mostly True.","[('Fox News Sunday, interview with Roger Goodell, Feb. 2, 2014', 'http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/pdfs/NFL_Notification_01.pdf'), ('NIOSH, ""Heart health concerns for NFL Players,"" accessed Feb. 2, 2014', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""N.F.L.

Mary Burke says Wisconsin trails every other Midwest state in job creation
","Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke says Wisconsin’s job-creation record not only lags behind the national average, but ranks as worst in the Midwest since Gov. Scott Walker took office. ""I think we have to focus on what’s going to create jobs here,"" Burke, the former state Commerce secretary, said Jan. 14, 2014 in Kenosha. ""That’s how you’re going to get taxes down, if you grow the economy."" Burke added this, according to WITI-TV (Channel 6) in Milwaukee: ""You have to get the base larger in Wisconsin — and we haven’t seen that.  We’re trailing every other state in the Midwest in terms of job creation since January of 2011."" Wisconsin’s national job-growth ranking of 37th was highlighted in December when quarterly jobs data through June 2013 was released. Other figures suggest that Walker, now in the final year of his term, is only about 40 percent of the way to his goal of creating 250,000 private sector jobs in his four-year term. But is the state last among its neighbors? When we asked the Burke campaign to back up its claim, it pointed us to a chart on the Capital Times website that tracks monthly job-creation data covering January 2011 -- Walker’s first month as governor -- through November 2013, the latest available at that time the statement was made. The chart showed Wisconsin’s 4 percent growth rate trailing its four adjoining neighbors -- by a wide margin in two cases (Michigan and Minnesota), and by slim margins in the other two (Iowa and Illinois). We confirmed Wisconsin’s ranking by examining the data, which is reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as well as state of Wisconsin officials. We’re not done yet. Regular PolitiFact readers know there is more than one way to paint by numbers on employment. There are two distinctly different sources of jobs data. Burke cites the Current Employment Statistics figures, gleaned from a monthly survey of business establishments that provides estimates of employment, hours and earnings data by industry. Those monthly figures are frequently cited by researchers and the media, but the are estimates subject to revision, sometimes quite large ones. They are based on surveys of about 3 percent of businesses but are valued for their timeliness. The more accurate, if less timely, source of jobs data comes from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which is drawn from a census of 98 percent of U.S. businesses. The counts, though, lag behind real time by six to nine months. How does Wisconsin fare under the quarterly data, which economists consider the most credible source of jobs data? We looked at the data reported in December 2012, the latest quarterly data that can be directly compared to the numbers from December 2010, the baseline month just before the start of Walker’s term in January 2011. In the two-year period, Wisconsin’s growth rate of 2.8 percent trailed Illinois (2.98), Minnesota (4.3), Iowa (3.4) and Michigan (5.99). Wisconsin was not last at every measuring point along the way, but the bottom line growth rate trailed the pack. Geography question Burke’s claim, though, raises the question of how to define the ""Midwest."" She said ""Midwest,"" but cited contiguous states as evidence. The Journal Sentinel typically adds Indiana and Ohio into the mix in jobs stories. The federal agency that reports the jobs data uses an even broader definition preferred by the U.S. Census Bureau. It adds Ohio, Indiana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas to the Midwest, with the states that touch Wisconsin. In this broader region, Wisconsin no longer brings up the rear. The quarterly data shows Kansas and Missouri with slower growth than Wisconsin over two years. And the less-reliable but more up-to-date monthly surveys put Ohio, Nebraska and Missouri behind Wisconsin. Wisconsin fared somewhat better compared with its Midwest rivals early in Walker’s tenure, but by late summer 2011 was lagging behind its adjoining states. Manufacturing hiring growth slowed to nothing in the one-year period ending June 2013. We came across a couple of interesting side notes from the monthly data. Among Wisconsin’s contiguous neighbors, Minnesota and Iowa have rebounded to the best employment level they had in 2008, the year the Great Recession gained steam nationally. Minnesota, in fact, is actually a bit above that level; Iowa is right at it. Wisconsin is still 1.6 percent off its 2008 high, while Illinois and Michigan are more than 2.5 percent shy of it. We should note that PolitiFact Wisconsin uses a hybrid of quarterly jobs figures from 2011 and 2012 plus monthly jobs numbers from 2013 to provide a rough up-to-date gauge of progress toward Walker’s 250,000 goal. State Workforce Development officials point out that when applying that counting method to other states’ job-growth, Illinois and Ohio come in with lower growth than Wisconsin since Walker’s term began. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that the monthly and quarterly numbers are separate survey tools and are not designed to be used in combination to compare states. Our rating Burke claimed that under Walker, private job growth is lowest in the Midwest. The claim is accurate for adjoining states, based on either the monthly or quarterly jobs data. But viewed another way, three states in the Census Bureau-defined ""Midwest""  -- Ohio, Nebraska and Missouri -- show slower private job-growth rates than Wisconsin. We rate her claim Half True.","[('WITI web story version of TV report on Mary Burke, Jan. 20, 2014', 'http://fox6now.com/2014/01/20/gov-walker-vs-mary-burke-on-wisconsins-income-tax/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Midwest Scorecard,"" Dec. 18, 2013', 'No link'), ('Capital Times, ""Interactive Data: Job Growth under Scott Walker,"" accessed Jan. 23, 2014', 'http://www.jsonline.com/business/quarterly-jobs-data-for-wisconsin-nation-set-to-be-released-b99165965z1-236368171.html'), ('US Bureau of Labor Statistics, State and Metro Area Employment Hours and Earnings, accessed Jan. 27, 2014', 'No link'), ('US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Jan. 27, 2014', 'http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/interactive-data-job-growth-under-scott-walker/html_91c1d53c-86a3-11e2-8ee8-0019bb2963f4.html'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Employment debate requires closer look,"" May 26, 2012', 'No link'), ('Interview with Richard Jones, communications officer, Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, Jan. 24, 2014', 'http://www.bls.gov/sae/'), ('Email interview with Joe Zepecki, spokesperson, Mary Burke campaign, Jan. 22, 2014', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2014/feb/02/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-trails-every-other-midwe/

Corey Stewart wrongly says Trump made U.S. top oil and gas producer
","Thanks to President Donald Trump, Corey Stewart says, the United States is leading the world in oil and gas production. Stewart, Virginia’s Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, made that claim twice during a July 21 debate with Democrat incumbent Tim Kaine. Stewart — a Trump loyalist — was portraying Kaine as a constant opponent of the president programs, including energy policy. ""Because of President Trump, the United States is - now get this - the largest combined supplier of oil and gas resources on the planet,"" Stewart said. Stewart repeated the claim three minutes later. ""It is only because of President Trump that we have become the largest producer of gas and oil resources,"" he said. We investigated Stewart’s statements. The U.S. is the world’s largest combined producer of gas and oil. The question is whether that happened during Trump’s presidency, which began Jan. 20, 2017. The answer is no. Stewart’s campaign didn’t respond to three requests for proof of Stewart’s claim. So we turned to research from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which compiles data of global energy production and consumption. Figures and charts in an EIA report this spring show that the U.S. overtook Russia as the world’s largest gas and oil producer in 2011 - when Barack Obama was president. The U.S. produced 43.92 quadrillion British thermal units of gas and oil a day that year (roughly equivalent to 22 million barrels), compared to Russia’s daily rate of 43.85 quadrillion Btu. Saudi Arabia was a distant third, producing 26.5 quadrillion Btu daily. Since then, the U.S. has steadily expanded its lead. In 2017 - the first year of Trump’s presidency - the U.S. produced 59.4 quadrillion Btu of oil and gas daily, compared to Russia’s rate of 46.4 quadrillion Btu a day. Saudi Arabia again ranked third, at 28.7 quadrillion Btu. The EIA and other energy experts attribute the growth in U.S. production to a surge in extracting oil and gas from shale by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process involves using water pressure to fracture rocks and release their natural gas and oil. The U.S. is the world leader in shale gas production. Shale production has made the U.S. the ""undisputed global oil and gas leader,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, which advises 30 nations, told a U.S. Senate committee in January 2018. He said the U.S. should keep that that status for years to come. The U.S. overtook Russia in 2009 to become the world’s largest gas producer. It passed Saudi Arabia in 2013 to become the leading oil producer. Stewart said, ""It is only under  President Trump that we have become the largest producer of oil and gas resources."" His campaign didn’t respond to three requests for proof. EIA data shows that U.S. has been the world leader in gas production since 2009, oil production since 2013, and combined gas and oil production since 2011. All of this happened well before Trump came to White House. We rate Stewart’s statement False.

Did Brett Kavanaugh call birth control abortion-inducing drugs? No
","Democrats rallied around Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s reference to popular contraceptive methods as ""abortion-inducing"" during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., tweeted an 11-second clip in which Kavanaugh said, ""Filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objected to."" ""Kavanaugh chooses his words very carefully, and this is a dog whistle for going after birth control,"" Harris tweeted. ""He was nominated for the purpose of taking away a woman’s constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions. Make no mistake — this is about punishing women."" Several other Democrats tweeted similar statements. Kavanaugh chooses his words very carefully, and this is a dog whistle for going after birth control. He was nominated for the purpose of taking away a woman’s constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions. Make no mistake - this is about punishing women. pic.twitter.com/zkBjXzIvQI In Harris’ tweet, Kavanaugh appears to believe birth control is an abortion-inducing drug. Does he? We’re not sure what he believes. He hasn't said so in the confirmation hearings. Harris’ tweet takes Kavanaugh’s statement out of context. Harris cut an important second out of the clip — the attribution. Kavanaugh said, ""They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objecting to."" ""They"" refers to a Catholic nonprofit group, Priests for Life. Kavanaugh was answering a question from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about a case in which he argued Priests for Life shouldn’t have to provide women with the contraceptive coverage mandated by the Affordable Care Act for religious reasons. A later reply to that tweet included a two-minute clip with the full question and answer. Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said Kavanaugh was using the limited time available to summarize the arguments made by the plaintiff. ""It’s very clear he’s characterizing their position, which was held by all the Catholic organizations within that set of cases,"" Kupec said. ""But even within characterizing their position, if you look at the dissent, it’s still not a blanket description of birth control."" In the dissent, Kavanaugh writes, ""They complain that submitting the required form contravenes their religious beliefs because doing so, in their view, makes them complicit in providing coverage for contraceptives, including some that they believe operate as abortifacients."" The question is significant to abortion rights activists because most common types of contraception don’t prevent implantation but fertilization. According to the medical community, pregnancy begins after a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus. If a Supreme Court justice believes pregnancy begins at fertilization it could jeopardize the legality of birth control methods for women. Harris’ office pointed out that at no point in his answer did Kavanaugh disagree with this definition of contraception, note it was medically inaccurate, or acknowledge it was politically charged. ""In his full answer, he uses the term uncritically,"" said Lily Adams, communications director for Harris. ""He doesn’t say ‘so-called,’ ‘I don’t agree with it,’ there’s no caveat that he gives that he does not agree with the term."" Adams added that Kavanaugh was not exactly quoting the dissent, as the phrase used in the case was abortion-inducing products, not drugs. Kavanaugh has not defined what he believes constitutes ""abortion-inducing drugs."" But the White House insisted that in that statement, ""He did not express a personal view."" White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said it was not the judge’s job to be critical of the term, quoting another segment of the dissent. ""The Supreme Court has emphasized that judges in Religious Freedom Restoration Act cases may question only the sincerity of a plaintiff’s religious belief, not the correctness or reasonableness of that religious belief,"" Kavanaugh wrote, citing Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby and Thomas vs. Review Board. In the follow-up to his answer, Kavanaugh says the government did, in fact, have a compelling reason to ensure birth control access to the employees. But he determined the government could provide it without doing so on the backs of the religious objector. Harris tweeted a clip in which Kavanaugh said, ""Filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were -- as a religious matter, objected to."" In Harris’ tweet, Kavanaugh appears to define contraception as abortion-inducing. But the video failed to include a crucial qualifier: ""They said."" In fact, he was citing the definition of the religious group Priests for Life. He has not expressed his personal view. We rate this statement False.","[('Twitter, Sen.

Miami Dolphins hasn’t fired national anthem kneelers
","The Miami Dolphins team doesn’t have players named Horace Black or Manfred Brown on its roster. And the team didn’t fire these nonexistent athletes for kneeling during the national anthem like a fictitious story on social media claims. The article was published on us24.online with the headline ""BREAKING: Miami Dolphins fire 2 kneeling players before pre-season kickoff."" The text was copied from one of America’s Last Line of Defense websites, which are among the biggest sources of false news online. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its newsfeed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) America’s Last Line of Defense self-identifies as a satire site. The original article’s first link goes to a photo with text that says, ""This is not real.""

As the NFL season kicks off, false news stories are circulating on social media related to the ongoing controversy of players protesting during the playing of the national anthem. We’ve recently fact-checked two other stories that originated on America’s Last Line of Defense websites. We rated both Pants on Fire. In 2016, Colin Kaepernick, then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, started kneeling during the national anthem before games to protest the treatment of people of color in the United States.

""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in 2016. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" The Miami Dolphins considered penalizing or firing players who kneeled during the anthem this summer.  Shortly after the Associated Press reported on the potential penalties, the NFL and the NFL Players Association announced they would not be issuing or enforcing new rules related to the anthem. The NFL is not expected to implement a new national anthem policy this season. While several Miami Dolphins have knelt during preseason games this year, none of them share the names of the players in the article, and no one was fired or penalized. Miami Dolphins wide receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson knelt during the national anthem during the Sept. 9 season opener against the Tennessee Titans, eight days after the article's claim was made.

Joe Radinovich is no stranger to traffic court
","Do the crime (or petty misdemeanor), pay the fine. That’s an adage of justice. What to make, then, of a congressional candidate who’s cited more than 30 times with driving and parking violations but fails to pay in eight of those cases until the courts sic a collections agency on him? Minnesota’s Joe Radinovich says it was all an oversight, and a number of his tickets were a result of parking overtime in a meter zone -- not exactly high crimes -- although he’s also had a few speeding citations over the years. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to elect Republicans, says the behavior of Radinovich, a Democrat running for the open seat in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District, shows he is a ""typical politician,"" one who will raise your taxes yet ""refuses to pay his own bills."" We went to the records. They show Radinovich, a former state representative now vying to represent the Iron Range district in the nation’s capital, has been something of a ticket scofflaw until recently. He had his driver’s license revoked for a time. And he only paid the state's collections agency for the last four of his outstanding fines recently, at $75 each, months after he was originally ticketed and right when those tickets and fines became fodder in the 2018 congressional race. The claim against Radinovich arose when the Congressional Leadership Fund, a PAC allied with U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, put out a TV ad and news release on Aug. 17. An announcer in the ad says, ""Joe Radinovich votes to raise our taxes, but refuses to pay his own bills. Radinovich voted for a $2 billion tax hike, hurting working families. But Radinovich was cited 30 times for not paying court fines. ""And after refusing to pay his bills, Radinovich was turned over to a collection agency eight times."" The tax part of the claim refers to Radinovichs vote in the Minnesota Legislature for an ""Omnibus Tax Bill"" in 2013, according to KSTP-TV in Minnesota. The bill raised income taxes on Minnesota's highest earners by $1.1 billion dollars but also raised cigarette and other tobacco taxes by $430 million, the TV station said. The bill closed $400 million worth of corporate tax loopholes and increased taxes on some estates by $80 million, the station said. As for the tickets, the Congressional Leadership Fund accessed Minnesota court records, which are available online. Those records show the date a citation is issued, the alleged offenses, the plea and disposition of the charges and the collection of a fine if one is issued. The Congressional Leadership Fund’s ad led KSTP to do a ""Truth Test"" on the claim. That Truth Test -- in which the station gave the Congressional Leadership Fund’s claim an A minus -- in turn led Radinovich’s Republican opponent in the congressional race, Pete Stauber, to issue his own statement on Aug. 23. Stauber said that Radinovich ""won't even pay his own bills and take responsibility for his own actions."" Radinovich responded quickly to the Minnesota media. ""I reject that they're a character issue,"" the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party member said of the tickets and fines, according to an Aug. 23 story in the Duluth News Tribune. He called the issue ""a headache,"" the newspaper reported, and said he would be more careful about it going forward. He also said he uses a post office box and does not get mail at his physical address in Ironton, Minn., which sometimes led to a delay in his receiving notices. ""The vast majority of violations occurred in Hennepin County in the last several years, when Radinovich worked as an aide to onetime city councilor and current Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey,"" the News Tribune reported. ""It was tough to avoid parking tickets sometimes,"" Radinovich said in the story. He said construction and a lack of other parking options forced him to use streetside meters, which would expire while he became preoccupied with the business of the day. PolitiFact accessed the Minnesota state court system’s online records. The records showed 32 cases against Radinovich dating to 2004, when he was 18, most of them minor and all leading to convictions or findings of guilt. They included two cases in 2018, 12 in 2017 and one in 2016. Where the level of offense was listed, all were labeled as misdemeanors. Other details: Sixteen of the 32 cases involved parking meter violations. Four involved speeding, the most recent in July 2017 when records show Radinovich was accused of driving 69 mph in a 55 zone. A 2006 case showed a conviction for driving on a revoked license. The circumstances of the revocation were not detailed in the online record. In 2009, Radinovich was charged with speeding, accused of going 81 in a 65 mph zone. The records say the court requested a driver’s license suspension that October for failure to appear in court, and requested reinstatement of the license the following March when payment was made. Eight of the cases wound up going to a collection agency after Radovich was late paying his fines, records show. That does not mean private bill collectors were on Radinovich’s tail, however, because the state courts switched in 2010 from using private collectors to using the Minnesota Department of Revenue, Kyle Christopherson, a communications specialist with the Minnesota Judicial Branch told PolitiFact. Every one of Radinovich’s collection matters therefore would have been handled by the revenue department. Of the underlying offenses in those collection matters, six were for parking overtime in a meter zone. One was for obstructing traffic with a vehicle. One was for a violation that was unspecified in the online docket but was related to a vehicle registration, permit or license plates. Radovich pleaded or was adjudicated guilty in each case case against him, whether it went to collections or not, the records show. Petty stuff? That’s what Radinovich suggested. The Duluth News Tribune quoted him as saying, ""I take full responsibility for this. It's a series of petty misdemeanors and that's the extent of it."" When contacted by PolitiFact, Radinovich's congressional campaign did not dispute the tickets and late payments. Campaign spokesman Bennett Smith said the earliest driving offenses are from when Radinovich, now 32, was a young man. Radinovich's mother was shot and killed in a family murder-suicide in 2004, according to Minnesota media reports. ""Like many people in their late teens and early 20s, Joe has done a lot of growing up,"" Smith said. ""He's matured and is a different person."" As for the numerous parking offenses, Smith said the Republican-supporting PAC is ""oversensationalizing his ability to find convenient parking when he was working for the mayor."" The Congressional Leadership Fund said Radinovich was cited 30 times for not paying court fines. Radinovich unquestionably did not pay a number of his traffic and parking fines when due. The 32-year-old was charged in 32 separate traffic or parking cases since he was 18. But a single case can involve one or more legal citations, and this is where the Congressional Leadership Fund’s characterization can get a bit tricky. The PAC said Radinovch was ""cited 30 times for not paying court fines,"" but a ""citation"" can mean, in the legal sense, a ticket or a charge. Or it can mean a notation in the record. It is unquestionable that the Minnesota court records note Radinvich’s repeated failure to pay fines when due. That did not mean Radinovich faced 30 new misdemeanor charges strictly for failure to pay; rather, the PAC told PolitiFact that it used the word ""cited"" as a reference to court notations of Radinovich’s failure to pay on time, and these notations were not just in the cases sent for collection. With that caveat, we rate the Congressional Leadership Fund’s claim Mostly True.","[('Congressional Leadership Fund news release and ad, Aug. 17, 2017', 'https://congressionalleadershipfund.org/new-ad-in-mn-08-joe-radinovich-is-another-hypocritical-tax-raising-politician/'), ('Email and telephone conversations with Michael Byerly, Congressional Leadership Fund, Sept. 6, 2018', 'No link'), ('Minnesota Judicial Branch online case dockets, accessed Sept. 6, 2018', 'http://www.mncourts.gov/Access-Case-Records.aspx'), ('Press release from Pete Stauber congressional campaign, Aug. 23, 2018', 'No link'), ('""Radinovich addresses history of tickets, fines,"" Duluth News Tribune, Aug. 23, 2018', 'https://petestauberforcongress.com/press-release-joe-radinovich-owes-explanation-for-his-reckless-regard-for-the-law/'), ('""TRUTH TEST: Ad Targets Radinovich\'s Court Record, Unpaid Fines,"" KSTP-TV, Aug. 22, 2018', 'No link'), ('Telephone conversation with Kyle Christopherson, Minnesota Judicial Branch, Sept. 7, 2018', 'http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4489812-radinovich-addresses-history-tickets-fines')]",/factchecks/2018/sep/10/congressional-leadership-fund/joe-radinovich-no-stranger-traffic-court/

Did Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema protest troops in a pink tutu and denigrated their service?
","Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally in a campaign ad paints herself as a stark contrast with Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, her Democratic opponent in the race for Arizona’s open seat in the U.S. Senate. Side-by-side pictures show McSally in military uniform and Sinema in a pink tutu. The ad highlights McSally’s service as a U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and portrays Sinema as unpatriotic and out-of-touch with global threats. McSally’s Aug. 23 campaign ad said: ""Everyone remembers where they were on 9/11. I was deployed to the Middle East. Led airstrikes against the Taliban and was the first woman to fly a fighter jet in combat. I know the price of freedom. ""While we were in harm’s way in uniform, Kyrsten Sinema was protesting us in a pink tutu and denigrating our service. The world is a dangerous place. We need strong leaders who understand the threat and respect our troops. Kyrsten Sinema fails the test."" PolitiFact wondered about McSally’s claim that Sinema protested troops in a pink tutu, ""denigrating our service."" McSally retired from the Air Force in 2010 after 26 years of military service that included six deployments to the Middle East and Afghanistan. Sinema was a law student at the time who participated in a series of vigils and anti-war protests in Arizona. In at least one of those instances, she wore what looks like a pink tutu. The 2003 event coincided with Women’s International Day, included live music and dancing, and other attendees also wore pink outfits. Sinema described the event as ""an expression of creativity and of self.""  Sinema’s pink tutu photo has been used against her in previous races for public office, and it’s a real photo. But we didn’t find evidence that Sinema denigrated the service of military members, as McSally’s ad claimed. Screenshot from McSally for Senate campaign ad. Sinema was a law student at Arizona State University when she was quoted in student newspaper articles as an organizer of protests against the Iraq, which former President George W. Bush ordered March 19, 2003. Six days earlier, an article detailed Sinema’s participation in a Phoenix rally called ""No War! A Celebration of Life and Creativity"" that coincided with International Women's Day. ""Flurries of pink — the color of International Women's Day — highlight the shirts and skirts and socks of demonstrators,"" the article said. The article said Sinema wore ""a neon-pink shirt and something resembling a pink tutu."" Sinema told the newspaper, ""You protest when you feel like you're not being heard. To make yourself heard, you have to do something out of the ordinary. There, inherently, is this expression of creativity that comes with protests, so you can say, 'I am important. I am a human.'"" The articles don’t quote Sinema as saying anything specifically against the troops. Her comments center on Bush’s policy. ""Since Bush has taken office, he has rolled back civil liberties and provoked war against Iraq. We couldn't not protest,"" Sinema said in a September 2002 student newspaper article. The Arizona Republic published a story in February 2002 about silent vigils in Phoenix against war and the abuse of women worldwide. Sinema is quoted as saying that the vigils will continue ""til there's no more war."" The story also quotes an ASU professor as saying that the vigils seek to raise awareness about the victims of war, which included the poor, women and ""yes, soldiers."" The Arizona Republic included the voice an 18-year-old who was planning to enlist in the Marine Corps. ""Everybody has their own opinion,"" Steve Sullivan told the newspaper. ""I'm not offended at all. It's great they come out and protest."" Sinema told the Associated Press for a story on anti-war protesters that a lot of people were worried about the future and felt isolated. ""We just want people who are sad, upset, devastated or confused about the war to have a place to meet and be comforted by other people who feel the same way,"" Sinema said in March 2003. Sinema’s campaign today says she also supported U.S. troops. ""Kyrsten has always supported our service members,"" Helen Hare, a spokeswoman for Sinema’s campaign told PolitiFact. ""Reporting from the time confirms that while she spoke out against the war, she also voiced her respect for those who serve — like the members of her family."" The photo in question is from a 2003 protest, it did not happen on 9/11, contrary to what the ad may imply, her campaign said. Sinema’s campaign also pointed to an Arizona Republic March 2003 article about vigils in opposition to the Iraq war. Sinema told the newspaper that they wanted ""to respect and honor those who would be killed. We want those lives to not be sacrificed."" Sinema’s campaign said that her older brother enlisted in the Marines in 1991 and left active duty in 1999; and her younger brother enlisted in the Navy in 2005 and is still on active duty. Sinema has also voted in favor of bills authorizing funding for the military and pay raises for troops, and co-sponsored bills to help veterans receive benefits, her campaign said. Sinema was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2012. As she campaigned for that seat, she told The Hill in a May 2012 article that while her views had evolved, her approach to dealing with global conflicts had not. ""She said she favors aggressive diplomacy, crippling sanctions to combat proliferation, and swift, multilateral intervention as a last resort,"" the Hill reported. The Hill story said that in April 2006, Sinema in an online social justice group wrote: ""I have always and will always continue to oppose war in all its forms."" But in her interview with The Hill, she said: ""You should never take military intervention off the table. When you do so, you give an out to a rogue nation or rogue actors."" For instance, Sinema called for military intervention in places such as Sudan, citing genocide, and wished U.S. troops had intervened earlier in Rwanda and in World War II, The Hill reported. In September 2015, Sinema was among 25 House Democrats who voted against a resolution to approve the Iran nuclear deal. Former President Barack Obama about a month earlier had said that rejection of the deal ""leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option — another war in the Middle East."" Sinema told The Huffington Post after the September vote that it was ""hyperbole"" and ""not necessarily true"" that being against the deal meant choosing war. ""I’m frustrated by these false dichotomies,"" she said.  McSally in a campaign ad said, ""While we were in harm’s way in uniform, Kyrsten Sinema was protesting us in a pink tutu and denigrating our service."" McSally retired from the Air Force in 2010 after 26 years of military service. After 9/11, Sinema led protests against the war in Iraq. At a 2003 rally called ""No War! A Celebration of Life and Creativity,"" Sinema wore a pink tutu. Media reports of the rallies in 2002 and 2003 quote Sinema as opposing the war and the Bush administration’s policy, but we found no evidence of her disparaging troops. McSally’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.   --- Editor’s note, Sept. 18, 2018: The Senate Leadership Fund and Defend Arizona contacted us after publication to point out that CNN published a story on Sept. 15 saying that a group led by Sinema in the early 2000s distributed anti-war flyers, including one that depicted a soldier as a skeleton. Text in that flyer said, ""You can help us push back U.S. terror in Iraq and the Middle East."" The Senate Leadership Fund said this was evidence showing the accuracy of McSally’s claim. Sinema’s campaign told CNN, however, that Sinema did not approve or design the flyers. The flyers were not used in McSally's ad claiming that Sinema denigrated troops. McSally's campaign did not send PolitiFact the flyers — or any other material — as evidence for the claim. McSally's ad focused on Sinema wearing a tutu. Contemporaneous reporting of the event in which Sinema wore a tutu did not say that Sinema denigrated troops. Given that the flyer is not evidence that Sinema denigrated troops herself, our rating remains the same.","[('Twitter, @MarthaMcSally tweet, Aug. 23, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/MarthaMcSally/status/1032713389640826880'), ('Email interview, Helen Hare, campaign spokeswoman for Kyrsten Sinema, Sept. 5-6, 2018', 'No link'), ('Arizonadailyindependent.com, Rogers Questions Sinema’s Foreign Policy Core, Oct. 7, 2014', 'https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2014/10/07/rogers-hits-sinema-hard-in-first-ad/'), ('The Hill, Candidate’s stance on Afghan, Iraq wars faces scrutiny in Dem primary, May 2, 2012', 'No link'), (""State Press, Crow has eye on war demonstrations, March 26, 2003; Phoenix participates in worldwide anti-war protests, An exhibition of protest, March 13, 2003; Feb. 17, 2003; Bush's Phoenix visit incites protest, Sept. 30, 2002; Bush visit attracts protesters, Sept. 27, 2002"", 'http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/224919-candidates-stance-on-afghan-iraq-wars-faces-scrutiny-in-dem-primary'), ('New York Times, Bush Declares Start of Iraq War; Missile Said to Be Aimed at Hussein, March 20, 2003', 'No link'), ('George W.

"['Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Rauner falsely claims graduated income taxes always hurt the middle class
","A recurring theme of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner’s re-election campaign is to paint Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker as a big taxer. To that end, Rauner has seized on Pritzker’s advocacy for replacing Illinois’ current flat-rate income tax with a graduated system used by most states and the federal government that imposes higher rates on those with higher income. Pritzker, however, has been vague about what sort of rates he would like to set, and that has given Rauner a big opening to try to fill in the blanks. During a recent radio interview with the Bloomington-Normal based WJBC-AM, Rauner claimed Pritzker was being cagey because middle class voters were bound to get hammered by any switch. ""The truth is, every state that has put in a graduated income tax, the middle class always pays more,"" Rauner said, echoing what’s become a frequent talking point. ""That’s what Pritzker doesn’t want known, that’s the truth and we’ve got to get the truth out."" Last fall, we rated Mostly False a claim from Rauner that the graduated system Pritzker supports would necessarily result in a tax hike on Illinois’ middle class. Because Pritzker has so far refused to propose rates, no one can say for sure whether the plan he might ultimately unveil would be worse or better for middle-income taxpayers. But Rauner’s recent claim paints the issue with an even broader brush, flatly declaring it ""the truth"" that all 32 states that tax income at graduated rates penalize the middle class. That’s a tall order, so we decided to see if we could find ""the truth"" about Rauner’s ""truth."" In Illinois, the rich as well as the not-so-rich all pay the same 4.95 percent tax rate on their income. We asked Rauner spokesman Justin Giorgio to explain how middle-class taxpayers are worse off in all states with graduated taxes, and he sent us a list of 26 states in which a single filer making $59,000 would be taxed at a higher rate than the one currently in effect in Illinois. There are glaring problems with that response. Giorgio’s list omits six states with graduated taxes where such a taxpayer would pay less even though Rauner was adamant that his claim applied to all such states. Then there’s the question of that $59,000 benchmark, which is what the U.S. Census pegged as the median household income in the nation for 2016, the latest year for which such data is available. The household number is typically an aggregate of the incomes of two or more wage earners living under the same roof — not individuals. In 2016, the Census measured the median income for the category of people that most closely approximates single filers at slightly more than $35,700. Loading... Setting aside the Rauner camp’s sloppy metrics — not to mention the lack of any consensus definition for the middle class — we looked up the tax impact in each of those 32 graduated tax states when applied to that hypothetical single filer making the national median $35,700. Under that scenario, the number of states that would tax her income at lower rates than in Illinois grows from six to 11. In several of those graduated tax states, the rate advantage over Illinois would be substantial. In North Dakota, for instance, her income would be taxed at just over 1 percent. Comparing tax policies between the states is fraught with complications because no two do it alike. But the Rauner camp doesn’t just compare apples to oranges. More like apples to an entire fruit basket. Rates alone don’t necessarily tell us who pays more. Many graduated tax states do indeed impose rates for most income brackets above Illinois’ single rate. But that doesn’t always mean an individual’s tax burden will be higher there. At a different campaign event on the same day as his radio appearance, Rauner pointed to four graduated tax states with what he described as ""stunningly high"" rates: Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. What he failed to point out, however, is that several of those states also offer a generous menu of exemptions and deductions that significantly mitigate costs for middle- and low-income taxpayers. Individual taxpayers in Connecticut earning over $10,000, for instance, are faced with nominal tax rates higher than Illinois’ flat one. But a single filer in Connecticut also receives a personal exemption worth seven times more than that offered in Illinois. And in New York, rates higher than Illinois’ set in on every dollar earned by an individual above $11,700. But the standard deduction is worth four times the $2,175 personal exemption in Illinois, which does not have a standard deduction. It’s important to note that a multi-rate structure doesn’t necessarily guarantee a state’s income tax will be exceptionally progressive. Missouri, for example, has a ten-tiered rate structure but the highest rate kicks in after just $9,072 in income. That said, Missouri taxpayers also benefit from a standard deduction even more generous than that in New York. And because graduated systems impose tax rates in escalating steps on different portions of income, people in those states aren’t paying top rates on every dollar they earn. In Iowa, for instance, that means taxpayers still get to pay lower rates than they would in Illinois on their first $14,382 of income, regardless of how much they earn beyond that. Graduated rates, by their very nature, are designed so lower-income earners pay less on a greater share of their income. ""It doesn’t take a tax policy analyst to say that you could create an income tax with rates both below and above [4.95 percent] at different levels of income and that the majority of middle-income taxpayers would pay less as a result of that,"" said Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. ""To argue that going to a progressive income tax is bad for low- and middle-income families is kind of missing the point of why you would have a progressive rate structure in the first place,"" he added. Rauner said that in ""every state that has put in a graduated income tax, the middle class always pays more."" But 11 of the 32 states that tax income at graduated rates would tax an individual earning the national median at lower rates than Illinois. In some of those states, the rate would be significantly lower. What’s more, tax rates tell only part of the story. Many states, including some with much higher rates, also offer taxpayers generous exemptions and deductions, significantly reducing their actual tax burden. Rauner’s claim that graduated systems inevitably lead to higher taxes on the middle class is not even close to accurate. We rate it False.","[('""Governor Rauner recounts his record on jobs, budget battles in first term,"" WCIA, Aug. 19, 2018', 'https://www.wcia.com/capitol-connection/watch-governor-rauner-recounts-his-record-on-jobs-budget-battles-in-first-term/1381982140'), ('""Illinois governor’s race: Candidates push ag growth,"" AgriNews Publications, Aug. 31, 2018', 'No link'), ('""Rauner distorts Dems\' message on Illinois income tax,"" PolitiFact Illinois, Dec. 14, 2017', 'http://www.agrinews-pubs.com/news/illinois-governor-s-race-candidates-push-ag-growth/article_0acd36c5-bfcc-54af-85fb-1b4c3dd94e94.html'), ('Report: State Individual Income Tax Rates and Brackets for 2018, Tax Foundation, March 5, 2018', 'No link'), ('Report: Kentucky Passes Tax Package, Tax Foundation, April 16, 2018', 'https://www.politifact.com/illinois/statements/2017/dec/14/bruce-rauner/rauner-distorts-dems-message-illinois-income-tax/'), ('Email interview: Justin Giorgio, Rauner campaign spokesman, Sept. 4, 2018', 'No link'), ('Glossary definitions, U.S. Census, accessed Sept. 6, 2018', 'https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-brackets-2018/'), ('Data: Income and Poverty, U.S. Census, Sept. 2017', 'No link'), ('Phone interview: Richard Auxier, research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, Sept. 4, 2018', 'https://taxfoundation.org/kentucky-tax-reform-package/'), ('Email interview: Verenda Smith, deputy director of the Federation of Tax Administrators, Sept. 4, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email interview: Ron Alt, research economist with the Federation of Tax Administrators, Sept. 4, 2018', 'https://www.census.gov/glossary/#term_Householdincome')]",/factchecks/2018/sep/09/bruce-rauner/rauner-falsely-claims-graduated-income-taxes-alway/
"['Food', 'Missouri', 'Vicky Hartzler']","
Hartzler wrong in attack on healthy school lunches
","It’s no secret that Americans throw out literal tons of food each year, but has an Obama-era federal school lunch policy made it worse? Fourth District U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., seems to think so, and it motivated her to co-sponsor a new bill aimed at curbing some nutritional regulations that require schools to serve more healthy foods. In an Aug. 14 tweet, Hartzler announced the introduction of the Local Control of School Lunch Act (HR 6541) and promised her followers: ""This bill would provide students & school lunch workers relief from rigid federal school lunch requirements that cause large amounts of food waste & diminished use of school lunches!"" We’ve looked at other policymakers’ claims about the value of regulating nutritional standards. What caught our attention with Hartzler’s tweet was her assertion that kids are throwing more food away under these regulations. We wondered if that was really true. A quick note to Hartzler’s office confirmed that her bill is a reaction to Congress passing the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Acts of 2010, a policy initiative supported by then-first lady Michelle Obama, who championed the cause of reducing childhood obesity. It mandates that schools must serve more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and limits calorie and sodium intake, among other things. Since the law went into effect during the 2012-13 school year, critics such as Hartzler have argued that it amplifies food waste because kids don’t find the new menu options appetizing. Citing those and other reasons, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in 2017 relaxed some of the original rules. When we asked for the proof supporting her claim, Hartzler’s office sent us a link to a 2014 study commissioned by the Department of Agriculture. Her office specifically cited a chart in the report which states that the waste of both raw and cooked vegetables in school cafeterias saw an increase of more than 60 percent. But then we noticed a footnote underneath the chart Hartzler’s office used to defend the food waste statement: ""Plate waste estimates were based on observations and not actually measured or calculated during SY 2013–14."" 2M Research Services, LLC, the group that wrote the report, did not respond to repeated calls and emails from PolitiFact. So we reached out to five independent food policy experts. The three who responded had similar reactions: Accurately measuring food waste is more complicated than the general public might understand. ""There are several ways to measure food waste using validated tools that yield quantifiable data,"" said Carmen Byker Shanks, an associate professor of food, nutrition and sustainable food systems at Montana State University. She said observation — the method used in the study cited by Hartzler — is an important first step, but that it’s ""subject to many biases."" In 2017, Byker Shanks led a study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, which found that since the 1970s, around 30 percent of school lunches have consistently landed in the trash. ""Kids just don’t eat all of their food,"" said Marlene Schwartz, director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut and professor of human development and family studies, in an email. Schwartz said waste should be calculated based on the proportion of food that is eaten, not the total amount thrown away. She used that framework to co-write a 2015 study that concluded overall plate waste has decreased under the new guidelines. There were more fruits and vegetables served since the 2010 regulations, Schwartz said, because it was a requirement with every meal. ""But the proportion of fruit eaten before (in our study) was on average 70 percent and the proportion thrown out was on average 30 percent, and afterwards, the proportions stayed the same: 70 percent eaten and 30 percent thrown out,"" Schwartz said. In fact, a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, which measured the physical weight of wasted lunches, said that after the implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, entree and vegetable consumption increased by 15.6 and 16.2 percent, respectively. As for Hartzler’s other claim that student participation in school lunch programs has diminished under the push for healthier food, Schwartz said there is no evidence to support that. In fact, the same report Hartzler pointed to as evidence for increased plate waste, said that while some school administrators observed challenges during the first year, there has been no substantial change in school lunch program participation between 2011 and 2014. Moreover, a 2015 study by the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit geared toward reducing hunger, reported no noticeable change in participation trends over the past five years, compared to before the legislation was implemented. Participation continues to rise among low-income children and it continues to decline among children not eligible for free or reduced-price meals, the report said. In announcing a bill that would roll back Obama-era legislation making school lunch regulations healthier, Hartzler tweeted federal school lunch requirements ""cause large amounts of food waste & diminished use of school lunches!"" Experts say the observation-based evidence she uses to back up the claim is faulty and that the proportion of healthy foods thrown out is about the same, even though the total amount of fruits and vegetables wasted has gone up because they are required on every child’s plate. They also say that no substantial drop off in school lunch program participation has occurred since the law went into effect. For those reasons, we rate this claim as Mostly False.","[('Byker Shanks, Carmen, Jinan Banna, Elena L.Serrano.\xa0""Food Waste in the National School Lunch Program 1978-2015: A Systematic Review.""Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

"['Education', 'North Carolina', 'Michael Lee']","
NC senator claims teacher pay increased under Republican leadership
","Teacher pay is always a popular topic around election time. Republicans and Democrats either want credit for any progress being made, or want to blame the other side for any lack of progress. Sen. Michael Lee, a Republican from Wilmington, is gearing up for re-election against Harper Peterson, a former Wilmington mayor. He tweeted on Aug. 28 that ""teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher’s unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017."" Did teacher pay increase over the past five years? Here’s the average teacher salary from the past five years: 2013-14: $44,990 2014-15: $47,819 2015-16: $47,985 2016-17: $49,837 2017-18: $50,861 Those teacher salaries also include supplements, but those are provided by the local district and not the General Assembly. The numbers do not take into consideration any rise in health care premiums, cost-of-living or other expenses. The average rate of inflation over the course of these years was 2.3 percent, based on information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At first glance, it does appear that teachers got a pay raise every year. However, the salary schedules from the North Carolina Department of Instruction tell a slightly different story. Teachers with 35 years of experience were being paid $52,150 in the 2013-14 school year. In the 2014-15 school year, the base salary for teachers with 25 years of experience or more dropped to $50,000. The 2016 ""Held Harmless"" statute made sure no teacher would make less in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. So, those teachers did not receive a pay cut in the following years. The average pay did increase every year after the 2013-14 school year. In the 2017-18 academic year, teachers with 35 years of experience were paid $51,300. Basically, teachers who reach 35 years of experience today because they are now included in the overall ""25-year-plus"" category. (Clarification: An earlier version of this story said teachers received pay cuts following the 2013-14 academic year. However, we neglected to factor in the ""Held Harmless"" statute that prevents teacher pay cuts.) It’s the same story for teachers with 36 years of experience. They were paid $53,180 in the 2013-14 academic year, but teachers who reach 36 years of experience would’ve been paid $50,000 in the 2014-15 academic year. In the 2017-18 academic year, these teachers were paid $51,300 as well. The same ""Held Harmless"" statute has been included in the 2018-19 budgets so no teacher gets a pay cut. In addition, teachers with up to four years were the only ones to get a base salary increase in the 2015-16 academic year. They were paid $33,000 in 2014-15, and then paid $35,000 in 2015-16. In the following years, first-year teachers did not see an increase to their base salary. It stayed at $35,000. How fast did teacher pay increase? North Carolina was ranked second in having the fastest teacher pay raise in 2016-17 nationally, according to the National Education Association. This is where Lee’s legislative assistant, Emily Barnes, says Lee got his information. However, that hasn’t always been the case. In the 2013-14 academic year, North Carolina was ranked 48th for percentage change in average teacher salary, with a -1.6 percent change. The state also ranked 41st in the 2015-16 academic year for teacher pay raises with a 0.3 percent change. North Carolina did rank first in teacher pay raise in 2014-15 with a 6.3 percent change from the previous year. Our ruling Teachers did get a salary increase in each of the past five years under Republican leadership. However, despite the ""Held Harmless"" statute, teachers who reach 25 years of experience or more today would not make as much as they would have in 2013-14. That’s the main wrinkle in Lee’s claim.

Ken Paxton draws on debunked figures, says 'illegals' committed 600,000 crimes in Texas since 2011
","Republican Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general seeking a second term against Democrat Justin Nelson, invoked previously debunked numbers when he was asked about Democrats seeking to decriminalize border crossings. Paxton, in an Aug. 26, 2018, appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" called decriminalizing crossings ""a little scary,"" telling the host: ""Obviously, you know we’re a border state. We are struggling with protecting our border, protecting our people. To have a policy like this that takes away criminalizing crossing the border, you’re basically opening up your borders. ""And the reality is we already struggle with this,"" Paxton went on. ""We’ve had over 600,000 crimes committed by illegals since 2011. Over 1,200 homicides. We've had human trafficking. We've had all kinds of drug crimes. And if we make it more lenient, we’re going to get more of it. So, it’s going to cost lives if we go down this path,"" Paxton said. An Aug. 23, 2018, Huffington Post news story quoted Texas’ Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Lupe Valdez, and a Democratic U.S. House nominee, Veronica Escobar of El Paso, speaking favorably about no longer charging border crossers with criminal violations. The story quoted Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee, specifying that people seeking asylum at the border shouldn’t be charged with criminal violations. We can’t check a prediction about what happens if fewer people crossing the border get charged with crimes. But the big crime counts aired by Paxton reminded us we’ve long found flaws in citations of counts of crimes and homicides attributed to information publicized by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the lead state agency tasked with helping keep watch over the Texas-Mexico border. Let’s plumb our relevant past fact-checks before reviewing the meat of Paxton’s statement. Rick Perry's flammable 2014 claim In July 2014, Gov. Rick Perry warned about the security of the Texas-Mexico border by  declaring that more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by ""illegal aliens"" in six years. Pants on Fire, we ruled, in that Perry had misrepresented figures on a DPS web page that could be read, at worst, to indicate that in their lifetimes, an unspecified subset of 203,685 ""criminal alien defendants"" booked into Texas jails over the nearly six years through June 2014 had been charged with--not convicted of committing--3,070 homicides. We identified other complications that, it turned out, also weakened a pair of subsequent claims we checked that were based on DPS-posted numbers. To begin with, the term ""criminal aliens"" is generally used by law enforcement to identify noncitizens residing in the U.S. who are convicted of a crime--and such individuals include people living here legally or without legal authorization. Also, Michael Walker, an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New  York, said the DPS information didn’t even demonstrate the homicides occurred any time recently or in any particular state. Meantime, Northeastern University criminologist Ramiro Martinez, Jr. built his own analysis of Texas crime numbers and told us that if Perry’s claim held up, it would mean that more than half the state’s homicides in the six years were committed by unauthorized residents--an absurdity. ""It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed,"" Martinez commented. Two 2018 immigrant-crime claims Early this year, we replowed DPS-posted numbers before rating Pants on Fire Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick’s statement that ""566,000 crimes"" had been ""made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last six years."" At the time, the DPS said that more than 638,000 charges and over 286,000 convictions had been accumulated by more than 240,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into Texas jails in the latest six-plus years--as before, we confirmed, the charges had been amassed through their ""criminal careers."" We’ve posted the charts offered as factual back-up by Perry and Patrick, respectively, here. In March 2018, most recently, we rated False a claim by Sean Hannity of Fox News that  642,000 crimes were committed against Texans by criminal immigrants in a recent seven-year period. We found that Hannity’s claim, triggered by DPS-posted figures, reflected on mostly petty charges leveled through the lifetimes of 245,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into local Texas jails from June 2011 through February 2018--and 34 percent of them weren’t identified as living in the U.S. without legal authorization at their latest arrest, the DPS said. Generally, nonviolent offenses predominated, accounting for 66 percent of the tallied charges and 55 percent of career convictions. Martinez looked over these DPS-posted numbers, later saying that to his eyes, they reflected what’s known about most domestic crime--a ""sea of minor drug and property crimes."" Paxton points to DPS figures In May 2018, we emailed a DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, seeking to learn more about data fueling the DPS’s evolving posts about immigrants and crime. Two months later, Vinger responded by pointing out a substantially revised version of the web page. Vinger later told us by email that the revised web page ""only refers to charges and convictions for criminal aliens who were in the country illegally. Past versions,"" Vinger wrote, presented higher counts by showing ""charges and convictions for all criminal aliens – legal and illegal."" Another change: Vinger said the previous web page tallied crimes for each jailed individual’s criminal ""career"" while the new version, he wrote, shows charges and convictions occurring since June 2011. When we requested Paxton’s backup information, a spokeswoman for his state office, Kayleigh Lovvorn, said by email that Paxton’s numbers came from the same DPS web page, ""Texas Criminal Illegal Alien Data."" However, we didn’t spot information on the revised web page supporting Paxton’s reference to ""illegals"" committing over 600,000 crimes and more than 1,200 homicides since 2011. The newly available figures linked far fewer offenses, including homicides, to unauthorized residents. According to U.S. Department of Homeland Security ""status indicators,"" the DPS reported, ""over 261,000 criminal aliens were booked into Texas jails between June 1, 2011, and July 31, 2018, of which over 175,000 were classified as illegal aliens."" In the same period, DPS says, ""these 175,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 273,000 criminal offenses and  which included arrests for 505 homicide"" charges. All those criminal charges, the DPS says, ""have thus far resulted in over 114,000 convictions including 229 homicide convictions; 12,801 assault convictions; 3,016 burglary convictions; 17,002 drug convictions; 159 kidnapping convictions; 6,820 theft convictions; 10,846 obstructing police convictions; 962 robbery convictions; 1,596 sexual assault convictions; 1,087 sexual offense convictions; and 1,215 weapon convictions."" According to the web page, Homeland Security separately identified another 10,182 ""illegal aliens,"" all imprisoned in Texas, who together had been charged with more than 6,000 criminal offenses included 83 homicide charges. We combined the two sets of counts--a move supporting the conclusion that, per the DPS, more than 185,000 individuals believed to be living in the U.S. without legal permission were jailed in Texas over the seven-plus years who all told accounted for more than 279,000 criminal charges and over 114,000 convictions including 589 homicide charges and 229 homicide convictions--on all fronts, considerably shy of what Paxton said. Cato perspective We also ran Paxton’s statement past Cato Institute analyst Alex Nowrasteh, who authored a February 2018 study of crimes committed by immigrants in Texas. Nowrasteh said by email that in 2016, according to DPS data he said he obtained through a public information request, 16,277 illegal immigrants were convicted of a crime in Texas, accounting for 4 percent of Texas residents convicted of a crime at a time that illegal immigrants accounted for 6 percent of the state’s residents, according to U.S. Census Bureau research. Put another way, Nowrasteh said by email, the ""most crime-prone group in Texas were American natives."" Our ruling Paxton said Texas has ""had over 600,000 crimes committed by illegals since 2011. Over 1,200 homicides."" Both of these numbers--which we’ve twice debunked in detail since 2010--exceed what the state estimates by more than 400 percent. DPS-posted figures lately suggest that since mid-2011, Texas-jailed individuals believed to be living in the U.S. without legal permission account for 229 homicide convictions among more than 114,000 convictions across a range of mostly minor offenses.

Could net neutrality have shielded California firefighters from throttling?
","The idea that greedy corporations would screw over the average Internet user was perhaps the most vocal concern raised last year when a bundle of Internet protections, known as net neutrality, went on the chopping block. Now, three months after the regulations officially died, proponents are staking out a very different position as they work to resurrect the rules. Net neutrality must be restored, they argue, because its repeal has jeopardized public safety. ""We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California firefighters,"" said digital rights group Fight for the Future. Let’s unpack that statement, starting with the California fire. Golden State firefighters are still working to contain the largest blaze in state history. The Mendocino Complex Fire began burning in Northern California in late July, and so far has torched over 726,000 acres — more than double the size of Los Angeles. Firefighters from around the state have been called to action. Among the out-of-town responders were firefighters from Santa Clara County, located in the center of Silicon Valley, about 160 miles south of the inferno. The Santa Clara County fire department deployed a high-tech truck, known in firefighter jargon as an ""Incident Support Unit,"" to serve as a command-and-control center.  To work effectively, the trucks need a robust Internet signal. Its broadband hookup is used to power software like Google Sheets, which lets firefighters coordinate real-time responses. But in the midst of battling the largest fire in California history, the Santa Clara County truck’s Internet speed suddenly slowed to a crawl. At roughly 1/200 the original speed, firefighters would have been no worse off using a dial-up modem from the 1990s. So what the heck was happening? ""(We) discovered the data connection was being throttled by Verizon,"" Fire Chief Anthony Bowden said in a statement filed as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the FCC. ""These reduced speeds severely interfered with the unit’s ability to function effectively. ""Even small delays in response translate into devastating effects,"" he added, ""including loss of property, and, in some cases, loss of life."" The throttling persisted for some time even after the firefighters complained to Verizon and told the company of their urgent need to have fast Internet restored. Verizon later apologized for the incident. The restrictions were in place because the firefighters had a contract that said excess data usage was subject to significantly slowed-down speeds. But the company said it failed to comply with its own internal policy of taking its foot off the brake during emergencies. ""In supporting first responders in the Mendocino fire, we didn’t live up to our own promise of service and performance excellence when our process failed some first responders on the line, battling a massive California wildfire,"" Verizon said in a statement. ""For that, we are truly sorry."" The public relations fiasco drove Verizon to vow not to throttle west coast firefighters and some other first responders.   But that olive branch had limited reach. For some, the incident was the most clear-cut demonstration of the shortcomings of industry self-policing in the post-net neutrality era. Instead of after-the-fact corporate damage control, they argue, what’s needed is to put the law back on the books. So would Verizon’s conduct have been unlawful and punishable under net neutrality? That’s the main thrust of Fight for the Future’s statement. For the purposes of this fact-check, you need to bear in mind a couple of net neutrality’s key features. (See a more detailed explainer here.) A core idea behind net neutrality is that virtually all content will travel unimpeded around the same speed. ""Usually, when one thinks of a net neutrality violation, one thinks of the violation of the no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization rules,"" said Blair Levin, who served as chief of staff to the FCC chairman from 1993 through 1997. Of those three rules, we’re concerned here with only one: the ban on throttling. That rule generally prohibited Internet service providers, or ISPs, from slowing down customers’ speeds. However, to give ISPs flexibility in designing service plans that would avoid network congestion, the FCC carved out an exception. ISPs could offer plans that would allow willing customers to be throttled if they exceeded their data cap. In a sense, by signing this type of contract, customers waived their right not to be throttled. In addition to the no-throttling rule, you also need to know about net neutrality’s ""general conduct"" rule. That rule stopped companies like Verizon and Comcast from ""unreasonably interfering"" with customers’ Internet access. It also created an avenue for customers file complaints to the FCC, which could trigger an investigation into an ISP’s practices. One way to think about net neutrality with respect to ISPs is that it gave the FCC teeth. Net neutrality’s repeal, in turn, largely defanged it. So would the FCC have taken a bite out of Verizon if the old rules were still in play? The contract between Verizon and the California firefighters allowed throttling for excessive data use. In other words, the firefighters waived their right not to be throttled over their limit. Under the $37.99-per-month plan, the department would get high-speed broadband for the first 25 gigabytes. Data use beyond that was subject to speed reductions. The device installed in the California firefighter’s high-tech truck can use up to 5-10 gigabytes per day. At that rate, the firefighters quickly hit their cap. To some experts, the incident was simply the culmination of a series of mistakes — not a poster child for stronger regulation. ""What really happened wasn’t a net neutrality issue,"" Berin Szoka, a tech lawyer and president of the group TechFreedom, wrote. ""The (fire department) simply chose a data plan for their mobile command and control unit that was manifestly inappropriate for their needs."" What’s clear is that because the firefighters’ service plan permitted the kind of speed restrictions that were allowed under the old rules, Verizon did not directly violate net neutrality’s no-throttling rule. ""The throttling incident, while a real PR disaster for Verizon, has nothing to do with net neutrality,"" said Doug Brake, the director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. ""The rules explicitly allowed for data plans that rate-limit or ‘throttle’ a data connection after a certain threshold."" A spokeswoman for the Republican-majority FCC pointed out that the Santa Clara County fire department, which is party to a lawsuit against the FCC to restore net neutrality, does not argue the no-throttling rule was violated here. ""What happened had nothing to do with net neutrality,"" she said. ""Verizon was not discriminating on the basis of content, application, service or device.""  Even the group behind the claim we’re checking, Fight for the Future, conceded the narrow point about the contract falling under the no-throttling exception. Evan Greer, Fight for the Future’s deputy director, told us, ""Verizon's throttling of firefighters was not a direct violation of the ‘no throttling’ rule since it related to a data cap."" But there’s another rule that could have ensnared Verizon: The ""general conduct"" rule. This prohibited companies like Verizon and Comcast from ""unreasonably interfering"" with customers’ Internet access. It also created an avenue for customers to file complaints to the FCC. But the repeal of net neutrality choked off this avenue. ""Under the 2015 rules, the firefighters could have filed a complaint with the FCC on grounds that the throttling was ‘unjust and unreasonable,’ "" said Chip Stewart, a communication technology expert and professor at Texas Christian University. ""After the current FCC repealed those rules, that is no longer an option."" Gigi Sohn, who was a counselor to the FCC chairman while the net neutrality rules were written, said she believes the firefighters ""could have made a persuasive case"" if that option were available today. ""The throttling of the Santa Clara County FPD’s broadband service was a disaster waiting to happen,"" Sohn wrote in an essay for NBC News. ""In the absence of net neutrality rules and without strong FCC oversight, broadband providers like Verizon, Comcast and AT&T are free to run their networks as they please without regard to consumers, competition or public safety."" Harold Feld, the senior vice president at the liberal Public Knowledge, said the key point comes down to whether or not there’s a process for aggrieved consumers to get a fair hearing. ""It’s not just about whether Verizon behaved appropriately or not,"" he told PolitiFact, citing a blog post he wrote. ""It’s about having clear rules and procedures in place so that when an emergency like this happens, people know what to do and can resolve the problem quickly."" Some tech experts say additional oversight is unnecessary because companies are capable of policing themselves. (Verizon has promised to do so with more verve in the future, for instance.) But not all agree. ""The removal of the 'cop on the beat' may have contributed to Verizon acting in ways that even it now admits was dumb,"" Levin said. ""If there is no one watching, people act differently than if they think someone is watching."" Fight for the Future said, ""We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California fire fighters."" Under net neutrality, the firefighters could have filed a complaint against Verizon to the FCC, which at the very least would have launched an investigation, experts said. Repeal of the rules removed that avenue, thereby sidelining the FCC from serving as a ""cop on the beat."" However, the firefighters’ service plan permitted the kind of speed restrictions that were allowed under the old rules. So the company did not violate net neutrality’s no-throttling rule. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate this Half True.

Was Lincoln's Gettysburg Address initially ridiculed, as Donald Trump said?
","  Few people would have had ""Gettysburg Address"" on their bingo card for President Donald Trump’s Sept. 6 rally in Billings, Mont. But Trump did riff on the famous mid-Civil War speech by President Abraham Lincoln. The 273-word address, memorized by countless schoolchildren, was delivered for the dedication of the National Cemetery of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, at the site of a bloody but pivotal battle in the Civil War. Here’s what Trump said at the rally: ""You know, when Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed. ""He took the horse and carriage up from the White House, he wrote it partially in that carriage and partially at a desk in the Lincoln Bedroom, which is incredible, by the way, in the White House. And he went up to Gettysburg, and he delivered that speech, the Gettysburg Address. And he was excoriated by the fake news. They had fake news then. He was excoriated. ""They said it was a terrible, terrible speech. They said it was far too short. It's not long. Many of us know it by memory. It was far too short, and it was far too flowery. It was too flowery, four score and seven years ago, right? Too flowery. And he died. ""Fifty years after his death, they said it may have been the greatest speech ever made in America."" Some portions of Trump’s description are inaccurate (the president rode the train to Gettysburg rather than taking a horse and carriage) while others are fairly accurate (he is generally believed to have written a large portion of the speech at the White House before completing it and making revisions after his arrival in Gettysburg). The part that raised our eyebrows is the notion that Lincoln, despite being lionized for his words in subsequent generations, was ""ridiculed"" for the address at the time. Trump has a point, but the speech’s reception is more complicated than he lets on. Trump may have been thinking of the example of the Harrisburg Patriot & Union, which attracted national attention in in 2013, as the 150th anniversary of the address approached. The paper, located less than an hour away from the battlefield, wrote a scathing account of the speech. About Lincoln’s portion, the newspaper opined, ""We pass over the silly remarks of the President. For the credit of the nation we are willing that the veil of oblivion shall be dropped over them and that they shall be no more repeated or thought of."" A century and a half later, the newspaper's take officially changed. The Harrisburg Patriot-News and pennlive.com, under the leadership of editorial page editors John L. Micek and Matthew Zencey, ‘fessed up to the paper’s past editorial misstep in a 2013 fashion modeled on Lincoln’s original address: ""Seven score and ten years ago, the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed, so tainted by hubris, so lacking in the perspective history would bring, that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives. … No mere utterance, then or now, could do justice to the soaring heights of language Mr. Lincoln reached that day. By today's words alone, we cannot exalt, we cannot hallow, we cannot venerate this sacred text, for a grateful nation long ago came to view those words with reverence, without guidance from this chagrined member of the mainstream media. ... The Patriot-News regrets the error."" The newspaper’s self-deprecating retraction went viral, even inspiring a recurring character on Saturday Night Live’s ""Weekend Update"" -- Jebidiah Atkinson, the unrepentant, arrogant ""speech critic"" for the 1860s Harrisburg Patriot & Union, played by cast member Taran Killam. (Watch his inaugural SNL appearance, in which Atkinson haughtily disses famous speeches by everyone from Patrick Henry to Jesus.)   So one particularly high-profile case backs up evidence for Trump’s remarks in Montana. The Harrisburg Patriot-News’ negative reaction was not isolated, but it was not unanimous. The poet and historian Carl Sandburg wrote in 1954 that ""the American correspondent of the London Times wrote that 'the ceremony was rendered ludicrous by some of the sallies of that poor President Lincoln. ... Anything more dull and commonplace it would not be easy to produce.'"" And the Chicago Times wrote, ""The cheeks of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly, flat, and dishwatery utterances."" But others offered high praise indeed. The Chicago Tribune wrote, ""The dedicatory remarks by President Lincoln will live among the annals of man."" Sandburg reported that the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin wrote that ""not many"" who read Lincoln’s speech ""will do it without a moistening of the eye and a swelling of the heart."" And the Providence Journal added, ""We know not where to look for a more admirable speech than the brief one which the president made."" The key determinant of a newspaper’s positive or a negative review? Politics, historians say. Lincoln was a Republican. ""The Patriot was a Democratic organ dedicated to the defeat of Republicans,"" said William Blair, a Penn State University historian and author of With Malice toward Some: Treason and Loyalty in the Civil War Era. ""The Democrats were being increasingly dominated by a peace faction that was calling for an armistice of an indistinct nature but with the possibility of bargaining with the South for reunification while preserving slavery. The Democrats increasingly criticized Republicans for a seeming willingness -- in their eyes -- to waste more and more white lives for the ending of slavery while refusing to consider negotiating to end the war."" In other words, Blair said, what seems to modern ears like an apolitical speech appealing to universal values was actually seen at the time as a statement of policy -- in favor of continuing the war, and seeking emancipation. ""It was a brilliant speech that pressed forward two important policy measures without seeming to do so,"" Blair said. ""The Patriot’s response was to an extent predictable. Republican newspapers were very supportive"" of Lincoln’s speech in the immediate aftermath. Trump does have a point about the address' changing assessment over time, said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian who specializes in slavery and the Civil War. ""The speech definitely was seen as iconic 50 years later but not at the time,"" Foner said. ""A few (newspapers) recognized that this one was really special. But generally, in 1863 Lincoln was much more revered for the Emancipation Proclamation than the Gettysburg Address."" Trump said, ""When Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed."" Lincoln was definitely ridiculed by some newspapers, primarily on the basis of politics. Those sympathetic to Democrats and the South blasted it for seeming to support a continuation of the war and the goal of emancipation. It's worth noting that other newspapers -- those whose sentiments aligned with the Union -- lavished the address with praise.

Greg Abbott says Texas enjoying record high-school graduation rate
","Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who seeks re-election in November against Democratic nominee Lupe Valdez, says in a new ad that he’s kept his big campaign promises as evidenced, he suggests, by the state’s economy and schools. We’ve tracked progress on numerous Abbott campaign promises from 2014 on our Abbott-O-Meter. Abbott’s ""Promises Made, Promises Kept"" TV ad, released Aug. 30, 2018, talks up jobs and crime-fighting. He also says in the ad that on his watch, ""schools are stronger; high school graduation rates are at all-time highs."" All-time tops? We wondered about that mindful that this March, we rated True an Abbott claim that Texas ranks among the top five states for its high-school graduation rate. Abbott spokesman John Wittman told us at the time that Abbott had gotten to his top-five claim by relying on a chart showing state-by-state graduation rates in 2015-16. According to the chart, posted by the National Center for Education Statistics, Iowa led that year with a 91.3 percent high school graduation rate.Texas landed fifth with a rate of 89.1 percent, just ahead of Missouri (89 percent). The nation’s high school graduation rate was 84.1 percent, the chart says. Separately, a Texas Education Agency spokeswoman, Lauren Callahan, urged us to notice that the Texas graduation rate had consistently escalated. The statewide graduation rate in 2014-15 was 89 percent, the agency advised, compared with 88.3 percent in 2013-14 and 88 percent in 2012-13. So, the state’s 2015-16 graduation rate was the highest in a few years. And did it set a record? Rates gauged since 1996 In September 2018, Callahan replied to our fresh query on this front with an email confirming that the 2015-16 rate set a Texas record and noting that charts in the agency’s report on the year’s rate show state-gauged graduation rates for 1996 through 2016. Callahan cautioned, though, that the definition of dropouts changed in 2005-06 and was phased into graduation rates over three school years, making comparable only the graduation rates shown for 2009 through 2016. In 2009, the report for 2016 says, some 82.9 percent of the year’s class of seniors graduated. That rate was the highest since 2005, according to figures in the report, when 84 percent of seniors graduated. According to the report, the previous high graduation rate or the years starting in 1996 was set in 2004, 84.6 percent. We wondered too if every high school has lately experienced a record rate. Callahan said confirmation would take more historical research than the agency could immediately perform. That said, Callahan called it ""unlikely that rates are at a record high for all high schools statewide."" Other metrics From past fact-checks, we recognized another method used to gauge progress through high school — by comparing a year’s count of graduates to the number of ninth-graders three years earlier; the difference signals student attrition. There are two paths to such an alternative comparison. In 2014-15, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, 89 percent of Texas high school students graduated three years after finishing ninth grade. According to the agency, Texas tied Alabama and Nebraska for third place nationally by this metric with Iowa (91 percent) and New Jersey (90 percent) leading the nation. In contrast, Texas lags more states by a cruder yet popular measure based on tallying high school graduates each year and comparing that count with the number of students who completed ninth grade three years before. In 2012-13, the latest year analyzed by the education statistics center, Texas tied with California with an ""averaged freshman graduation rate"" of 83.6 percent. Twenty states had higher rates, a center chart says. In October 2017, the San Antonio-based Intercultural Development Research Association, which tracks high school completion rates, reported that, through the 2016-17 school year, the state’s attrition rate, not counting charter schools, hovered around 24 percent to 25 percent for five years — down from 33 percent in the mid-1980s. ""Texas public schools are failing to graduate one out of every four"" high school students, the report says. To our inquiry, state education officials didn’t have a comparable attrition rate for 2016-17. DeEtta Culbertson, a TEA spokeswoman, emailed us agency information indicating that for 2015-16, the state calculated an attrition rate of 19.6 percent. Even earlier, Julian Vasquez Heilig, a professor at California State University Sacramento who has been critical of how Texas achieves its reported graduation rates, told us enrollment drop-offs that show up in calculations of attrition amount to a soft spot in the state’s calculation of graduation rates. In 2015, Heilig told us that’s probably because the rates are rooted in each school district reporting the progress of each student, making it at least possible for administrators to record dropouts as students who left for legitimate reasons — such as moving to another state. In May 2014, Heilig laid out his own look at how Texas schools apply student ""leaver"" codes here. Also in 2015, the TEA’s Callahan said by email that if a district’s reported reasons for students leaving school look suspicious, it can trigger a state review. ""Is some leaver information ultimately inaccurate?"" Callahan said. ""Yes, but it is usually not because someone is intentionally lying. People just change their minds. At the time a student withdrew from public school, the parent signed a document saying the child was being transferred to a private school, for example. Ultimately something happens and the child never enrolls anywhere."" We reconnected with Heilig about Abbott’s claim; he said by phone that nationally, improved rates are an indicator that public schools are better than ever though any discussion of rates, he reaffirmed, still merits a caveat about the persistent difference between the number of students who graduate each year trailing the number of students who were enrolled in ninth grade four years before. Our ruling Abbott says in his ad that Texas has record high school graduation rates. In 2016, the Texas graduation rate of 89.1 percent was the highest the state has measured since 1996, the earliest year of available data. Abbott was not talking about an alternative metric by which Texas in 2012-13 trailed 20 states for its share of students graduating compared with the number of ninth-grade students advancing three years before.

Fact-checking Democrat Katie Porter's tax attack ad in California 45
","If Democrats are to retake the U.S. House, California is likely to play a big part. And near the top of any list of toss-up races is California’s 45th Congressional District, an Orange County seat held by incumbent Republican Rep. Mimi Walters. Hillary Clinton carried the district in 2016 by five percentage points, and Democrats have nominated UC Irvine law professor Katie Porter to challenge Walters this November. One big issue in the race: President Donald Trump's 2017 tax overhaul. While the tax bill, which Walters supported, cut taxes for many, Porter claimed in a recent television ad that it will actually raise taxes on ""middle-class Californians."" ""Mimi Walters votes with Donald Trump 99 percent of the time and Mimi Walters raised taxes on middle-class Californians,"" Porter’s ad claims. Here, we’re focusing on Porter’s claim that Walters ""raised taxes on middle-class Californians."" Porter campaign manager Erica Kwiatkowski said the claim stems from Walters’ vote for the Trump tax bill. The tax bill, signed into law by Trump in December 2017, cuts corporate taxes across as well as income taxes for many Americans. But residents in higher-tax states like California will be hurt by changes to the state and local tax deduction. Previously, California residents could deduct the amount they pay in state and local taxes from their federal tax bill. As part of the 2017 tax bill, deductions will be capped at $10,000. The provision is set to end after 2025. About 6.1 million Californians filed for the deduction in 2015, reducing their federal tax income by an average of $18,438, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. A report prepared by the Government Finance Officers Association, a group made up of government finance officers, shows similar numbers. The average deduction in California, New York and New Jersey are all over $17,000. If the state and local tax deduction were eliminated, ""an average taxpayer in New York who currently itemizes SALT (state and local tax) would face a tax increase of almost $5,500.""   That figure wouldn’t be far off for a decent chunk of Californians. First, the 1 million California taxpayers who may have to shell out more tax money next year, as seen in Porter’s ad, are not all middle class. The Sacramento Bee reported that while Californians will lose a collective $12 billion because the new law caps the state and local tax deduction, the lion’s share of that money will be paid by wealthy residents earning more than $1 million a year, with 43,000 of them paying a combined $9 billion. Still, some middle-class California families are predicted to pay more, too, according to an analysis by the state’s Franchise Tax Board. The board has been releasing reports on the tax bill in waves since it was signed into law in December. Notably, the tax board found that while most Californians should see a tax cut, about 751,000 households with incomes under $250,000 will likely owe more tax. Taken together, these taxpayers are estimated to owe an extra $1.1 billion. Regardless, it’s still hard to tell how it will affect each family as every tax return is different. And in a state with more than 39 million people, many middle-class Californians will see a tax cut — not an increase. ""In general, tax situations are unique for everyone, and it's difficult to assess a broad-ranging effect on future years, without having specific information about a person's return,"" a spokesperson for the tax board told PolitiFact. The Los Angeles Times also reported that Walters spent weeks pushing House leaders to alter the bill to lower the burden on her constituents before deciding to support it. She told the organization that she believes the ""changes to deductions"" and ""tweaks to the income ranges"" would mean a tax cut for her constituents. ""I campaigned on tax reform. I’ve always been a big proponent that we need to have tax reform in this country, and I think we have a very good package that we are presenting to the American people,"" she told the Times. It is worth noting that Walters’ Republican counterparts in nearby districts, Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Darrell Issa, both voted against the measure.  Porter’s ad says, ""Mimi Walters raised taxes on middle-class Californians."" That's misleading. While a provision in the tax bill will result in tax increases for some middle-class Californians, it won't for many more. The ad ignores all that context, along with the fact that lion's share of the tax increases Porter is talking about will be paid for by wealthy Californians. Porter's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.","[('Katie Porter’s campaign ad, Aug. 20, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tipEUo3QUQ0'), ('Mimi Walters’ campaign ad, Aug. 14, 2018', 'No link'), ('Votesmart.org, Mimi Walters’ voting record, accessed Aug. 28, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mz2LIym2xE'), ('Congress.Gov, H.R. 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Dec. 22, 2017', 'No link'), ('The Sacramento Bee, ""Trump\'s tax cut not for everyone: 1 million Californians will owe $12 billion more next year,"" April 17, 2018', 'https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/29346/mimi-walters/?p=1#.W4Vb_BJKigR'), ('The Orange County Register, ""House plan would raise taxes for many in So Cal; two area GOP reps vote against it,"" Nov. 16, 2017', 'No link'), ('The Los Angeles Times, ""The GOP tax plan passed.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Congressional Leadership Fund']","
Congressional Leadership Fund distorts Kara Eastman’s statements on taxes
","Democrat Kara Eastman came on the national political scene in a big way after defeating a more moderate member of her party, Brad Ashford, in the primary in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. NBC News called Eastman ""the new darling of the left."" She ""rode a progressive wave,"" the Omaha World-Herald said of her May primary victory. Now Eastman gets to challenge a Republican incumbent, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, for the congressional seat in November. That has put her under the watch of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that wants to retain the House of Representatives’ Republican majority. The PAC, aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, released a TV and web ad on Sept. 4 saying that because Eastman was opposed to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 -- the so-called Republican tax cuts signed by President Donald Trump just before Christmas -- and has spoken of repeal, a vote for Eastman would be a vote to ""eliminate your tax cuts."" ""Your family,"" the ad says, would have to pay $2,500 more a year in taxes as a result. Eastman’s position, however, is more nuanced than that. The ad begins with an announcer saying, ""We know Kara Eastman is a liberal. But what does that really mean?"" If Eastman is elected, the ad says with a series of answers, Americans would pay $32 trillion. ""That’s the cost of Eastman’s plan to give everyone free health care,"" the announcer says. Then the ad gives another figure, $600 billion. ""That’s the price of Eastman’s free college plan,"" the announcer says. And finally: ""$2,500 -- that’s how much more your family will pay after Eastman eliminates your tax cut."" The first two figures are based on the legislative equivalent of moonshots for progressives like Eastman. For example, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, has said his College for All Act, eliminating tuition for families making $125,000 or less, would cost $600 billion, financed through a new ""Wall Street speculation tax."" And left- and right-leaning think tanks alike have pegged the cost of Sanders’ ""Medicare for All Plan"" around $32 trillion, although Sanders disputes the estimates. But free college and health care in the United States would require a political tsunami before they could get more than fleeting floor discussion in Congress. Eastman might support them but even if elected, she could be waiting a long time. The Kaiser Family Foundation last year suggested it could take ""a prolonged national debate over making such a dramatic change to the U.S. health care system."" That is why we are focusing here on something far more likely: a change in the tax rates and Eastman’s position specifically. If Congress doesn’t change the new tax law, in fact, Americans are practically guaranteed to face a tax hike within a decade. That’s because lawmakers structured individual tax cuts to expire by 2027, a way of making costs fit within 10-year congressional budget contours. The law can be amended and extended when the time is right -- and unless members of both parties want to face accusations that they raised taxes, they are almost certain to try to make those changes and keep many if not all of the individual tax cuts intact. That brings us back to Eastman’s position on those taxes and the claim we are examining. The Congressional Leadership Fund is telling residents in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District that ""your family"" will pay $2,500 more if Eastman gets her way. Will they? To answer, we first asked the Congressional Leadership Fund to cite the basis of its claim. The PAC said the $2,500 figure is from a U.S. House Ways and Means Committee analysis in December of how much money families in each congressional district would save with the tax cuts. The committee’s Republican leaders said in their estimate that a married couple with two children in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District would get a median cut of $2,597. Next, we looked at why the Congressional Leadership Fund says Eastman would take these tax cuts away. The PAC said the elimination claim came specifically from a May 14 article in the Omaha World-Herald that described differences between Eastman and her Democratic primary campaign opponent. The article said: ""The candidates agree that the recent Republican tax overhaul was overly tilted to the wealthy, but Eastman wants to repeal the law and go in the other direction while Ashford would want it to be rolled back. For example, the bill cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Eastman wants to see it at least returned to 35 percent, while Ashford would set the corporate rate at about 26 percent."" If both parts are true -- that the median annual tax cut for a family of four in Eastman’s district was $2,500, and if Eastman ""wants to repeal"" the tax law -- then the claim would be accurate. But there’s more to it. Even the $2,500 figure is disputed. Figures for savings by middle-class families across the country have differed because of variables included or excluded in estimates, such as changes to deductions and exemptions, and even because of different methods of counting. As PolitiFact reported in July: ""For 2018, the average tax cut for the middle 20 percent of the income scale is $780. That’s much less than it is for the top one-fifth of the income scale -- $5,790 -- and compared to the top 1 percent, at $32,650, it’s positively paltry."" That’s a national figure. While the Ways and Means Committee says the average savings in Nebraska District 2 is $2,597, the liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has put the savings for middle-class Nebraskans -- those earning $45,430 to $73,300 -- at $840. But the institute added that due to the scheduled expirations, those families’ taxes will rise by 2027. ""The CLF ad is deceptive in that they are using fuzzy math and refuse to admit to voters that the Republican tax bill will raise taxes on middle-class families in Nebraska by 2027,"" said Heather Aliano, Eastman spokeswoman. Quibbling over sums aside, what about Eastman’s statement, as cited by the Congressional Leadership Fund, that she wants to repeal the law, a characterization -- but not an Eastman quote -- in the Omaha World-Herald? Courtney Alexander, the Congressional Leadership Fund’s communications director, told PolitiFact the article speaks volumes. ""We are simply referring to an article by the Omaha World-Herald, which is arguably the most respected newspaper in the state,"" Alexander said. Yet the information on taxes was in a single paragraph highlighting the candidates’ general positions, not the details. We found several more detailed descriptions, and Eastman’s campaign sent us others. None spoke of repealing the entirety of the 2007 tax cuts. Nor, for that matter, did the article that the Congressional Leadership Fund says it based its ad on. In that single paragraph on taxes, Eastman said she wanted the corporate income tax rate returned to 35 percent, but she did not speak about individual rates. That turned out to be consistent with more detailed quotes and statements elsewhere in which Eastman criticized the December tax package as too generous to the wealthy but never said she wanted to take away middle-class tax cuts. In an interview with the Gateway, an independent, student-run newspaper and website at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Eastman said in August that ""we need to be thinking more about regular people."" ""I would like to see that tax bill flipped so that we are taxing the very wealthy and large corporations at a fair rate,"" she said in that interview. ""Giving them a tax break does not benefit Nebraskans. It actually just benefits the CEOs of those companies and the shareholders. And we're seeing clearly that cutting taxes for the very wealthy is not the way to boost the economy."" On her campaign website, Eastman says, ""The U.S. has to generate more revenue to pay down our $20 trillion debt by raising the top tax rate and eliminating corporate tax loopholes."" The website says nothing about overall repeal. Discussing this with the Congressional Leadership Fund, Alexander again cited the newspaper language that said Eastman wants to ""go in the other direction"" from the one the tax bill followed. Although that direction was not specified in the article the PAC cites, Alexander said that ""if you repeal the tax cuts, the tax rates go up. Kara Eastman said she wants to repeal the bill."" Eastman has not said she wants to repeal everything, however. She has not laid out her own tax plan or proposal, but she has said repeatedly that she wants rates to go back up for the rich, not the middle class. ""That tax plan is a dupe to Americans, to the middle class, to working people, and we need to flip that tax plan on its end,"" she told KETV, Omaha’s ABC affiliate, on March 12. Asked how she would change it, she spoke about ""taxing the very wealthy, the 1 percent and corporations."" Aliano, the campaign spokeswoman, told PoltiFact, ""Kara doesn’t want to see tax rates rise for the middle class. She’d like to maintain the tax breaks the middle class receives long term -- something the Republican tax plan doesn’t do."" The claim that Eastman will raise taxes on ""your family"" by $2,500 is based on a generalization in a single article that could be open to interpretation. It need not be viewed in isolation, because a body of interviews and statements exists that show more specifically what Eastman would do. She would raise rates on the wealthy. She has not spoken of raising rates on the middle class. We rate the claim False.","[('Ad and news release from Congressional Leadership Fund, Sept. 4, 2018', 'https://congressionalleadershipfund.org/first-t-v-and-digital-ad-in-ne-02-kara-eastmans-liberal-agenda-means-big-price-tag-for-nebraska-families/'), ('Email and phone conversations with Courtney Alexander, Congressional Leadership Fund, Sept. 4 and 5, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email and phone conversations with Heather Aliano, Eastman for Congress, Sept 4 and 5, 2018', 'https://waysandmeans.house.gov/numbers-tax-cuts-jobs-act-delivers-tax-cuts-families-every-congressional-district-2/'), ('""By the numbers Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delives tax cuts for families in every congressional district,"" U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, Dec. 21, 2017', 'No link'), ('""How the final GOP-Trump tax bill would affect Nebraska residents’ federal taxes,"" Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, Dec. 16, 2017', 'https://itep.org/finalgop-trumpbill-ne/'), ('""Five key differences between rad Ashford and Kara Eastman,"" Omaha World-Herald, May 14, 2018', 'No link'), ('Kara Eastman campaign website, accessed Sept. 4, 2018', 'https://www.omaha.com/news/politics/five-key-differences-between-brad-ashford-and-kara-eastman/article_016f9638-9eec-5e50-8e2a-6d6eb7d2b912.html'), ('Kara Eastman news release, Nov. 2, 2017', 'No link'), ('""Kara Eastman rides a progressive wave to the Democratic nomination in the 2nd District,"" Omaha World-Herald, May 17, 2017', 'http://eastmanforcongress.com/smallbusiness/'), ('""Meet the progressive whose surprise win just spoiled establishment Democrats’ plans,"" NBC News, May 16, 2018', 'No link'), ('""Could Trump tax cut save up to $44,697 per family?""

As the screen cuts to a sepia-toned image of the U.S. Capitol building, Hannah says, ""I don’t understand why Amy McGrath ... wants to fund more welfare for people who can work, but don’t."" Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot, is the Democratic candidate running against incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr in what is expected to be a November toss-up race. The two have sparred on the role that welfare, and specifically Medicaid, should play in Kentucky. The sponsor of the ad is the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican PAC closely aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan. We wanted to know whether McGrath has called for ""more welfare"" for people who can work, but don't. The Congressional Leadership Fund pointed us toward two instances in which, they say, McGrath supported welfare for those who are able to work but don’t: her stances on a Kentucky Medicaid waiver, and the 2018 farm bill. In January 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a proposal from Kentucky leaders through the federal Medicaid waiver application process, in which states can submit proposals to use federal Medicaid funds in nontraditional ways. Under Gov. Matt Bevin's plan, called Kentucky HEALTH, adult Medicaid recipients would be required to work or volunteer to receive benefits, if they are able. In July, a federal judge blocked the measure, saying the proposal didn’t fully consider federal requirements for access to health care. But the idea behind it remains a talking point in the state’s politics. Barr has said that states should be able to set their own policies for health care, and supported the concept of work requirements for benefits, saying it could help recipients ""achieve self-sufficiency."" McGrath is against work requirements. ""I value encouraging people to work, if they are able, but I fail to see why we are linking that to having health care,"" she said to Lex18, a local NBC affiliate. ""We can't punish those who need assistance as a cruel way to cut the state budget."" Currently, Kentucky’s Medicaid program does not have job requirements. McGrath’s opposition to Kentucky HEALTH does not necessarily mean she wants to expand Medicaid to cover more people, or to make easier for those without jobs to receive insurance, as the ad claims. Instead, she supports the status quo: providing Medicaid to low-income Kentuckians, even those without jobs. The Congressional Leadership Fund also pointed us to the 2018 farm bill, which included new regulations for food stamps, known as SNAP. Under the initial draft of the bill, SNAP recipients would be required to work or do job training at least 20 hours per week. The farm bill has not yet become law. The version with work requirements was passed by the House in June 2018. The Senate passed their version just a week later, but they removed the controversial work requirements. McGrath, who by this point had retired from teaching at the Naval Academy to campaign full-time, tweeted a critique of the work requirements, saying they ""would take away SNAP assistance to thousands of veterans and active duty military families who rely on these benefits."" Fellow Kentuckians, this bill they all voted for would take away SNAP assistance to thousands of veterans and active duty military families who rely on these benefits, who are among those 1 million households affected. https://t.co/XngSHGqWd4 Andrew S. London, professor of sociology at Syracuse University, studies the relationship between SNAP benefits and the military. He said there is support for McGrath’s notion that a work requirement might lead to reduced benefits going to a subpopulation of veterans. ""Our research suggests that SNAP use among veterans and reserve/guard who are either unemployed or not in the labor force is substantial,"" he said. Much like the Medicaid debate, McGrath isn’t pushing for more welfare for unemployed Americans. Instead, she wants to keep eligibility requirements as they currently are, allowing many people — including unemployed veterans — to keep their benefits. An ad by the Congressional Leadership Fund says that McGrath ""wants to fund more welfare for people who can work, but don’t."" This is exaggerated, and it hinges on the use of ""more"" to create a deceptive picture about her position. McGrath spoke out against the Kentucky HEALTH plan, which would have required Medicaid recipients to work or do community service in order to receive benefits. She also objected to the House version of the 2018 farm bill, which would have imposed stricter work requirements on SNAP recipients. However, in both instances, McGrath hasn’t called for more welfare. Rather, she opposes imposing work requirements and disqualifying some current recipients. McGrath has said she wants to keep the status quo on welfare, not to increase it or make it easier for people not to work. The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.","[('Congressional Leadership Fund, ""(KY-06) Hannah,"" Aug. 8, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGCoYj8sM1A&feature=youtu.be'), ('Congressional Leadership Fund, ""CLF releases new ads highlighting Amy McGrath’s extreme, liberal agenda,"" Aug. 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('Lex18, ""Barr and McGrath spar over medicaid work requirements, benefits cuts,"" Jul. 03, 2018', 'https://congressionalleadershipfund.org/clf-releases-new-ads-highlighting-amy-mcgraths-extreme-liberal-agenda/'), ('Email interview with Mark Nickolas, press contact for McGrath campaign.', 'No link'), ('Amy McGrath, ""Ending Either/or: Amy McGrath’s plan to move the central Kentucky economy forward,"" 2018', 'http://www.lex18.com/story/38567147/barr-and-mcgrath-spar-over-medicaid-work-requirements-benefits-cuts'), ('NPR, ""Federal judge blocks medicaid work requirements in Kentucky,"" Jun. 29, 2018', 'No link'), ('Northern Kentucky Tribune, ""Kentucky HEALTH delayed by federal judge, halts plan to require Medicaid recipients to work,"" Jun. 29, 2018', 'https://static1.squarespace.com/static/594516cd2cba5e0fcda7a240/t/5ab3aefa575d1f7020b59bd2/1521725186089/McGrath+Economic+Plan.pdf'), ('Kentucky HEALTH, ""FAQ,"" 2017', 'No link'), ('Farm Policy News Illinois, ""Farm bill passes the Senate,"" Jun. 29, 2018', 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/29/624807533/federal-judge-blocks-medicaid-work-requirements-in-kentucky'), ('Politico, ""Senate passes farm bill, setting up food stamp battle with the House,"" Jun. 28, 2018', 'No link'), ('Amy McGrath, tweet, Jan. 10, 2018', 'https://www.nkytribune.com/2018/06/kentucky-health-delayed-by-federal-judge-halts-plan-to-require-medicaid-recipients-to-work/'), ('AP, ""Medicaid becomes latest sparring issue in congressional race,"" Jul. 3, 2018', 'No link'), ('NPR, ""House passes farm bill with controversial work requirements,"" Jun. 21, 2018', 'https://kentuckyhealth.ky.gov/Pages/FAQ.aspx'), ('Andrew London, ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Use Among Active-Duty Military Personnel, Veterans, and Reservists,"" Aug 7, 2015', 'No link'), ('Amy McGrath, tweet, Jun. 21, 2018', 'https://farmpolicynews.illinois.edu/2018/06/farm-bill-passes-the-senate/'), ('Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ""House Farm Bill’s SNAP Cuts, Work Requirements Would Hurt Veterans,"" Jul. 6, 2018', 'No link'), ('Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ""Taking Medicaid Coverage Away From People Not Meeting Work Requirements Will Reduce Low-Income Families’ Access to Care and Worsen Health Outcomes,"" Aug. 13, 2018', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/28/senate-passes-farm-bill-683232'), ('Marketplace, ""Military families turn to food stamps,"" May 25, 2015', 'No link'), ('Henry J.

Super PAC ad twists truth on Maine candidate’s welfare voting record
","A super PAC’s attack ad in the race for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District claims that Democratic candidate Jared Golden voted for people to purchase tattoos, tobacco, alcohol, lottery tickets with with welfare dollars. ""Why isn’t Jared Golden looking out for us?"" the ad says. ""In Augusta, Golden voted to let welfare recipients use your tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol, even lottery tickets."" The ad comes from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC focused on strengthening and maintaining the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Golden, a state representative, is looking to unseat two-term incumbent Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin in November. Golden claims the ad was is false. Let’s find out. The super PAC’s claim refers to a state law passed in 2016 that limits people on Maine Temporary Assistance for Needy Families from using Electronic Benefits Transfer cards to purchase a laundry list of items, including tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets. This state law passed Maine’s House of Representatives 206-38 with bipartisan support. Golden was one of the 38 representatives who voted against the bill. He told the Sun Journal he opposes misuse of welfare funds, but the state-level restrictions were unnecessary because federal rules already prohibit using welfare money for items like tattoos, tobacco and alcohol. Golden spokesman Bobby Reynolds said just because Golden voted against that bill, it doesn’t mean he voted in favor of using welfare dollars for controversial purchases. Reynolds said that if the bill failed, Mainers would still be barred from using TANF funds to purchase those items under federal rules. ""It was a solution in search of a problem,"" Reynolds said. ""To be clear, Jared Golden opposes the use of SNAP and TANF for such purchases."" However, it’s worth noting that Maine’s 2016 law is more restrictive than federal law. The federal Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires states to maintain policies and practices to keep EBT cards from being used at liquor stores, casinos or adult-oriented entertainment establishments. The federal law does not restrict transactions at grocery stores that sell alcohol or that have ""gaming activities."" It also does not regulate how cash that has been withdrawn with an EBT card can be used. Maine's 2016 law also does not address cash withdrawals. ""It would be virtually impossible to effectively monitor and implement such a restriction,"" Schott said. The 2012 federal law also does not mention tattoos or tobacco. Maine’s 2016 law expanded TANF EBT card purchase restrictions to also include tobacco products lotteries, bail, firearms, ammunition, vacation or travel services, tattoos and obscene materials or entertainment. The Poliquin campaign declined our request to comment on the content of the ad, saying the campaign had no control over the ad and no role in its creation. The Congressional Leadership Fund claims that Golden voted in favor of welfare recipients using tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets. Golden voted against a 2016 bill that limited EBT card purchases, saying federal law already covered the issue. Golden did not vote in favor of a measure that would expand EBT card use to those items. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.","[('Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, ""(ME-02) Work Hard,"" Aug. 27, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aoi_6HQrbg'), ('PolitiFact, Congressional Leadership Fund file, accessed Aug. 29, 2018', 'No link'), ('Lewiston Sun Journal, ""New GOP television ad targets Golden\'s positions — and tattoo,"" Aug. 27, 2018', 'https://www.politifact.com/personalities/congressional-leadership-fund/'), ('State of Maine Legislature, S.P. 384 - L.D. 1097, approved April 16, 2016', 'No link'), ('State of Maine Legislature, ""Roll-call details for House roll-call #645 LD 1097,"" April 15, 2016', 'http://www.sunjournal.com/new-republican-television-ad-targets-jared-goldens-positions-and-his-tattoos/'), ('USDA, ""What is Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT)?"", Aug. 23, 2018', 'No link'), ('United States Congress, ""Middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012,"" approved Feb. 22, 2012', 'https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0384&item=10&snum=127'), ('Email interview with Bobby Reynolds, Golden campaign spokesman, Aug. 30, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Brendan Conley, Poliquin campaign spokesman, Aug. 30, 2018', 'https://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/rollcall.asp?ID=280055776&chamber=House&serialnumber=645'), ('Interview with Congressional Leadership Fund spokesperson, Sept. 4, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Liz Schott, senior fellow at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Sept. 5, 2018', 'https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/what-electronic-benefits-transfer-ebt'), ('Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ""TANF Cash Benefits Have Fallen by More Than 20 Percent in Most States and Continue to Erode,"" Oct. 13, 2017', 'No link'), ('United States Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,"" accessed Sept. 5, 2018', 'https://www.congress.gov/112/plaws/publ96/PLAW-112publ96.pdf'), ('Portland Press Herald, ""LePage: Transaction records show welfare cards abused,"" Jan. 7, 2014', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/sep/07/congressional-leadership-fund/super-pac-ad-twists-truth-maine-candidates-welfare/

Tony Evers wrong to blame Scott Walker's rejection of Medicaid money for higher health costs
","In his first TV ad after winning the state’s Democratic nomination for governor, Tony Evers blamed incumbent Scott Walker for high health care costs in Wisconsin. The 30-second ad focused on the Republican governor’s decision to turn down federal funds that would have expanded Medicaid in 2014. ""When Walker was running for president, he played politics and rejected millions in federal health care money that would have lowered costs for our families,"" the ad says. ""Minnesota’s governor took the funds. They made changes. Wisconsin families now pay nearly 50% more than Minnesotans for the same health care."" There’s a core statistical claim about health care costs, but also implications about the reasons behind it. Let’s dig in. The 50 percent claim is simple enough. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit think tank focusing on national health issues, uses benchmark plans for comparisons between states — specifically the second-lowest cost silver premium for a 40-year-old in each county. Their approach, which is widely accepted, shows a $569 average premium for Wisconsin in 2018 and a $385 average premium for Minnesota. Thus, Wisconsin premiums are about 48 percent higher for people purchasing individual insurance through the state and federal marketplaces created after the Affordable Care Act, according to the latest data. So the ad is largely correct about the number. But it is incorrect to attribute that number to ""families,"" since the analysis it is drawn from is based on the cost an individual would pay. The ad also focuses on why those premiums are higher, pointing to Walker’s Medicaid decision. Declining Medicaid was part of Walker’s Obamacare alternative, and was his first major policy initiative as a presidential candidate. (Democrats have come after Walker for this decision before, including a claim by then-gubernatorial candidate Dana Wachs that the move cost Wisconsin $1 billion, which we rated Mostly True in June 2018.) Medicaid expansion would have covered everyone making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Walker instead did what’s called a ""partial expansion"" of Medicaid, covering everyone making less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level. The full expansion would have moved more low-income people out of the marketplace, which affects premiums for those who remained in it. But how much? Experts say Medicaid may be a factor in the premium difference, but it is just one of many that could explain differences in premiums between two states. A handful of studies have shown Medicaid expansion has some impact on premiums, but not much, said Adam Searing, a research professor at Georgetown University. Several studies showed Medicaid expansion reduced premiums by 2 percent to 7 percent, while a study in New Hampshire actually showed an increase in premiums after Medicaid expansion. JP Wieske, deputy commissioner of the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, called it ""total poppycock"" to claim that Medicaid decisions drove the difference between Wisconsin and Minnesota premiums. He said Medicaid would be ""very far down"" the list of factors affecting Wisconsin health care premiums. ""I’m not sure it would be top three or five,"" Wieske said. Other factors in premium determination include reinsurance, risk pool differences and competition between insurers and providers, said Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute in Washington, D.C. She said the amount attributable to Medicaid is ""likely to be small relative to the other factors."" Sabrina Corlette, another research professor at Georgetown University, said the ad over-reaches and oversimplifies by comparing two states based primarily on the Medicaid distinction. ""It is just challenging to draw hard and fast conclusions when you’re just comparing one state to another, because states can have very different policy and market dynamics,"" she said. Minnesota’s health care system has a unique history that includes a state-run high risk pool (for the most costly patients) that dates to the 1970s and MinnesotaCare, which at the time of the Medicaid expansion already covered many people who became eligible, said Jim Schowalter, chief executive of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans. So Medicaid expansion had a different impact in Minnesota than Wisconsin. ""It’s an apples and oranges comparison because of the different programs and eligibility,"" Schowalter said. Corlette said it’s fair to note, though, that Minnesota has been more proactive than most states about addressing health care costs. ""Minnesota has really leaned in, and where there are policy levers available to try and keep people covered, get rates lower, make the marketplace run smoothly, they have taken advantage of those,"" she said. ""I think that’s fair to say about Minnesota and its political leadership."" Sam Lau, a spokesman for Evers’ campaign, said the ad was drawing a distinction between the states’ leadership. ""In contrast to Scott Walker's inaction, there are numerous decisions and changes Minnesota made to lower its health care costs, and now in 2018, average health costs in Wisconsin are nearly 50% higher than in Minnesota,"" he said. ""Health care policy is complex, but despite its complexities, health care costs can be lowered."" Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg said the ad actually makes the case for Walker’s record on health care. Walker pushed for a reinsurance program for Wisconsin, which will be in effect for next year. The plan, called the Health Care Stability Plan, is projected to lower premiums by 10 percent compared to what they would have been and takes effect in January, according to the insurance commissioner office. It is funded by $166 million in federal money and $34 million in state dollars. The 50 percent gap in premium costs only developed this year after Minnesota implemented reinsurance. In 2017, Wisconsin actually had lower premiums than Minnesota — $368 compared to $412. But Wisconsin’s premiums jumped to $569 in 2018 as insurers raised rates after losing $500 million in the Wisconsin marketplace from 2014 to 2017, said Elizabeth Hizmi, spokeswoman for the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance. Some insurers reduced coverage areas and others left the Wisconsin market altogether. Meanwhile, Minnesota’s rates stayed consistent as the state instituted reinsurance. Under that program, the state paid a portion of medical expenses for insurers beyond $50,000 and until $250,000, meaning insurers took on less risk from the sickest people and could offer lower overall rates. ""Our premiums today have everything to do with reinsurance,"" Schowalter said. Evers’ ad is built around the claim that Wisconsin premiums are 50 percent higher than Minnesota’s, but it goes astray on several fronts. The ad attributes the figure to ""Wisconsin families,"" when it comes from an analysis that looks at the premium cost for a 40-year-old individual in each county. And while the ad notes Minnesota ""made changes,"" the framing of the issue — starting with Walker’s rejection of the funds and ending with the difference in health care costs — leaves viewers with the impression that Walker’s decision is the sole, or at least a primary reason, the states have such different premiums. Experts say that’s not correct. Several other policies and market dynamics play a more significant role than Medicaid in determining premiums. Furthermore, differences in the health insurance markets between Wisconsin and Minnesota make simplistic comparisons between the states unreasonable. The ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.","[('YouTube,\xa0Tony Evers for Governor, ""Who.""
