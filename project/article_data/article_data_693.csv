Florida elections chief says we had ""record"" turnout
","
A few days after the election, a CNN reporter asked Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner about long lines and other problems Florida had on Election Day: ""How could this happen in 2012 in a state in the United States, that people would wait six hours and many would just abandon and not vote at all?""

Detzner responded that there were two reasons for the long lines. First, Florida had a long ballot -- 11 constitutional amendments and in Miami-Dade, a slew of local amendments -- on top of the presidential election and local races.

Second, he said, turnout ""was unprecedented. It was a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history."" Detzner identified some other issues throughout the interview, including that elections offices need to have sufficient equipment and the state needs more early voting locations.

Was the Nov. 6, 2012, election in Florida a ""record"" for overall turnout? And did Florida also break a record of pre-election day voting?

In mid-December, Detzner plans to make a fact-finding trip to five counties that had some long lines and other election problems, including Miami-Dade, where voters stood in line for as long as seven hours. Broward is also on that list -- the county found 963 ballots after Election Day, but the supervisor said that they weren’t actually ""lost.""

Detzner will begin his road trip in Tampa, which performed well, as a benchmark before he visits the counties that had problems.

Overall turnout 
Florida’s general election turnout was about 71.2 percent. 
This was no record. Statistics starting in 1954 show Florida general election turnout exceeded 71.2 percent 11 times: 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008. The highest general election turnout was 83 percent in 1992 when Bill Clinton won his first presidential race.

""Relatively speaking, Florida in 2012 moved backward when it came to voting,"" the Miami Herald wrote after the election.

Detzner was referring to the sheer number of voters -- 8,491,920 -- not the percentage of voters who participated, said Chris Cate, Florida Department of State spokesman. That’s the highest number of voters who have ever participated.

Cate said that ""more total people cast a ballot, early or not, in this election than any previous Florida election."" Looking at 1992 -- the year that had record-high turn-out -- Cate noted that about 5.3 million Floridians cast a ballot, which is about three million fewer than November 2012. 
This growth in the number of voters makes sense considering Florida's population growth. We looked up the numbers and found the state population was 13.7 million in 1992 but grew to 19 million in 2011 (the most recent data available). 
Early voting and absentee

Florida began offering absentee ballots to everyone -- not just those who could prove they were out of town or in the military -- in 2002. The state began offering early voting in 2004.

Let’s look at the breakdown for the types of votes cast in presidential general elections since the start of early voting:
  
Source: Florida Division of Elections (Note: Total reflects certified results.)

In 2012, about 4.77 million Floridians cast ballots early or absentee, more than either 2008 or 2004. There was also a huge increase -- more than 1 million -- in early voting between 2004 and Barack Obama’s first presidential victory in 2008. Despite those large increases in early voting, a Republican-led state Legislature voted in 2011 to cut back the number of days for early voting. Republican Gov. Rick Scott refused to extend early voting in 2012.

In response to the state’s decision to reduce early voting days, the Obama campaign encouraged supporters to vote with absentee ballots, which are typically mailed in but can also be dropped off in person at the supervisor of elections office.

Detzner’s focus on sheer numbers rather than percentage

We sent Detzner’s claim to several political science professors who study elections and asked whether it is more relevant to compare turnout percentages or raw numbers, particularly when examining why we had election problems and how to fix them.

""In the end, it is the total number of people that show up that creates the lines and counting delays, not the percentage,"" University of Central Florida professor Aubrey Jewett wrote in an email to PolitiFact Florida.

Given that state and local officials knew that record numbers of people had registered, they should have been prepared for record numbers of voters, Jewett said. ""I shudder to think what things might have looked like if we actually had a record turnout percent this past election!""

Our experts also said turnout numbers shouldn’t be used as an excuse for the long lines. The state Legislature was responsible for reducing early voting days, limiting early voting locations and for placing 11 amendments on the ballot. And decisions by local officials about spending, training, equipment and staffing also contributed to problems.

""Overall, there is plenty of blame to go around for our voting problems at both the state and local level,"" Jewett said.

Steven Tauber, a government professor at the University of South Florida, told PolitiFact Florida that he saw three main reasons for the long lines: ""The primary reason is that the state was unprepared for the volume of voters, and they should have been. Clearly, the state did not provide enough resources to handle the election. The second point is that for no good reason, the state cut back on early voting. The third reason is that the state legislature unnecessarily loaded the ballot with needless, wordy amendments (most of which lost) that lengthened the amount of time it took people to vote.""

Susan MacManus, a University of Southern Florida professor, said that the more relevant information is what happened on a local level, in the counties that had the long lines or problems. ""I don’t ever like to use aggregate statewide figures when you have concentrated areas of problems,"" she said.

But turnout figures don’t provide much of a window on the problems in South Florida.

In the state’s largest county in Miami-Dade, turnout dropped from about 70 percent in 2008 to about 67.6 percent in 2012. The number of voters increased slightly by about 16,000. In addition to the long ballot, the county faced a series of other problems that contributed to the lines, including a shortage of temporary workers and equipment, and the county’s decision to delay a plan to redraw precincts to avoid huge crowds where the population had swelled.

Broward had an even bigger dip in turnout percentage but a similar increase in voters -- and again, that doesn’t explain problems, such as finding 963 ballots in the elections warehouse after Election Day.

Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes told the Sun-Sentinel that her office ""got thrown off its game"" with a lawsuit that allowed in-person absentee voting the Sunday and Monday before Election Day, days that were meant to prepare precincts and tabulate absentee ballots.""

Our ruling

As he was grilled about Florida’s long lines, Detzner said, ""The turnout was unprecedented. It was a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history.""

He’s right that the sheer number of voters was a record, at 8.5 million. Also, he's right that more people ""than ever before"" voted early or absentee. 
But it was not the highest turnout by percentage. At 71 percent, 2012 marked the 12th highest turnout since 1954.

"['Georgia', 'LGBTQ', 'Marriage', 'Alex Wan']","
Claim about size of Atlanta's gay population has some merit
","
The ongoing national debate about same-sex marriage recently reached the court of opinion inside Atlanta City Hall.

Alex Wan, an openly gay Atlanta city councilman serving his first term, introduced legislation during the City Council’s last meeting of 2012 declaring support for marriage equality.

Wan’s nonbinding resolution contained several pieces of information to back up his argument. We thought one statement in particular would be interesting to fact-check.

""The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities,"" it read.

Atlanta has long been perceived to have one of the largest LGBT populations in the South, if not the nation. An annual LGBT pride festival draws an estimated 200,000 people. Several intown neighborhoods have businesses that market heavily to the LGBT community. Mayoral candidates actively courted LGBT voters during the 2009 campaign. Wan’s resolution passed by an 11-2 vote.

Wan’s resolution may have little sway across the street from City Hall among lawmakers who work in the state Capitol. In 2004, 76 percent of Georgia voters backed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The councilman recognized that obstacle, but believes the tide is shifting nationally on the issue and wanted Atlanta to be on the forefront. Wan said he’s unaware of any other Georgia cities that have passed a similar resolution.

""We should be one of the first voices to that dialogue because of the sheer number (of LGBT residents in the city),"" Wan said in a telephone interview.

Wan added that he has been with his partner for more than seven years and said it ""seemed inconsistent to me"" that they’ve made such a commitment but can’t have it legally recognized by the state.

The issue is somewhat thorny inside City Hall. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been criticized by some LGBT activists for not fully supporting same-sex marriage. Reed, who as a state lawmaker successfully passed a hate crimes bill to protect gays and other groups, has said he respects the council’s vote on the resolution. Wan said he didn’t intend to pressure Reed by introducing the resolution and hopes the mayor will soon ""reach the same conclusion"" on same-sex marriage.

Wan said he based the claim about Atlanta off information from the online library Wikipedia. The Wikipedia link used a chart that was published in 2006 in The Seattle Times. The chart read Atlanta ranked third, with 12.8 percent of its population as LGBT. The sources for the chart were the U.S. Census Bureau and the Williams Institute, which conducts research on sexual orientation, gender identity law and public policy.

The U.S. Census Bureau tracked the number of same-sex couples (it does not attempt to determine sexual orientation) by county in 2010. Among counties with 50 or more same-sex couples, DeKalb County was first in Georgia and 10th nationwide with about 15 same-sex couples per 1,000. Fulton County was second in Georgia and ranked 21st in the U.S. with nearly 12 same-sex couples per 1,000.

According to another website, City-Data, Atlanta ranked 32nd in the percentage of same-sex unmarried households. If you narrow it down to cities with overall populations greater than 100,000, Atlanta ranked sixth in the percentage of same-sex unmarried households. The list does not indicate when it was compiled, but the numbers were pretty similar to the most recent U.S. census data.

PolitiFact Georgia reviewed 2011 U.S. census data, and it showed the percentage of same-sex unmarried households in Atlanta was 1.6 percent. Atlanta’s percentage was lower than San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Oakland, Calif., Seattle and Santa Fe, N.M. Of those cities, Seattle is the only one in a state that recognizes same-sex marriages, and their law was passed last month.

To sum up, Councilman Wan said Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita and ranks third nationally. From what we can determine from U.S. census and other data, it’s valid to state Atlanta has one of the highest LGBT populations in the country.

It’s less clear that Atlanta ranks third nationally because there’s not much current data detailing the percentage of all LGBT residents by city. Atlanta ranks below more than at least five cities when it comes to same-sex, unmarried households.

The first part of Wan’s claim appears accurate. But even these numbers are open to interpretation. It appears Atlanta is a little lower than third in the other part of the claim.

Overall, Wan’s statement is probably accurate, but it needs a lot of context.

We rate it: Half True.","[('\nAtlanta City Council resolution 1813, passed on Dec. 3, 2012.\n\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution, ""In Georgia, Obama\'s stance on gay marriage draws ire, cheers,"" May 9, 2012.', 'https://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/in-georgia-obamas-stance-on-gay-marriage-draws-ire/nQThn/'), ('\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution Political Insider, ""Kasim Reed and his same-sex marriage dilemma,"" June 8, 2012.', 'No link'), ('\nCity-Data statistics on same-sex households.', 'http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2012/06/08/kasim-reed-and-his-same-sex-marriage-dilemma/'), ('\nEmail from City of Atlanta communications director Sonji Jacobs, Dec. 6, 2012.', 'No link'), ('\nSeattle Times, ""12.9% in Seattle are gay or bisexual, second only to S.F., study says,"" Nov. 15, 2006.', 'http://www.city-data.com/top2/c11.html'), ('\nTelephone interview with Councilman Alex Wan, Dec. 6, 2012.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau 2010 data on same-sex couples in Georgia.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2012/dec/07/alex-wan/claim-about-size-atlantas-gay-population-has-some-/

Mike DeWine says abuse of bath salts led man to make bizarre claim about racoons
","
Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine recently told some disturbing and odd stories about bath salts – an emerging drug that he said is a growing problem in Ohio.

The stories were part of DeWine’s announcement last month that his office will target bath salts in its ongoing fight against drugs.

Bath salts and other synthetic drugs have a tendency to induce violent and paranoid behavior, said DeWine, the state’s top law enforcement officer.

One example DeWine, a Republican, gave involved a man having hallucinations of raccoons in his house.

""The Ohio State Highway Patrol confronted a man who after using bath salts reported that raccoons had set fire inside his home and stolen his cell phone. He proceeded to chop up his deck with a hatchet while looking for the fire-setting raccoons,"" DeWine said.

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity going, so it decided to look into the facts behind the bizarre tale. Examining the statement might provide useful information to people unfamiliar with the drug and its effects.

When we called DeWine’s office for information to back up his account, spokesman Dan Tierney provided an Ohio State Highway Patrol study to educate the law enforcement community about bath salts.

Bath salts, which became illegal in Ohio in 2011, are a synthetic drug that can be snorted, injected or mixed with a fluid to drink. Users have said the drug gives an intense high and a rush similar to cocaine, according to the highway patrol study, which was completed in May. Others have described users as violent, unpredictable and paranoid.

The study includes a short description of the raccoon event DeWine described – along with five other incidents involving bath salts – but it doesn’t provide any details about the time, place and people involved. We called the highway patrol and were told the incident happened in Reynoldsburg, near Columbus. The police department there provided a report with written accounts from three responding officers.

The police report includes a transcript of the 911 call in August 2011 from the 31-year-old Reynoldsburg man who was seeing raccoons:

""I got raccoons in my house that are starting fires. I wonder how the hell they are doing it,"" he said. ""I keep putting them out but they start another one. I had to drive down here because I couldn’t find my cell phone. I think one of them took it and did something with it.""

The report also said the man told police he took bath salts three times that day and could be hallucinating. A local fire department determined there were no fires inside the house.

One of the officers noticed the deck at the house was destroyed and there was a hatchet nearby. The man told police he chopped up the deck because he was looking for a dead raccoon.

So where does that leave us?

DeWine’s account at the press conference last month was backed up by the Reynoldsburg police report. His only misstep was saying state patrolmen confronted the man. The mistake is immaterial because it doesn’t change the circumstances of the incident and the role of bath salts, according to police.

The Reynoldsburg man, for what it’s worth, eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of making false alarms.

DeWine’s statement is accurate and there is nothing significant missing. That rates True on the Truth-O-Meter.","[('\nOhio Capital Blog, ""DeWine Drug Crackdown 1 of 7,"" Nov. 14, 2012\n\nAttorney General Mike DeWine, news release ""Attorney General DeWine announces new efforts to fight synthetic drugs,"" Nov. 14, 2012\n\nOhio State Highway Patrol, Critical Information and Communication Center, Awareness: Bath Salts and Officer Safety, May 29, 2012\n\nReynoldsburg Police Department, police report, Aug. 28, 2011\xa0\n\nPhone and e-mail correspondence with DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney, Nov. 27, 2012\xa0', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTIXnbVb0YE&list=UUagNNeUgJmb-Zca97t7Ro2w&index=42&feature=plcp')]",/factchecks/2012/dec/07/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-says-abuse-bath-salts-led-man-make-biz/
"['Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Todd Hunter']","
Todd Hunter says Obamacare funded by real estate taxes
","
A South Texas legislator opposed to the federal health care overhaul signed into law by President Barack Obama doesn’t like how the law came to be.

State Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, was asked during a Nov. 26, 2012, Texas Tribune event what he favors in state health care reform.

Hunter replied: ""The first thing I prefer is transparency,"" adding that in his view, doctors, nurses and the people weren’t included in writing the federal act.

""And when you have amendments where Nebraska gets exempted from the taxation and then today we’re finding out you have real estate taxes being placed to pay for this?"" Hunter said. ""Actually, the biggest problem is how it was handled,"" Hunter said.

First, let’s weigh the Nebraska exception. By email, Hunter told us he was referring to the so-called ""Cornhusker Kickback,"" which was a 2009 deal resulting in the Senate-approved version of the health care act giving Nebraska added federal Medicaid funds, as recapped by FactCheck.org in a December 2011 review. At the time the amendment was accepted, U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, declared he would vote for the overall proposal.

However, the Nebraska provision was removed before the legislation passed into law, FactCheck noted. In turn, ""all states ended up with more federal funds, and they may well have Nelson to thank for it,"" FactCheck wrote.  

By phone, Hunter told us he had not said that the Nebraska amendment stuck in the plan because he didn’t know whether it did. He said he mentioned the amendment to demonstrate the deal-making that went on.

In any event, his Nebraska reference could be taken as vague. 
So we’re focusing this fact-check on whether real estate taxes were put in place to fund Obamacare.

Hunter pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2012, Forbes.com blog post by Michael Chamberlain, a personal financial planner. Headlined ""Will You Pay the New Obamacare Tax,"" the post says a surtax in the law means couples with incomes over $250,000 a year and singles earning more than $200,000 could see their taxes increase in 2013.

He also nudged us to an undated publication on the tax from the National Association of Realtors, which says in part that the ""tax WILL NOT be imposed on all real estate transactions, a common misconception.""

Indeed. 
In February 2011, PolitiFact debunked a claim that under Obamacare, all real-estate transactions would be subject to a 3.8 percent sales tax. That statement, rated Pants on Fire, is deceptive because a Medicare tax on investment income created under the law applies to the investment income of single taxpayers who make more than $200,000 or couples who make more than $250,000. (It’s spelled out in Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled ""Unearned income Medicare contribution."")

That seems worth stressing. The tax would only apply to very high earners, accounting for no more than 2 percent of taxpayers, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Tax Policy Center, told us by telephone. For them, he noted, the tax would apply to the lesser of how much the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds the $200,000/$250,000 threshold or the amount that their investment gains exceeds the relevant threshold.

And which investments might be subjected to the tax?

According to the Internal Revenue Service, the Net Investment Income Tax applies, starting in 2013, to investment income for those very high earners from interest, dividends, capital gains, rental and royalty income and certain annuities plus income from businesses involved in trading financial instruments or commodities and businesses that are ""passive activities to the taxpayer,"" meaning they're held for the purposes of gradual long-term appreciation.

Williams said he calls the tax an investment tax. ""When somebody says ‘real estate tax’ to me, I don’t think of the capital gains tax on real estate sales. I think of the property tax"" levied by local and state governments. ""This"" new tax ""has nothing to do with property taxes,"" Williams said.

Separately, a director for the Washington-based Tax Foundation, which says it seeks sound tax policy, said the group does not call the tax a real estate tax. Joe Henchman said by phone: ""I imagine calling it a real estate tax could scare a lot of people, unnecessarily. Everyone is going to think it applies to them when 99 times out of 100, it won’t.""

While few property owners would be affected in the tax’s early years, the foundation said in a Sept. 24, 2010, blog post that more home sellers could be hit as years pass because the tax changes were not indexed for inflation.
   
PolitiFact has previously pointed out that homeowners will not be socked by the tax even if they make sales profits of hundreds of thousands of dollars. That’s because there’s a long-standing tax exemption on the profits from home sales. To be hit with the investment tax, you would have to clear more than $250,000 in profit off your home, which means at least $250,000 more than you paid for it. The ceiling is higher for a married couple. Married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit from home sales. And again, that's profit, not the sales price.

Finally, we wondered how much total revenue the tax is expected to produce. Williams suggested we consider research by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which assists members of Congress on tax policy. The panel’s March 20, 2010, fiscal analysis of the health care law says that combined with a change in law stepping up payroll tax contributions by high-income taxpayers, the investment tax is expected to raise $210 billion from 2010 through 2019, a little under half of $438 billion in net revenue attributed to the overall law. 
Hunter later said he didn’t intend to scare anybody with his comment. ""We do need to make sure folks know how complicated this deal is,"" Hunter said.

Our ruling

Hunter said real estate taxes were put in place to pay for Obamacare.

That’s an incomplete characterization, potentially leaving the misimpression we’ll all be ponying up every time we sell a property. In reality, the tax helping to fund the health care law is an investment tax solely affecting the very wealthiest taxpayers and then only touched off by super-sized profits from any of a variety of investment types.

Real estate (including rents) fits into the big mix, giving the claim an element of truth. We rate it as Mostly False.","[('\nTelephone interviews, Todd Hunter, Corpus Christi, Dec. 5 and 7, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Roberton Williams, senior fellow, Tax Policy Center, Washington, Dec. 7, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Joe Henchman, vice president for legal projects, the Tax Foundation, Washington, Dec. 7, 2012\n\nBlog post, ""Would \'ObamaCare\' (Health Care Reform) Tax the Sale of Your Home?

Alan Grayson says more Walmart employees on Medicaid, food stamps than other companies
","
Leave it to Alan ""Congressman with Guts"" Grayson to get a security escort from Walmart on Thanksgiving.

Grayson, who returns to Congress next year after losing his old seat in 2010, ditched his family on Thanksgiving to hand out turkey sandwiches to employees of an Orlando-area Walmart.

Amid employee walkouts across the country, Grayson approached workers with his turkey tidings and told them about their right to join a union.

Walmart employees are paid so little, he argued, they often seek government programs for help.

""In state after state, the largest group of Medicaid recipients is Walmart employees. I'm sure that the same thing is true of food stamp recipients. Each Walmart ‘associate’ costs the taxpayers an average of more than $1,000 in public assistance,"" Grayson wrote in a Huffington Post column on Nov. 24, 2012.

He doubled down in a subsequent interview with The Young Turks show on Current TV, saying Walmart employees represent ""the largest group of food stamp recipients.""

Democrats and labor unions have long been critical of the non-union retailer and have recently been emphasizing that its low wages end up costing government because workers seek food stamps and other aid. (""Wal-Mart"" is the corporation. ""Walmart"" is a store.)

We wondered if Grayson was right that the chain's impact was that large, so we dug into the numbers.

Largest group of Medicaid recipients?

Newspapers, lawmakers and liberal policy groups for years have analyzed which companies have large numbers of employees that seek public health insurance assistance.

In nearly all 24 states in which a study was completed, Grayson’s point proved accurate, according to a list from Good Jobs First, a labor-funded group that has criticized government support for Wal-Mart.

We should note not every study examined Medicaid, the joint state-federal partnership that insures the poor and disabled. Many reports focused on state-run programs aimed at people with low-paying jobs who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t make enough to provide insurance their families (these are often called SCHIP).

Philip Mattera, Good Jobs First research director, pointed to two simple reasons for it: Wal-Mart pays relatively low wages and is the biggest employer in the country.

Here's a sampling:

In Florida, Wal-Mart topped all companies operating in Florida with the largest number of employees and family members (12,300) eligible for Medicaid, according to a 2005 Tampa Bay Times story. Wal-Mart also ranked highly (No. 2) for dependents enrolled in Florida Healthy Kids or KidCare, trailing Miami-Dade County employees.

In Missouri, where Wal-Mart is the largest employer behind state government, the state’s social services department determined Walmart employees outnumbered all others with employees and family members enrolled in MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid plan, in the first quarter of 2011. However, at almost 14 percent, it did not represent the highest percentage of workers enrolled or responsible for an enrollee (Dollar General, for instance, was much higher at 42 percent).

And in Pennsylvania, a 2006 Philadelphia Inquirer investigation revealed the company had the highest percentage of employees enrolled in Medicaid. One in six of Walmart’s 48,000 Pennsylvania employees were enrolled in Medicaid, costing the state about $15 million a year (it’s likely higher because the Inquirer’s story did not cover employees’ dependents on Medicaid, or any other public assistance such as food stamps).

There was at least one exception on Good Jobs First’s list. In Vermont in 2005, Wal-Mart placed fourth of companies with employees and families enrolled in Medicaid, trailing Price Chopper, McDonald’s and Hannaford, according to Good Jobs First, which cited a 2005 Vermont Guardian report.

As labor groups pushed states to consider laws that would make Wal-Mart and companies like it pay more for employee health benefits, the New York Times reported on a 2005 internal memo from a Wal-Mart executive that showed the company knew a ""significant number of associates and their children who receive health insurance through public insurance programs.""

The memo from Susan Chambers, Wal-Mart's executive vice president for benefits, said 5 percent of Walmart associates were on Medicaid compared to an average of national employers of 4 percent. In sum, she wrote, 46 percent of associates’ children were either on Medicaid or uninsured. Her memo did not address employees on food stamps.

""On both of these issues – affordability and public assistance – it is important to note that our offering and performance are on par with other retailers,"" Chambers wrote. ""Wal-Mart’s critics, however, hold it to a ‘large company’ standard, not a retailer standard.""

She continued: ""Despite the difference in industry economics, critics believe we should behave more like a GM or a Microsoft than a Target or a Sears.""

So on Medicaid, the sampling of states shows Grayson’s assessment of this happening in ""state after state"" is accurate. 
Largest group for food stamp recipients?

There’s no national tally of where food stamp recipients work.

A handful of researchers and reporters have mined state data for Walmart employees on food stamps, though not as frequently as the Medicaid studies.

In Ohio, the  state Department of Job and Family Services report found Wal-Mart to be the state’s top employer for workers and family members who receive Medicaid (16,098), food stamps (14,799) and cash assistance (803), according to January 2012 numbers. A state spokesman cautioned the report does not tell the difference between full- and part-time employees, or employees who do not yet qualify for benefits, or why employees sought Medicaid.

In Maine, Wal-Mart topped employers with the largest number of workers on MaineCare, food stamps and temporary cash assistance, according to a 2005 Lewiston Sun Journal report, but it did not break down how many employees receive each subsidy. The company was fourth in the percentage of employees on public assistance.

In Florida, 1.9 million households receive food stamps, and nearly 500,000 have earned income as of October 2012. Of those with earned income, 9,095 households get paychecks from Wal-Mart, according to a report prepared for PolitiFact by the state Department of Children and Families.

The Florida taxpayer tab for their food stamps: $2.6 million.

DCF cannot determine how this bill compares to other Florida employers. The employer data field in DCF’s database is not mandatory and is usually filled in by hand. That leads to a lot of different entries for the same workplace (Wallmart, Wall mart, Wal-mart, Walmart, etc), making it difficult to draw conclusions about all employers.

Grayson cited a figure circulated by the liberal Daily Kos that  ""as many as 80 percent of workers in Wal-Mart stores using food stamps."" (We couldn't find a study that backs up that number, but did find it was mentioned as an anecdote.)

Grayson could not provide solid evidence to us that he was right, but he said it was accurate largely because Walmart is simply such a big company.

""Walmart is the largest private employer in the country, by a substantial margin,"" Grayson wrote. ""Even if 100 percent of the employees of the second largest employer were on food stamps – an unlikely scenario, to say the least – Walmart employees would still be the largest group.""

He added: ""Given the similarity between qualification rules for Medicaid and food stamps, if Walmart is #1 in a state for Medicaid, it’s very likely that it is #1 for food stamps, too.""

Here, too, there is support for Grayson's point, but it is not conclusive.

$1,000?

There's less factual support for this aspect of Grayson's claim. We found the data is eight years old.

Grayson’s spokesman cited a 2004 study called the ""Hidden Cost of Wal-Mart Jobs"" by the University of California Berkeley’s Labor Center. The study, which Wal-Mart has criticized, analyzed Walmart employees’ use of safety net programs in California.

The researchers found taxpayers paid $86 million a year to subsidize Walmart workers’ wages -- $32 million for health programs and $54 million in other assistance. (""Other assistance"" could be food stamps, subsidized housing and school lunches, and use of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a tax credit for low- to moderate-income workers.)

The average taxpayer bill per employee was $730 for health expenses and $1,222 for other expenses, researchers found. The totals for other large California retailers totaled $521 for health and $880 for other.

Also widely cited by the anti-Walmart contingent is a 2004 Democratic U.S. House committee report that examined the company’s record on many issues, including public subsidizing of employees’ wages. A 200-person Walmart store could require $420,750 in tax dollars for employee assistance a year, working out to $2,103 per worker, according to the Democratic Staff of the Committee on Education and the Workforce report.

Walmart does not dispute that many of its employees receive public health assistance. But company spokesman Kory Lundberg criticized Grayson citing the Berkeley study, saying, ""They’re pointing out data that’s at least seven to eight years old.""

Plus, he said, it’s expected the company would top such lists because its employs the most people.

And even though just over half of its employees take the company health care plan, Lundberg said, workers often have other options for health insurance, including from the military, Medicare, or a parent’s or spouse’s plan.

Our ruling

Grayson's claim about Wal-Mart employees on Medicaid and food stamps has support from several reports, although it's worth noting that some of them come from Democratic or labor-funded groups that are critical of Wal-Mart.
   
Comprehensive figures are not available, but we did find considerable evidence that echoes Grayson’s point about employee dependence on public health assistance in several states. His claim about Walmart employees on food stamps is not as substantiated, but we did not find any substantial evidence that contradicted his point.

His claim about the $1,000 cost has the least support because it's based on two studies that are eight years old. 
Also, the presence of Wal-Mart at the top of the list is not necessarily unexpected given its size and the nature of wages for retailing. 
On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.","[('\nPolitiFact Ohio, ""Rep.

"['New Jersey', 'Transportation', 'Michael Doherty']","
Sen. Michael Doherty says state report confirms red-light cameras lead to ""more accidents, more injuries and greater cost""
","
More accidents, more injuries, more costs.

As state Sen. Michael Doherty sees it, those are the results confirmed by a new state report into New Jersey’s red-light camera program. Pointing to that evidence, the Warren County Republican called for ending the camera use in a Nov. 28 op-ed on NorthJersey.com.

The report from the state Department of Transportation, Doherty wrote, ""confirms"" that red-light cameras ""lead to more accidents, more injuries and greater cost.""

Doherty’s claim is solid as far as the report’s overall findings for the 24 intersections where red-light cameras had been recording violations for at least a full year by the end of 2011.

But the senator failed to mention how the report shows a reduction in total crashes and costs at the two locations with two years of data. Also, the report contains repeated warnings to not draw final conclusions about the program, as Doherty appears to have done.

Doherty told us he stands by his statements.

""There should be little surprise that government bureaucrats don't want us to draw the obvious conclusions that are supported by the data they hoped would remain hidden in an obscure report,"" the senator said in an e-mail.

Under the five-year pilot program, which officially began in December 2009, traffic control monitoring systems produce images of vehicles running red lights, which are reviewed by law enforcement officials to see if a violation occurred.

As compared with the year before the cameras were installed, total crashes at those 24 intersections increased from 577 to 582, or about 0.9 percent, and crash severity costs increased by an estimated $1,172,800, the report states. Those costs include vehicle damage and repair, medical care and even funeral expenses, according to the report.

But the report also points out how there has been an overall reduction in crashes and costs at the two locations -- both in Newark -- where cameras had been operational for two full years.

Comparing the second year of operation to the year before installation, the combined effect at those two locations has been a reduction in total crashes from 47 to 20, or about 57 percent, according to the report. At those locations, total estimated crash severity costs have decreased by $268,900, the report states.

When comparing the first and second years of camera use at those intersections, total crashes dropped from 26 to 20, or about 23 percent, and there was a net reduction in crash severity costs of $119,900, the report states.

Doherty pointed out how the total number of right-angle and rear-end crashes at those two intersections only dropped from 9 to 8 between the first and second years of camera operation. The senator referred to that reduction as ""a statistically insignificant decline.""

""There is no evidence that the massive safety gains that we were told to expect have appeared or are likely to appear if the red light pilot program is allowed to continue,"" Doherty added.

But the state report repeatedly cautions readers to not draw final conclusions, and notes how many other locations had not been involved in the program long enough to be included in the crash analyses.

Of the analysis regarding those 24 locations, the report says, ""it is important to remember that safety trends are never established over a single year, and as such additional sustained analysis is needed before concrete conclusions can be drawn.""

Our ruling

In an op-ed, Doherty claimed a new state report ""confirms"" that red-light cameras ""lead to more accidents, more injuries and greater cost.""

The senator’s claim accurately reflects the overall findings at the 24 locations where cameras had been operational for at least a full year by the end of 2011. But Doherty failed to mention how there’s been a overall reduction in crashes and costs at the two locations with two years of data.

Also, Doherty doesn’t heed the report’s repeated warnings to not draw any final conclusions.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Poverty', 'Anne Goodman']","
Cleveland Foodbank exec Anne Goodman says food stamp growth lagged the rise in unemployment
","
Mention food stamps in a mixed political crowd and you’ll get a full buffet of opinions -- starchy, sugary, wilted and done to a turn -- about the people who use them.

Exhibit A is the array of reader comments on Cleveland.com after a story there, and in The Plain Dealer on Dec. 3, described efforts in Congress to cut the federal food safety net.

Sorry, but you’ll get no dish here about the habits or consumption patterns of Americans using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP (now delivered in the form of an electronic card rather than with stamps or coupons). Instead, PolitiFact Ohio is using this as an opportunity to revisit a claim from the food stamp story, made by Anne Goodman, president and CEO of the Cleveland Foodbank. The food bank provides food for 450 meal sites, shelters and pantries, whose clients include Ohioans on SNAP whose food budgets run out before the end of each month.

Goodman said that while national SNAP enrollment grew by 70 percent between 2007 and 2011, unemployment jumped by a much higher rate, 94 percent. That shows, she said, ""that SNAP is working as it was intended. It was designed to ensure that families have food when they need a helping hand.""

PolitiFact Ohio was curious about those figures. Did food stamp growth really lag unemployment as the economy turned sour.

A cursory look at labor statistics showed she was in the ballpark. But the data, and thus the rhetoric, can change depending on the months reported or even the dates when the data is released, so we asked for more.

Goodman provided three sources of information.

The first was the latest SNAP Annual Summary from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs SNAP. The summary provided data from 2007 to 2011, a five year window that includes pre-recession data for a baseline and carries into recovery. 2011 also is the most current year for which statistics are available.

The summary shows annual participation, measured in fiscal years. In 2007, there were 26.316 million individual SNAP recipients. In 2011, there were 44.709 million.

That comes to a growth rate of 69.89 percent. With almost no rounding, that’s the same as 70 percent. So Goodman was accurate on that figure.

We should note that these are annual averages. As the article in The Plain Dealer on food stamps said Dec. 3, participation was as high as 47.1 million at one point, in August, 2011. That figure came from another Agriculture Department set of data, tracking SNAP participation by the month.

The second source that Goodman sent us was a set of U.S. Census Bureau data on economic characteristics of Americans. This was from the bureau’s American Community Survey, and it estimated the percentage of individuals on food stamps was 7.7 percent in 2007, and 13 percent in 2011.

That’s a 68.8 percent growth rate, or 1 percent lower than the figure from the Agriculture Department. The difference is likely due to a difference in methodology: The census asks questions of households, and the Agriculture Department has actual figures from the food stamp program, since it runs it. With the numbers so close, it makes little difference here.

So Goodman’s numbers were good on food stamp growth. But what about unemployment growth?

That leads to the third set of data she cited, this from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau, a division of the Labor Department, tracks the number and percentage of people in the workforce who are unemployed.

In 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.6 percent.

In 2011, it was 8.9 percent.

That’s a 93.48 percent rise. Goodman put it at 94 percent -- within a percentage point of the actual figure. We checked BLS data using a different table -- the government agency allows you to use its information in different formats -- and got the same result as Goodman.

These, too, were annual averages, and some months were higher, some lower. If you were to pick certain months in those years to find high and low points, you could show an even bigger leap in unemployment -- as high as the 105 percent rise between May 2007 and May 2011. But by using the more conservative annual average, it becomes clear that Goodman did not cherry pick the data to show extremes.

Her comments to The Plain Dealer, and an op-ed column on food aid that she wrote for the newspaper on Dec. 2, were not the first time these numbers have been cited. Goodman mentioned them when she appeared before the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee on March 7 to discuss the need for food assistance.

And Feeding America, a national charity, has cited them in its materials.

Goodman’s figures check out entirely.

"['Rhode Island', 'Elections', 'Unions', 'Mark S. Zaccaria']","
R.I. GOP Chairman Mark Zaccaria says public employees make up 25 percent of state workforce
","
Mark Zaccaria, the outgoing chairman of Rhode Island’s Republican Party, was on WJAR-Channel 10’s ""News Conference"" program recently, commenting on the hard time the state party had in legislative races this year.

Though Republicans recently have had a strong record of success in winning the governor’s office -- the Democrats have held it for just 4 of the last 28 years -- the Grand Old Party took a beating in state House and Senate races in November, dropping from 18 Republicans out of a 113-member General Assembly in 2010 to 11 in the session that will begin in January.

Zaccaria said the party’s poor showing was due in part to structural advantages he said the Rhode Island Democratic Party has developed over the years, particularly support from state and local government employees and their unions.

""If you add the members of the teachers unions, if you add the other public service employees all around the state that are municipally based,"" he said, ""it comes to something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island.""

Now, we can’t determine whether drawing a state or local government paycheck guarantees how someone might vote. But we did wonder whether Zaccaria’s calculation was correct.

When we asked him for his source, Zaccaria said he’d been using the 25-percent estimate since he ran for Congress in 2010. He said he’d done research to justify the figure, but after two years couldn’t recall the specific source of the statistic.

So we went to the website of the Department of Labor and Training, which tracks the number of jobs in the state month by month and year by year. According to its October 2012 report, the  most recent, Rhode Island had 463,300 non-farm jobs.

The department breaks down those jobs into more than two dozen categories, including federal, state and local government workers. The local government category includes public school teachers.

If you combine the local and state government numbers for October 2012, you get about 50,000 jobs, or about 11 percent of that 463,300 statewide job total -- less than half of Zaccaria’s estimate.

Even if you add in the 10,000 federal government employees in the state, that would bring the number up to about 60,000, or about 13 percent of the state’s work force.

Because Zaccaria said he’s been using his 25-percent figure since 2010, we went back to the 2010 numbers to see whether things were different then. They weren’t.

The closest he would have come was January 2010, the month when the number of total jobs was lowest.

Combined state and local government employees were counted at about 52,000 that month, 11.7 percent of that month’s 444,500 statewide jobs. Including 10,200 federal jobs that month would have bumped the public employee sector share to 14 percent, still short of 25 percent.

Our ruling 
Rhode Island State Republican Chairman Mark Zaccaria said that 25 percent -- one in four -- of paychecks in the state of Rhode Island go to state workers, municipal workers and public school teachers. But state labor statistics show the figure is closer to 11 percent, or about 1 in 9.  

We rule his claim False.

"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'John  Kitzhaber']","
Did Oregon have the nation's second fastest-growing economy last year?
","
Oregon’s economy is looking up -- and in a recent speech at the Oregon Leadership Summit, Gov. John Kitzhaber counted the ways.

Unemployment is falling, our credit rating is rising, the state ranks as one of the friendliest to business and just last year, Oregon had ""the second fastest growing economy in the nation.""

It was that last one that caught our ear. Oregon usually lags behind the country -- but when the state is hot, it’s hot, so it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. Still we decided to check it out.

We got in touch with Amy Wojcicki, the governor’s spokeswoman, and she reminded us of an article The Oregonian published last June. The story’s headline spoke for itself: ""Oregon economy growing at nation’s second-fastest rate.""

The story cited figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Statistics. In 2011, Oregon’s gross domestic product increased by 4.7 percent. The state was second only to North Dakota, which saw its GDP grow by 7.6 percent that year.

The numbers show the governor was right. Still, we decided to dig just a little bit further because we know, when it comes to economics and statistics, nothing is ever quite as clear cut as it seems.

We called up Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economist. ""That's the fact -- you can certainly point to it."" But, he added, ""I would be wary.

""I think it's important to recognize that a significant amount of those gains came from manufacturing"" -- particularly microchips and related industries.

All of this was covered in the original article. Indeed, manufacturing was far and away the biggest driver of growth that year. Intel alone had huge growth. So, we asked, what’s the problem with that?

""It's a real effect,"" Duy said, ""But is this the experience of the average Oregonian? I don't think the average Oregonian perceives the economy as growing at the second fastest rate in the nation.""

We asked Duy if he could suggest another measurement that might provide a fuller picture -- he suggested the rate of job growth. Fortunately, this just came up in the state’s most recent revenue forecast. According to that report, which based its numbers on figures from the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, Oregon ranks 26th overall in that category. Said another way: We’re perfectly average.

In a recent speech, Gov. Kitzhaber mentioned that a year ago, Oregon boasted the second-fastest growing economy in the nation. It was just one fact of several that he referenced to make the point that the state is rebounding from a dismal recession. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the governor’s statement is accurate. We agree with Duy that most Oregonians don’t feel like they’re living in an economic boom, but that doesn’t make the governor wrong.

We rate this claim True.","[('\nGov. John Kitzhaber, Oregon Leadership Summit speech, Dec. 3, 2012\n\nE-mail from Amy Wojcicki, the governor’s spokeswoman, Dec. 4, 2012\n\nW.P.

"['Education', 'Poverty', 'Texas', 'Dan Micciche']","
Dallas school board member says poverty among Dallas students is high and greater than in some other large, urban districts
","
In a November 2012 opinion article, a member of the Dallas school board touted a breakfast-in-the-classroom program for heading off student hunger.

Dan Micciche, writing in the Dallas Morning News, also spoke to poverty in Dallas: ""The poverty level in"" the Dallas school district ""is one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark.""

Like some other urban Texas counties, Dallas County is home to more than 10 school districts. Similarly, the Houston district is among more than 20 Harris County districts. So we figured Micciche was not speaking to poverty across Big D.

But is child poverty in the Dallas district super-high?

By email, Micciche pointed us to a chart in a January 2012 report on school breakfast programs by the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing hunger among poor Americans.

The chart lists the share of students in 26 large urban school districts determined to be eligible for federally supported free- and reduced-price school meals in a recent school year. The intent, the report says, was to look at the ""largest school districts in a substantial number of states.""

Students who qualify for the meal assistance do not have to be living below the federal poverty level. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the poverty level are eligible for free meals, while children from families with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level are eligible for reduced‐price meals, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture fact sheet. For the year running through June 2013, 130 percent of the poverty level is $29,965 for a family of four; 185 percent is $42,643, the sheet says.

In 2010-11, the report chart indicates, the Dallas district had a greater share of students eligible for free- and reduced-price meals than districts serving New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark.

Specifically, 88.2 percent of the Dallas district’s students were eligible for free- or reduced-price meals, 83.5 percent for free meals. Among the cited others, the Detroit district ranked second with 84.3 percent of students eligible for free- or reduced-price meals, 82.1 percent for free meals. Micciche’s other mentioned districts fell out in this order: Chicago, Newark, Houston, Los Angeles and New York, where 64 percent qualified for free- or reduced-price meals.

Among all the sampled districts, the Memphis and Oklahoma City districts had greater shares of students eligible for free- or reduced-price meals than the Dallas district.

Next, we looked for a more precise breakdown of children living in--not just above--poverty.

The government determines who lives in poverty by comparing annual income to dollar values called thresholds--updated annually for inflation--varied by family size, number of children and age of householder, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If a family’s before-tax money income is less than the dollar value of their threshold, then that family is considered to be in poverty. For people not living in families, poverty status is determined by comparing the individual’s own income to his or her threshold. The poverty levels are not adjusted for regional differences in the cost of living.

Census spokesman Robert Bernstein helped us compare child poverty, based on tax filings and other records, within the Dallas district to child poverty in the six other districts. Some 47 percent of children in the Detroit district lived at or below the poverty level in 2010, according to the bureau, compared to nearly 38 percent of children in the Dallas district. Smaller shares of students lived in poverty in the other districts.

A center researcher, Madeleine Levin, informed of this breakdown, cautioned by phone that the government’s poverty threshold is less restrictive than the income hurdles for the school meal programs. ""You’re comparing apples to oranges,"" she said. ""Totally different numbers.""

Micciche agreed, further speculating that the bureau’s estimates swept in children living within the bounds of districts but not attending public school. ""That’s not my point,"" he said  by phone. ""The students who are in our schools come from a high-poverty population.""

Finally, we looked at figures for student eligibility for free- and reduced-price lunches in 2010-11 as compiled by the U.S Department of Education on its Elementary/Secondary Information System.

Resulting percentages varied, sometimes considerably, from the survey results cited by Micciche. The Dallas and Newark districts had the greatest share of students eligible for the programs, about 87 percent total, followed by the Detroit district, at 80 percent. The Newark district had a much lower student enrollment, 33,812, compared to 157,143 students shown for the Dallas district.

Levin told us the discrepancies may reflect the fact that the federal counts drew on figures dating to October 2010 while the center drew on responses from food service departments submitted in fall 2011. At any rate, Levin said, both data sources indicate a high level of poverty among students in the Dallas schools.

The Dallas school board voted in late November 2012 to offer breakfasts in the classroom across the district, according to Dora Rivas, who directs the district’s Food and Child Nutrition department. The breakfasts will be phased in starting in 2013-14.

Our ruling

Micciche said the poverty level in the Dallas school district ""is one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark.""

The poverty level is among the highest, though it looks like a greater share of Detroit students was living at or below poverty in 2010 and data collected by the federal government suggests that as of October 2010, the Dallas district was tied with the considerably smaller Newark district with nearly nine in 10 students eligible for free- or reduced-price meals. Then again, a more recent survey of school districts indicates Dallas had the greatest share of students qualified for the meal programs that year.

We rate this claim as Mostly True.","[('\nReport, ""School Breakfast in America\'s Big Cities, School Year 2010-11,"" Food Research and Action Center, January 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Robert Bernstein, public affairs specialist, U.S. Census Bureau, Suitland, Md., Nov. 28, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Dan Micciche, Dallas, Nov. 28, 2012\n\nTelephone interviews, Madeleine Levin, senior policy analyst, Food Research and Action Center, Washington, Nov. 29 and Dec. 5, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Marie Stetzer, program manager, National Center for Educational Statistics, Dec. 5, 2012', 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/012012%20fracreport.pdf')]",/factchecks/2012/dec/05/dan-micciche/dallas-school-board-member-says-poverty-among-dall/

Pasch says Democrats outpolled Republicans statewide in Assembly races despite losing a majority of seats
","
Even as Democrats celebrated their statewide electoral successes in the Nov. 6, 2012 elections, the party faced the sobering reality that Republicans had regained complete control of the state Capitol.

In the party’s statewide radio address a few weeks later, Assistant Minority Leader Sandy Pasch (D-Shorewood), scoffed at the idea that voters had validated the Republicans’ agenda.

""The people of our state sent a clear message in this election – they are sick and tired of partisan politics trumping the best interests of middle-class families,"" Pasch said.

She added: ""And Republicans cannot claim a mandate for continuing their extreme agenda, as Assembly Democratic candidates actually received 200,000 more votes statewide.""

The claim about a Democratic popular-vote advantage jumped out at us.

After all, Republicans won 60 of the 99 Assembly seats on Election Day, giving them a 60-39 advantage next year, a margin nearly identical to the previous two years. (In the state Senate, control flipped from the Democrats to the GOP).

Is it possible Assembly Democratic Party candidates ran up a vote advantage while losing more than 60 percent of the races?

Pasch’s office said she got the figure from a Nov. 13, 2012 opinion piece authored by State Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate and published in the Journal Sentinel. Tate said when the final vote tallies were confirmed, the margin would be ""close to 200,000"" in favor of Democrats.

Losing the popular vote while winning a big majority would be unusual.

In the 2010 Assembly races, for example, the GOP took control of the Assembly and Senate before temporarily losing the Senate after recall elections in 2011.

That year state GOP Assembly candidates ran up a 263,000 vote edge over their Democratic counterparts. Republicans won 57% of the votes, collectively, in the Assembly races across the state.

The two elections before that, in 2008 and 2006, saw the opposite: Democrats picked up seats. And in doing so, they ran up a huge majority of the collective vote in Assembly races, more than 60 percent in both cases, according to research by Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal political group One Wisconsin Now.

So what about 2012?

We crunched district-by-district numbers from the official results reported on the state Government Accountability Board website.

And we found the historical trend flipped on its head.

We counted a 174,000-vote edge for Democrats in the 99 races in the final tally.

Statewide the Democrats won 53 percent of the 2.7 million votes cast in those local Assembly races, compared to 46 percent for Republicans, we found. The rest went to independents and other parties.

Democrats blame the new redistricting plan, pushed through by Republicans for packing Democratic officeholders into supermajority districts and giving the GOP a majority of redrawn, conservative-leaning areas. Pasch called it a ""gerry-mandate.""

A Republican political strategist, Mark Graul, owner of Arena Strategy Group, said he thinks redistricting was a factor but that in some districts Republicans simply outperformed their Democratic Party counterparts.

In this item, we’re not evaluating Pasch’s claim that ""Republicans cannot claim a mandate"" in light of the Democratic vote majority. Her assertion struck us, and experts we consulted, as an opinion statement.

But here are a few additional facts that help explain the vote totals and put the results in context.

Behind the popular vote figures that Democrats cite are some stark figures that favor the GOP. If you look just at contested Assembly races featuring both a Republican and a Democrat, the GOP won 56 of 74 matchups. That’s 76 percent.

In the 74 contested races, Republican outpolled Democrats by 155,000 votes. The overall Democratic edge in all races traces to the party’s 329,000 vote edge in races where only one party or another was on the ballot.

As you might guess from those figures, Democrats dominated the uncontested races, including in Pasch’s district in Milwaukee and suburban Shorewood.

Republicans wouldn’t or couldn’t field a candidate in a whopping 21 districts (most in vote-rich Milwaukee and Dane Counties), while Democrats fielded a contender in all but four. That’s a big switch from two years earlier, in 2010, when it was Democrats who sat out more races.

In fielding so many candidates, Democrats might have been hoping to goose turnout in other races, said Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin Milwaukee political scientist elected five times as a Democrat in the state Assembly and Senate in the 1970s and 1980s.

Our rating

Pasch, citing Democratic Party research based on unofficial and preliminary vote data, claimed that ""Assembly Democratic candidates actually received 200,000 more votes statewide"" despite Republicans winning more than 60 percent of the seats.

The final, certified election results showed a 174,000 edge for Democrats, despite the fact they won only 39 seats.

We think that her statement rates a Mostly True.","[('\nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin, audio of weekly radio address, by Rep.

Chambliss defends his record on fighting tax increases
","
There’s probably nothing worse for a conservative politician than to be accused of supporting tax increases.

U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia has heard the whispers -- well, shouts -- from fellow conservatives suspicious of his charter membership in a bipartisan ""gang"" of senators that has been working for more than a year on a solution to the federal government’s budget problems.

Shortly before Thanksgiving, Chambliss defended the work in a radio interview and had political reporters across the country rushing to their laptops to write about his comment that ""I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge"" he signed in 1994 not to raise taxes. There were countless news articles pondering whether Chambliss and other Republican lawmakers had severed ties with Grover Norquist, the influential tax watchdog who leads Americans for Tax Reform, the organization that created the pledge.

In one follow-up interview a few days after the holiday, Chambliss attempted to convince skeptical conservatives by stating a claim about his track record on taxes.

""I can tell you that neither Lindsey nor I have ever been in the business – nor have either one of us ever voted for increasing taxes,"" Chambliss said. Chambliss was referring to U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who also discussed voting for a plan to increase revenue.

PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine whether Chambliss was correct when he claimed to have never voted for a tax increase.

Chambliss was first elected to Congress in 1994. He served eight years in the House of Representatives before surprising many pundits in 2002 by defeating incumbent U.S. Sen. Max Cleland, a Democrat. Chambliss won re-election in 2008 and plans to run for a third term in 2014. But there has been some speculation that a Republican might challenge him.

What constitutes as a tax increase can vary depending on whom you ask.

""What is the definition of a tax increase?"" asked Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University. ""It's sort of like when President Clinton asked what the definition of ‘is’ is.""

Generally, a tax increase is simple to deduce. A lawmaking body votes to increase a rate that others pay for various services. Federal legislation often contains hundreds of pages of language with complicated minutiae that occasionally includes changes that contradict the ideals of some lawmakers. We found one bill that could contradict the senator’s claim.

First, a little background on the pledge. During Chambliss’ 1994 campaign for the House, he signed the Americans for Taxpayer Reform Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The pledge is a promise by candidates to their constituents to ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses, and … oppose any further reduction or elimination of deductions and credits."" Similar types of pledges are offered in each state, and most Republican elected officials have signed the pledge.

Chambliss has won the ATR ""Hero of the Taxpayer"" Award and was heartily endorsed by the organization’s president, Norquist, in his 2002 race against Cleland. Chambliss and Norquist have largely been compatriots on taxes, which made his initial comments in the radio interview newsworthy as Congress and President Barack Obama work on a solution to avoid what’s been called a ""fiscal cliff"" of tax increases and spending cuts starting in 2013.

Norquist and Chambliss have since talked about the senator’s comments, and both men say they largely have the same goal not to raise federal income tax rates. But Chambliss said they disagree on some details. ATR did not return a request for comment to our question about whether Chambliss has voted to raise taxes. Norquist did answer that question at a recent event sponsored by the Washington-based news outlet Politico.

""He's never voted for a tax increase,"" Norquist said of Chambliss. ""He just talked about maybe someday doing that.""

PolitiFact Georgia reviewed other records and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s archives, and it reached out to political science professors and others to see whether there was any evidence that Chambliss has voted to raise taxes. Some we spoke with complained that Chambliss has been too accommodating on federal spending or hasn’t supported tuition deductions or child tax credits. None said Chambliss was big on raising taxes.

Doug Kellogg, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, said there may be transportation or telecommunication bills over the years that include a fee hike or an increase in certain taxes, but he wasn’t aware of any legislation that Chambliss backed that included a tax increase on a large group of Americans.

""It doesn’t necessarily seem like there’s a bloody glove,"" Kellogg said.

A Georgia Democratic Party official brought forward what seemed to be the strongest evidence against the senator’s claim. In 1997, Chambliss voted in favor of raising the cigarette tax from 24 cents to 34 cents in 2000 and 39 cents in 2002.

Chambliss spokeswoman Lauren Claffey said the increase was part of a balanced-budget deal in two pieces of legislation aimed at lowering taxes for most Americans. She included comments made by then-President Bill Clinton at the bill’s signing.

""This act, together with the tax-cut legislation that I have also signed today, implements a historic agreement that will benefit generations of Americans,"" Clinton said. ""These bills will balance the budget in a way that honors our values, invests in our people and cuts taxes for middle-class families. They are a victory for all parents who want a good education for their children and for all families working to build a secure future.""

News reports at that time said the deal would reduce taxes by about $140 billion for families and be the broadest tax cut since 1981.

Chambliss defended his vote in a statement, saying it was part of a ""comprehensive deal of tax provisions and spending cuts.""

""The net result of this legislative package was a balanced budget by way of substantial spending cuts coupled with substantial tax cuts, including a large cut in the capital gains tax rate that is widely credited with causing the economic boom of the late ’90s. The fact that some excise taxes were increased as other taxes were cut at far higher levels does not constitute a tax increase by my definition, nor by the definition of tax watchdog groups,"" he said.

To sum up, Chambliss said he has never voted for a tax increase in his 18 years in Congress. By the standards of some of the most active federal tax watchdog organizations in the nation, Chambliss has not raised taxes. There was one clear example of a tax increase that would have an impact on smokers, but it was part of a bill that cut taxes for a large number of Americans. We rate this claim True.","[('\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog, ""Fiscal cliff talks begin -- between Saxby Chambliss and Grover Norquist,"" Nov. 27, 2012.', 'http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2012/11/27/your-daily-jolt-fiscal-cliff-talks-begin-%E2%80%93-between-saxby-chambliss-and-grover-norquist/?cxntfid=blogs_political_insider_jim_galloway'), ('\nAmericans for Tax Reform, ""Chambliss Vows \'No New Taxes\' in Georgia, While Cleland Opposes Permanent Tax Relief,"" accessed Dec. 3, 2012.', 'No link'), ('\nAssociated Press, ""Budget deal elates both sides,"" July 29, 1997.\n\nEmail from Kerwin Swint, professor, Kennesaw State University, Nov. 28, 2012.\n\nEmail from Eric Gray, spokesman, Georgia Democratic Party, Nov. 29, 2012.\n\nEmail from Lauren Claffey, spokeswoman, U.S. Sen.

Broward GOP activists claim ""we had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website""
","
It’s not easy being a Republican in Broward County -- home to the largest number of Democratic voters in Florida and a county where registered GOP voters are outnumbered two to one by Democrats.  

Beyond the numbers, Broward’s liberalism often makes amusing headlines -- from a 2002 gay mayoral candidate in Wilton Manors who said he was attacked for not being ""gay enough,"" to a county commissioner in 2007 who questioned airing emergency warnings on the station that ran Rush Limbaugh’s radio show.

It wasn’t a surprise that Democrats swept Broward and helped re-elect President Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. But the Broward GOP also suffered the loss of two of their most prominent local Republicans: state Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff of Fort Lauderdale who lost after redistricting, and Sheriff Al Lamberti, who lost to Democrat Scott Israel. (They also had the blow of Fox News favorite U.S. Rep. Allen West moving out of Broward to the Treasure Coast and then losing.)

Richard DeNapoli, chairman of the Broward Republican Executive Committee, or BREC, wrote a memo to the group listing accomplishments of the past year. Most of those accomplishments were nothing surprising, such as lining up volunteers and distributing thousands of Romney bumper stickers. But one accomplishment caught our eye:

""We had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website.""

We wanted to know, did the Broward GOP get the Broward Supervisor of Elections to remove a League of Women Voters guide from its website? And was that guide or is the League itself ""liberal""?

The League of Women Voters guide

First, some background on the Florida League of Women Voters 2012 voters guide. The guide had short biographical sections and statements submitted by Obama and Mitt Romney. It also included bio information on U.S. Senate candidates Democrat Nelson and Republican Connie Mack and questionnaire responses from Nelson. (Mack chose not to answer the questionnaire.) It included a section on the state Supreme Court justices seeking retention, as well as the state’s constitution and a list of voter resources.

The longest section was about the 11 proposed state constitutional amendments. The guide included a synopsis of each amendment and a brief explanation about what a ""yes"" or ""no"" vote would mean.

The guide summarized conflicting viewpoints  -- for example about a question on public funding of abortion: ""Supporters say this amendment puts the state on even footing with the federal government. Opponents say it is a pre-emptive strike on a woman’s right to make her own health care choices.""

The guide didn’t just include opposing viewpoints -- it included analysis, such as noting a ""yes"" vote on a question about the health care law would add language to the state’s constitution that could be found unconstitutional.

""Amendment 1 is more of a political referendum than a meaningful change to our Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has upheld the federal government’s right to impose the individual mandate, the legal standing of Amendment 1 is precarious,"" the guide said. ""The passage or defeat of Amendment 1 may have no practical implications other than to send a message that a majority of Florida’s voters are either for or against the individual mandate.""

The guide didn’t endorse candidates or tell voters which way to vote on the amendments -- but the League did separately come out against the amendments.

The guide, funded in part by Wells Fargo and American Express, was developed in conjunction with experts including the Collins Center for Public Policy, said Deidre Macnab, president of the Florida League, in an interview with PolitiFact Florida.

League members distributed the guides at events and public libraries. The League did not request that it be linked to on the Broward Supervisor of Elections website, Macnab said.

The voters guide on the Broward elections website

DeNapoli said he learned the League’s guide was linked to the Broward Supervisor of Elections homepage sometime near the beginning of October. DeNapoli said he called Mary Cooney, a spokeswoman for Broward Supervisor Brenda Snipes, to express his concern.

""As soon as you went to the Broward Supervisor of Elections home page it was glaringly right there,"" DeNapoli told PolitiFact Florida.

DeNapoli said his goal was to get the guide off the home page: ""If they bury the link (to the League’s website) way into the Supervisor of Elections website, that wasn’t our main concern.""

Within a day or two, the link was moved off the home page.

""I made a decision to remove the brochure from our website after several calls, one of which was from Mr. DeNapoli,"" Snipes told PolitiFact Florida in an email. She also heard from the conservative news website BizPac Review which reported on DeNapoli’s efforts and then advocated removing the link from the website’s voter education page.

When we searched the supervisor’s website on Nov. 27, we could only find the link to the guide if we typed ""League of Women Voters"" into the website’s search engine.

Was the League’s voter guide liberal?

So BREC did get the supervisor of elections to move the voters guide to a less prominent spot on its website. But is it accurate to call the guide or the League itself ""liberal""?

The national League of Women Voters was formed in 1920 from the movement to give women the right to vote, and it continues to advocate for voter education and participation. The Florida League formed in 1939 with the help of women in St. Petersburg and other cities.

""But being nonpartisan does not mean we lack opinions, or the willingness to express them.  Our opinions are formed after research, study and consensus,"" states the national League of Women Voters website. ""We are passionate advocates – both women and men – who work to influence policy on specific issues by speaking out and putting pressure on our elected leaders.""

The national League has taken stances in favor of expanded early voting, backing the Affordable Care Act and calling on Obama to do more about climate change. The League also has a history of supporting abortion rights.

We asked DeNapoli for his evidence that the League or its guide was liberal. He said he found the guide’s discussion of the amendments ""slanted"" and noted that the League separately came out against the amendments, and that the Republican Party of Florida supported the amendments (nearly all of them).

Macnab said the League wasn’t the only group to oppose the amendments -- the Hillsborough County Republican Party opposed the majority of them. Ultimately Florida voters rejected most of the amendments.

Macnab said the League has been consistent in its support of certain issues, but the parties have changed their stances. ""We often get tagged with one name or another,"" she said. ""We see it as a pretty age-old political tactic to divert voters’ attention.""

Our ruling

The Broward Republican Executive Committee claimed on its website that in 2012,  ""We had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website.""

The group’s chairman did contact the Broward elections office to complain about the guide,  and the link was moved from the home page. It can now be found through a few clicks by using the search engine, but you have to know to look for it.

It’s more difficult to say whether the League’s voter guide or the League itself is ""liberal.""

Some of the national League’s stances on issues -- in favor of more early voting, in favor of tackling climate change and supporting the health care law -- do dovetail with current liberal positions. The League officially considers itself nonpartisan and independent. 
But the guide didn’t endorse candidates and gave them an equal chance to respond.

The committee was mostly correct about getting the voters guide removed from the Broward website, but the guide wasn’t clearly ""liberal.""

"['National', 'Elections', 'Amy Klobuchar']","
It’s True. Before he was mayor, Pete Buttigieg ran statewide in Indiana – and got drubbed
","One of the testier back-and-forths at the Democratic presidential debate in Los Angeles centered around electability, focusing on two candidates from the Midwest who say they can best connect with voters who backed President Donald Trump in 2016. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., went after South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, saying ""Winning matters. I think a track record of getting things done matters."" Buttigieg responded, ""If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80% of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence’s Indiana,"" to prolonged applause. But Klobuchar had her own applause-line ready: ""If you had won in Indiana, that would be one thing. You tried and you lost by 20 points."" People following the 2020 Democratic presidential primary probably know a little bit of Buttigieg’s background as mayor and his successful re-election. But they probably haven’t heard the election story Klobuchar is referencing. Before Buttigieg was first elected mayor in 2011, he ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010. He lost the general election to Republican Richard Mourdock by nearly 25 percentage points, according to voting records kept by the Indiana Secretary of State. Buttigieg received 37.54% of the 1.68 million votes cast. Mourdock, a tea party Republican, received 62.46% of the vote. Mourdock went on to run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, defeating incumbent Richard Lugar in the Republican primary before losing in the general election to Democrat Joe Donnelly. Mourdock, you might remember, said during that Senate campaign that when a woman is impregnated during a rape ""it’s something God intended."" As for Buttigieg and the 2010 treasurer’s race, it’s important to note that: 1. Mourdock was the incumbent in the race; 2. No Democrat in Indiana won statewide in 2010; and 3. No Democrat has been elected state treasurer in Indiana since 1979. Comments Buttigieg made during that race have come up in the current campaign. Buttigieg attended a meet-up of tea party activists at a South Bend church. Video of Buttigieg speaking includes the following lines. ""There are some, especially in my party, who think that the tea party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Republican Party,"" Buttigieg said. ""But there are many others who believe that the tea party is motivated by real concerns about the direction of our government, and the responsiveness of our government to citizens, and above all the frustration with business as usual. That is what motivated me to run. And so while we may come from often very different perspectives, I believe we might find that we have a lot in common on that front.""

Bernie Sanders says real wages rose 1.1%. He’s right
","In the Democratic debate in Los Angeles, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders pushed back against the idea that President Donald Trump can point to a strong economy as he runs for re-election. ""Trump goes around saying the economy is doing great,"" Sanders said Dec. 19. ""You know what real inflation accounted-for wages went up last year? 1.1%. That ain't great."" According to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers, Sanders is correct. The agency reported that real average hourly earnings were 1.1% higher in November compared with 2018. When people talk about real earnings, they mean how much workers make after taking the cost of living into account. When costs rise, it eats away at the increase people see in their paychecks. There are other ways to track wage trends. For real median weekly wages for all full-time workers, the rise was 1.3% over the course of the year, again using government data. After the Great Recession, real wages began to grow again in 2014. The highest jump was 2.2% in 2015. There’s no way to quantify whether a 1.1% increase ""ain’t great,"" as Sanders said. Broadly, the rise is consistent with the long-running economic growth the country has seen. It is not the biggest increase workers have seen in recent years. But looking back to 1980, the average yearly change is .3%. In that light, 1.1% is better than average. The trends, however, will vary depending on the sort of workers (all workers, or just production and nonsupervisory ones) and the time period. In general, for the production and nonsupervisory group, real weekly earnings have been rising since the late 1990s, with significant dips during recessions. There is an encouraging sign for lower wage workers. In 2018, wages rose fastest for those at the bottom end of the pay scale. With wages, there are many possible ways to slice the data, and no single measure captures the full story. Sanders said real wages rose 1.1% in the past year. Government numbers back that up. Whether that ""ain’t great,"" is a matter of judgment. It is not as high as it was in 2015-2017. It is higher than the average since 1980.

Doug Collins repeats a false claim about Pelosi’s letter on impeachment
","U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., misquoted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as he argued unsuccessfully against the impeachment of President Donald Trump. ""In November 2019, Speaker Pelosi said it would be ‘dangerous’ to leave it to voters to determine whether President Trump stays in office,"" said Collins, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Dec. 18 on the House floor. Collins’ claim is False. This is a mischaracterization of what Pelosi told Democratic members a month before the House passed two articles of impeachment. (The near-party-line vote set up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate early next year.)  Collins is referencing a Nov. 18 open letter to Democrats in which Pelosi justified impeachment. Here’s what she said, in context: ""The facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests. ""The weak response to these hearings has been, ‘Let the election decide.’ That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections."" A Fox News reporter distilled her message this way in his report: ""Pelosi circulated a memo to Democrats tonight telling them it would be dangerous to let voters decide President Trump’s fate."" Trump referenced that quote in a tweet an hour after chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel said it on Fox News. From there, the claim was repurposed into several popular Facebook posts, which we previously rated False.  Emanuel did not say he was quoting Pelosi directly, but his paraphrase is distorted. And so is Collins’. Pelosi said waiting for the election is dangerous because she believes the president is ""jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections."" She did not say it’s dangerous to leave it to voters to determine whether Trump stays in office, as Collins said she did. We reached out to Collins’ press office for comment, but we haven’t heard back. The statement is inaccurate.

The False claim comparing Jesus before Pontius Pilate and Trump's impeachment
","During the House debate on the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, Rep. Barry Loudermilk closed his remarks with a statement that drew its own headlines. ""Before you take this historic vote today, one week before Christmas, I want you to keep this in mind,"" the Georgia Republican said Dec. 18.  ""When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers. During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president in this process."" The comparison didn’t stand up well among experts in religion and law. We asked Loudermilk’s press secretary, Brandon Cockerham, for information to back Loudermilk’s statement, but didn’t get a reply. The Catholic News Agency reported that Cockerham defended the statement in an email to the news service, saying:  ""Congressman Loudermilk was simply making a comparison about the process; that Pontius Pilate allowed Jesus (to) face his accusers, but the Democrats refused to allow the president or Republicans to even know who the accuser was, much less the right to question him or her.""  Cockerham was alluding to the whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine triggered the impeachment proceedings. That person’s identity has remained confidential.  But Loudermilk didn’t single out the whistleblower; rather, he alluded to multiple accusers. Several passages from the New Testament of the Bible tell how Jesus appeared before Pontius Pilate, a Roman governor, before being crucified.  During Passover, Pilate freed any prisoner the people asked for. Jesus was accused of blasphemy and treason for stating he was the King of the Jews.  From Matthew Chapter 27, on the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ website: Now Jesus stood before the governor, and he questioned him, ""Are you the king of the Jews?"" Jesus said, ""You say so."" And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. Then Pilate said to him, ""Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?"" But he did not answer him one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed. Jesus received no due process before Pilate, according to Robert Tuttle, professor of law and religion at George Washington University. ""He just questions Jesus and says he finds no fault, then asks the crowd what they want done."" The passages from the biblical books of Matthew (chapter 27), Mark (chapter 15) and Luke (chapter 23) ""pretty much agree on the story,"" said Douglas Laycock, a professor of law and religious studies at the University of Virginia. ""No one says that Jesus was offered a lawyer, or a chance to bring one, or a chance to call his own witnesses. No one said he could testify in writing if he didn't want to answer orally,"" Laycock told us. ""They say the priests and scribes made accusations; no one says that any witnesses were called to support those accusations. Pilate thought Jesus was innocent, but the mob demanded his execution and Pilate finally acquiesced."" The House’s impeachment proceedings were akin to an investigation by the police, a prosecutor or a grand jury — and due process rights are not granted. Trump’s trial will be in the Senate. Trump was not denied a fair hearing, said Michael Gerhardt, author of ""Impeachment: What Everyone Needs to Know"" and a University of North Carolina professor of law who testified before Congress in support of impeaching Trump. ""He was invited but declined, and still had his bully pulpit."" Allan Lichtman, author of ""The Case for Impeachment"" (from April 2017) and a history professor at American University, said Trump’s supporters in the House and their attorneys could have cross-examined witnesses, Trump declined an invitation to present a defense before the Judiciary Committee, and he blocked witnesses from appearing. ""The only comparison between these two proceedings is that they both pretty much refused to defend themselves in the actual tribunal,"" Laycock said. Loudermilk said, ""When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers. During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president in this process."" Biblical accounts cited to us by experts in law and religion say Jesus was questioned by the Roman governor, not given an opportunity by Pilate to face his accusers. Trump has yet to go on trial in the Senate. But before being impeached by the House, he was given the opportunity to present a defense.

White House snubbed House’s document requests, Democrat says
","On a day that ended with President Donald Trump becoming the third U.S. president to be impeached, House Democrats hammered Trump for refusing to comply with their investigation, saying his stonewalling proved he has something to hide. ""(This) was an attempt by Donald J. Trump to aim Ukrainian corruption straight at the heart of the presidential election of 2020,"" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. ""The president knows this, which is why he has not given this Congress a single email, phone record or document.""  The truth is clear to anyone not deliberately looking away.Instead of fighting corruption the President aimed it at the 2020 presidential election.Today, I answer the call to defend our democracy and the United States Constitution. I will vote to impeach the President. pic.twitter.com/hUzCCkuFrZ The White House did release summaries of Trump’s April 21 and July 25 phone calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  But when we examined whether the administration transmitted any other records to Congress, we found that it defied the House’s multiple requests and subpoenas for documents. In a statement to PolitiFact, a White House official said the call readouts are ""what matters."" ""The White House raised well-recognized presidential privileges in response to these document requests,"" the official said. ""House Democrats chose not to address those privileges, clinging instead to an artificial impeachment deadline on their sham proceeding."" In early October, the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees subpoenaed the White House for Ukraine-related documents that Democrats had requested but not received. In response, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to Congress saying the executive branch would not be participating in the investigation. At the White House’s direction, several top administration officials also defied subpoenas seeking testimony or documents. The night before European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland was expected to testify, for example, his attorneys received a last-minute call from the State Department informing them that the Trump administration would not allow his testimony.  Sondland eventually testified against the White House’s orders and in response to a subpoena, but his recollections in both his private and public testimony were limited because the White House refused to turn over documents and call records.  Nine administration officials defied similar subpoenas from the House. ""The executive branch cannot be expected to, and will not participate in, this exercise of partisan political theater,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. House Democrats elected not to take the issue up in court. Instead, they packaged Trump’s efforts to block cooperation into an article of impeachment alleging obstruction of Congress.  The obstruction of Congress article, which the House approved by a 229-198 margin, charges Trump with ""directing"" the White House and various executive branch agencies ""to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of documents."" According to the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees’ reports, ""not a single document"" was produced by the White House, the vice president’s office, the Office of Management and Budget, the State Department, the Defense Department or the Energy Department.  In total, those agencies received ""71 specific, individualized requests or demands for records,"" the committees’ reports said. The House did obtain some documents, such as text messages that former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker exchanged with Sondland and other U.S. and Ukrainian diplomats, that were in witnesses’ ""personal possession,"" according to the Judiciary Committee’s report. But multiple witnesses testified to the existence of other key White House documents that Congress never received. These materials included: • Talking points prepared ahead of Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, director for European affairs at the National Security Council. • Notes taken during Trump’s call with Zelensky by Vindman and by Tim Morrison, the former top Russia expert on the NSC. • A memo prepared by Vindman that former National Security Adviser John Bolton was expected to present to Trump conveying ""the consensus views from the entire deputies small group"" that ""the security assistance be released."" • Call records between Trump and Sondland. • Notes from NSC legal advisor John Eisenberg detailing his discussions with Vindman about a July 10 meeting with a top Ukrainian official, during which Sondland suggested that investigations could help secure a White House meeting for Zelensky. • The readout of Trump’s Sept. 25 meeting with Zelensky in New York. The House Intelligence Committee’s Republican minority report does not dispute that Trump’s White House withheld these and other documents. But it notes that Trump made readouts of his April 21 and July 25 phone calls with Zelensky publicly available, calling them ""directly relevant."" Himes spokesman Patrick Malone said the readouts were released in response to public pressure rather than congressional subpoenas. The White House published the July 25 call summary on Sept. 25, days after news of the whistleblower complaint broke and one day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the House impeachment inquiry. ""They weren’t released to Congress in response to our requests,"" Malone said. ""They were released to the public."" Himes said Trump ""has not given this Congress a single email, phone record or document."" The White House told Congress that it would not cooperate with the House’s impeachment inquiry, and all evidence suggests that the White House stood by that pledge.  The White House did, however, release two call readouts. They were not in response to congressional subpoenas as part of the House’s investigation.  We rate Himes’ statement Mostly True.","[('C-Span, ""Articles of Impeachment Debate,"" Dec. 18, 2019', 'https://www.c-span.org/video/?467441-1/us-house-impeaches-president-trump'), ('House Judiciary Committee, ""Impeachment of Donald J.

State Sen. Kooyenga says doorbuster deals and holiday shopping specials are against the law
","There’s nothing Wisconsinites love more than a good deal — it’s baked into all those not-so-subtle price drops we sneak into responses to compliments. ""Nice sweater!"" ""Thanks, I got it for 43 cents at Kohl’s since it was clearance and then I had 30% off coupon and I had Kohl’s cash and…."" But one state lawmaker says there’s a problem with some of those deals, especially when it comes to Black Friday-style doorbusters – they’re illegal. In a Dec. 13, 2019, email to constituents, state Sen. Dale Kooyenga condemned what he called the ""Wisconsin Grinch"" -- the state’s minimum markup law. The law — most commonly known for setting baseline prices for gas, alcohol and tobacco products — actually prohibits far more than that, he said. ""The minimum markup law also forbids retailers from selling most other products below cost,"" said the Brookfield Republican. ""That makes many doorbuster deals and holiday shopping specials technically against the law. It’s essentially a state-mandated profit margin."" Could doorbusters really be illegal? Let’s dig into the law books. The history The minimum markup law — technically called the Unfair Sales Act — dates back to the Great Depression. It seeks to ensure fair competition among businesses by taking aim at ""loss leaders"" -- items priced below cost to draw in customers for other purchases, or to drive a competitor out of business. Several other states have similar laws. Wisconsin’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau described the law’s origin this way in a 2019 informational paper: The Unfair Sales Act took effect in the 1930s with the intent of preventing predatory pricing by large firms. It was thought that large firms could reduce prices below cost to levels smaller firms could not match. Larger firms would incur short-term losses but drive smaller firms out of business. It was thought the remaining large firms would use near-monopoly power to charge exorbitant prices after smaller firms were mostly forced from the market. The law itself describes selling below cost as ""a form of deceptive advertising and an unfair method of competition in commerce."" These pricing limitations have remained on the books despite efforts from both parties to limit them. Republican lawmakers proposed repealing the law, or parts of it, in 2015 and 2017, to no avail. The repeal was opposed by numerous agriculture and business and tourism interests, and favored by just one registered entity — Walmart, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. And in 2019, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers hit a wall with a budget proposal to repeal the minimum markup for gasoline. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection enforces the law, along with local district attorneys. Violators can face forfeitures of up to $500 for first-time offenders and $2,500 for repeated violations, but there is no active monitoring of pricing since the agency only investigates based on complaints. For example, someone filed a complaint in 2015 when Meijer, new to the area, was selling bulk instant coffee for $4.98, the Milwaukee Business Journal reported. But no one has been fined for such a violation in at least a decade, said Ti Gauger, spokesman for the department. So what exactly is banned? Limits on retailers The law is best known for its effect on prices for gas, alcohol and tobacco products. Each of these must be marked up 3% above cost by the wholesaler and 6% by the retailer, the statute says.  But the law also says all other products cannot be sold below the seller’s cost under a section titled ""illegality of loss leaders.""  It says sales under cost ""with the intent or effect of inducing the purchase of other merchandise or of unfairly diverting trade from a competitor, impairs and prevents fair competition, injures public welfare and is unfair competition. … Such sales are prohibited."" As proof of Kooyenga’s claim, spokesman Chris Rochester pointed to the statutory wording above and a 2017 memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau that summarized the law as generally prohibiting sales below cost. That said, the statute does offer a number of exceptions where sales below cost are allowed, including sales for charity, under court order or as part of a government contract. These are the other five exceptions spelled out in the law: 1.       ""Bona fide"" clearance sales 2.       Prices set to match a competitor’s documented price 3.       Perishable merchandise 4.       Damaged or discontinued merchandise 5.       Pre-closing liquidations sales Statutes can be open to some interpretation, but we’ll assume the ""clearance sales"" referenced are where retailers are clearing out excess stock, or making way for new stock. And doorbusters won’t always involve matching a competitor’s documented price. The other three wouldn’t apply to doorbusters. That leaves a swath of low-priced specials that would appear to violate the law if below cost. But that’s a key if. It’s often assumed that doorbuster deals like those on Black Friday are sold below cost, as referenced in reports published by CNBC, the Washington Post and others. But Jerry O’Brien, an expert on retail industry trends at the University of Wisconsin, said the actual invoice cost is ""incredibly difficult"" to pin down. That’s because agreements between vendors and retailers often depend on many factors outside of actual production cost. They can factor in whether one side is providing advertising, whether the vendor provides in-store services, such as keeping the item stocked, and how returns are handled. For example, the vendor could lower the price by a set percentage if the retailer agrees to simply discard returns instead of sending them back to the vendor. ""I’m really not sure anyone in the state is openly breaking the law. I’d say the law has a lot of room for wiggle,"" said O’Brien, executive director of the Kohl’s Center for Retailing Excellence. ""When you’ve got these giant vendors selling to these giant retailers, they’re negotiating some amazing invoices that would probably stand up (to the law’s requirements)."" Kooyenga’s office did not respond to a request for evidence of specific retailers that have sold below cost in Wisconsin. Our ruling Kooyenga said in a letter to constituents that ""many doorbuster deals and holiday shopping specials are technically against the law."" The Unfair Sales Act does generally ban prices below cost in Wisconsin, with some exceptions. And there have been reports over time of stores offering loss-leaders or below-cost prices to get customers through the door. But Kooyenga’s claim assumes Wisconsin retailers actually routinely sell doorbusters below cost.

Joe Biden says he got Republicans to vote for Obamacare and the stimulus bills. Barely
","Former Vice President Joe Biden said the next president has to unite the country, and having a solid plan for big problems isn’t enough. ""We need someone with proven ability to bring people together and do the hard work of getting legislation passed,"" Biden said at a Dec. 13 rally in San Antonio, Texas. ""I have done that before — finding the Republican votes for the Recovery Act, Obamacare, helping us from falling into a Great Depression."" Given Biden’s emphasis on uniting the country, a reasonable interpretation is that he was talking about bringing together Democrats and Republicans. Biden’s staff told us he was talking broadly about his track record of passing key legislation, not necessarily to have won support from Republicans. To the extent this was about bipartisanship, the two bills he picked don’t prove his point. When the Democrats took the White House and both houses of Congress in 2009, they inherited a nation on a steep slide into the Great Recession. Their first major act was to pass a bill to kickstart the economy, the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The bill passed 60 to 38, the number needed to avoid a filibuster, with just three Republican senators voting in favor: Maine’s Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania. Not a single Republican in the House backed the bill. Biden pushed for passage; so did President Barack Obama and the rest of the Democratic leadership. Republicans said a stimulus was needed. They also said the Democratic package cost twice what was needed. ""This is one of the most expensive pieces of legislation Congress has ever approved,"" said then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Feb. 13, 2009. ""This isn't Monopoly money. It is real. It adds up. It has to be paid back by our children and their children."" As for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, the sweeping health care reform bill passed in 2010 with zero Republican votes in both the Senate and the House. The bill needed to pass in the Senate with a 60-vote veto-proof majority, which it got. Biden lobbied fellow Democrats to back the measure, but again, so did other Democratic leaders. Biden said cited the 2009 economic recovery bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act as proof that he can ""bring the country together."" At most, those legislative wins show Biden can bring Democrats together. The vote totals showed minimal to no bipartisanship. The recovery bill was opposed by every Republican except for three in the Senate. There was no Republican support in either chamber for Obamacare.  We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Joe Biden, San Antonio rally, Dec. 13, 2019', 'https://youtu.be/s0m4aSO6EOE?t=1337'), ('U.S. Congress, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Feb. 17, 2009', 'No link'), ('U.S. Congress, Congressional Record - ARRA Conference Report, Feb. 13, 2009', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1/text'), ('U.S. Congress, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, March 23, 2010', 'No link'), ('Interview, Michael Gwin, rapid response deputy director, Biden for President, Dec. 17, 2019', 'https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2288-1')]",/factchecks/2019/dec/18/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-he-got-republicans-vote-obamacare-a/

Tucker Carlson falsely claims immigrants are dirtying the Potomac River
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson ripped into immigrants in the nation’s capital, accusing them without evidence of contaminating the Potomac River. In an interview with the Atlantic, Carlson said he’s been fishing in the river, which stretches from West Virginia into the Chesapeake Bay, for almost 35 years. ""It has gotten dirtier and dirtier and dirtier and dirtier,"" he said. ""I go down there, and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants."" Asked how he knew immigrants were to blame, Carlson added: ""Because I’m there. I watch it."" We found that Carlson’s claim is at odds with data collected by activists devoted to keeping the Potomac clean, who told us that the river has actually gotten cleaner over time.  Plus, there’s no evidence that immigrants are especially to blame for any trash floating around the river’s waters. (Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.) The Potomac River has long been considered too polluted for swimming, particularly in and around Washington, D.C., where Carlson lives. Its waters were so bad that in 1965, former President Lyndon Johnson declared the river a ""national disgrace."" But a 2018 report from the Potomac Conservancy, a nonprofit clean-water advocate in the region, found that the Potomac’s overall health has improved dramatically in the last 10 years. Hedrick Belin, president of the group, blasted Carlson for his ""groundless accusation"" in a statement to PolitiFact, calling the Fox News host’s comments ""factually incorrect"" and ""racist."" ""For the first time in generations, we are within reach of fully enjoying a healthy, thriving Potomac River,"" Belin said, noting that river pollutants are in decline as fish are returning. Other experts agreed. ""This is a river that's getting cleaner and cleaner, not 'dirtier and dirtier,'"" said Philip Musegaas, vice president of programs and litigation for the Potomac Riverkeeper Network. The nonprofit called Carlson’s claim ""dead wrong"" in a Facebook post. Musegaas said plans to upgrade the sewer systems in Washington and Alexandria, Va., should eliminate the ""last sources of untreated sewage pollution"" in the nearby metropolitan area. Curtis Dalpra, communications manager for the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, said different environmental issues affect different parts of the river, which is more than 380 miles long. But generally speaking, the river is cleaner than it was 30 years ago. Still, Carlson was talking specifically about litter, so we also reached out to the Alice Ferguson Foundation, which organizes annual trash cleanups along the riverside and keeps tabs on the total amount of trash and recyclables its volunteers haul out of the Potomac’s shores each year. According to the foundation’s data, less litter was collected in 2019 than in 2007, even as the number of volunteers increased. Specifically, the number of trash-and-recyclable-filled bags per volunteer dropped from an average of 2.14 bags in 2007 to 1.20 in 2019.  At Fletchers’ Cove — a spot that, according to the Washington Post, is roughly a 10-minute drive from Carlson’s house — the average number of bags-per-volunteer went from roughly 2.11 in 2007 to about 1.32 in 2019. Local experts also cast doubt on Carlson’s claim that immigrant litter was at fault. For starters, litter is not the top pollutant soiling the Potomac River’s waters. Belin said nutrients and sediment that flow off the land are the main causes for concern. When they hit the water, they harm wildlife, degrade habitats and taint the water, making it less clean and safe.  Litter is still an issue. But foreign-born people — who make up roughly 14% of the population in Washington, D.C., according to the Census Bureau — are not uniquely prone to littering. ""Littering is definitely a problem, but it is a problem that knows no color or ethnicity,"" Musegaas said. ""Tourists litter, residents litter, and people fishing and boating on the river litter."" Not only that, but most of the trash that ends up in the Potomac River is not deposited directly, experts said. Often, trash left in the street or outside in barrels gets swept by rain into the sewer or the river. Of course, that trash has to come from someone, Dalpra noted. At some point, it was thrown on the ground or stuffed in the trash. And in a dense city like Washington, there’s likely more litter to go around than elsewhere. But that litter ""is really a problem that spans society,"" Dalpra said. While we won’t discount the possibility that Carlson has spotted immigrants tossing trash in the Potomac, there’s no evidence that the litter ""is left almost exclusively by immigrants."" Carlson said the Potomac River ""has gotten dirtier and dirtier and dirtier and dirtier. I go down there and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants."" The available data shows the opposite; the Potomac has actually gotten cleaner. And there’s no evidence to suggest that immigrants are most responsible for the remaining litter in the river.  We rate this statement Pants on Fire!","[('The Atlantic, ""What Does Tucker Carlson Believe?""

Nancy Pelosi claims 200K “will be prohibited from voting” in Wisconsin. That's wrong.
","Up to 234,000 Wisconsin residents are at risk of being removed from the voter rolls, a political lightning-rod that has drawn national attention given the state’s critical role in the 2020 presidential election. Wisconsin election officials believe those people may have moved, so they sent letters inquiring about their status in October. A series of ensuing lawsuits and court actions have sought to more quickly remove these people from the voting rolls -- or delay that from happening. The controversy caught the attention of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat. A Twitter account described as Pelosi’s ""political account"" retweeted a statement from Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler and then offered its own take on the situation. ""It’s beyond alarming that more than 200,000 registered Wisconsin voters will be prohibited from voting,"" the tweet said. The tweet does not appear to have been sent by Pelosi herself, since it was not signed with her initials, a style referenced in the account description. There’s clearly room for disagreement over how to handle the 234,000 voters. But Pelosi’s claim is a significant exaggeration of what’s at stake. Here’s why. The background The controversy began in October 2019 when the Wisconsin Elections Commission sent letters to 234,000 voters it believed may have moved because of information it received from the post office, Division of Motor Vehicles or other government entities. That’s 7% of the 3.3 million registered voters in the state. The letters asked recipients to re-register at their new address if they had moved or to confirm they were still at their same address if they hadn't. Related: Here's what Wisconsin voters should do to ensure they're registered properly All of this is a big deal in Wisconsin, a state President Donald Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016, a key factor in his victory. Officials have refused to release the names of those who received the letters, but a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis of the mailings showed 55% went to municipalities won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. A higher percentage of voters received the mailings in traditional Democratic strongholds, such as Milwaukee, Madison and many college towns. Voting roll cleanup in Wisconsin Map shows the distribution by county of letters sent by the Wisconsin Elections Commission in an effort to clean up Wisconsin voter rolls. About 55% of mailers were sent to municipalities that supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. (Letters sent to municipalities that bridge multiple counties were counted in the county where most of the population lives) Design: Eric Litke, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
Source: Wisconsin Elections Commission  State officials want to put off forcing people off the rolls until 2021, not wanting to affect the 2020 election since they aren’t certain all of those people actually moved. Indeed, as of Dec. 5, 2019, the Elections Commission said 2,300 recipients had responded to the letter to report they still lived at the same address. By that point, 16,500 recipients had also registered to vote at new addresses, and 60,000 letters had been returned as undeliverable. But a lawsuit brought in November by three voters with the help of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty argued election officials were required to remove voters from the rolls 30 days after sending the letters if they hadn't heard from them. On Dec. 13, 2019, an Ozaukee County judge ruled those people should be removed immediately. Four days later, Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed notice the state would appeal and seek to stay the judge’s ruling. The same day, the left-leaning League of Women Voters of Wisconsin filed suit in federal court to try to stop voter names from being purged. So what happens to the 234,000 voters? The claim by Pelosi, via her Twitter account, is that they will be ""prohibited"" from voting.  But anyone in this group has multiple opportunities to regain their status as registered voters. Voters who are removed from the rolls — correctly or not — can re-register online, at their clerk's office or even at the polls on Election Day. Wisconsin is one of 21 states that allows voters to register at their polling place the day of the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Addressing this at the polls would mean filling out paperwork and providing proof of residence such as a driver's license, property tax bill, utility bill, bank statement, paycheck stub, lease or workplace ID. That means some people — we have no idea how many — could be unable to vote if they can’t provide proof of residence at the polls and don’t re-register beforehand. The Pelosi tweet was made in the context of the 2020 election, but the next chance for Wisconsin residents to vote is the spring primary on Feb. 18, 2020. So it does leave a narrow window to get reregistered before the election. That said, the 234,000 people who received the letter are not prohibited from voting. The Elections Commission stated this explicitly in the Oct. 10, 2019, announcement that the letters were being sent. ""This mailing is designed to help people who may have moved within Wisconsin make sure they’re ready to vote next year,""  said Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin’s chief elections official. ""It will not keep anyone eligible from voting.""  When asked for evidence supporting the tweet, a Pelosi spokesman acknowledged the ability to re-register but largely reiterated the same overstated claim. ""Of course, if people re-register, they will be able to vote,"" said Jorge Aguilar. ""If the purge goes through, people will be de-registered and not be allowed to vote."" Weighing in on the Wisconsin voter rolls controversy, Pelosi says these 200,000-plus people ""will be prohibited from voting."" That’s a major overstatement of how this actually works. Yes, the pruning process — if allowed by the courts — could potentially remove more than 200,000 people from the voting rolls before the upcoming elections. But there is no punitive element that would ban future voting. Everyone can re-register, even on Election Day. The use of the word ""prohibited,"" in particular, goes too far, in that it suggests there is no way to vote in the future. We rate Pelosi’s claim Pants on Fire.","[('Nancy Pelosi (Team Pelosi twitter account),\xa0tweet, Dec. 17, 2019', 'https://twitter.com/TeamPelosi/status/1206976392665149441'), ('Wisconsin Elections Commission, State of Wisconsin Mails Letters to Voters Who May Have Moved, Oct. 10, 2019', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Judge orders state to purge more than 200,000 Wisconsin voters from the rolls, Dec. 13, 2019', 'https://elections.wi.gov/node/6587'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Effort to stop removal of 234K voter registrations heads to federal court, while attorney general tries to stall purge in state court, Dec. 17, 2019', 'No link'), (""Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, A judge ordered the state to purge more than 200,000 voters from the rolls.

California Firefighters ‘Spoke Out’ Against Trump? Claim In Biden Ad Is True.
","Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden attacked President Trump in a new digital campaign ad, which claims California firefighters ""spoke out"" against the president over his controversial tweet during the state’s deadly November 2018 wildfires.  Trump’s tweet, which was his first public comment on the fires, blamed the state’s poor ""forest management"" for the infernos and threatened to withhold federal funding.  Biden’s ad includes images of California burning and the head of the state’s largest firefighters union calling Trump’s statement ""idiotic.""   ""Firefighters say the tweet contained so much misinformation, they had to speak out,"" the ad claims.  Is Biden’s ad right? Did California firefighters, beyond the union president, really criticize Trump during the wildfires? We set out on a fact check.    The Camp Fire rages through Paradise, Calif., on Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. Noah Berger / AP Photo Background on the fires The ad references Northern California’s Camp Fire and Southern California’s Woolsey Fire, both of which broke out in November 2018.  The Camp Fire killed 86 people in Butte County and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures, including 14,000 homes, making it the state’s most deadly and destructive wildfire in history. The Woolsey Fire killed three people and destroyed more than 1,600 structures.  Here’s Trump’s tweet from Nov. 10, 2018:  Shortly after, PolitiFact California fact-checked Trump’s claim that forest management is the sole reason for the fires. We rated it False.  Forestry and climate experts told us stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions driven by climate change are also making California’s fires worse. They said forest management is one factor, but not necessarily the driving force.  In another tweet two days later, Trump thanked California’s firefighters and first responders. He also approved California's request for a major disaster declaration, freeing up federal aid for fire response and recovery. Criticism from firefighters The most vocal fire leader to criticize Trump was Brian Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters. Rice is shown in the Biden ad saying ""That statement was idiodic,"" referring to Trump’s tweet. The comments were lifted from an interview Rice did with a San Francisco TV news station. In the full interview, he added: ""It was ill timed. And it’s ignorant. It’s a statement of an ignorant man. … I love my country. I am proud to be an American. But I am disgusted with my president.""  In an interview this week, Rice called Biden's ad ""fair and accurate."" A union spokesperson said Rice ""clearly spoke out,"" citing a formal statement he issued at the time. ""The statement pretty clearly indicates that Mr. Rice believes Mr. Trump’s tweet was misinformed,"" he said. Rice said his chapter fully supports the decision of its national union to endorse Biden’s 2020 presidential bid. The International Association of Fire Fighters announced its support for Biden in April.  Biden is in a virtual tie with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren among likely voters in California’s Democratic primary, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls.    A spokesperson for Biden’s campaign attributed all of the ad’s statements, including the claim that firefighters spoke out against the president, to news coverage. The claim in question, that ""Firefighters say the tweet contained so much misinformation, they had to speak out,"" comes directly from a TV reporter narrating a news story.  We found Rice wasn’t the only fire leader to criticize Trump’s words.  The Biden ad includes a brief clip of Los Angeles Fire Chief Daryl Osby, pulled from a separate TV interview. In it, he says the state is ""in extreme climate change right now."" That by itself isn’t a biting critique. But Osby goes on to say in his full interview: ""I personally find that statement unsatisfactory … It’s very hurtful for all first responders that are putting their lives on the line to protect lives and property.""  Tom O’Connor, president of the San Francisco Fire Local 798, also criticized Trump’s tweet, telling a TV station after asked about the tweet that, ""Now is not the time for politics. It’s a time for leadership. It’s not the ‘red and blue states of America.’ It’s the United States of America.""  Finally, Scott Austin, president of the Pasadena Firefighters Association said in a tweet: ""Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong.  The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management. Come to SoCal and learn the facts & help the victims. Scott Austin, Pres IAFF 809."" The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  Our ruling Former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden attacked President Trump in a recent campaign ad over his comments last year on California’s deadly wildfires. The Biden ad claimed California firefighters ""spoke out"" against the president over a controversial tweet he made as the fires raged. The tweet included a threat to withhold federal funds.   The ad shows two fire leaders, including the president of the state’s largest firefighter union, speaking out when asked about Trump’s statements. Full interviews with those leaders show they went on to make even stronger critiques of Trump. Additional news reports show other top fire leaders calling out the president’s tweet as misinformed and an inappropriate use of politics during a time of crisis.  This backs up the main assertion about firefighters speaking out.

Image of 1800s-era drug store with marijuana plant sign isn’t legitimate
","A viral social media post shows an old, black-and-white photograph of a drug store with a marijuana leaf painted above its entrance. Text above the photo reads: ""They say history repeats itself."" The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo isn’t legitimate.  A reverse-image search led us to a February 2009 post on the website Deviant Art, where the image was shared under the description tags of mash-ups, pop culture and memes. Multiple comments on the page congratulate the poster on the photo manipulation, and one commenter asks for a link to the original photograph, to which the poster replies that they can’t find it anymore. The manipulated image also appears on meme websites, including a page of altered mashup images. However, the notion that marijuana was used for medicinal purposes in the 1800s isn’t wrong. According to PBS, the U.S.-marijuana relationship dates back to the Colonial Era, and it wasn’t until the 1930s that the government started to criminalize the drug: ""American production of hemp was encouraged by the government in the 17th century for the production of rope, sails, and clothing. (Marijuana is the mixture of dried, shredded flowers and leaves that comes from the hemp plant.) Domestic production flourished until after the Civil War, when imports and other domestic materials replaced hemp for many purposes. In the late 19th century, marijuana became a popular ingredient in many medicinal products and was sold openly in public pharmacies."" Nevertheless, this photo does not appear to be authentic.

No, Virginia didn’t announce it was ending youth hunting
","As Democrats won control of the Virginia legislature in November, an image started to spread online showing a child in hunting hear holding a dead deer.  One such post published on Facebook Nov. 8 says: ""Yesterday Virginia announced the end of youth hunting!

However, the state’s Department of Game and Inland Fisheries wrote in a Nov. 8 Facebook post that it ""wanted to clear up some rumors that have been circling about youth hunting in Virginia.""  ""There are no changes to currently scheduled youth hunting days,"" the post says. ""All current laws and regulations pertaining to hunting in Virginia are in effect as shown on the DGIF website and the current Hunting & Trapping in Virginia Digest. Any changes to hunting laws would require action either by the Virginia General Assembly or the Board of Game and Inland Fisheries, and currently no such changes are proposed.""  In November, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, announced that in the upcoming legislative session he would push for gun control measures like ""getting rid of bump stocks"" and reintroducing red flag laws designed to remove firearms from people deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others. After a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, Northam introduced eight policy proposals and called a special session to address gun control, but no action was taken before it was adjourned by Republicans, CNN reported.   The proposals included ""legislation enhancing the punishment for allowing access to loaded, unsecured firearm by a child from a Class 3 Misdemeanor to a Class 6 felony,"" according to July a press release, and raising ""the age of the child from 14 to 18.""  Outdoors writer Ken Perrotte wrote a Nov. 27 column in the Free Lance-Star, a newspaper in Fredericksburg, Va., warning that ""proposed legislation would be trouble for Virginia hunters.""  One bill for the upcoming 2020 session, writes Perrotte, ""would make it a felony to leave loaded, unsecured firearms where anyone under the age 18 could access them. This bill also contains a bombshell provision that makes it a crime for anyone under age 18 to use a firearm without adult supervision. Presumably, this includes hunting scenarios."" The proposed legislation says it would be unlawful for anyone ""to recklessly leave a loaded, unsecured firearm in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any person under the age of 18."" But a spokeswoman for the governor’s office told the Associated Press that ""a responsible hunter — regardless of age — would not be affected by this bill.""  The bill also says it would be unlawful for anyone younger than 21 to ""knowingly and intentionally possess or transport a handgun or assault firearm anywhere in the Commonwealth."" However, that wouldn’t apply to ""any person actually engaged in lawful hunting or going to and from a hunting or preserve,"" according the proposed legislation.

NC Lt. Governor makes baseless claim about immigration violence
","North Carolina politicians are divided over what should be done with undocumented immigrants after they’re arrested.  After the 2018 election, a new wave of Democratic sheriffs vowed to halt their jails’ practice of holding undocumented immigrants on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE. The sheriffs’ position: if a judge or magistrate grants a person’s release, he or she should be released -- regardless of immigration status. In response, some Republicans said the sheriffs were endangering public safety, and the GOP-controlled North Carolina legislature passed a bill that would require sheriffs to comply with ICE requests. But Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it.  Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who’s running for governor against Cooper, recently spoke at a press conference about the impact of the Democrats’ decisions. Speaking about immigrants wanted by ICE, Forest encouraged the media to use certain terms. ""Please think carefully about the words that you use. Many of you are going to be struggling to try not to use words like illegal and alien and words like criminal and rapist and murder and child sex offender,"" he said. ""But if we have tens of thousands of children in our state -- tens of thousands of children in our state that have been victims of these violent criminals already, you have a lifetime, tens of thousands of lifetimes of victims in our state that are going to grow up with that on their mind."" His speech can be viewed in a YouTube video, and his claim was first flagged by the liberal American Independent website. Forest’s claim stuck out to us because it’s not specific to a number or timeframe, but loaded with a hefty accusation.  So we wondered: have undocumented immigrants victimized ""tens of thousands"" of children in North Carolina? To answer this question, we knew we’d need a credible source that tracks: violent crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the age of the victims of those crimes, and a state-level breakdown of those statistics. Contacted by PolitiFact, Forest’s campaign cited news stories about crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. But none of the stories verify Forest’s claim that ""tens of thousands"" of children have been victimized by undocumented immigrants. One big reason Forest’s claim can’t be verified: There is no federal government database or study tracking how many people have been victimized by undocumented immigrants or the age of the victims.  Forest’s campaign says they meant the word ""victim"" in a general sense as much as a legal one. We’ll get to his argument later. But first, let’s look at the legal meaning of what Forest said, and whether there’s data to back it up. ""The thing is, it’s very easy to identify individual cases and want to extrapolate up. But that is a major, major fallacy in statistics,"" said Charis E. Kubrin, professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California Irvine. She called Forest’s claim ""very vague and problematic."" A familiar claim Generally speaking, Forest’s claim is similar to others made by Republicans. President Trump, for instance, frequently expresses concern about crimes committed by immigrants who are in America illegally.  But the lack of data makes it difficult to get a clean look at claims like the one Forest made. ICE doesn’t track crimes committed by immigrants in the United States illegally, nor does it track the age of victims of those crimes, Lindsay Williams, spokeswoman for the agency, told us in an email. North Carolina-specific data isn’t available, either. Neither the NC Attorney General’s Office, the State Bureau of Investigation, nor the Department of Public Safety tracks the statistic Forest mentioned, according to spokespeople for those agencies. Texas is the only state that tracks the immigration status of those convicted on the state level, said Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.  Wrong to assume Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn emailed us a list of news stories to back up the Lt. Governor’s statement. One was a story by WBTV that details 1,020 criminal charges and 407 convictions for immigrants sought by ICE in 2019 but released from NC jails before ICE could obtain custody.  But many of those charges were for driving offenses, larceny and other nonviolent crimes. And it’s unclear whether the charged immigrants were convicted, or if their victims were children. ""Two of those examples identify children as the victim,"" Nowrasteh said. To back up his claim, Forest would ""need 10,000 times as many examples."" Dunn also suggested the word ""victim"" refers to an emotional toll on children who aren’t directly involved in a crime. He noted that, in Charlotte, ""hundreds of families were evacuated from their homes and countless thousands impacted during a 9-hour SWAT standoff with an illegal immigrant accused of kidnapping, strangulation and assault on a female."" Still, those numbers and anecdotes don’t back up Forest’s original claim.  Our ruling In a speech about immigrants in the country illegally, Forest said ""we have tens of thousands of children in our state that have been victims of these violent criminals already."" There’s no available data to support his claim. We rate it False.","[('YouTube video of Lt. Gov.

No, Texas has no plans for Santa Anna statue at Alamo
","In a lengthy Facebook post, a group called Save the Alamo warned that Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush wants to erect a statue of the Mexican general who led his nation’s forces during the Battle of the Alamo in 1836 on the grounds of the historic mission in San Antonio. Save the Alamo was created by Rick Range, a former candidate for land commissioner who challenged Bush during the 2018 Republican primary. In the post, Range described a Dec. 4 meeting of the San Antonio Historic Design and Review Commission, at which he said new information about Bush’s plans for the site came to light. ""However, during that hearing, it was revealed that not only do George P. Bush and the GLO intend on moving the Cenotaph outside the boundaries of the Alamo; they also intend to erect a statue of the dictator Santa Anna and a memorial honoring the Mexican Army!"" Range wrote. ""I am not making this up. We know that parts of the Bush plan were going to be horrendous, but it now looks like it will be worse than we ever dreamed."" It’s true that the General Land Office, which Bush heads, has proposed moving the cenotaph monument, which honors those Texans who died at the Alamo, to a different location as part of the agency’s planned $450 million project to restore the Alamo. But there are no plans to build a monument to Santa Anna and the Mexican Army at the Alamo. Bush shared a series of tweets on Thursday rebutting the allegations in the post and suggesting that the claim has racist roots. Here are his tweets, presented together: ""One must ask themselves, why am I being accused of honoring the murderous dictator Santa Anna?"" Bush wrote. "" Is it because my mother (now a naturalized citizen) is from Mexico? I was born in Houston, my wife is from San Angelo, and my boys were born-you guessed it- here in Texas. ""As a United States Navy Veteran, who deployed to Afghanistan, I know exactly what it means to be loyal to the American flag, this country and this great state. The idea that I would EVER place a statue of Santa Anna at the Alamo is patently false. Enough is enough. This is an outright lie, and is quite frankly, flat out racist.""  There is no mention of constructing a statue or monument of Santa Anna in the official synopsis of the Alamo Master Plan, the restoration project.   The only time Santa Anna is mentioned in the synopsis is during an overview of the different political factions present during the Battle of the Alamo.  San Antonio Council Member Roberto Treviño, who serves on the Alamo Master Plan Management Committee, told the Rivard Report that the statement is ""baseless, and downright ridiculous."" ""Among the information and rumors being spread about the plan for the Alamo, this might be one of the most obscene,"" he said. ""We are honoring our history; we are honoring the truth; we are honoring freedom. Erecting a statue of Santa Anna does none of these things."" Molly Quick, director of government relations for the General Land Office, gave state lawmakers a progress report on implementation of the restoration project in a Dec. 17 email. There is no mention of Santa Anna or the Mexican Army in her materials. Commission meeting video not altered During the public meeting of the San Antonio Historic Design and Review Commission on Dec. 4, designers behind the restoration project sought the commission’s approval to start implementing the first phase of the plan, which includes landscaping and street improvements — as well as the repair and relocation of the cenotaph to its new location. Range, who was not present at the meeting, said he was told by others in attendance that one of the speakers presenting the project said there were plans to ""honor Santa Anna"" at the redesigned site. ""One of the consultants on the design teams made the statement that they were going to honor both sides, including Santa Anna and the Mexican army,"" Range told PolitiFact Texas. ""If you’re going to honor somebody, that is a statue or a memorial or a monument. I don’t know how else you would honor somebody."" But multiple viewings of the archived video of the hearing reveal that none of the people presenting the project said anything about honoring Santa Anna or constructing a sculpture for him or the Mexican army. The only mention of Santa Anna came at the end of the presentation, when John Kasman, vice president of PGAV Destinations, spoke about future phases of the project and some details still under consideration. ""There are multiple stories that occurred upon that south edge that deserve to be told,"" he said, briefly mentioning the position of Santa Anna’s troops as one of those stories. Range said this was not the remark from the meeting that concerned him — in fact, he said he thought a plaque showcasing the movement of the Mexican troops during the 1836 battle would be a ""good idea"" for the site. Even though the video does not show any individual discussing a plan to ""honor"" Santa Anna, Range said he was certain the remark was made at the hearing. ""What they did was one of their typical ploys — they went through that video and redacted out that segment that caused the hubbub,"" Range said. ""They didn’t want people seeing it."" David McElroy, the studio manager of TVSA, the public access channel that airs government meetings in San Antonio, said that footage of the Dec. 4 meeting was not edited. The city uses a vendor that indexes and uploads footage from public meetings to the city’s website. If technical difficulties arise, the city may need to step in and upload its own version of the footage. Either way, McElroy said the city ""won’t ever edit a meeting for content,"" including during the Dec. 4 commission meeting. ""Is this the full record of this meeting? Absolutely,"" McElroy said. Our ruling In a Facebook post, Range said ""George P. Bush to place statue of Santa Anna at the Alamo."" This claim is inaccurate.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The woman the post identifies as Karlan appears upset and is wearing an Uncle Sam-style hat and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign logo. But the person in the image is actually Janna DeVylder, who was photographed at an election party in Australia that year.    The Des Moines Register reported in January 2017 that DeVylder grew up in Iowa and was living and working in Sydney when Clinton lost to Trump. She had voted absentee for Clinton. The picture of her watching election results quickly became a meme, and she was derided online as the ""poster child for the mentally insane Hillary snowflakes.""  We rate this Facebook post False.","[('Facebook post, Dec. 5, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1232436200283193&set=a.100607080132783&type=3&theater'), ('PolitiFact, No, viral photo of woman on costume is not law professor Pamela Karlan, Dec. 13, 2019', 'No link'), ('AP News, Photo does not show professor who testified in impeachment hearing, Dec. 6, 2019', 'https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/dec/13/viral-image/no-viral-photo-woman-costume-not-law-professor-pam/'), ('FactCheck.org, Viral photos don’t show impeachment expert, Dec. 11, 2019', 'No link'), ('News.com.au, The ‘crying’ Hillary supporter who became a meme, Jan. 16, 2017', 'https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8253490009'), ('The Des Moines Register, How a ‘crying liberal’ became global meme for those gloating over Trump win, Jan. 15, 2017', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/dec/17/viral-image/no-photo-hillary-clinton-supporter-isnt-pamela-kar/

This story about men’s testicles exploding after male birth control testing is fake
","A viral story shared on Facebook about male birth control testing — claiming that it caused men’s testicles to explode — originated on a satirical website. But some online posts don’t make that clear.  They were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  ""Male birth control testing stopped after men’s testicles start exploding in India,"" reads the headline. Readers of the story are directed to ""faceofmalawi.com"" below the headline, and ""n pas"" is cited as a source at the end of the article.  That refers to ""npas,"" which are the letters at the top of the website ihlayanews.com, where the story appeared on Dec. 3. Below ""npas"" are the words ""nuusparodie waarvan jy hou."" As AFP Fact Check notes, that’s Afrikaans for ""news parody you like.""    But the post flagged by Facebook includes no such disclaimer.  We rate it Pants on Fire!","[('News-af.op-mobile.opera.com, Male birth control testing stopped after men’s testicles start exploding in India, visited Dec. 16, 2019', 'http://news-af.op-mobile.opera.com/news/detail/2bd7fc92a200e1a1a7c3a410d6decdc3?from=share&pct=15.33&client=news&fbclid=IwAR0hCywS6joqqmRJbPQMf0mQmTKoevPCFkv_W9311brj5Sf4C46vTDjnQtw'), ('Npas, Male birth control testing stopped after men’s testicles start exploding in India, Dec. 3, 2019\xa0', 'No link'), ('AFP Fact Check, Did exploding testicles halt Indian male birth control trial?
