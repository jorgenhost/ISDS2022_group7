Florida takes billions more from Washington than it gives, Rep. Debbie Mayfield says
","Florida House members left the 2015 legislative session early over health care funding, but they’ve kept on railing against Medicaid expansion while waiting to reconvene to discuss a state budget. Rep. Debbie Mayfield, R-Vero Beach, argued against taking federal money to expand Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for the very poor, saying it wasn’t Florida’s money to take.   ""FL is NOT a donor state. Get the facts on federal spending and Medicaid expansion in FL,"" she tweeted. The tweet included an infographic that read, ""Florida sends $135 billion and D.C. returns $150 billion. It's not your hard-earned tax dollars! It's borrowed against your children’s future!"" Other House Republicans shared the same infographic, including Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island. We wondered where they were getting their numbers. Tax totals House communications director Michael Williams said the amount Florida sends comes from Internal Revenue Service gross tax collections in the state ($154 billion in 2014) minus average tax refunds, ending up at $135 billion. The amount Washington sent back came from USASpending.gov, a website that tracks federal contracts, loans, grants and public assistance. The site says the federal government spent $150 billion in Florida in fiscal year 2014. Subtract $135 billion from $150 billion, and that accounts for Florida getting $15 billion more than it puts in. But tax policy experts told us there are different ways to calculate the numbers, so it’s not as cut and dried as the House makes it out to be. Steve Ellis, vice president of watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the House’s methodology is generally sound, but he would suggest using actual tax refunds instead of average refunds. He said that would push Florida’s payout total even lower than $135 billion. On the spending side, National Priorities Project research director Lindsay Koshgarian points out that data from USASpending.gov does not give the most reliable picture available. Koshgarian said that among the site’s issues is that it does not include all grants or federal employees and operations in state spending totals. She suggested using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau would yield a more accurate total. So federal tax totals paid out of Florida may be lower than what the House is saying, while federal spending could be even higher. But our experts said that comparison still doesn’t paint a good picture of the state’s nuances. For example, Social Security and Medicare costs are disproportionately high in Florida because of the retiree population, which already paid into the system, but likely in another state. Florida has the third-largest uninsured pool in the country, with a public assistance budget to match. Also, there’s a lot of that $150 billion in Washington cash that isn’t as controversial in the House as Medicaid spending, like money for infrastructure or federal contracts for businesses like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. ""I doubt these folks are saying the state should not be taking federal highway money, just because they are taking in more than they spend,"" said Paul Van De Water, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Differences between states make it difficult to make direct comparisons, Koshgarian said. She cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to illustrate her point. ""We all need one CDC, but we don't need one in every state, so the dollars have to go somewhere,"" she said. Koshgarian said that in 2013, the last year with complete Census data, Florida received the fourth-highest total of federal grants to state government with $23.5 billion (the bulk of which was Medicaid), but was 48th among states for federal grant dollars per resident -- only Nevada and Virginia ranked lower. Those numbers mostly reflect Florida’s status as one of the more populous states. Ellis added that there’s one other thing to keep in mind to put Mayfield’s point in context: The U.S. government is always in the red these days. ""In my opinion, no state is a donor state when you consider that the budget deficit is nearly half a trillion dollars, so no one is paying their way,"" he said. Our ruling Mayfield said, ""Florida sends $135 billion and D.C. returns $150 billion."" Tax policy experts told us the House’s numbers were one way to look at it, but different data sources could yield different totals. They also said such a comparison really doesn’t illustrate the nuances of what federal money is used for in Florida or why. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC73C4C0>],/factchecks/2015/may/14/debbie-mayfield/florida-takes-billions-more-washington-it-gives-re/
"['National', 'Financial Regulation', 'Foreign Policy', 'Trade', 'Elizabeth Warren']","
Fact-checking the Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama trade fight
","President Barack Obama’s international trade agenda is moving forward in Congress, after facing temporary defeat by fellow Democrats in the Senate. Obama is butting heads with many Democrats over this issue, but his squabble with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been the most public. Most recently, Warren said if Obama gets his way on trade, it could unravel Dodd-Frank -- Obama’s hallmark financial regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis. ""In the next few weeks, Congress will decide whether to give the president fast-track authority,"" Warren said in May 5 remarks at the liberal Institute for New Economic Thinking. ""This is a long-term problem — a six-year problem. If fast-track passes, a Republican president could easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules."" Obama responded to that claim in a May 8 interview with Yahoo’s Matt Bai. ""She’s absolutely wrong,"" he said. ""Think about the logic of that, right? The notion that I had this massive fight with Wall Street to make sure that we don’t repeat what happened in 2007, 2008. And then I sign a provision that would unravel it? I’d have to be pretty stupid."" So who’s right here? We decided to dig into the substance of their arguments and see if Dodd-Frank really is in danger because of the trade debate. Buckle up. Alphabet soup A lot of media coverage has conflated two distinct aspects of the trade debate. The first is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is the trade deal that Obama is currently negotiating with several countries along the Pacific. The second is Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which is a piece of legislation that would allow trade agreements (such as the TPP) to move through Congress under special rules intended to speed up the process, thus its nickname ""fast-track."" Most trade deals since the 1970s have been accompanied by fast-track legislation. If the fast-track rules pass, Congress would not be able to amend or filibuster a trade agreement, which means the deal would only need 51 votes in the Senate to pass, as opposed to the 60 votes necessary without fast-track. And the rules would apply to all trade agreements before Congress for the next six years. Supporters say fast-track is necessary to bolster confidence among foreign partners that domestic politics won’t dismantle a trade agreement. Critics, like Warren, argue that this drastically diminishes Congress’ role in the process, to its detriment. It’s the fast-track bill that Warren said could allow future politicians to ""easily"" chip away at Dodd-Frank or any other law. This is possible in theory. Here’s how. Imagine that the next president does not support Dodd-Frank regulations. He or she could -- unlike the Obama administration -- be open to discussing Dodd-Frank as part of foreign trade negotiations. The president could bring to Congress a trade agreement that requires scaling back Dodd-Frank to comply with the agreement parameters. (Congress doesn’t vote on the agreement itself, it votes on a bill that lays out how the agreement will be implemented under U.S. law.) The administration could try to push this through without fast-track, but it would likely face opposition from members of Congress like Warren, who could try to amend or filibuster the agreement in order to maintain Dodd-Frank as is. With fast-track, the agreement wouldn’t face these hurdles. Congress’ only option would be to vote against the whole agreement -- all or nothing. If enough Dodd-Frank supporters were to decide that the trade deal is more important, the agreement could pass, watered-down regulations and all. So Warren’s prediction is possible -- not ""absolutely wrong,"" as Obama said. However, as Obama also said, ""this is pure speculation."" How big of a risk exists is a much harder question to answer. Is it easy? Those who share Warren’s position argue that under fast-track, a trade deal only needs 51 Senate votes, as opposed to 60 without fast-track, and that makes a huge difference in how easy it is to move the deal through Congress. It could be a ""backdoor means of undermining Wall Street reform,"" said Ben Beachy, global trade research director at Public Citizen, an advocacy group that sides with Warren on this issue. Beachy noted that the Trans-Pacific Partnership might hurt Dodd-Frank, because it includes certain financial parameters that mirror many of the North American Free Trade Agreement’s ""pre-crisis, deregulatory rules that threaten financial regulations"" and would expand them further. However, what’s actually in the Trans-Pacific Partnership remains secret, and the White House denies this claim. Even accounting for the Senate vote threshold, though, nearly every expert we interviewed said Warren exaggerated the threat that fast-track authority would ""easily"" allow a Republican president to dissolve Dodd-Frank. ""The risks are very small, so in that sense I agree with Obama,"" said Bill Krist, senior policy scholar at the Wilson Center and a former trade official in the early 1980s. ""But in the more literal sense of Elizabeth Warren being ‘absolutely wrong,’ I don’t."" First of all, the fast-track bill currently on the table gives members of Congress other ways to object to the negotiations, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a trade official at the Treasury in the late 1970s. It allows a bipartisan group of Congress to advise and serve as delegates. Relatedly, the fast-track bill gives Congress the ability to reject fast-track for a particular trade deal if it fails to meet certain congressional objectives. Additionally, trade negotiations take a long time, so it’s hard to envision a new president coming in, reversing the U.S. position on financial regulation, and finalizing a deal by 2021 (the end of the fast-track bill’s time frame). For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, nearing completion this year, has been in the works since 2005. ""The proposition that suddenly a trade deal is going to appear and it’s inconsistent with Dodd-Frank is not going to work,"" said Brookings Institution fellow and international trade expert Joshua Metzler, adding that the parameters of a trade deal ""are seen from miles away."" It’s also important to keep in mind that future administrations could go after Dodd-Frank through the courts, by passing domestic legislation, or through regulatory discretion -- all of which would be more much more efficient than going through international negotiations, Hufbauer said. ""It’s always possible that a future administration will do things in the financial area that she doesn’t like,"" he said. Warren argues changing regulation through trade agreements is ""hardly a hypothetical possibility"" -- there’s evidence of big banks on both sides of the Atlantic trying to push through Dodd-Frank reductions through a trade deal with the European Union currently in progress. U.S. officials, such as Trade Representative Mike Froman and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, have acknowledged the pressure coming from banks to consider changing financial regulations as part of the negotiating process. They have, however, staunchly avoided such discussions. Of course, as Warren said in her May 5 remarks, this attitude might not carry into the next administration. But even if a new administration thinks trade negotiations are the appropriate avenue for dismissing financial regulations, it might not be so simple to get all parties to agree. Some regulations in Europe in particular -- such as those affecting credit rating agencies, insurance companies and banker bonuses -- ""are more stringent than those adopted by the United States in the financial crisis,"" said Chris Brummer, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and Georgetown University law professor. One final issue We wanted to briefly address the issue of investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS), a form of international arbitrage in which an investor can bring a claim against a foreign government. It’s not 100 percent germane to the topic at hand, but it’s been getting mixed up in the discussions about the Obama-Warren trade dispute. As it stands, the Trans-Pacific Partnership will have this type of settlement system. Warren and others oppose the settlements for a number of reasons: the proceedings are secretive, and the court can impose a fine on the foreign government so large that it changes its domestic laws as a result. The classic example of an ISDS case is tobacco giant Philip-Morris suing nations over their domestic anti-smoking laws, claiming the laws damage their profits. But Warren’s staff told us that her beliefs about ISDS are separate from her position on fast-track -- she didn’t mention ISDS in her May 5 remarks, when she said the fast-track bill could derail Dodd-Frank, nor when she made the same point on PBS Newshour May 13. (She has mentioned it in the past.) Obama appears to have misinterpreted Warren’s most recent comments. In responding to them in the Yahoo interview, he said her argument ""is based on this dispute-settlement provision I just talked about. There’s no evidence that this could ever be used in this way."" That’s basically true, said Brummer, of Georgetown Law. ""Virtually all trade agreements include regulatory carve-outs that limit the jurisdiction of the courts as relating to market supervision,"" he said, so it's highly unlikely that the Trans-Pacific Partnership or a deal with the European Union would cede authority to special arbitrators to unwind hard-fought financial reforms. ""At most, one would see a process elaborated for enhanced cross-border regulatory cooperation, something you already see in some accords."" In any case, in the statement we are fact-checking, Warren was not arguing that ISDS would be cause for Dodd-Frank rollbacks, something we wanted to clarify. Our ruling Warren said proposed fast-track legislation would allow presidents to ""easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules."" It’s not entirely far-fetched that a trade deal could impact domestic financial rules -- in fact banks and some countries are pushing to make financial regulation part of ongoing negotiations with the European Union. And fast-track legislation would remove some congressional hurdles. However, that doesn’t mean the process would be easy. Negotiations take many years, and there are other obstacles that could stop watered-down financial regulations from making it into a final deal. Additionally, it is pure speculation that this fast-track bill in particular would result in scaled-back Dodd-Frank rules. We rate Warren’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC93EFC0>],/factchecks/2015/may/14/elizabeth-warren/fact-checking-elizabeth-warren-and-barack-obama-tr/
"['National', 'Climate Change', 'Homeland Security', 'Terrorism', 'Michael McCaul']","
Does Homeland Security put more money into climate change than stopping online terrorism recruiting?
","Federal officials have been warning for several years that violent Islamic extremists are using the Internet to inspire people already in America to commit acts of terror. The shootings in Garland, Texas, seemed a textbook example. According to CNN, two men in Arizona responded to social media from overseas and set out to gun down people at an anti-Islamic gathering. Although the FBI had been tracking one of the men and had alerted Texas law enforcement, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, faults the White House for not doing enough to stop this kind of activity in the first place. ""I think (FBI) Director James Comey is spot on when he talks about the threat inside the United States,"" McCaul said May 10, 2015, on Fox News Sunday. ""And yet this administration, its budget allocates zero dollars towards combating homegrown violent extremism. In fact, within the Department of Homeland Security, more money, in fact, millions of dollars, are dedicated to climate change rather than combating what I consider to be one of the biggest threats to the homeland, and that's the violent extremists radicalizing Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America."" McCaul’s statement might strike you as sweeping -- we spend more money on climate change than domestic terrorism threats. But in reality it’s a tightly scripted message comparing spending within the Department of Homeland Security on climate change to the money spent preventing Islamist terrorists from using the Internet to spread messages in the United States. Through that small window, McCaul’s claim is right on the numbers. But that ignores all that’s going on at the FBI and other federal agencies. The Department of Homeland Security budget Each year, federal agencies send Congress a fairly specific justification for the amount of money they want and how they plan to spend it. McCaul’s staff pointed us to the Homeland Security department’s submission for fiscal year 2016, which included $10 million ""for analyses of climate change impacts on infrastructure critical to national and economic security, and national public health and safety."" Climate change programs show up elsewhere in the DHS budget, bundled in with other initiatives. There is $6 million in the Federal Emergency Management Agency budget (which is part of homeland security) for ""climate workshops and regional resilience coordination"" done by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. So, on the low-end, the Department of Homeland Security asked for $10 million for climate change and maybe more. What’s the request for dealing with radicalizing over the Internet? The administration’s budget documents don’t show much. We found $275,000 to cover travel to send staff to a number of cities such as Houston, Atlanta and Chicago to draw more people into the discussion of how to spot and prevent radicalization. We saw $1 million budgeted for a database to analyze past violent extremist incidents and see what sort of programs work best to head off attacks. A House Homeland Security Committee spokeswoman told us that there are four to eight full-time staff assigned to countering violent extremism. The department has a senior level official who serves as the coordinator of Countering Violent Extremism, but his office has no separate line item in the budget. All together, at the outside, the budget submissions show less than $2 million focused on stopping radicals from attracting recruits over the Internet. The bigger picture As we noted, McCaul was talking about a very specific type of terrorism spending -- to prevent terrorist recruiting over the Internet. But there’s plenty more spending inside the Department of Homeland Security as it relates to detecting, investigating and thwarting terrorists. The Department of Homeland Security asked for $57 million in 2016 just for technology programs to counter terrorists. It wants another $14 million to detect and predict hostile activity. Part of its $1 billion National Preparedness Grant Program to state and local governments could be spent on projects to spot early signs of terrorist planning. Extending matters into other parts of the federal government pulls in many additional programs. The FBI would like $1.9 billion and over 7,000 staff to focus on counterterrorism. It’s Intelligence Division seeks $1.6 billion to ""prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist operations before they occur."" The Justice Department would like $30 million for its own intelligence work, and another $14 million to target and disrupt homegrown threats. The State Department recently received $188 million to directly engage on the social media front to undermine violent extremism. Our ruling McCaul said that the Homeland Security budget has more money dedicated to climate change than combating the violent extremists radicalizing Islamist terrorists over the Internet. That is a very narrow comparison. It concerns only the Homeland Security Department and only programs designed to prevent Islamic extremists’ use of the Internet. Within that limited frame, McCaul’s comparison holds up. However, any complete analysis would show that federal departments and agencies spend significantly more money targeting terrorists than they do targeting climate change. McCaul's statement needs that additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB863480>],/factchecks/2015/may/14/michael-mccaul/does-homeland-security-put-climate-change-above-on/
"['Rhode Island', 'Climate Change', 'History', 'Science', 'Weather', 'David Cicilline']","
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline: Precipitation in Rhode Island has risen by just over a foot in 100 years
","People who warn that humanity is dramatically changing Earth's climate invoke several indicators to prove their point. They note the rise in sea levels, the increase in global temperature and the growing acidification of the oceans. In a May 1, 2015, commentary in The Providence Journal, U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, along with Michael Shank, director of media strategy for Climate Nexus, a group devoted to warning about climate change, invoked those warning signs, and more. ""Global warming is happening, here and now. Its impact is already being felt in coastal states like Rhode Island, and greenhouse gas emissions are undeniably responsible,"" they said. Cicilline and Shank argued that, ""Greater annual precipitation, which has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century, also means movement and mixing of pollutants, nutrients, contaminants and salinity levels, all of which can critically undermine marine productivity."" We know we've seen some wet years recently, but we also know how variable weather can be from year to year. So the statistic in that paragraph made us wonder -- has precipitation in the state actually increased by more than a foot over the past 100 years? When we contacted Cicilline's office to ask for the source of the claim, spokeswoman Alex Macfarlane directed us to two publications. The first is a four page fact sheet from the University of Rhode Island's Sea Grant program which says, ""In Rhode Island, precipitation has increased by over 12 inches since 1905, mostly during non-summer months."" Because the undated sheet refers to a weather event in 2012, it's clear that the ""over 12 inches"" is referring to a time span of at least 107 years. The second piece of evidence was from a 2008 book, ""Science for Ecosystem-Based Management: Narragansett Bay in the 21st Century."" In the second chapter, Michael Pilson of URI's Graduate School of Oceanography reports that annual precipitation data from Providence and Warwick from 1905 to 2006 show an increase of 13 inches. That's over 102 years. So Cicilline was citing a good source, although the data are eight years old. To determine if the trend is true today -- and the congressman made it sound like he was talking about current precipitation numbers -- we downloaded the National Weather Service data through 2014. Rainfall and melted snow totals can vary dramatically year to year, so we used Microsoft Excel to calculate a trend line using the last 100 years, beginning in 1914. The increase: 11.9 inches. And if you take the data back to 1905, a longer time than Cicilline was citing, the increase is 13.5 inches. The trend line (not the actual precipitation amounts) goes from 36.3 inches in 1905 to 49.8 inches in 2014. That's a 31 percent increase in precipitation in the past century; 37 percent since 1905. The months that have seen the greatest precipitation increases are March, October and November. The only month with a decrease has been July, and it's been slight. In summary, David Cicilline said annual precipitation ""has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century."" Reliable but slightly out-of-date sources back him up. The 100-year increase we calculated going through 2014 is just a tenth of an inch shy of 12 inches, but the difference between that and being slightly over 12 inches is just a few drops in the bucket. Thus, we rate the claim as True.

Mike Huckabee and the diabetes cure he endorsed that 'no health agency supports'
","Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is distancing himself from the unusual ways he earned money before announcing his White House run May 5, but journalists aren’t letting the former Arkansas governor off the hook. Huckabee, who shed about 100 pounds after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, filmed TV and radio infomercials advertising a program to ""reverse"" diabetes in February and March. Huckabee also lent his email list to carry ads about a looming food shortage and a cancer cure found in the Bible. CBS’ Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer tried to pin Huckabee down on his business dealings during a May 10 interview that followed a critical column about ""Huckabee’s Hucksterism"" by National Journal’s Ron Fournier. Huckabee got testy as he explained the program he endorsed is more about healthy eating than dietary supplements. A bit later, Schieffer moved on to Fournier during a pundit panel discussion for a response. ""As you know, there was more to that, and I really like the way you kind of put him on his heels and he had to filibuster you,"" Fournier said. ""He -- his endorsing -- the infomercials that are endorsing cures and treatments that no health agency supports. He's linking cancer to cures to the Bible verse."" In other words, he said, not very presidential behavior. PunditFact wanted to dig into Fournier’s claim about Huckabee’s past. Did he shill for a shoddy diabetes ""cure"" that ""no health agency supports""? ‘Diabetes Solution Kit’ Fournier’s column references a March New York Times story about Huckabee’s ""highly unconventional income streams."" In a since-deleted video (though you can see one on the Daily Mail), Huckabee encouraged viewers to buy the Diabetes Solution Kit made by the South Dakota company Barton Publishing. In the video, Huckabee promises diabetes can be reversed (""I should know because I did it"") and condemns ""mainstream"" treatment methods of insulin injections and prescriptions.  ""Prescription drugs aren’t going to cure you,"" Huckabee tells viewers. ""They’re only going to keep you a loyal pill-popping, finger-pricking, insulin shooting customer so Big Pharma and the mainstream medical community can rake in over $100 billion a year annually."" After explaining how he used ""the same techniques"" outlined in the Diabetes Solution Kit, Huckabee asks viewers to ""sit tight, because in a moment a free presentation is coming up that’ll show you everything you need to know about the Diabetes Solution Kit so you can discover all the natural secrets that are backed by real science that really work."" That free presentation lasts more than 30 minutes, kicking off with a spokesman named Lon showing a picture of cinnamon rolls that ""contain a real ingredient that reverses diabetes"" and going on to berate insulin, diabetes pills and other injectables as treatments. (We sat through it so you don’t have to.) The kit turns out to be booklets offering tips for eating, exercise, and yes, formulating dietary supplements — for the low, low price of $19.97. ""We don’t sell pills,"" said Barton Publishing chief marketing officer Marty Fahncke. ""We sell books that do, in fact, teach people how to reverse their diabetes."" However, the video discusses at length the ""Double C Diabetes Remedy"" of cinnamon and chromium picolinate, which is described as a ""weird, spice, kitchen cabinet cure"" that ""will allow you to live life just like when you didn’t have diabetes at all."" Lon the narrator calls this precise combination of cinnamon and chromium picolinate a ""cornerstone"" of the system.  Huckabee’s campaign did not return an email seeking comment for this story. Huckabee told Schieffer that he is no longer doing the infomercials as a presidential candidate. The Barton Publishing press release about Huckabee’s endorsement deal says he was ""given just 10 years to live"" by a doctor who diagnosed him with Type 2 diabetes in 2004. This contradicts Huckabee’s own account of his diagnosis as documented by the media. According to the Associated Press, Huckabee was diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes in 2002. He lost 50 pounds within about two months after following a diet created by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. By 2004, he had lost 100 pounds through healthy eating and fitness.  Newspaper accounts contain no mention of a cinnamon and chromium compound helping Huckabee through, and Huckabee is careful in the video to avoid saying he followed the Diabetes Solution Kit. The closest he gets is saying the he ""used the same techniques to lose 110 pounds of fat, get my own blood sugar under control, and completely reverse my Type 2 diabetes."" Position of diabetes associations So that’s the diabetes solution Huckabee was being paid to promote. The question is: Do health agencies say it works? The New York Times story describes the American Diabetes Association and Canadian Diabetes Association as warning that dietary and herbal supplements ""are ineffective for treating diabetes,"" linking to a page of only the American group’s website. The ADA’s Diabetes.org page is slightly more nuanced than outright calling the supplements ineffective, but nowhere does it signal support for herbal remedies: ""It is best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat. In fact, research has not been able to prove that dietary or herbal supplements (including omega-3 supplements, cinnamon, and other herbs) help to manage diabetes."" The organization cites a National Health Interview Survey that acknowledges use of herbal therapy or dietary supplements among one-fifth or one-third, respectively, of people with diabetes, especially in minority ethnic groups. The Canadian Diabetes Association was more straight-forward: It ""does not support the use of the dietary supplements advertised in these infomercials."" Fahncke of Barton Publishing sent PunditFact links to various Web pages of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Diabetes Association, Mayo Clinic, and a journal called Nutrition Research. The links either talk about the importance of a healthy diet to control diabetes (and don’t mention herbal supplements at all) or discuss small studies in China and Pakistan that showed cinnamon supplements might reduce risk factors in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Still, none of the links offer strong support for the cinnamon-chromium mixture recommended in the Diabetes Solution Kit — much less the endorsement of a reputable health agency. Other expert opinions Other endocrinologists we contacted were more blunt: The promised kitchen cabinet remedy does not work. ""There is no scientific support for herbal treatments in the care of diabetes,"" said Dr. Domenico Accili, Columbia University professor medicine and director of the Columbia University Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center. ""The concoction of cinnamon and chromium has been sold for many years, and it’s pure quackery."" Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, a past president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and attending physician in the endocrinology, diabetes and bone disease division of New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital, said even though chromium and cinnamon are ""associated with salutary effects on glucose and insulin physiology in animals and in vitro,"" there are insufficient clinical data to back up a recommendation for the product. Even though consuming either the spice cinnamon or mineral chromium picolinate is inherently low risk, Mechanick said, there are several reasons to avoid the combined product, including insufficient regulation and a lack of strong science. ""The philosophy of using (dietary supplements and nutraceuticals) to manage diabetes instead of proven lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies is harmful,"" he said. Food and Drug Administration spokesman Eric Pahon said people who ""rely on products which have not been reviewed by FDA for safety and efficacy"" — e.g. Diabetes Solution Kit’s cinnamon and chromium picolinate recommendation — ""may place themselves at increased risk of poorly controlled diabetes and other risks."" Our ruling Fournier said ""no health agencies support"" the ""cures and treatments"" that Huckabee endorsed in an infomercial promising diabetes reversal. Health groups and physicians that specialize in diabetes told us they do not support the approach to ""reversing diabetes"" outlined in the Diabetes Solution Kit that Huckabee used to endorse. We rate Fournier’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC926200>],/factchecks/2015/may/13/ron-fournier/mike-huckabee-and-diabetes-cure-he-endorsed-no-hea/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Does the United States have the highest number of immigrants as Marco Rubio says?
","The United States leads the world in terms of the number of immigrants it allows to enter the country, says U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. ""We have a legal immigration system in America that accepts 1 million people a year, legally,"" Rubio said at the National Review Forum May 1. ""No other country in the world even comes close to that."" Is Rubio correct that no other country in the world comes close to the number of legal immigrants that come to the United States each year? Legal immigration First, some background on Rubio’s efforts to change the nation’s immigration laws. Rubio and seven other senators crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate in 2013. The bill included a pathway to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants, albeit one with significant hurdles. But the House wasn’t interested in that approach, and after that died, Rubio said he still favored changing immigration law through piecemeal bills. We sent Rubio’s spokesman a summary of our findings, and he noted a similar fact-check we did in 2012. Immigration has been such a hot topic in the 2016 presidential race, though, that we decided to take a fresh look at the numbers. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security keeps track of the number of new legal permanent residents a year, and in 2013 (the most recent year available) it was 990,553. Of this number, about 46 percent were new arrivals, and about 54 percent were people already in the United States whose status was upgraded to ""permanent."" For data on the number of new immigrants in the United States compared with other countries, we turned to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Formed in 1961, OECD collects data on a wide range of topics, including immigration. We looked at the data in two ways for 2013: first, the sheer number of legal immigrants and secondly, the number of new immigrants as a percentage of the population. Comparing the sheer number of new legal immigrants in the United States with other countries is complicated because countries use different requirements to define an ""immigrant"" for their statistics. For example, Germany -- which has had big increases in immigration in recent years -- uses a broad definition of an immigrant that catches a lot of short-term flows. That means that the figures reported by Germany are not directly comparable with those in the United States, which only counts permanent immigration, said Thomas Liebig, an OECD immigration expert. OECD standardizes the data from various countries to make them comparable with those in the United States. That process aims to count only permanent residents and exclude other categories such as seasonal workers or students. The OECD is in the process of standardizing the data for 2013, but the United States will be in the top spot for the sheer number of immigrants with nearly one million immigrants. Provisional figures by OECD show that Germany had 466,000 while the United Kingdom had 291,000. In per capita rates,the United States place 19th out of 24 countries. That means that the United States received fewer immigrants per capita in 2012-13 compared with several European countries, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. ""While the United States remains the largest destination of new permanent immigration in the OECD in absolute terms, inflows in per capita terms (i.e. relative to its population) are less than half of the OECD average,"" Liebig told PolitiFact. Several other immigration experts pointed to the OECD data but also offered additional caveats. People moving within the European Union will not necessarily get citizenship in their new country, while those in the United States given greencards can become citizens after three or five years, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. ""It is correct to say that in total number of people admitted with what I would call a ‘clear path to citizenship,’ the United States vastly exceeds all other countries. And these absolute numbers matter a great deal. One million people is still a lot of folks, whether they are 1 percent or 3 percent of a nation's population,"" he said. ""As a percentage of the population, the number who can get citizenship is still very high in the United States, but some countries are higher. What is very generous about the United States is that we give so many folks with no historical or ethnic tie to the United States a clear path to citizenship."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""We have a legal immigration system in America that accepts one million people a year, legally. No other country in the world even comes close to that."" The United States accepted just under 1 million people in 2013, the most recent numbers available. As a percentage of population, though, the United States ranked 19th out of 24 countries in 2013. Still, Rubio is correct that the overall figure puts the United States ahead of other countries. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE2C400>],/factchecks/2015/may/13/marco-rubio/does-united-states-have-highest-number-immigrants-/

Garnet Coleman said transgender individuals have a 1 in 12 chance of getting murdered
","State Rep. Garnet Coleman brought up murder in urging colleagues to add acts against transgender Texans to the state’s hate-crimes law. ""The facts do not lie,"" the Houston Democrat said in a May 6, 2015, hearing held by the Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence. Coleman, suggesting transgender Americans are more likely to be attacked, went on: ""Transgender individuals in the U.S. have a 1-in-12 chance of being murdered. The average person has a 1-in-18,000 chance."" His House Bill 2059 would add ""gender identity or expression"" to what a judge or jury could consider to declare an action a hate crime. We asked Coleman to elaborate on his declaration about the chances of a transgender resident, meaning a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth, being murdered. In a written statement we fielded by email, Coleman said the 1-in-12 figure turned out not to have a factual basis. In preparing his presentation, Coleman said, he drew the 1-in-12 element from Equality Texas, a group that says it advocates for ""full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Texans."" Coleman also told us a 2012 Human Rights Campaign press release no longer posted online publicized the seemingly unsupported 1-in-12 statistic. We shared Coleman’s response with Equality Texas and the Human Rights Campaign, which says it focuses on achieving equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Chuck Smith of Equality Texas confirmed it gave Coleman the figure. A campaign spokesman, Adam Talbot, replied by email that he couldn’t find any sign of the group bandying the 1-in-12 formulation. By phone, Coleman said: ""The information is false; it’s not verifiable."" We took our own look. Chances of a murder We recognized, for starters, that counting the number of murders across the population isn’t the same as calculating the chances of any member of a subgroup getting murdered. Various factors come into play including where someone lives and works, for instance. Regardless, Coleman told us the 1-in-18,000 general chances of murder in the United States he mentioned was based on FBI-collected figures for murders in 2000. By email, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer guided us to an agency chart showing 15,586 murders and nonnegligent homicides in 2000 when the U.S. had 281,421,906 residents, which suggests 1 in 18,056 residents were murdered. According to the most recent compiled data on the chart, in 2013, the 14,196 murders/nonnegligent homicides within the U.S. population of 316,128,839 residents suggests there was one person murdered for every 22,269 residents. Fischer pointed us to another FBI chart stating that nationally in 2013, law enforcement agencies tallied 5,928 hate-crime incidents with 1,233 incidents traced to bias against the victim’s sexual orientation. Some 277 incidents were categorized as anti-lesbian, anti-gay, anti-bisexaul, or anti-transgender, the chart says. Separately, of 31 gender-identity hate crimes, according to the chart, 23 were anti-transgender and 8 were anti-gender-nonconforming (referring to a person who does not conform to the gender-based expectations of society as in a woman dressed in traditionally male clothing or a man wearing makeup). According to another FBI chart, none of the tallied 2013 victims of anti-transgender or anti-gender-nonconforming bias hate crimes were murdered. More recently, a March 2015 web post by the Human Rights Campaign and the Trans People of Color Coalition said that between January 2015 and March 10, 2015, at least seven transgender women were murdered in the U.S--after 13 transgender women were murdered in 2014. Smith from Equality Texas suggested by email that the 1-in-12 statistic originated in a master’s degree thesis written in the 1990s by a Californian, Kay Brown, who gave a course on transgender history based on her thesis, it appeared. However, neither Smith nor we could find a copy nor did we confirm any of these details. Next, some 11 months after we published this fact check, we heard by email from Brown, who said she once reached a ""back-of-the-envelope"" estimate on the chances of an androphilic (exclusively attracted to men) male-to-female transexual person being murdered. Brown said that result, which was not in a master’s thesis, evidently morphed elsewhere into a transgender murder rate. Brown also brought to our attention her August 2013 blog post on the topic. Separately, none of several online posts pointed out by Smith identified a factual basis for the 1-in-12. Notably, a May 2012 blog post by Christina Stephens of Missouri described her failed attempts to find a substantive basis. Stephens and others writing online speculated the statistic was referring to lifetime chances of being murdered with writer Parker Marie Molloy concluding in November 2013 that if estimates of the share of U.S. residents who are transgender are accurate, it’s not numerically reasonable for the 1-in-12 figure to hold up. A 2009 web post by the Washington, D.C.-based National Center for Transgender Equality, which calls itself the ""nation’s leading social justice advocacy organization winning life-saving change for transgender people,"" said that no agencies tally transgender residents and many aren’t public about their identities, but the center estimates that up to 1 percent of the population is transsexual. Even if one presumes the 1-in 12 statistic reflects the lifetime chances of getting murdered, Molloy called it ""extremely unlikely"" to be correct. ""Far too many trans people find themselves the victims of anti-transgender violence,"" Molloy concluded, ""but luckily for us, it’s not 1 out of every 12 of us."" Other research Thinking others might have sorted this out, we turned to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs whose latest report on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and HIV-affected hate violence, published in May 2014, covered U.S. conditions the year before. The report was based on public data and information provided by 14 member-groups including the Montrose Center in Houston, which means incidents were undercounted, the authors wrote. Overall, the report said, anti-LGBTQ and HIV-affected homicides in 2013 were down 28 percent from the year before, totaling 18 compared with 25 in 2012. But for the third year in a row, the report said, ""transgender, transgender people of color, and LGBTQ and HIV-affected people of color experienced disproportionately severe violence."" Thirteen of the 2013 victims were transgender women, the report said. The report also said: ""Unfortunately, data on the prevalence of hate violence against queer, bisexual, transgender and HIV-affected people is virtually non-existent."" Also disconcerting, the report said, its 2013 report documented over 600 more survivors and victims of hate violence through 2012 than the FBI had (1,376 survivors and victims compared to 2,001 survivors and victims). We also reached Vincent Villano, spokesman for the National Center for Transgender Equality. By phone, Villano expressed unfamiliarity with the 1-in-12 figure. ""There really isn’t any data available out there,"" Villano said. Our ruling Coleman told colleagues: ""Transgender individuals in the U.S. have a 1 in 12 chance of being murdered."" We’re not judging here whether transgender individuals are at risk of attack. But we did not find evidence for this figure or even sufficient information to gauge if it was rooted in facts. All told, Coleman's claim was both unsupported and implausible. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 12:30 p.m., April 25, 2016: We revised this article after hearing from Kay Brown.

Scott Walker says Barack Obama has never been to the Texas-Mexico border as president
","During a trip through the crucial presidential state of Iowa, Gov. Scott Walker did an interview on April 25, 2015 with Caffeinated Thoughts, a website that says it looks at ""culture, current events, faith and politics from a Christian and conservative point of view."" When Walker was asked about his position on immigration reform, he began his answer by saying: ""Number of things. Border security for sure. Unlike this president, I’ve actually gone to the border and been there with the governor of Texas,"" Walker said, referring to a trip he made a month earlier. Wait, what? Immigration has long been a huge national issue. Barack Obama has been president for more than six years. Is Walker right that Obama has never been to the Texas-Mexico border? Walker’s evidence AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Our American Revival, the group Walker created in anticipation of a campaign for president, responded to our request for information to back Walker’s statement. She essentially tried to modify the governor’s claim by narrowing the time frame, saying Obama ""chose not to go to the border while he was in Texas in 2014 during a humanitarian crisis"" at the border. Walker, of course, made a much broader claim. But let’s start with his evidence: a July 9, 2014 CBS News report. On the day the report was posted online, Obama arrived in Texas for a previously planned two-day trip that was to involve talking to Texans about the economy and attending Democratic fundraisers. At the time, there had been a surge in the number children and teens from Central America crossing the Mexico-U.S. border unaccompanied by a parent. Many of the youths fled drug violence at home, but faced new challenges in the United States because the border patrol system wasn’t equipped to handle them, according to news reports. Changes in policy to expand legal residence opportunities in the United States for undocumented youth may have led some families to send younger family members on the journey north. Because of the crisis at the border,  Obama altered his plans to include a meeting, in Dallas, with then-Gov. Rick Perry and local officials to discuss the situation at the border. But Obama -- resisting calls from lawmakers in both parties -- did not visit the border, although several senior members of his administration had done so.   More to the point of Walker’s claim, however, the news report he cited also said Obama had visited the border in May 2011. We found that Obama visited El Paso on May 10, 2011. (Our colleagues rated as True his statement during his speech there that the Border Patrol had doubled the number of its agents since 2004.) A Washington Post report on the speech said Obama was ""standing within sight of Mexico"" and that it was his his first trip to the U.S.-Mexico border as president. That was his only visit to the border as president. Our rating Walker said that ""unlike this president, I've actually gone to the (Texas) border."" Obama certainly hasn’t been a frequent visitor, but as president he did go to the border once, in May 2011 to give a speech on immigration reform. We rate Walker’s statement False.

Democrats parlay votes on transportation bill into scholarships for students
","On May 4th, Gov. Nathan Deal signed into law the year’s most talked about bill -- one allowing the state to raise about $1 billion a year to tackle a backlog of transportation needs. The state’s Republican leadership initially wanted transportation issues handled closer to home. But a majority of the state’s voters nixed that idea in 2012, when a special purpose local option sales tax for transportation, the so-called T-SPLOST, was defeated in nine of 12 regions, including metro Atlanta. Passing the transportation bill, House Bill 170, this year -- even with Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, House Speaker David Ralston and behind it -- wasn’t easy, either. Some Democratic votes proved essential. Senate Democrats parlayed their support for the bill into concessions from Deal’s office related to one of their long-standing concerns, underrepresentation of minorities in contract awards at the Georgia Department of Transportation. This includes funding in 2016 of scholarships for minority students pursuing degrees in engineering, said Senate Democrats, including Minority Leader Steve Henson of Tucker. A curious reader contacted PolitiFact weeks after the legislative session ended April 2, asking us to check if this were really true. ""Where is it in the state budget?"" she asked. PolitiFact promised to take a look. It took until Monday of this week, the day the governor signed the 2016 budget, for us to finally see the full picture. There is indeed money to fund scholarships for minority students who want to pursue degrees in engineering. There’s $3 million in fact. The money will be available in Fiscal Year 2016, which starts July 1, through the Georgia Student Finance Commission, best-known as the state agency overseeing the popular HOPE scholarship program. Qualifying minorities include females, African Americans, Hispanics and American Indians. These scholarships will be available to students at Georgia Tech, Kennesaw State, Georgia Southern, Mercer University and the University of Georgia, as well as qualifying dual-degree program students. For each $3,500 a student receives, he or she must commit to working in an engineering-related field in Georgia for one calendar year or repay the money in cash, plus interest. This is separate from an engineering scholarship program already available to Mercer University students. That program will cost the state about $1 million in 2016. But it’s obvious why the reader was skeptical. There is no reference to $3 million or any money in legislative budget documents. There is some budget language that says the program will operate with existing funds. That’s because, as we’ve been told, the Student Finance Authority will pay for the program with ""revenue generated from the servicing and sale of student loans."" The Georgia Student Finance Authority signed off on dedicating the $3 million to the scholarship program at a meeting earlier in the month in Statesboro. The vote though was contingent on the budget being signed by the governor, which, as we said, happened Monday. A 2012 study raised concerns about the representation of minority, women and economically disadvantaged business enterprises in construction and engineering contracts at the state DOT from 2009 t0 2011. Part of the DOT’s comeback was there aren’t enough minority engineers, Henson told PolitiFact. In negotiations on the transportation bill, in addition to the commitment to minority scholarships, Senate Democrats won concessions for more money for African-Americans and other minority road contractors, as well as a firmer pledge by the state DOT to steer more business toward minority-owned firms. The DOT board has already passed a resolution that Democrats have applauded related to contracts that will be issued in connection with the new transportation funding bill. Our conclusion Senate Democrats said they won concessions for their support of the transportation bill, including a commitment of funding for minority scholarships in engineering. The budget signed by the governor Monday includes a commitment of existing funds for that program. And based on action by the Georgia Student Finance Authority, the total amount will be $3 million. We rate the statement by Senate Democrats as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6E0400>],/factchecks/2015/may/13/senate-democrats/Democrats-parlay-votes-on-transportation-bill-into/

A Jade Helm 15 sidenote: Did a liberal writer warn about a Bush fascist takeover?
","CORRECTION: Soon after publishing this fact-check on May 12, 2015, with a rating of Mostly True, Lowry pointed us to an interview given by Wolf in 2008. Wolf's comments from that interview are now included in this fact-check and we have changed the rating to True based on the new information. * * * There’s a theory going around that the federal government is using a massive military training exercise as a foundation to take over parts of the West, including Texas. The military has said, no, that’s not the case. But the air remained sufficiently thick with rumors on May 10, 2015, that ABC’s This Week took a few minutes to discuss the matter. Pundits Greta Van Susteren, Rich Lowry, Gwen Ifill and Jamelle Bouie all seemed to brush the talk off as conspiratorial hogwash. ""Federal control of Texas is something that was pretty much established in the mid-19th century by President (James) Polk,"" Lowry said. ""So, the idea that the federal government is going to go in and retake over Texas is just nonsense."" (Polk was president when Texas became a state.) Lowry wanted to make clear, however, that conspiracies are not only for conservatives. ""We've always seen distrust, and it's on both sides,"" Lowry said. ""I don't see liberals worried about military takeovers,"" said Bouie, a writer for Slate. ""Well, look at the left,"" Lowry said. ""They have the anti-vaxxers. They have unscientific fears about nuclear power and GMO foods. During the Bush administration, you actually had a prominent liberal write a book about how Bush was preparing for a fascist takeover of this country."" We were curious about Lowry’s point, and honed in on the claim about George W. Bush. Lowry said what he had in mind was a 2007 book by Naomi Wolf called The End of America: Letter of warning to a young patriot. Wolf, a feminist and activist, cast the book as a dire warning about the trajectory of the country. In it, Wolf lists 10 changes that she said typically mark a country’s descent into totalitarianism. Her case studies included the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, China, Italy under Benito Mussolini, and Chile under Augusto Pinochet. ""There are 10 steps that would-be dictators always take when they are seeking to close down an open society,"" Wolf said in a 2007 interview on Comedy Central’s Colbert Report. Wolf’s thesis, which she also shared in a newspaper opinion piece titled ""Fascist America in 10 easy steps,"" is that the United States had taken the 10 steps during the George W. Bush administration. ""It is my argument that, beneath our very noses, George Bush and his administration are using time-tested tactics to close down an open society,"" Wolf wrote. Here’s Wolf’s list, and how Wolf alleges that Bush aligned himself with despots. (We’re simply re-posting her arguments, which obviously are controversial.) 1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy: The war on terror with its warning of a global caliphate that threatens civilization. 2. Create a gulag: The Guantanamo Bay prison and the CIA ""black-sites."" 3. Develop a thug caste: Private security guards, such as the Blackwater contractors. 4. Set up an internal surveillance system: Government tracking of phone calls, emails and banking transactions, as reported in 2005 and 2006. 5. Harass citizens' groups: Government tracking of anti-war organizations and their activities. 6. Engage in arbitrary detention and release: An airport security list that flags people like Wolf for extra scrutiny. 7. Target key individuals: The outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame after her husband publicly challenged the Bush administration assertion that Iraq had acquired yellow cake uranium from Niger. 8. Control the press: The distribution of false information, such as the yellowcake uranium claim. 9. Dissent equals treason: Bush administration assertion of the power to label an American citizen as an ""enemy combatant."" 10. Suspend the rule of law: Increased presidential authority to deploy the National Guard. Wolf never actually claimed Bush had a plan to convert the nation into a totalitarian state in the book. Wolf argued that what she saw laid the groundwork for a fundamental loss of liberty. Wolf said ""our experiment in democracy could be closed down by a process of erosion."" However, Wolf was much more matter-of-fact in an October 2008 interview on KEXP 90.3 FM Seattle. Wolf was there to discuss her follow-up book, Give Me Liberty: A Handbook for American Revolutionaries.  In the interview, Wolf warned that Bush may declare martial law if Congress failed to pass the 2008 financial bailout bill. In that scenario, Wolf mused that Bush would stop the 2008 election. ""There is not going to be an election, as usual, if he can declare on Oct. 3 that he’s going to engage in martial law if people don’t do what he wants,"" Wolf said. ""Why on Earth would he hand over the power to Barack Obama?"" In another part of the interview, Wolf said a coup was already underway. ""We have to wake up,"" Wolf said. ""On Oct. 1, the First Brigade of the Third Infantry Division was deployed in the United States of America for the first time since 1807 when a bright line was placed preventing the military from policing American streets. A military brigade -- that's 3/4,000 soldiers -- has been brought in to police our streets."" Wolf goes on to say that ""the president now has an army."" ""The coup is here rather than looming,"" said Wolf, who went on to tell listeners she would be posting instructions on how to arrest the president on a website. Our ruling Lowry said that a leading liberal had written a book about how Bush was preparing for a fascist takeover of this country. The book Lowry cited does not allege a specific plot. Rather it uses events during the Bush administration and compares them to events that happened in the build-up of totalitarian regimes around the world. But in an interview in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, Wolf said a coup was underway and that Bush may declare martial law and prevent the 2008 election.

Advocacy group overreaches with claim on NYPD shootings
","The fatal shooting of New York City police officer Brian Moore has the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety again taking aim at Georgia and its gun laws. ""Once again, a police officer has been killed with an illegal gun from Georgia -- a state that last year did the NRA’s bidding and weakened its already lax gun laws,"" Megan Lewis, the group’s vice president, said in a May 6 press release.. Moore, 25, was shot in the face May 2 and died two days later.  Police took a convicted felon into custody 90 minutes after the shooting and later said the suspect’s weapon was one of 23 guns reported stolen in a break-in at  Little’s Bait, Tackle & Pawn in Perry, south of Macon, in October 2011. Nine of those 23 stolen guns have since turned up at New York crime scenes, including the silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver seized in connection with Moore’s slaying, NYPD officials said. But have there been other police officers killed by illegal guns traced to Georgia as Everytown for Gun Safety’s statement suggests? PolitiFact decided to check. First a little background. Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts, contends that stolen and illegally trafficked firearms are making their way to cities such as New York from Georgia and other states, especially in the South, that have lax gun laws via the so-called ""iron pipeline."" Erika Soto Lamb, the group’s communications, said Everytown for Gun Safety can back up the statement. As evidence, she pointed to the killings of two NYPD police officers last December in a rampage by a convicted felon. The suspect was using a  gun that was first sold legally by Arrowhead Pawn Shop in Jonesboro, she said. We asked: Is it fair to say that’s ""an illegal gun from Georgia?"" ""The shooter in that event was a convicted felon -- which means he should not have been in possession of a gun and which makes that an illegal gun,"" she wrote in an email.. Tracing and tracking firearms The job of tracing guns falls to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the only agency authorized to track firearms made in the United States and abroad when law enforcement agencies request help. Police recover guns in various ways – as part of a criminal investigation, during regular patrols and even in buyback events. They can submit requests to the ATF’s National Tracing Center to track a weapon’s history, said ATF Agent Charles J. Mulham, the public information officer for the Bureau’s New York field division. Because a gun’s history can become evidence in a trial, the records are not public unless the requesting agencies disclosing them. The New York Police Department submitted such a request following the shooting of Moore in Queens. It later made the findings public in a press conference. Without required public disclosure of the trace records, the question of whether additional illegal guns from Georgia were used in the shooting deaths of other New York City cops becomes fuzzy to answer. Federal law requires only that guns stolen or lost from licensed gun dealers be reported to the ATF. The District of Columbia and another 10 states – including New York and neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut – require private citizens to report the theft or loss of at least some handguns or weapons. Georgia has no such requirement. That means those who aspire to make money by selling hard-to-come-by firearms in New York City for profit could, in theory, not even bother to steal them in Georgia. They could buy them here, sell them for high mark-ups in New York and, if the trace came back to a legal purchase, possibly face no penalty if they claimed the weapons had been stolen but not reported, Mulham said. In other words, it’s a tricky definition to term a gun ""illegal"" given the patchwork of state laws that govern their purchase. That complicates the definition of the gun used in the December shooting deaths of New York City officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos That gun, a Taurus 9 mm, was bought legally in 1996 from the Jonesboro pawn shop, said NYPD Lt. John Grimpel. The weapon’s history then becomes murky before convicted felon Ismaaiyl Brinsley ended up with it and shot the officers as they sat in their patrol car. It was illegal for Brinsley to have the gun, given restrictions on ownership by felons as well as New York law making it illegal for anyone to have a handgun without a permit. But the gun itself was officially legal because it was legally purchased. That history was uncovered when NYPD requested the gun be traced after the shootings. ""After 1996, the whereabouts of the gun were unknown, until December 2014 when it was used in the murders of officers Ramos and Liu,"" Grimpel said. Our conclusion Police have seized a gun stolen from Georgia nearly four years ago and believe it was used  in the recent, tragic shooting death of a young NYPD officer. But Everytown For Gun Safety overreaches in suggesting that an earlier fatal shooting of two officers involved an ""illegal gun from Georgia."" That weapon was sold according to federal law and therefore legal, until it found its way to someone who used it to commit a horrific crime. Such overreaches allow political debate to shape facts. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC002080>],/factchecks/2015/may/12/everytown-gun-safety/advocacy-group-overreaches-claim-nypd-shooting/

Does Ben Carson want to 'eliminate dependency on government' despite benefiting from welfare?
"," With Ben Carson officially in the ring of Republican presidential contenders, Democratic social media activists are using his famous scraps-to-scalpel narrative against him.  Carson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson’s family. The Facebook meme shared May 4, 2015, says, ""Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to ‘eliminate dependency on government.’ "" ""But he doesn’t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. ""Hypocrisy, much?"" A reader asked us to look into Carson’s biography and see if the facts align with the meme’s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we’ll deal with the claims line by line. ‘Grew up in public schools’ This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons’ father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. ""Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,"" Carson wrote. ‘Got public housing’ The details here are a little thin. When Carson’s mother divorced his father, she received their ""modest house"" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family’s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to ""move into the Boston tenements"" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes ""armies of roaches,"" ""hordes of rats"" and omnipresent ""winos and drunks."" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an ""upper lower-class neighborhood,"" he wrote. Carson doesn’t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in ""Detroit’s downtown housing projects"" and ""the ghetto."" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons’ original home in a better neighborhood. Got ‘food stamps’ This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn’t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. ""By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,"" he wrote. ""She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy."" ‘Got free glasses from a government program’ This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn’t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. ""The school provided glasses for me, free,"" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. ‘Was helped by affirmative action’ This claim is unproven. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state ""actively recruited black students"" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson’s resume was impressive — he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying ""most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks."" ""The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,"" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. ""Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,"" he wrote. "" ‘Ben,’ he said to me, ‘I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.’ "" Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. ‘Got Pell grants for college’ This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson’s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of ""Ben Carson"" and ""Pell Grants"" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama’s proposal to offer free community college.  ""First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,"" Carson wrote in a February column. ""Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me."" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson ""benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,"" and ""med school paid for with grant from USPHS."" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We’ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson’s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson’s biography. It’s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. ""Many people are critical of me because they say, ‘Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,’ "" he said, according to a Politico account. ""This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people."" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February’s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. ""I’m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,"" he said. ""I’m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes."" Carson’s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What’s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme ""Eliminate dependency on government,"" though that language wouldn’t be out of character for Carson. Carson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson’s ""family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit,"" but didn’t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing. Our ruling A popular liberal Facebook meme aims to hold up Carson’s past reliance on public assistance against him as he calls for eliminating government dependence in high-profile speeches. The meme gets many details of Carson’s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson’s past and his plans if elected president. Carson has said he wants to eliminate government dependency, but he also has made clear he intends to maintain programs public safety nets for people who need them. Carson hasn’t elaborated what programs fall into what category, and how those he benefited from would be treated. Overall, the meme is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.

"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Patients who use LIP are different than Medicaid expansion population, Scott says
","Washington may favor expanding Medicaid, Gov. Rick Scott argues, but it won’t help the people being served by the soon-to-expire Low Income Pool, called LIP. Speaking to reporters, Scott said he doesn’t share the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ position that growing Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is a better solution than renewing the current LIP fund. The LIP program, which mostly helps cover hospital costs for uninsured and underinsured patient visits, is set to expire June 30. ""The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare,"" Scott said. Given the context, we’re taking ""Obamacare"" to mean Medicaid expansion; we contacted Scott’s office, but they didn’t elaborate. One of the chief arguments for Medicaid expansion is that it would cover uninsured Floridians, many of whom receive care at hospitals and clinics that then turn to the LIP program to offset costs. We decided to check if Scott was right about those being two different sets of potential patients. LIP vs. Medicaid The debate over Medicaid expansion and the loss of federal matching money for the $2.2 billion LIP fund has roiled the state Legislature this year. While the Senate wants a Medicaid expansion based on private insurance, the House refuses. Adding fuel to the fire is that Washington in 2014 said it would not renew the LIP, a temporary program funded since 2005 by both state and federal taxes. That led to a billion-dollar hole in the budget and a standoff that requires a special session in June. One of the primary arguments for expansion has been that more than 800,000 Floridians would be covered under a broader Medicaid program. The Affordable Care Act allows Florida to cover all adults with incomes below 138 percent of federal poverty level. (100 percent is currently $11,770 for an individual and $24,250 for a family of four). The pro-expansion side points out this means the hundreds of thousands of newly eligible Floridians would be able to enroll in Medicaid and have access to the physicians and preventive care it offers. Advocates say this would preclude the need for LIP money, as most of the uninsured who typically turn to emergency room visits for care would then be insured.   But just because you are uninsured doesn’t necessarily mean you are poor enough to qualify for an expanded Medicaid. The LIP fund helps reimburse care providers for services rendered instead of directly covering patients. That means it pays for anyone who is uninsured, whether they would qualify for Medicaid or not. Experts told us those who don’t qualify for Medicaid would include undocumented immigrants and people above 138 percent of the federal poverty level without insurance. But that second group at least enjoys the benefit of being able to get subsidized policies if their incomes are less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Even if they don’t choose to enroll in one of those policies, the option exists. It’s also not right to say that potential Medicaid beneficiaries and those helped by LIP are mutually exclusive groups, as Scott makes it sound. Chances are that most of the uninsured making these uncompensated ER visits are the poorest patients, Harvard health policy professor Ben Sommers told us. ""Technically yes, some portion of the people potentially served by the LIP would not be identical to the people covered by the ACA (Affordable Care Act),"" he said. ""But in broad strokes, the main people who benefit from the LIP would benefit even more from the Medicaid expansion and ACA Marketplace coverage."" Florida has the second-highest total of low-income, uninsured adults in the nation behind Texas, so insuring them through Medicaid would mean hospitals would get paid for their services, those analysts said. It’s much more effective than attempting to pay emergency bills after the fact. ""If you have insurance you may know that you can get preventive care like vaccinations, mammograms or primary care,"" said Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University. ""If there is only uncompensated care, more people are likely to skip preventive and primary care because they will worry about the cost ... and only get care when they are quite sick and need emergency or hospital care."" Our ruling Scott said, ""The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare."" This makes it sound as if the people who would qualify for Medicaid under an expansion are completely different than patients who leave hospitals with unpaid bills the LIP fund helps pay to providers. Health policy experts said that while there would still be uninsured people not paying their bills under an expansion, plenty of overlap exists between the two, especially at lower incomes. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8C37C0>],/factchecks/2015/may/11/rick-scott/patients-who-use-lip-are-different-medicaid-expans/

Ukrainian boxing star auctioned Olympic gold medal in 2012, long before Russia’s war in Ukraine
","The famous Klitschko brothers, former professional boxers from Ukraine, are back in the international spotlight for reasons that have nothing to do with their sport.  Soon after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Vitali Klitschko, now the mayor of Kyiv, and his brother Wladimir pledged to take up arms and fight for their country. They have made numerous media appearances. Their charitable foundation listed ways that people could help Ukraine. Wladimir Klitschko called the war effort the ""biggest fight of my life."" But on social media, one tale of Wladimir Klitschko’s devotion to the cause made an old event seem as though it had just happened. A widespread Facebook post shared during Russia’s invasion said that Wladimir Klitschko had raised $1 million for Ukrainian children by auctioning off the Olympic gold medal he won in 1996. ""Wladimir Klitschko has auctioned off his 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games gold medal to raise money for the children of Ukraine,"" said the March 14 post, from a boxing fan page with nearly 800,000 followers. ""He received around 1 million dollars. The buyer gave Klitschko the medal back instantly when he heard what Wladimir was using the money for."" The gesture the post described did happen. But it took place in March 2012, more than a decade before Russia launched its current assault on Ukraine.  ""I did sell the medal in March (2012), and 100% of the funds, which is $1 million, went to the Klitschko Brothers Foundation,"" Klitscho told CNN in July 2012, four months after the auction. ""We care about education and sport, that is the key in any children's life."" The Klitschko Foundation said in a statement after the auction that the buyer returned the medal to the family immediately after bidding on it.  Vitali, right, and Wladimir Klitschko, left, pass by Wladimir's Olympic gold medal during a charity auction for the Klitschko Brothers Foundation in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 29, 2012. (AP) The brothers’ foundation did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. But the fundraising that Wladimir Klitschko accomplished by selling his gold medal took place in 2012 — not in 2022, as the recent Facebook post led some commenters to believe. That out-of-context framing spread on Facebook after a boxing website’s tribute accurately highlighting Klitschko’s 2012 gesture went viral, according to PolitiFact’s analysis of CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. On March 10, 2022, the website Boxing TV posted an image of Klitschko that described the story of his auctioned gold medal to its Facebook page.

"['Gas Prices', 'Foreign Policy', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Joe Biden']","
How much blame does Putin deserve for high gasoline prices?
","President Joe Biden recently cast blame for a spike in gas prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We’ve seen the price of gas go up over $1 just since he put his troops on the border of Ukraine,"" Biden said in an address to the National League of Cities on March 14. ""It went up $1.05. A big part of that reason is Putin began amassing troops along the border and then crossed (it). And guess what? The world took notice. The market anticipated; prices went up. And then Putin invaded."" Biden continued, ""Make no mistake: The current spike in gas prices is largely the fault of Vladimir Putin. It has nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan,"" referring to the big coronavirus and economic relief package Biden pushed through Congress and signed early in his presidency. Gasoline prices have risen most aggressively since Putin began preparing his invasion of Ukraine. ""Current,"" however, is doing a lot of work in Biden’s remarks, which ignore a long run-up of gas-price increases prior to the escalation of military conflict in Ukraine. And while assessments differ over how much the American Rescue Plan promoted inflation generally, the legislation is widely credited with aiding the nation’s economic recovery, which in turn increased demand for gasoline and pushed prices higher. ""Gasoline and crude oil prices overall have increased significantly over the past year due to a variety of factors, mainly driven by increased demand due to recovery from the COVID pandemic and associated problems with the supply chain and employment,"" said Hugh Daigle, an associate professor at the University of Texas-Austin’s Center for Subsurface Energy and the Environment. The United States imports some crude oil from Russia, but Russian oil has a relatively small footprint in the U.S. market. Recent data shows Russian imports accounting for about 7% of total U.S. imports; in turn, imports are roughly equal to U.S. crude oil production, making the importance of Russian oil even more modest. That said, the price of oil is determined by international factors, and because other countries are more heavily dependent on Russian oil than the U.S. is, any cutbacks in the use of Russian oil elsewhere can reduce global supplies, pushing prices higher for U.S. consumers. To put Putin’s impact on U.S. gasoline prices in context, we looked at weekly per-gallon gasoline prices from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, dating back to the low point for gas prices in May 2020. That was just a few months into the coronavirus pandemic, when commuting and travel had slowed dramatically, producing low demand and low prices for gasoline. In mid-May 2020, gas prices sat at around $1.88 a gallon. By late January 2021, when President Donald Trump left office and Biden was sworn in, a gallon of gas had risen to about $2.39 a gallon, an increase of about 50 cents. From Biden’s inauguration until early November, the price of gas continued to rise: It reached $3.39 in early November, or an increase of about another dollar. We chose November 2021 as a turning point because that’s when a continuing Russian troop buildup on Ukraine’s borders began to attract wider notice. On Nov. 3, Ukrainian officials said the number of Russian troops on its borders had reached 90,000, and on Nov. 10, the Biden administration offered public warnings about the military buildup. By early December, the buildup and potential invasion became widely known to news consumers in the U.S., documented in the New York Times and other publications. Between early November and the start of the Russian invasion in late February, U.S. gas prices rose modestly, climbing 10 cents to $3.49. The big spike came when the invasion began, with the price of gas rising by 83 cents to $4.32.   So Putin’s invasion clearly caused the single biggest gas price spike during this period. And gas prices did rise during the four-month-long build-up to the invasion. What Biden’s comment leaves out is that the gas price rise following Putin’s military buildup accounted for a fraction of the overall rise in gasoline prices. Looking at the entire period starting with March 2020, the low point for gas prices, only about 38% of the price increase to today came during the period when Putin was threatening or conducting war in Ukraine. The remaining 62% of the rise had already occurred before the buildup became a major story in November. And even if you only look at the rise during Biden’s tenure in office, less than half of the rise in gas prices occurred before the troop buildup became big news in November 2021. So if Putin’s war plans aren’t ""largely"" the cause of the increase in gas prices, what other factors played a role? The big one is the economic recovery from the pandemic. When the U.S. economy began sputtering back to life during the second half of 2020, it increased demand for oil, which in turn pushed up gas prices. ""I think it’s fair to say that much of the run-up happened before Russia’s buildup became a focus, and was driven by the post-COVID recovery in global demand,"" said Mark Finley, a fellow at Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. Finley added that a longstanding refusal by the OPEC oil cartel and its allies to increase production has added to the upward pressure in prices. Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, agreed. ""Biden was definitely overstating the case"" in blaming Putin as the primary driver of high gas prices, Bake said. ""Clearly, the recovery was a factor in gas prices."" It’s important to note that some of the early rise in gas prices after March 2020 was simply a ""return to a more ‘normal’ supply-demand balance"" following the extraordinary economic shutdowns of the early pandemic, said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. He added that a significant part of why supply has trailed demand for the past two years is low investment in production during the pandemic, due to uncertainty about how to plan for a recovery. ""Oil prices and oil markets are influenced by a complicated, multi-directional, global network of causes and effects,"" he said. But he added that ""any analysis of oil price shifts since 2019 that doesn't put COVID front and center is flat out wrong."" The White House acknowledged to PolitiFact that Biden did not mean to suggest that every cent of increase since May 2020, or since January 2021, was attributable to Putin, and they said that a number of factors have fed into the overall increase in gas prices. Instead, the White House focused on Biden’s use of the term ""current spike,"" saying that the most recent rise does stem largely from Putin’s actions. In the meantime, it's important for everyone ""to avoid a U.S. bias,"" WIlliams-Derry said. ""Oil prices are set globally, so there's a tendency to blame U.S. politicians for things that they have literally no control over."" Biden said, ""Make no mistake: The current spike in gas prices is largely the fault of Vladimir Putin."" By current, Biden means very current. The most recent spike in gas prices has stemmed largely from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.  But gas prices were rising before the Russian troop buildup around Ukraine became front-page news. About two-thirds of the price rise since gas prices’ low point in May 2020 came before the Ukraine buildup became a major international story, an increase that experts say stemmed primarily from the economic recovery following the pandemic. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD62E00>],/factchecks/2022/mar/16/joe-biden/joe-biden-blame-putin-high-gasoline-prices/

Tom Suozzi offers oversimplified critique of Manhattan DA’s prosecution policy
","Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg attracted attention, including criticism, for implementing new prosecutorial policies shortly after taking office Jan. 1. Critics perceived a memo by Bragg as laying out policies that would treat some cases too lightly, such as those involving resisting arrest and armed robbery.  A Democrat running for governor of New York, Rep. Tom Suozzi, was one of those taking a shot at Bragg, a fellow Democrat. Suozzi posted a campaign advertisement to his Twitter account on Jan. 21 that featured a tough-on-crime message. ""The Manhattan DA is actually proposing to downgrade armed robbery to a misdemeanor, and to stop prosecuting resisting arrest,"" Suozzi’s ad said. 📺 I released my first TV ad of the campaign on the crime crisis in NY.If any DA refuses to enforce the law, I’ll remove them. @KathyHochul refuses to act. I will. pic.twitter.com/dBX3GwRKDa However, the reality is more complicated than that. In addition, shortly after Suozzi’s ad stopped running, Bragg released a new memo clarifying his policies. In a Jan. 3 memo, Bragg said his office would increase its emphasis on both ""diversion"" and ""declination."" It defined diversion as ""the opportunity to complete a short but meaningful programming mandate after arrest through a community-based provider, based on the needs of the person arrested."" It defined declination as a decision not to prosecute a case after an arrest was made.  Bragg argued that investing in alternatives to incarceration would reduce recidivism and allow his office’s resources to be dedicated to the most serious, and often violent, crimes. Reducing the prosecution of nonviolent offenses would disproportionately benefit people of color. In the memo, Bragg said a robbery that might otherwise qualify as a felony should be prosecuted as a misdemeanor ""if the force or threat of force consists of displaying a dangerous instrument or similar behavior but does not create a genuine risk of physical harm.""  The memo also said that resisting arrest would not be prosecuted by his office unless accompanied by another charge not included on the list of offenses the office was generally declining to prosecute.  The list of cases the office wouldn’t be prosecuting included marijuana misdemeanors, including selling more than three ounces; not paying a public transportation fare; trespassing, except a fourth-degree stalking charge; certain cases of obstructing governmental administration; and prostitution. Suozzi’s advertisement summarized these changes without adding important nuance. Under Bragg’s memo, not all armed robberies would be downgraded to misdemeanors, just those determined not to ""create a genuine risk of physical harm."" And under the memo, resisting arrest would continue to be prosecuted if it accompanied another prosecuted crime. The Jan. 3 memo drew criticism from residents, police, and some politicians; they argued that Bragg’s insistence on downplaying the role of incarceration made streets less safe and left police vulnerable.  Criticism intensified after news reports of a case that Bragg’s office prosecuted as a misdemeanor. The suspect was alleged to have stolen about $2,000 worth of cold medicine from a drug store while wielding a pocket knife and threatening a manager. It was the man’s 39th arrest. Critics said that if the case had been heard two weeks earlier – under the previous prosecutorial policies – it would have been tried as robbery in the first degree, a felony. Later, when a gunman fatally shot two New York City policemen on Jan. 21, the wife of one of the officers used the funeral as a platform to criticize Bragg.  Under increasing pressure over his office policies, Bragg on Feb. 4 issued an updated memo, acknowledging that his Jan. 3 memo had become ""a source of confusion, rather than clarity."" The new memo addressed both the prosecution of armed robberies and of resisting arrest. ""A commercial robbery with a gun will be charged as a felony, whether or not the gun is operable, loaded, or a realistic imitation,"" the new memo said. ""A commercial robbery at knifepoint, or by other weapon that creates a risk of physical harm, will be charged as a felony. In retail thefts that do not involve a risk of physical harm, the office will continue to assess the charges based on all of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances presented."" As for resisting arrest, the memo said, ""Violence against police officers will not be tolerated,"" the updated memo says. ""We will prosecute any person who harms or attempts to harm a police officer."" A spokeswoman for Suozzi said their ad campaign ended Feb. 2, two days before Bragg issued the updated memo. The advertisement remained on Suozzi’s official Twitter account as of March 16. Because the ad aired before Bragg updated his policies, we will only consider its description of the initial policies for our Truth-O-Meter rating.  ""The fact is that the Manhattan district attorney put out a ‘day one’ memo stating that his office would not prosecute some crimes, including some armed robberies and resisting arrest, and the Suozzi campaign aired an ad highlighting Bragg’s new policies,"" said Kim Devlin, a senior advisor to the Suozzi campaign, told PolitiFact New York.  Suozzi’s ad said, ""The Manhattan DA is actually proposing to downgrade armed robbery to a misdemeanor, and to stop prosecuting resisting arrest."" Suozzi was referencing Bragg’s initial announcement of new policies on prosecuting, or declining to prosecute, certain offenses. Bragg did lay out changes to his office’s policy on prosecuting armed robberies and resisting arrest in his initial memo. However, Bragg did not say his office would refuse to prosecute these crimes entirely; he offered a range of exceptions that would allow both offenses to be prosecuted as felonies in certain circumstances. Suozzi’s ad did not reflect this nuance. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB991240>],/factchecks/2022/mar/16/tom-suozzi/tom-suozzi-offers-oversimplified-critique-manhatta/

Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa. Experts said the vast majority of people trying to cross the southern border into the United States are summarily turned back. Exceptions are made for unaccompanied minors, some of whom are transported by planes to be with relatives or approved sponsors — a practice also done during the Trump administration.  Kistner’s campaign did not reply to our requests for information to support his claim. Two law professors and directors of immigrants’ rights clinics, Fatma Marouf at Texas A&M University School of Law and Nicole Hallett at the University of Chicago Law School, walked us through the process. Because of a public health law known as Title 42, invoked at the start of the pandemic by the Trump administration and continued under Biden, the vast majority of migrants are turned back and not given the opportunity to make their case for why they should be allowed to stay. Those encountered at the border who have been allowed to remain are, by and large, unaccompanied minors. They typically are taken first to facilities near the border and then transferred to the temporary custody of the U.S. Health and Human Services department, which eventually places the children with family or sponsors in the U.S. If family members or approved sponsors are not able to arrange transportation, the federal government pays for transportation, including flights.  The charter flights are not publicized and sometimes are done in the middle of the night to protect the confidentiality of those being transported and to guard against anyone who would interfere with the flights. Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, have complained that they were not notified about the flights and U.S. House members from New York asked the Biden administration to stop such flights to their state. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker reported that sometimes the federal government tries to save money by arranging for flights that land late in the evening. Most unaccompanied minors turn themselves in to border authorities and by doing so are ""actually following the rules of seeking asylum,"" said Marouf. ICE Air Operations is the air transportation arm of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is responsible for the detention and deportation of immigrants. The Biden administration, like the Obama and Trump administrations, uses flights to move adult detainees from one detention facility to another in order to avoid overcrowding. If some of those flights occur at night, it’s not necessarily indicative of something nefarious or covert going on, as the ad suggests. News reports, including some in Florida and Pennsylvania, have made clear that the process is routine and occurred under the Trump administration, as well. Mexican nationals ordered for deportation from the United States travel on domestic flights from various U.S. cities to southern cities such as San Diego, California and Brownsville, Texas, and are then bused to the U.S.-Mexico border for removal at a land port of entry, ICE said in August 2020. Neither ICE nor the Health and Human Services Department responded to requests for comment for this fact-check. The White House cited one of several statements it has made in response to such claims. A reporter on Oct. 19 asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki: ""Why is the administration flying thousands of migrants from the border to Florida and New York in the middle of the night?"" Psaki said: ""It is our legal responsibility to safely care for unaccompanied children until they swiftly — can be swiftly unified with a parent or a vetted sponsor. And that’s something we take seriously; we have a moral obligation to come to do that and deliver on that. ""As a part of the unification process, our Office of Refugee Resettlement facilitates travel for children in its custody to their families or sponsors across the country. So, in recent weeks, unaccompanied children passed through the Westchester (N.Y.) airport, which I think is what you’re referring to, en route to their final destination to be unified with their parents or a vetted sponsor. ""It’s no surprise that kids can be seen traveling through states, not just New York.  It’s something that we’re also working to unite children with their family members or vetted sponsors in other parts of the country as well."" Kistner, an ex-Marine, is running against Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, who was first elected in 2018 to the 2nd District seat, which represents part of southeast Minnesota.  Craig defeated Kistner in 2020 by 48% to 46%. Campaign watchers rate their rematch as ""Democratic toss up"", ""tilt Democratic"" and toss up.  Democrats have an 11-seat advantage in the House. Kistner said Biden ""has been secretly flying illegal immigrants into communities across the country in the middle of the night."" The ad implies that it is a new phenomenon for the federal government to transport immigrants around the country. That’s not true.  The federal government flies adult detainees in its custody from one facility to another, or from one U.S. city to another during deportation proceedings. The U.S. government in some cases also flies unaccompanied children who are being released from its custody to a family member or sponsor. Some of these flights may happen at night, but they are not covert operations. The same types of routine flights were done by the Trump administration. The ad contains only an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.

American megachurches are offering support to Ukraine, despite claims on social media
","Nearly 3 million people have fled Ukraine in what the United Nations now calls the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. The mounting challenge to evacuate, clothe, feed and shelter Ukrainians after Russia’s invasion has prompted a massive humanitarian response. But some people on social media accused Christian megachurches of not stepping up to help.  Some posts on Facebook and Twitter combine a photograph of Lakewood Church, the Houston, Texas, megachurch led by Joel Osteen, with the following text:   ""Funny how we haven’t seen a single American megachurch offer ANYTHING to the Ukrainians…""  Another tweet shared on March 14 claimed, ""You’ll notice that you haven’t seen one multimillion dollar tax exempt MegaChurch or their grifting sinister millionaire owners sending relief or supplies to Ukrainian refugees, which isn’t surprising because they don’t even help U.S. citizens during times of disaster."" But these posts aren’t true. Multiple megachurches around the country have been raising funds to help Ukrainians. The term ""megachurch"" generally refers to any active Protestant congregation with an average weekly attendance of 2,000 people or more, according to the Hartford Institute for Religious Research. The institute estimates that there are approximately 1,750 megachurches in the U.S. Lakewood Church is one of the largest megachurches in the U.S., with a weekly congregation of about 45,000 people. On March 7, the church shared a Facebook video featuring Osteen’s brother, Dr. Paul Osteen, talking about the church’s efforts to help Ukrainians in need.  ""We are doing what we can do to help partner churches in Slovakia who are helping refugees fleeing the war,"" Osteen says in the clip. ""We're looking for opportunities to work with refugees in Poland, and with our long standing partnership with Dr. Todd and Sue Price, we’re working inside of Ukraine to help those who are in the midst of the conflict right now."" The video says that John Osteen, Joel and Paul’s father, kickstarted donations in 1996 that helped build a church in Ukraine that is now feeding refugees.  Gateway Church, another megachurch in Texas, has set up a crisis relief fund to support people in Ukraine and the surrounding region. Saddleback Church, a megachurch located in Lake Forest, California, has an advance relief team connecting with local pastors in Ukraine and Poland who are caring for hundreds of Ukrainian refugees. The church’s website features ways people can help and has provided multiple updates on its efforts in the region. The Rock Church, a megachurch in San Diego, California, is directing people to its partner organization, Crisis Response International, and told PolitiFact that it’s in the process of establishing a Ukraine relief fund. Crossroads Church, an Ohio-based megachurch, partners with humanitarian and disaster relief organizations Convoy of Hope and World Vision, which both have operations on the ground in Ukraine. Other church networks, like the United Methodist Committee on Relief and Catholic Relief Services, are collecting donations and deploying staff and resources.  We rate posts that say no megachurches are raising money for Ukraine relief False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC2E840>],/factchecks/2022/mar/16/tweets/american-megachurches-are-offering-support-ukraine/

McCrory misrepresents Budd comments on Russia
","A recent television ad for U.S. Senate candidate Pat McCrory suggested that one of his Republican opponents is sympathetic to Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. McCrory, the former governor of North Carolina, is one of several candidates hoping to replace retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr later this year. His latest TV ad attacked U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, another Senate candidate, for his recent comments on Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The ad alternated between video clips from Budd’s recent television interviews and McCrory’s commentary. Here’s the transcript: McCrory: ""While Ukrainians bled and died …"" Budd: ""He’s a very intelligent actor."" McCrory: ""Congressman Budd excused their killer."" Budd: ""There are strategic reasons he’d want to protect his southern, western flank. We understand that."" McCrory: ""Budd’s votes have been friendly toward Russia. He voted against sanctions on Russia. These are serious times and we need serious senators. I’m Pat McCrory. I don’t compliment our enemies. I stand for truth and freedom. I approved this message. Make your stand with me."" The ad cited its sources for each of the Budd clips as well as McCrory’s claim that Budd’s votes have been ""friendly towards Russia.""  When we asked the McCrory campaign why it accused Budd of excusing Putin’s actions, McCrory spokesperson Jordan Shaw pointed to Budd’s comments on Fox that Putin has ""strategic reasons for protecting"" his flank and ""we understand that.""   ""Wouldn’t you describe that comment as excusing the invasion?"" Shaw said. PolitiFact examined the comments and McCrory’s sources and found that McCrory cherry picked Budd’s comments and overlooked the numerous times Budd condemned Putin for his actions in Ukraine. To judge whether Budd is excusing Putin’s actions in Ukraine, let’s first look at the examples offered in McCrory’s ad. Budd said Putin is ""a very intelligent actor."" This is from an interview with WNCN-TV. A reporter asked Budd if he agreed with comments by former President Donald Trump, who called Putin ""pretty smart."" Budd called Putin intelligent. But the ad leaves out parts of the interview where Budd accused Putin of being erratic and ""evil"": ""Well, you have to look at it in two ways. One is good and bad. I would say Putin is evil. But that doesn’t mean he’s not smart. He’s a very intelligent actor, although I’d say he’s been quite erratic in his approach to the Ukraine. It was very predictable what he would do. At the same time, Putin is evil. He’s an international thug. But he is intelligent and so we have to treat him as such."" Budd said ""there are strategic reasons [Putin would] want to protect his southern, Western flank."" This is from Budd’s Feb. 26 appearance on Fox News. In this interview, Budd attempted to explain Putin’s motives for invading Ukraine. Again, he described Putin’s actions as ""evil"" and said he supported Ukraine: ""Putin is trying to reverse history and undo what happened in 1991. We should have known this all along. At his State of the Union in 2005, he essentially said that [Ukraine] was — he considered it to be part of a larger Russia, but he's essentially trying to build the glory of Russia. There are strategic reasons why he would want to protect his southern, Western flank because of the flatlands of Russia. We understand that. But still, I mean, this is evil. This is a sovereign nation in the Ukraine, and we stand with the Ukraine people now."" McCrory’s ad also mentioned a News & Observer story that described some of Budd’s votes as ""friendly towards Russia."" But the same story mentioned Budd’s condemnation of Putin on Feb. 24, when he said, ""We need to take stronger action against Vladimir Putin’s outrageous invasion of Ukraine, starting with cutting off Russia’s access to the global financial system."" McCrory said: ""While Ukrainians bled and died, Congressman Budd excused their killer."" McCrory’s ad implied that Budd was forgiving Putin’s actions or attempting to absolve him from blame. However, a review of the full context of Budd’s interviews shows that he also attempted to explain Putin’s motivations, but didn’t endorse or forgive them. Budd said Putin has ""strategic reasons"" for his actions, but he also called Putin ""evil,"" ""erratic"" and a ""thug."" He said he supports Ukraine and he advocated stronger action against Putin. McCrory’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Courts have repeatedly upheld grants Gableman says amount to 'massive election bribery'
","Michael Gableman, the former state Supreme Court justice overseeing a Republican-ordered, taxpayer-funded review of Wisconsin’s long-settled 2020 election, has made many factually-challenged statements. But one in particular caught our attention during his March 7, 2022  appearance on Fox News’ ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" It came in this tangle of a response to a request from Carlson to give an overview of his findings:  ""We had a wave of massive election bribery, in which government officials in the five Zuckerberg-sponsored cities participated, as well as what you related when you introduced your audience (to) me, which is the government sponsored elder abuse, all to wring out votes from people who frankly were victimized by the very people at the Wisconsin Elections Commission who are supposed to keep our voters safe.""  There’s a lot going on there – and there was a lot in the rest of the interview. But this is the claim we are pulling out: That five Wisconsin cities received money for the 2020 election from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which amounted to ""a wave of massive election bribery.""  The appearance came soon after Gableman gave an update on his review to a state Assembly committee on March 1, 2022. Although a judge found little evidence of work having been done, Gableman has been given more time by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, to complete his work – which originally was to be done in October. Is Gableman, a former member of the state’s top court, right about a ""massive wave of bribery""? According to multiple court rulings: No. Indeed, he is ridiculously wrong. Let’s start with a little background: First, recounts and the courts have repeatedly confirmed that Democrat Joe Biden defeated Republican Donald Trump by nearly 21,000 votes in 2020 in Wisconsin. A legislative audit and study by a conservative group found no signs of significant voter fraud. Nevertheless, Vos – who has publicly stated Wisconsin’s electoral votes cannot be rescinded – named Gableman as special counsel and gave him a taxpayer-funded budget of $676,000 to complete a review. Vos and Gableman reached a new agreement March 8, 2022, that extends his work until at least April. On March 1, 2022, Gableman issued a wide-ranging report to an Assembly committee that included this claim:  ""The Center for Tech and Civic Life’s $8,800,000 Zuckerberg Plan Grant with the Cities of Milwaukee, Madison, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay (the Zuckerberg 5 Cities) violates Wisconsin law prohibiting election bribery.""  Those grants are what Gableman was referring to on the Carlson show. And that’s what Gableman’s staff pointed us to when we asked for backup to the claim. The Center for Tech and Civic Life, a national nonprofit organization, used $350 million in donations from Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, to issue grants aimed at helping local governments conduct safe elections during the COVID pandemic.  The group told PolitiFact Wisconsin it issued nearly 2,500 grants nationwide and that every eligible office that applied received at least some money. More than half went to election offices that serve less than 25,000 registered voters. The money arrived as local election budgets were drained by spending on election workers, postage and printing for the increasing number of voters who wanted to vote by mail. All told, $10 million in grants went to more than 200 communities across Wisconsin, including many in Republican areas. So, Gableman is wrong to suggest the money went only to five.  He and Republicans have trained their fire – and ire – on the $8.8 million that went to the state's five largest cities, which are home to many Democratic voters. That’s about 90 percent of the total distributed in the state. More importantly, the grants have been upheld by the courts. ""As former state Supreme Court Justice, Michael Gableman should know better than anyone that these baseless claims of ‘bribery’ were heard before the election and were rejected in court multiple times,"" the center said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  In one of the many lawsuits, U.S. District Judge William Griesbach, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, a Republican, refused to block the grant money, saying there was nothing in state law ""that can be fairly construed as prohibiting the defendant Cities from accepting funds from CTCL.""  Later, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on an appeal of that case that those who brought the lawsuit failed to identify any laws that would prohibit the grants.  Gableman has argued that various communities are the recipients of the ""bribe,"" never mind that he only focuses on five communities – and not the 195-plus more that received the same money. In his view, what Zuckerberg got for the ""bribe"" is the president he wanted. But it’s unclear why he would have then given the money to communities poised to deliver votes to Donald Trump, or have spent money in states where the outcome was never in doubt, instead of just swing states like Wisconsin. Gableman said five Wisconsin cities received money for the 2020 election from Mark Zuckerberg, which amounted to ""a wave of massive election bribery.""  But far more than five cities received the money. Gableman is ignoring ones in largely Republican areas. And courts have repeatedly upheld the grants as lawful, not bribery – much less a ""massive wave"" of bribery. As a former state Supreme Court justice, that’s a point Gableman should be familiar with. That makes the claim ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA983FC0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/15/michael-gableman/courts-have-repeatedly-upheld-grants-gableman-says/

No, Zelensky’s hospital visit video doesn’t feature combat medic who died weeks earlier
","Russia’s state-controlled media outlet Russia Today cast doubt on the authenticity of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky’s recent military hospital visit, suggesting without evidence that a video he posted with wounded soldiers may have been pre-recorded or staged. Zelensky posted the video of his visit on Telegram on March 13, along with photos on his official government website. Shortly after, Russia Today, Russian commentator Maria Dubovikova and other social media users falsely claimed that a woman who accompanied him was actually a combat medic who had been killed at the beginning of Russia’s invasion. ""Zelensky published a video in which he allegedly visited a hospital with wounded soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine today,"" states the translated version of a March 13 post from RT’s Russian-language Twitter account. ""But the footage showed a doctor, Inna Derusova, who died on Feb. 26.""  ""Attentive people mentioned a problem w/ today’s video of Zelenskiy visiting a hospital,"" Dubovikova wrote in one of two related tweets, which no longer appear on her page. ""There is physician Inna Derusova in the video, but she is dead since Feb. 26.""  She added: ""Thus the video is far from being even recent."" These posts echo viral internet rumors that baselessly claim the war is staged, scripted or exaggerated with crisis actors. The claim at the heart of the posts is wrong.

Spain’s Maldita.es analyzed a photo of Zelensky and Ostashchenko that was uploaded to Zelensky’s government website. Ostashchenko’s name could be seen on her uniform, the outlet reported, and facial recognition technology from Microsoft matched Ostashchenko’s face in the photo from the hospital to another photo of her — but not to another photo of Derusova.

Fact-checking Nikki Fried’s claim about Florida’s Medicaid funding
","Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a Democratic candidate for governor, criticized the state’s Medicaid policies at a recent virtual town hall meeting. Asked about the state’s Medicaid budget for developmental disabilities, Fried said that the program’s undersized funding says a lot about Florida’s legislative priorities.  ""It is disgusting that we are 49th in the nation when it comes to funding,"" Fried said about 20 minutes into the Feb. 21 event, which was hosted by the advocacy group Florida Voices for Health. ""The fact that we are not doing it is such a disgrace to our state and shows where the priorities are not right now in a Republican Legislature."" Medicaid is a joint state and federal program to provide health insurance to the very poor. The program has long been a point of contention among Florida’s politicians.  One of the state’s largest disputes related to the program is Medicaid expansion, which, if enacted, would extend the program’s eligibility to those with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.  To date, Florida is one of 12 states that has not expanded its Medicaid eligibility. While the efficacy of Florida’s Medicaid program has been debated since the state adopted it in 1970, we wondered whether Fried’s characterization of the program’s funding for people with disabilities really fit the bill. Data shows she’s right.  One way to gauge the accuracy of Fried’s statement is to examine the latest data available for each states’ overall Medicaid spending.  At first glance, Florida ranked fifth in the nation for overall Medicaid spending, at about $24 billion a year, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. When looking at the spending per capita, Florida ranks 10th. Though these rankings seem notable, they do not present a full picture of the program’s funding. The sizable spending figure can mostly be attributed to Florida’s dense population, the third largest in the U.S. To fairly compare Florida’s Medicaid spending with other states, experts said we should look at the state’s spending per enrollee.  Only three states — Nevada, Georgia and South Carolina — spent less than Florida per enrollee in fiscal year 2019, per the Kaiser Family Foundation, or KFF. While some states’ Medicaid budgets are funded 50/50 with state and federal dollars, Florida contributes less — its budget is 60% dependent on federal funding. ""Florida does okay by some of the people it considers most deserving,"" Scott Darius, executive director of Florida Voices for Health, told PolitiFact. ""But we keep state funding to a minimum.""  Still, Fried’s broader point was specifically related to Florida’s Medicaid spending on services for people with disabilities. The person who asked her the question at the town hall also referenced the statistic as he described his experience being wait-listed for services through Medicaid. Florida ranked 49th out of 50 states in per-capita Medicaid spending for intellectual and developmental disabilities, according to a 2019 report by the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council, a nonprofit research organization that drew from 2017 data.  The Florida Policy Institute, a progressive-leaning research organization, cited this statistic in its 2020-2021 budget report and noted that the ranking has remained consistent for years now. The KFF also ranked Florida 49th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in Medicaid spending for intellectual and developmental disabilities, at about $12,000 per enrollee in fiscal year 2019. The funding for Florida’s iBudget Medicaid Waiver, a program designed to provide ""medically necessary supports and services"" to those with developmental disabilities, has decreased by about 10% annually since 2007. More than 20,000 people with intellectual and developmental disability services are on a waitlist for Medicaid services, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Many have been on the list for several years.  Though Florida has recently approved more funding for the iBudget waiver, experts contend that the state needs to do more to ensure that Floridians with developmental disabilities receive the assistance they need. ""It’s way overdue for Florida leaders to step up and make a significant investment to eliminate the waitlist for these essential services,"" said Anne Swerlick, senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute. Florida’s legislature approved a $112.1 billion state budget on Monday, March 14, for the 2022-23 fiscal year. The final budget includes a $41.9 million appropriation to take about 789 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities off the waitlist, Darius told PolitiFact. ""Other than that, the funding seems to have stayed steady."" Darius said Florida’s ranking on this measure was unlikely to change at this level of funding. In response to a question about services to people with disabilities, Fried said Florida ranked ""49th in the nation when it comes to (Medicaid) funding."" While the latest data ranks Florida fifth in the nation for overall Medicaid spending, the context of Fried’s statement was related to the state’s funding for intellectual and developmental disability services.  Though Florida is spending a significant amount of money on its Medicaid program, the state is 49th in the U.S. regarding per-capita spending on services for people with disabilities. Since 2007, Florida’s fiscal effort for such services has decreased 10% annually.

""Classified documents (order by the Commander National Guard of Ukraine) acquired by @mod_russia confirm without a shadow of a doubt: the Kiev regime was covertly preparing an offensive operation against #Donbass, scheduled for March 2022,"" reads a tweet posted by the Russian Federation’s Ministry of Defense. The post included a Bitly link with ""more details."" Bitly, a URL shortening service, removed the link from its systems for being ""potentially harmful."" The document ""has nothing to do with planning an offensive operation,"" the Ukrainian National Guard told StopFake.org, a Ukrainian fact-checking organization. StopFake.org is a verified signatory of the International Fact-checking Network, which promotes nonpartisan and independent fact-checking around the world and is run by PolitiFact’s owner, the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. ""The plan of an offensive operation must provide for the presence of some specific goals that are not in the document,"" the Ukrainian National Guard said. ""This is not an order to march to some position in the (Joint Forces Operation) zone, followed by deployment for an offensive. This is an order for conducting combat coordination in the Lviv region!"" Ukrainian fact-checkers also determined that it isn’t a classified document, because it does not have the corresponding marks.  The document represents a typical order for a military training camp for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and National Guard of Ukraine in Starichi, a region in the Lyiv Oblast, according to fact-checkers. That’s in western Ukraine — on the opposite side of the country from the Donbas.  While the Donbas region was mentioned in the document, it ""was not either a prominent part of the document nor stated in an offensive context, both of which were alleged in the misleading Russian presentation,"" Christo Grozev, the executive director of Bellingcat, an online investigations organization, told PolitiFact.  According to fact-checkers from Science Feedback, another IFCN signatory, the document includes instructions to set up training for battalions to fulfill tasks in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas. There’s no additional information on when, where and what kind of operations, so the document doesn’t prove the claim that ""without a shadow of a doubt"" Ukraine was preparing an attack on the Donbas in March 2022. Russian officials shared a Ukrainian document on Twitter with claims that it showed secret, classified orders for a military offensive on the Donbas region in southeastern Ukraine.  This is wrong. There is no proof that the document is classified, and there are no direct statements in it about an attack on the Donbas. The document makes references to a training camp on the opposite side of the country.  We rate claims about a document showing a planned military offensive in the Donbas False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC53CC0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/14/tweets/no-document-doesnt-show-secret-ukrainian-military-/

Kamala Harris did not laugh at Ukraine or idea of U.S. offering aid
","A blog article headline claims that a 15-second exchange between Vice President Kamala Harris and Poland’s President Andrzej Duda during a 48-minute news conference is evidence that Harris was callous about Ukraine and its refugees. The headline on the March 10 article reads, ""Vice President Kamala Harris laughs at the plight of Ukraine; at idea of America offering assistance."" It was published on The Raging Patriot blog, classified as a ""questionable"" source of information by Media Bias Factcheck. The article was shared on Facebook and flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Harris laughed during the March 10 news conference in Warsaw — as did Duda — but the headline mischaracterizes why she was laughing.  Harris and Duda ""were laughing about who would speak first amidst simultaneous translations — they were certainly not laughing about refugees,"" Herbie Ziskend, deputy communications director for Harris, said in a March 10 tweet. He noted that Harris also had announced funding to support Ukrainian civilians. The exchange in question came near the end of the 48-minute press conference, when an NPR reporter asked the final question. At the 40:34 mark, after the reporter stated her question, Harris and Duda looked at one another, Harris said, ""Okay,"" and Duda laughed. Harris said, ""A friend in need is a friend indeed,"" and laughed, then Duda began his answer. The phrase ""a friend in need is a friend indeed"" was used more than once during the press conference, including earlier by Duda, who said, ""As Madam Vice President remarked today, ‘A friend in need is a friend indeed.’ That is why I’m really happy that today, when we are in need and when the NATO eastern flank is in need, the United States, by the decision of President Joe Biden, has deployed additional troops."" After Duda’s answer to the NPR question, Harris said that the U.S. recognizes the generosity and kindness that Poland has shown to Ukrainian refugees. ""So the United States is absolutely prepared to do what we can and what we must, to support Poland in terms of the burden that they have taken on, that I think all of us who understand the moral obligation we should feel to help people who are fleeing harm and seeking refuge; the burden we should all be prepared to take on to support those people who are fleeing their home when they don’t want to leave,"" she said, according to the transcript. Harris also announced $53 million in new humanitarian funding from the U.S. government to support Ukrainian civilians. The moment of laughter that was singled out was not the first time during the press conference when the two paused and appeared to try to decide, laughingly, who should speak first. At the 35-minute mark, they also gestured and laughed as they determined who would reply first. An article headline says, ""Vice President Kamala Harris laughs at the plight of Ukraine; at idea of America offering assistance."" Harris laughed during the press conference, but in reference to whether she or Duda would speak first amidst simultaneous translations. Duda also laughed. The full context makes clear they were not laughing at the situation in Ukraine or offering assistance. In her remarks that preceded and followed the laughter, Harris expressed concern about the refugees and said there is a moral obligation to help them. We rate this claim False.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA7D100>],/factchecks/2022/mar/14/blog-posting/kamala-harris-did-not-laugh-ukraine-or-idea-us-off/

No, Kamala Harris didn’t defer to Polish president on gas prices
","There was an awkward pause when Vice President Kamala Harris was asked how long Americans should expect to be paying record-high gas prices in a news conference on March 11. But the reason for the pause is not the one being portrayed by people who are sharing an edited video clip of the event to criticize the vice president. ""Here’s Kamala Harris with really no answers about gasoline prices,"" Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo said to her guest, former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on March 13. ""Watch how she responds, look."" Bartiromo plays a clip where a reporter asks Harris how long Americans should be bracing for ""historic inflation and some unprecedented gas prices."" There is a pause as Harris and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis look at each other for a moment before Harris begins speaking. Miller was incredulous. ""It was a heart-stopping moment. She was asked about gasoline prices and inflation in America and she tried to defer to President Duda, the Polish president,"" Miller said. ""It is truly horrifying to think that the vice president of the United States lacks confidence so extremely on our domestic issues that she wants the president of Poland to discuss our gas prices and our inflation. And then she starts stammering about the Black Sea and reading her notes"" Miller gets two things wrong in his comments. First, he mixes up the presidents of Romania and Poland. Andrzej Duda is the president of Poland, who Harris met with on March 10. A video clip of that news conference was discussed first in the ""Sunday Futures"" segment, and Bartiromo and Miller criticized Harris for laughing after a question about refugees. In the second video clip Bartiromo played for Miller, Harris was holding a joint news conference on March 11 with Iohannis. Miller, apparently thinking the clip was from the first news conference, then references the Polish president instead of the Romanian one. Secondly, Aamer Madhani of the Associated Press asked two questions, one first for Iohannis of Romania and one for Harris. The video edited out the first question about the threat Romania faces in the Black Sea from Russia and what help he was seeking from Harris. His second question, addressed to Harris, was about gas prices and inflation. The awkward pause came as Harris and Iohannis looked at each other to determine who would answer first, not because Harris was deferring to a foreign leader to answer the gas price question, as Miller falsely alleges. Harris, a transcript of the news conference shows, said the leaders discussed a range of topics, including the Black Sea, which she said Iohannis could discuss in more detail. The Fox News video then cut off the rest of her answer before Miller launched into his criticism. Harris went on to discuss the situation in Ukraine before vaguely addressing the question about inflation and gas, saying ""The President did say in the State of the Union, there is a price to pay for democracy. Got to stand with your friends."" Miller said that Vice President Kamala Harris tried to defer to the Polish president when asked a question about high gas prices in the U.S. He’s wrong on both counts. Harris was speaking in a joint news conference with the president of Romania, not the Polish president. And the video clip played before Miller’s criticism edited out the first part of the question to Iohannis. The two leaders paused to determine who would answer first, not because Harris wanted him to answer about U.S. gas prices.

Video shows police in France in 2019, not Germany in 2021
","""Meanwhile in Germany…"" reads the text over a video that shows a man playing the ""Imperial March"" from ""Star Wars"" as black-clad police officers walk by.  The video was posted to Facebook on Dec. 14 2021, after a weekend of protests against COVID-19 policies in multiple German cities, including some demonstrations that became violent.  The video continued to draw comments and be shared in March 2022. But this video wasn’t filmed in 2021, and not in Germany either.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) People can be heard speaking French in the video, including a man who appears to be holding the camera saying ""encore, encore, encore,"" which means ""again"" in French. The word ""police"" appears on the back of the officers’ uniforms — it’s the same word as in English. In German, the word is ""polizei.""  A version of this footage appeared online as early as February 2019, a year before the pandemic. Fact Crescendo, a fact-checking outlet in India, pinpointed the location of the incident in Marseille, France, when it debunked a claim in 2020 that the recording showed police in the United States during protests over George Floyd’s death.  We rate claims that this happened in Germany in 2021 False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBA7D40>],/factchecks/2022/mar/11/viral-image/video-shows-police-france-2019/

Footage of Marines training in Arizona mischaracterized as showing Russians in Ukraine
","There are a few easy clues that a video posted on Facebook on March 7 doesn’t actually show the ""Russian war in Ukraine,"" as the description claims.  ""RussianFrogfoot Eats Anti-Air Missile,"" the post says. ""Keeps Flying."" But while much of the footage coming out of Ukraine shows a cold, wintry landscape, this video was clearly filmed in the desert, and Americans can be heard talking in the background as helicopters circle what looks like a village that’s under attack.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In reality, the video is an ocean and many countries away from Ukraine. It’s of a Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona. The village is a fake one made out of shipping containers that the Marines call ""Yodaville."" It’s a training range where Marines can practice air support exercises.  Capt. Ryan Bruce with the Marine Corps confirmed that the footage in the Facebook post shows Yodaville, but he said he didn’t know when it is from. We found what appears to be some of the video in this 2015 post on Military.com. The description says it shows gunships firing rockets and machine guns ""on the simulated village of Yodaville during a helicopter close air support (CAS) training exercise near Yuma.""
