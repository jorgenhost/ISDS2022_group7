Rodney Frelinghuysen claims proposed millionaires’ tax would harm small business owners
","
The millionaires’ tax proposal made its latest appearance in New Jersey this summer. Now it’s in the national spotlight.

Congressional Republicans and Democrats are going toe to toe on whether to raise taxes on individuals making more than $1 million to pay for pieces of President Barack Obama’s jobs proposal.

U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-11th Dist.) joined the national fray after a bill for $60 billion in spending on transportation and infrastructure that would have been paid for with an income tax hike of less than 1 percent was blocked in the Senate.

""To offset the ‘temporary’ spending, the proposal would contain a permanent tax increase on Americans earning $1 million annually.  Here’s the problem: the so-called ‘millionaire surtax’ is a permanent tax to pay for a temporary benefit,"" Frelinghuysen wrote in a Nov. 4 newsletter. ""And the President’s own Department of the Treasury says 41 percent of all business income reported on individual returns would be hit by the surtax. Thus, the President’s tax would harm small businessmen and women, the very people we are counting on to create new jobs and hire new workers!""

PolitiFact New Jersey found the congressman used a statistic that refers to all businesses to make a point about small business owners.

The 41 percent figure comes from an August technical paper from career staff at the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis. It identifies small business owners for the purpose of tax policy analysis.

According to that paper, business owners with more than $1 million in adjusted gross income  received 41 percent of business income, or about $237 billion. We should note that represents earnings, not individuals. Individuals with more than $1 million in income account for 2 percent of all business owners.

But small business income, by the paper’s broad definition, accounts for about 28 percent of that overall income, or $67 billion. Large business income accounts for nearly 72 percent of all business income, or $170 billion.

If you drill down further, and look at just small business income, individuals with more than $1 million in income received between 14 percent and 18 percent of small business income and represent 1 percent of small business owners.

For large business owners, those making more than $1 million in income received 83 percent of large business income and represent 13 percent of large business owners.

Frelinghuysen’s emphasis on small business owners is ""not consistent with what he just said about the 41 percent,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""He draws an implication that doesn’t really tie to what he just said.""

""The sentence following the 41 percent number could be viewed as misleading in its reference to ‘small’ business people, although it is not incorrect,"" said Alan Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in an email. ""Some of the tax would indeed fall on (‘harm’) small businesses,"" he said, ""although more of the tax would fall on large businesses.""

It’s worth nothing that Frelinghuysen also said it’s small businesses that ""we are counting on to create new jobs and hire new workers,"" but the Office of Tax Analysis paper found that slightly more than one-fifth of small businesses fit its definition of an employer.

A spokesman for the congressman said Frelinghuysen is ""en route back to the United States from an official visit to our troops in Afghanistan and is unavailable to comment,"" but said the congressman’s statement was correct.

""I regret that the Star-Ledger has chosen to apply another interpretation to the Treasury Department data,"" he wrote in an email.

Our ruling

Frelinghuysen claimed the Treasury Department said ""41 percent of all business income reported on individual returns would be hit by the surtax. Thus, the President’s tax would harm small businessmen and women, the very people we are counting on to create new jobs and hire new workers!"" 

The congressman’s use of the statistic is misleading. Frelinghuysen applies the statistic to small business owners, saying it would hurt the individuals we are counting on to create jobs. But the figure represents income from all businesses, not just small businesses.

And the same report he’s basing his information on found that slightly more than one-fifth of small businesses are employers.

We rate the statement Mostly False.

Rhode Island AARP head Kathleen Connell says 60 percent of state retirees don’t get Social Security
","
Among the more vocal critics of the Chafee administration’s plan to overhaul the state pension system is the head of the Rhode Island chapter of the AARP.

Kathleen S. Connell, a former secretary of state and one-time teacher, testified before a joint meeting of the Senate and House Finance Committees on Oct. 26 that the plan to suspend annual cost-of-living increases for retirees would be especially onerous for those who don’t collect Social Security.

Responding to a question posed by Senate Finance Chairman Daniel DaPonte about how many retirees don’t get Social Security, Connell said:  ""I believe the figure is on the order of 60 percent of the state retirees -- which are the ones we are addressing -- don’t get Social Security.’’

Her statement prompted some head-shaking in the audience. So we decided to check it out.

We contacted the Rhode Island AARP, and John Martin, the group’s spokesman, responded in an e-mail. ""This has been called to our attention,’’ Martin wrote.

Martin said that while Connell did, indeed, say ""state retirees,"" she actually meant ""state teacher retirees [emphasis added] who do not collect Social Security.""

That’s ""around 50 percent,"" he said. (The figure, he said, is based on data from the state Retirement System and the National Institute on Retirement Security, a nonprofit policy research organization in Washington.)

But teachers were never specifically mentioned during the exchange, and we think anyone listening would assume, as we did, that Connell was referring to all retirees in the state-run plans that were being discussed.

So we still wanted to know the answer to the Senate chairman’s question: How many state retirees don’t receive Social Security?

The facts

Social Security, the federal insurance program signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is designed to pay a post-retirement income to workers who contributed to the program.

In 1950, Congress expanded Social Security coverage to state and local government employees not covered by other retirement plans; in 1954, the act was amended again to make it available to all state and local employees, except for police officers and firefighters.

But state participation was voluntary. Massachusetts, for example, declined coverage for its public employees.

Rhode Island opted into the Social Security system for most state workers, but made local participation optional.

Participation requires contributions from both employers and employees. Some communities chose not to join. Others did sign on. The result is a patchwork system of coverage.

As far as we could tell, no single agency in Rhode Island knows the precise number of retirees in the state system who are covered by Social Security -- not even the state Office of the General Treasurer, according to its spokeswoman, Joy Fox.

But we did manage to get a good estimate. Here’s how we did it.

The state retirement system comprises five separate pension plans. The largest has 11,421 retired state employees and beneficiaries (generally spouses or children),  according to the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island June 30, 2010, actuarial report. All of them, Fox said, are covered by Social Security.

The next largest plan covers teachers, with 10,213 retirees and beneficiaries, according to the same actuarial report.

Based on the number of active teachers in each school district and the Social Security Agreements filed with the state, the treasurer’s office estimates that about half -- roughly 5,100 retired teachers -- are covered by Social Security.

Teachers in 14 of the state’s 37 school districts -- including Providence, Pawtucket, North Providence, Warwick and Woonsocket -- are covered by Social Security, according to the Rhode Island Association of School Committees.

Frank Flynn, president of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, whose members work for 11 of the 15 school districts, agrees with the treasurer’s estimate.

After teachers, the next largest group of retirees in the state system  -- just under 4,500 -- are local police, firefighters and municipal employees.

The Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns reports its survey found that all municipal employees in Rhode Island are covered by Social Security. But that’s not the case with police and firefighters.

In fact, several of the state’s larger, urban police and fire departments -- including Providence -- have no Social Security coverage, according to the League’s survey.

With the help of one of our newsroom data gurus, we looked at the records of more than 4,000 retired municipal, police and firefighters and their beneficiaries (or 90 percent of that group) in the state system. We found that about 95 percent of them are covered by Social Security.

So, all state employees, roughly half of all teachers and 95 percent of retired municipal, police and firefighters in the state retirement system get Social Security.

The remaining two groups of retirees in the state system are judges and state police.

All of the 81 retired judges and their beneficiaries get Social Security, according to Craig Berke, a spokesman for the state judiciary system.

And none of the 266 retired state police are covered by Social Security.

Add all the numbers up, and the share of retirees in the state-run plans who do get Social Security is about 78 percent.  

Even if we added in another 3,000 or so police and firefighters in municipally-run pension plans, almost all of whom don’t get Social Security, the overall percentage of those covered would still be 70 percent.

(A week after Connell’s testimony, Mark Dingley, the state’s deputy treasurer, testified before the same committee that the share of current employees in state-run plans is about 75 percent.)

The ruling

Connell was clearly wrong when she said that 60 percent of ""state retirees"" don’t get Social Security. Our research found it’s about 22 percent.
 
Connell’s spokesman said she meant retired teachers, not all retirees, although she didn’t make that distinction at the time. Even then, that number is 50 percent, not 60 percent.

We rule Connell’s statement False. 
Correction: The initial version of this item reported that teachers in the City of Central Falls, R.I., were covered by Social Security. That was based on information from the Rhode Island Association of School Committees. After this item was published, the association said that it had made a mistake. In fact, Central Falls teachers are not covered by Social Security.

Sen. Jim Webb says Ronald Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times
","
U.S. Senator Jim Webb, who will not seek reelection next year, has been lamenting the partisanship that grips the nation.

During a recent interview with ABC News, the Virginia Democrat was incredulous over the fighting that occurred this summer before Congress raised the debt ceiling so the United States could pay its bills.

An August deal raised the federal government’s $14.3 trillion borrowing authority to $16.4 trillion, a level that is expected to keep the government operating until early 2013.

""(President) Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times,"" said Webb, a former Republican who served as Reagan’s secretary of the Navy .

Webb is hardly the first Democrat to cite Reagan’s record on the debt limit. President Barack Obama, in a televised speech on July 25, said raising the borrowing cap has been a routine practice by Congress and presidents since the 1950s. Obama also said Reagan increased the debt ceiling 18 times.

We asked Webb’s office what the Senator based his statement on. Will Jenkins, Webb’s director of communications, cited a chart by the Office of Management and Budget that details 18 different laws signed to raise the debt limit during Reagan’s presidency from January 1981 to January 1989.

This seemed like a cut-and-dry case for PolitiFact Virginia. But like so many of the claims we investigate, there was a snag.

We came across several news stories saying Reagan hiked the debt limit 17 times, not 18. For example, Chris Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, was quoted in a July 16, 2011, article in The Hill newspaper using the lower number. We also found references to 17 Reagan-era debt limit hikes in The Washington Post and FactCheck.org.

We looked at the OMB chart again. After each law increasing the borrowing limit is a column showing the new, higher level of the debt ceiling.

Two of the 18 bills - one approved on May 15, 1987, and another approved on July 30, 1987 - are listed as boosting the debt limit to the same amount -- $2.32 trillion. Should they be counted as one increase, or two?

Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted in an e-mail that the May, 1987 increase to $2.32 trillion was a temporary hike. When that limit expired on July 17, 1987, the debt limit reverted to a previous level of $2.1 trillion, Kogan said.

But after a couple of weeks, Congress passed yet another temporary debt boost at the end of July 1987 increasing the debt ceiling from $2.1 trillion back to $2.32 trillion, he said.

Kogan, a former senior adviser to the Office of Management and Budget, said it’s a semantic question as to whether the July, 1987 should be considered its own increase, but added he personally would consider it a second debt ceiling hike.

Our ruling:

Webb said Reagan signed off 18 times on increasing the national debt. Figures from the Office of Management and Budget do show 18 laws were signed to increase the debt limit during Reagan’s eight years in office.

A semantic argument can be made that the actual debt limit was raised only 17 times during the Reagan administration, but we don’t think it’s worth the haggle. We rate Webb’s statement True.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Energy', 'Bill Clinton']","
Bill Clinton says wind, solar are already cheaper than nuclear energy
","
During a Nov. 8, 2011, appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, former President Bill Clinton touted the prospects for adopting renewable energy.

""Solar energy and wind energy ... would already be competitive with coal if you had to pay the extraneous costs of coal -- the health care costs and other things. And ... wind within two years and solar within five will be competitive in price with coal. They're both cheaper than nuclear right now.""

A reader asked us to check Clinton’s comment. We won’t rate his claim that wind and solar will be competitive with coal within two and five years respectively, since that’s a prediction. Instead, we’ll focus on his claim that solar and wind energy are ""both cheaper than nuclear right now.""

We found a price comparison published in 2011 by the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the U.S. Department of Energy. It uses ""levelized cost"" to compare various energy technologies. This measurement, widely used by energy policy analysts, includes the inflation-adjusted price tag for building and operating a plant over its life cycle.

Here’s the summary table from this study, with the relevant technologies in bold. (One factor that was not included in this calculation was state or federal incentives, such as tax credits.) 
  
94.8 
109.4 
136.2 
66.1 
63.1 
89.3 
124.5 
103.5 
113.9 
97.0 
243.2 
210.7 
311.8 
101.7 
112.5 
86.4 
  
So, according to this study, the least expensive form of wind energy -- using onshore turbines -- is about 15 percent cheaper than nuclear. But the cheapest form of solar -- using photovoltaic panels -- is about 85 percent more expensive than nuclear. This means that Clinton’s claim was half-right. (Clinton also could have pointed to three additional forms of renewable energy that are cheaper than nuclear -- geothermal, biomass and hydropower.)

The experts we contacted generally agreed with this analysis.

""It’s common and convenient to couple solar and wind in offhand references, but solar-based electricity remains, for now, appreciably costlier than wind,"" said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, a Washington-based think tank on energy and environmental issues. He cautioned that not including government incentives does add to the uncertainty of these figures, though it potentially cuts both ways. For instance, nuclear plants benefit from the Price-Anderson Act, which limits their accident liability, while solar and wind receive different types of tax credits, he said.

Stephen Brown, an economist at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas who specializes in energy policy, agreed that Clinton was right on wind but not on solar. He added that if you include additional factors known as externalities -- the kinds of things Clinton was referring to in the first part of his quote, such as the spillover environmental costs of the technology in question -- then the cost comparison could change. For instance, if the externalities were found to be sufficiently low for solar and sufficiently high for nuclear, he said, solar might end up being cheaper than nuclear.

However, since Clinton wasn’t making that comparison, we won’t factor that possibility into our rating.

A final thought from Darmstadter: In the short term, the comparative price options make natural gas, not any of the renewable fuels, the lowest-cost competitor with coal. Several natural gas technologies are cheaper than coal, according to the Energy Department study.

Our ruling

Clinton was correct about wind energy being ""cheaper than nuclear right now,"" at least the onshore kind. But for now, nuclear beats the cheapest form of solar energy on price. So we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BA88C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/11/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-wind-solar-are-already-cheaper-n/

Nancy Pelosi tells Jon Stewart congressional approval rating was 40 percent in April 2009
","
During an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., discussed the public’s dismal view of Congress. 
Stewart began the interview by joking that the public’s approval of Congress ranks ""slightly below, from what I understand, hepatitis C."" Pelosi responded by joking, ""And you wonder who are these people who approve of Congress, these 9 percent!"" 
She proceeded to draw a contrast between the current Republican-controlled House and the Democratic House she presided over as speaker from January 2007 to January 2011. 
""The last time I was here in April of 2009 ... the Democrats were in control and the congressional (approval) rating was 40 percent. Do you remember that?"" 
We actually didn’t, and when a reader asked us to fact-check it, we did. (She repeated the claim later in the interview.) 
We looked in the polling archive of RealClearPolitics.com and found four relevant polls during the month of April 2009. The approval ratings raged from a low of 26 percent approval to a high of 38 percent approval, for an average of just under 32 percent. So neither the average for April nor any individual poll within that month reached 40 percent, making Pelosi’s statement incorrect. (Still, 38 percent is close.) 
She’s on somewhat firmer ground if you expand the parameters. 
If you look at the months of March, April and May 2009, you’ll find two polls with 41 percent support. Still, all the other polls during that period were lower, and the average for the 13 polls is 35 percent -- still short of the 40 percent mark that Pelosi cited. 
This compares to the most recent three polls asking this question, which showed congressional approval below 13 percent. 
We should add that if Pelosi wants to tout the public’s approval of Democratic stewardship of Congress, the period she chose was clearly the high point of her tenure. Things went downhill from there. Within six months, approval ratings plunged to the mid-to-low 20s. Within about a year, approval ratings were often sinking into the teens. 
Our ruling 
Strictly speaking, Pelosi’s incorrect: Congressional approval didn’t hit 40 percent during the month of April 2009. Polls taken that month averaged just under 32 percent. But the rating did exceed that benchmark twice within the 13 polls taken in March, April and May 2009. On balance, we rate her statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DBCE40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/11/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-tells-jon-stewart-congressional-appro/

Tea party group says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has created a manufacturing-led jobs recovery, with 30,000 new jobs created this year
","
Gov. Scott Walker plays a prominent role in a nationally televised ad criticizing President Barack Obama’s proposed jobs legislation.

The ad, titled ""The Perry-Walker Way,"" cites job creation in Texas under Gov. Rick Perry and in Wisconsin under Walker. Both Walker and Perry, a presidential candidate, are Republicans.

The ad says the Obama plan calls for more government spending, increased regulations and higher taxes on those who create jobs. It cites the performance of Perry and Walker as offering a ""better way"" to create jobs, and then continues:

""In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker has created a manufacturing-led jobs recovery ... 30,000 new jobs were created this year, with 15,000 in the struggling manufacturing sector.""

We’ve had a lot of jobs-related statements lately.

Does this one add up? Are we really in a manufacturing-led jobs recovery?

We asked the Sacramento, Calif.-based State Tea Party Express for back up on the group’s claim about Walker’s performance on jobs. Spokesman Taylor Budowich sent us to a familiar source: PolitiFact Wisconsin, and specifically our Walk-O-Meter which tracks the governor’s campaign promises.

Of course, the top campaign promise made by Walker is that the state would create 250,000 private-sector jobs during his four-year term. Each month we update the Walk-O-Meter using state data, for a promise that remains In the Works.

Let’s dip -- again -- into the numbers.

The Tea Party ad aired in the middle of October 2011. The latest state employment numbers available at that point said there were 2,346,800 private-sector jobs in Wisconsin in August 2011, an increase of 29,600 since Walker took office in January 2011.

On the manufacturing front, a state report said there were 450,000 manufacturing jobs in the state, up 16,100 from when Walker took office.

(We’re not using the most recent jobs report, issued Oct. 20, because the State Tea Party Express ad began to air before that report was issued. The latest report says the overall change in the number of jobs since Walker took office is 29,300, 900 fewer than the previous month.)

So, the numbers are essentially accurate, but they are just part of the groups’ claim. The group maintains those numbers are evidence of a ""manufacturing-led jobs recovery.""

Are we in one?

A closer look at the month-to-month numbers show the situation is not nearly as encouraging as the ad suggests.

Indeed, the state lost a net 11,600 private sector jobs in July and August. (And another 900 in September,). Even Walker’s administration recognize this as a concern. On Oct. 21 2011, the state Department of Revenue said that by 2014 the state will have added only 136,000 jobs in the private sector compared with 2010 -- far short of the 250,000 net new jobs promised.

The department’s report says the manufacturing sector has recovered about a third of the jobs lost in the recession. It projects that sector will continue to grow this year, then slow between 2012 and 2014.

""In spite of this sustained growth,"" the report states, ""employment in this sector by the end of 2014 will still be 27,500 jobs short of its previous peak eight years ago.""

Beyond all that, the Tea Party -- like Walker -- highlights the private sector jobs. But the ad does not let viewers in on that fact. There is a somewhat different picture when you look at all jobs, including public-sector ones -- police, firefighters, teachers, sanitation workers and more.

In Wisconsin, government employment as of August was 419,600, up 500 from when Walker took office. (That number tumbled in September to 409,300 - 10,000 fewer jobs than when the governor took office. That sharp decline was shown in the Oct. 20 report, after the ad began running.)

The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 7.8 percent for September, compared with 9.1 percent nationally.

So the overall picture is not as rosy as the ad proclaims.

Our conclusion

With unemployment stubbornly high, jobs and job creation are central themes in state and national politics. In this case, the national Tea Party says Walker ""created a manufacturing-led jobs recovery"" that led to the ""creation of 30,000 new jobs.""

The numbers are essentially on the money. But the group makes a broad statement about jobs, when it is looking only at the private-sector side of the equation. What’s more, it does not reflect that the most recent months have seen a loss of jobs and the Walker administration itself sees weaknesses in the economy and future job growth.

We rate the group’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B30C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/11/state-tea-party-express-state-tea-party-express/tea-party-group-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-ha/

Bishop signs letter saying post office faces big pension burden
","
U.S. Postal Service leaders warn dire budget problems might force them to close offices and lay off 220,000 workers to keep from shutting down completely.

But as ugly as the agency’s $9 billion deficit seems, lawmakers could do one simple thing to help stanch the bleeding, the postmaster general argues. Change laws that make the post office pay for retiree benefits years before the bills come due.  

Recently, U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, an Albany Democrat, signed a letter with 81 other members of Congress that echoed this argument.

""The Postal Service would still have positive net revenue today except for the requirement that it prefund 100% of employee retirement and retirement health costs, a requirement that Congress imposed on it in 2006,"" it said.

""No other public or private business in America faces this onerous and unnecessary requirement, and Congress could give the Postal Service breathing room to recalibrate its business model simply by repealing this retirement prefunding requirement,"" it continued.

Our sister site PolitiFact National has already written about whether the post office’s financial losses would be solved by changing pension laws.  

What drew PolitiFact Georgia’s attention is the letter’s suggestion that the Postal Service is being singled out unfairly. Is it true that no other public or private business in America must prefund 100 percent of the costs of its retiree pension and health care benefits?

Before we address this question, we should note that the USPS is a unique government organization. It’s a part of the executive branch, but unlike a typical federal employer, it can go belly up.   

And unlike with a typical business, Congress can pass laws that directly dictate how the Postal Service spends billions of dollars.

One of these is the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. It requires the Postal Service to do what’s called ""prefund"" 100 percent of the health benefits for its future retirees.  The cost: About $5 billion a year until 2017.  

This is how it works. Each year, the federal government estimates how much Postal Service employees earned in pension and health retirement benefits and calculates what the USPS needs to save to pay these bills in the future. By law, the USPS has to store that money in a trust fund.

The federal Office of Personnel Management, which oversees pensions for federal workers, acknowledged in a Feb. 28 study that among federal employers, the retiree health benefit funding rule is unique to the post office.

They also said it’s essential. The USPS could go out of business, sticking the federal government with a bill it cannot pay. This could force the entire federal retiree health program to go broke, the OPM report argued.   

Now, let’s look at Bishop’s claim.

Federal employers:

Under the current retirement system, all federal employers, including the Postal Service, must prefund their pension benefits. And as we explained earlier, the USPS does have unique health benefit funding rules.

It’s therefore accurate that under the current retirement system, no federal employer aside from the Postal Service must prefund 100 percent of both its retiree health and pension benefits.

State and local governments:

No federal or state rules require state or local governments to fully fund pension or health benefits, said Keith Brainard, director of research for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.

None of the experts we interviewed had heard of cities, towns or counties with health prefunding requirements.

Private industry:

By federal law, private companies must fund their pensions fully, and catch up over time if they fall behind. They don’t have to prefund retiree health benefits.

This means there’s no reason to go postal over the claim by Bishop and others that ""no other public or private business in America"" except for the USPS must fund 100 percent of employee pension and retirement health costs in advance.

By and large, this statement fits the evidence.

We do take some issue with the claim’s broader point, which is that the retirement funding requirement unfairly singles out the post office. As we noted above, the office that manages federal retiree benefits argues the arrangement could keep the entire federal health benefit fund from going broke.

With this dispute in mind, we rule Bishop’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972DCE40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/11/sanford-bishop/bishop-signs-letter-saying-post-office-faces-big-p/
"['Immigration', 'Education', 'Texas', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Obama, Pelosi and Reid agree with Rick Perry on in-state tuition
","
To ominous background music, a video posted online by Mitt Romney’s campaign opens with a narrator asking, ""Who supports Gov. (Rick) Perry’s decision to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants?""

Next, photographs of President Barack Obama, U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada appear onscreen, one after the other. That’s followed by a November 2003 video clip of Vicente Fox, Mexico’s president at the time, thanking Perry for Texas’ 2001 law enabling some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at the state’s public colleges and universities. Fox’s thanks, which were videotaped by C-SPAN, were offered during a visit to Austin.

That moment aside, we wondered if Romney, the former Massachusetts governor vying with Perry and others for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, was correct in saying that the three Democratic leaders support Perry’s action.

This fall, Romney and other candidates have hammered Perry for the Texas law, which Perry has defended as giving solid students opportunities not to be drags on society. Also, Perry has accurately noted that the proposal cleared the Texas House and Senate with minimal opposition.

Under the Texas law, undocumented immigrants with a Texas high school diploma or GED who have lived in Texas for at least three years can qualify for in-state tuition if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they can.

We asked Romney’s campaign staff for backup on the Sept. 29, 2011, video’s claims. Spokesman Ryan Williams pointed us to news stories and government web pages showing Obama, Pelosi and Reid backing versions of the proposed federal DREAM Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, if they attend college or serve in the military.

We’ll explore the DREAM Act aspect in a moment.

First, we wondered whether any of the Democratic leaders have spoken explicitly about the Texas law.

Romney’s material offered nothing specific about that, though it noted that as a member of the Illinois Senate, Obama co-sponsored legislation to allow undocumented immigrant students to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. That measure became law in 2003.

Like the Texas law, the Illinois act requires benefiting students to have a high school diploma or GED from an institution in the state and to sign affidavits swearing to apply for permanent legal residency. Texas requires students to have lived in the state for three years prior to receiving a diploma/GED while Illinois requires that the students attended school in-state for the three years before they received a diploma/GED.

According to legislative records, Obama was one of 26 senators listed as co-sponsors of the proposal. He does not appear to have been a key advocate; none of 40 news items that we found published on the measure in 2002-03 mentions him.

In interviews and by email, aides for Pelosi, Reid and Obama each said their boss had not spoken about the Texas law.

We found no news accounts showing otherwise. More broadly, news reports yielded no flat endorsements by the Democratic leaders of state laws allowing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, yet also no indications that any of the three object.

During a 2007 visit to Arizona, Pelosi made what the Arizona Republic described as a ""reference to the effect of"" a state law barring illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates.

The paper’s Feb. 20, 2007, news story says Pelosi described meeting a prospective student who could not prove she was a legal U.S. resident and then said: ""Our country does not benefit by our depriving young people of an education.""

Her comment, though, falls short of calling for in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.

Asked to clarify Obama’s position on in-state tuition laws, White House spokesman Adam Abrams told us that he has not weighed in on the issue as president.

However, Obama recently voiced a sentiment similar to Pelosi’s: Speaking in support of the DREAM Act during a May 10, 2011, address in El Paso, Obama said that ""we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents. We should stop denying them the chance to earn an education.""

Reid has used similar words. Romney’s campaign cites a 2007 example in which MSNBC quotes Reid arguing for the DREAM Act: ""Children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents.""

But does the Democrats’ support for the DREAM Act — confirmed by their spokesmen — back up Romney’s claim?

Most DREAM Act versions, including those pending before the U.S. House and Senate, would repeal a 1996 federal provision that some people interpret as a ban on states allowing illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state college tuition rates unless everyone legally in the U.S. can get the same benefit. The provision says: ""An alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state (or a political subdivision) for any post-secondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit (in no less an amount, duration and scope) without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident."" 
Our ruling

Obama once co-sponsored a measure like the Texas tuition law, giving Romney’s claim a thread of truth. However, none of the Democrats has aired support for Perry’s decision to sign his state’s proposal into law, which is the essence of the claim. We rate Romney’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097088880>],/factchecks/2011/nov/10/mitt-romney/romney-video-claims-democratic-leaders-agree-perry/

Michele Bachmann says U.S. will soon send enough interest to China to pay for their military
","
During the Nov. 9, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Michigan, Rep. Michele Bachmann took aim at the United States’ dependence on borrowing from China with the use of a striking statistic. 
""By 2015, we will be sending so much interest money over, we will be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army of China, the No. 1 employer of the world,"" she said. 
We wondered whether the part about interest payments and the People’s Liberation Army was accurate. (We have seen conflicting information about whether the PLA is the world’s largest employer, so we’re not going to rate that part of her statement.) 
First, some background. The PLA is the primary military entity within China and includes the army, navy, and air force, as well as the nation’s nuclear missile assets. It has 2.3 million people on active or reserve status. 
Officially, the Chinese defense budget is $91.5 billion for 2011. But many experts believe the actual figure is significantly higher. In an annual report to Congress, the Pentagon said that ""estimating actual PLA military expenditures is a difficult process due to the lack of accounting transparency and China’s still incomplete transition from a command economy. Moreover, China’s published military budget does not include major categories of expenditure."" 
So the Pentagon estimated that China’s total military-related spending for 2009 was actually ""over $150 billion."" 
And what about U.S. interest payments to China? As it happened, PolitiFact Virginia looked at that question earlier this year, so we’ll use their methodology here.. 
The U.S. has $10.26 trillion in publicly held debt -- that is, the sum of all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government, including China and other foreign nations. China buys U.S. Treasury bonds in public auctions, the same way other nations and investment companies purchase U.S. debt. 
According to the Treasury Department, China, along with Chinese companies and investment groups, held about $1.14 trillion in U.S. debt in August 2011, or roughly 11 percent of all public debt, making China the biggest holder of U.S. debt of any foreign country. 
Because American debt has long been considered one of the safest investments in the world, the government can borrow money at very low cost, paying an average of less than 2 percent annual interest on its debt during the past decade. In October 2011, the U.S. had an average interest rate of 2.859 percent. 
In fiscal 2011, the federal government is expected to spend $206 billion in interest payments for public debt, according to the Office of Management and Budget. So if China holds about 11 percent of the U.S. public debt, then all other things equal, China would have received $22.7 billion that year. 
That’s well below even the official, $91.5 billion cost of the PLA, much less the Pentagon’s estimate of $150 billion. 
There are possible developments that could change this. Interest rates could go up; China could take on a bigger U.S. debt load; the mix of debt vehicles held by China could shift; or PLA spending could plummet. But the gap still seems to us to be too wide to bridge. Bachmann did say ""by 2015,"" not currently, but the trendline doesn’t suggest U.S. interest payments will explode by that much in just four years. 
Our ruling 
Bachmann said that ""by 2015, we will be sending so much interest"" to China that ""we will be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army."" Today, we only pay about a quarter (if you use official statistics) or 15 percent (if you use the Pentagon’s estimate), and the likelihood that those percentages will increase dramatically within four years is almost nil. So we rate Bachmann’s comment False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C301100>],/factchecks/2011/nov/10/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-us-will-soon-send-enough-int/

A controversial immigration detention center project gets Pembroke Pines mayor riled up
","
Southwest Ranches is a tiny wealthy suburban enclave in western Broward County where some residents still ride horses, and the town once fought a street light proposal because residents didn't want the lights to interfere with their view of the stars.

Now the rural-suburban oasis has become embroiled in controversy because of a longtime plan to build a jail. The town's plan to have a jail on the site had been publicly discussed for many years. But an uproar erupted in 2011, when U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement announced that it had tentatively selected the Southwest Ranches site for an immigration detention facility. The Miami-based Florida Immigrant Coalition, a pro-immigration group that opposes the jail, robo-called nearby residents.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents the area, wrote a letter of support for the project in April 2011, along with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. But as the controversy grew, Wasserman Schultz later wrote a letter to the town's mayor urging the town to hold a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE), and that meeting occurred Nov. 5.

Hundreds of residents gathered at a library to voice their concern. The Miami Herald described the meeting as a circus-like atmosphere -- replete with plenty of roving sheriff's deputies and a ""First Amendment"" area. The angry crowd was clearly against the project, and Mayor Frank Ortis, from neighboring Pembroke Pines, drew the biggest applause, the Miami Herald wrote.

Watch Ortis on the city's video of the meeting starting around minute 76:

""Let me just say that the longer I sit at this meeting, the angrier I'm getting,"" Ortis said. ""Many of you who have contacted our office I've told you this is a Southwest Ranches issue. We don't have a vote in it. Let me just finish. We don't have a vote in it. This is what happens when you don't go to the people first."" (The Herald's article also included most of that quote.)

Ortis' passionate speech prompted someone at the meeting to suggest ""Frank Ortis for governor.""

Ortis, first elected as a commissioner in 1996 and mayor in 2004, ingratiated himself with the angry opponents of the prison. But was he correct to state that Pembroke Pines doesn't have a vote in the project?

Jail in works since 1990s

First, some background on the immigration detention facility.

A jail has been in the works in the area for decades. In 1991, Broward County commissioners agreed to buy nearly 70 acres in unincorporated southwest Broward for a future 4,000-bed county jail, which at the time would have been the nation's fifth-largest jailhouse, the Sun-Sentinel reported then. A jail overcrowding crisis prompted the county to buy the site, but in lieu of developing it the county expanded a jail facility in Pompano Beach instead.

In 1998 Corrections Corporation of America, called CCA, bought an adjacent 24-acre site east of U.S. 27 between Sheridan Street and Stirling Road. CCA bought the land in response to a request for proposals from then-Sheriff Ron Cochran for a county jail for women, said Steve Owen, a CCA spokesman. Cochran died in 1997, and the next sheriff, Ken Jenne, cancelled seeking proposals. But CCA went ahead, believing that another government entity would want to send inmates there if it built a jail.

In 2000, Southwest Ranches incorporated as a town, and in 2005 the town signed a deal with CCA to build the facility with the intention that the customer would be the federal government.

CCA plans to build a facility for up to 1,500 beds, Owen told PolitiFact in an e-mail. (Some articles and documents cite higher figures, but Owen said an application to increase the number was withdrawn when ICE sought a smaller facility.)

The details with ICE are still being worked out but once construction begins, it could be up and running in about 18 months. Once the prison is built and fully occupied, the town stands to earn than $1 million a year in taxes and fees.

Pines commission voted multiple times about the prison

While Southwest Ranches has been in the driver's seat here -- the town was responsible for approving the agreement with CCA, for example -- Pembroke Pines has played a role. Let's look at the votes that Pines has taken related to the prison project while Ortis has been mayor. For a list of the votes by the Pembroke Pines Commission, we turned to an email sent by Pembroke Pines City Manager Charlie Dodge to commissioners Oct. 5, and we then we turned to the city's minutes when available to verify the votes. Here is a summary of some of the key votes:

• Sept. 21, 2005: The commission, along with Ortis, voted unanimously to notify Broward County that it objected to the 1,500-bed jail. But at the time, the town and city were embroiled in some unrelated spats about road lights and barricades the town had set up blocking drivers from Pines from traveling on certain Ranches roads. Pines' objection to the prison appeared to be more of a bargaining chip, because a few months later the city agreed to not fight the prison and the two municipalities reached an agreement on the roads.

• December 21, 2005: The commission, along with Ortis, unanimously approved an agreement with Ranches that included language that stated, ""The CITY shall not interfere with Corrections Corporation of America, or its successors or assigns, development and/or operation of the jail facility, or with the TOWN’S Agreement with Corrections Corporation of America concerning development of same.""

• June 27, 2011: The commission, along with Ortis, approved an agreement with the town to provide emergency medical and fire protection in exchange for $2.5 million annually starting Oct. 1. The agreement includes a section that states that ""CITY acknowledges that it has sufficient capacity to deliver emergency medical protection and fire prevention services to the TOWN’s future 2,500 bed penal institution/deportation facility, located on property currently owned by the Corrections Corporation of America...."" The agreement also states that it has capacity to provide water and sewer. The vote, which included Ortis, was unanimous.

• Aug. 17, 2011: Commission, along with Ortis, unanimously approved a motion to begin providing fire service one month earlier than planned: Sept. 1, 2011. (The minutes were not available but city clerk Judy Neugent provided us with a draft copy.)

Pines attorney cautions city against trying to stop service to jail site

After opposition sparked a fury, Pembroke Pines city commissioners asked their attorney, Sam Goren, to explain if the city had to provide water and sewer to the jail facility after they had already voted to do so. Goren's conclusion: once the city agreed to provide water and sewer it couldn't back away -- the city could face a breach of contract. And, as the Pines lawyers wrote in a follow-up memo Sept. 21, the city already provides water and sewer to the area including to an adjacent women's prison. ""The City’s denial of service to one facility while providing service to a similar adjacent facility may place the City in a legally tenuous position,"" said Goren in the memo.

Broward County also played a role in paving the way for the prison. Based on county staff's recommendations, the county commission voted to amend the plat note on Dec. 13, 2005. The amendment changed the plat note from industrial use to a 1,500-bed correctional facility.

Ortis responds

We asked Ortis why he told the crowd ""we don't have a vote in it.""

Ortis stood by his comments at the meeting and explained that the city of Pembroke Pines doesn't get a vote on whether the jail facility should be built.

""It is a Southwest Ranches issue with CCA. They cut the deal, they voted for it, this project was Southwest Ranches. They signed it. We had no signature to it. We don't have a vote in the entity itself. ... We never had a vote to say yea or nay to it,"" he said.

Pembroke Pines did vote to provide fire, water and sewer to the detention center, Ortis said, adding that the city already provides services to a nearby women's prison.

""We had a 5-0 (vote) to do that,"" he said. ""In my opinion, the five of us never thought that was a problem. ... Nobody objected to it, no one in the audience was objecting to it.""

Ortis said he doesn't think the detention facility belongs at that site, but that the decision rested with Southwest Ranches -- not Pines.

Our ruling

Ortis told the crowd of jail opponents: ""Let me just say that the longer I sit at this meeting, the angrier I'm getting,"" Ortis said. ""Many of you who have contacted our office I've told you this is a Southwest Ranches issue. We don't have a vote in it. Let me just finish. We don't have a vote in it. This is what happens when you don't go to the people first."" Ortis' comments could have left protesters with the impression that as Pines mayor he didn't get to vote on the project. There is a kernel of a fact here: it was Southwest Ranches -- not Pembroke Pines -- that penned the deal with the prison operator, and Pines didn't get an up or down vote on whether the facility should be built. But it's not as if Pines has been in the dark here. Ortis, along with the rest of the commission, voted to provide services to the prison in 2011. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097088040>],/factchecks/2011/nov/10/frank-ortis/pembroke-pines-vote-southwest-ranches/
"['National', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Taxes', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner equates taxing millionaires with hurting small businesses
","
Will increasing taxes on millionaires squelch job creation?

That’s the assertion behind Republican House Speaker John Boehner’s remarks on ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, criticizing President Barack Obama’s jobs bill.

The bill, which so far has been stymied in Congress, calls for a 5.6 percent surtax on incomes greater than $1 million to pay for tax cuts for workers, infrastructure spending, hiring incentives and cash for local governments to keep teachers and police from being laid off.

Republicans oppose the so-called millionaires' tax because they say it will discourage investment and expansion by business owners who are best positioned to create new jobs. But the idea is popular with the public, a point raised by Amanpour in her Nov. 6, 2011, interview with Boehner.

""Now, you obviously disagree with the idea of paying for this with extra taxes,"" Amanpour said. ""Some 75 percent of Americans agree with an increase in tax on millionaires as a way to pay for these jobs provisions. Do you not feel that by opposing it you're basically out of step with the American people on this issue?""

""Well,"" Boehner responded, ""over half of the people who would be taxed under this plan are, in fact, small businesspeople. And as a result, you're going to basically increase taxes on the very people that we're hoping will reinvest in our economy and create jobs. That's the real crux of the problem.""

We see this argument raised regularly, so we decided to look further.

Who are the small businesspeople?

To determine the accuracy of Boehner’s statement, we first needed to define a small business owner.

To be clear, we’re not talking about large companies that pay corporate taxes. We’re talking about individuals who have some amount of business income that they are able to account for on their personal tax returns.

Still, defining a small business owner is no simple task.

""A person who gets paid to give a speech shows up along with the owner of a small manufacturing plant, the guy who runs a pizza place, a lawyer in solo practice, a small investment firm and so forth,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""Some of them are what we think of as small businesses that might grow and hire more workers while others are not...Tax returns lack the information needed to sort out the different types of small businesses.""

For one thing, they don’t distinguish if a business has any employees.

The Tax Policy Center did glean some valuable insights from tax return data, though, namely by calculating how many people in different income categories get various percentages of their income from businesses.

The information, contained in this chart, shows that among people with income over $1 million, about 60 percent of them get more than 10 percent of their income from businesses. But just 37 percent get more than a quarter of their income from those sources and only 29 percent get half or more.

""Are people who get relatively little income from business really small businessmen?"" Williams asked.

These millionaires are more likely earning the bulk of their income through wages or capital gains, he said.

What’s a small business?

The Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department recognized the vacuum in the debate over taxing small businesses without a clear definition of a small business.

In an August analysis, the authors acknowledge that defining a small business is a matter of setting some subjective parameters. The ones they set include a limit of $10 million in income or deductions to be counted as ""small"" and a minimum labor deduction of $10,000 to distinguish businesses that don’t have any employees.

Other tests they applied excluded businesses on the very low end of the scale, such as those with $4,600 or less net annual income.

Not surprisingly, by narrowing the definition, far fewer tax filers qualified as small businesses.

The authors found that:

• one-fifth of small businesses are employers, using their definition.

• slightly more than half of small businesses reported total income of less than $50,000, and half of those businesses reported a tax loss for the year.

• only 0.5 percent of small businesses reported a profit in excess of $1 million. For those businesses, investment and rental income comprised roughly half of their reported income.

The study paints a clearer picture of what many of us think of as a small business -- a bagel shop or dry cleaner -- that has several employees, earns a modest income for its owner and yields profits of much less than $1 million.

Other evidence

Boehner’s spokesman acknowledged the speaker could have worded his statement better. Then he referred us to a 2010 report by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined Obama’s previous proposals to raise income taxes on high earners. The top two income brackets would have seen a bump from 33 percent and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent, respectively if the proposals had been adopted.

That report said ""50 percent of the approximately $1 trillion of aggregate net positive business income will be reported on returns that have a marginal rate of 36 or 39.6 percent.""

But half the income being taxed at that rate is not the same as half the earners being taxed at that rate.

Furthermore, the report said, that $1 trillion income figure does not imply ""that all of the income is from entities that might be considered ‘small.’ For example, in 2005, 12,862 S corporations and 6,658 partnerships had receipts of more than $50 million.""

We know of few bagel shops and dry cleaners with revenues anywhere near $50 million.

Our ruling

Boehner said, ""Over half of the people who would be taxed under this plan are, in fact, small businesspeople.""

Boehner is wrong on two points -- the ""half"" and the ""small businesspeople.""

Of the business income reported on tax returns, half of it would have been taxed at the top two rates, the Joint Committee on Taxation found. But that doesn’t mean half of the earners are paying those rates.

And it’s incorrect to call small business owners and millionaires who would see a tax increase one and the same. The Joint Committee as well as the Tax Policy Center have given credible evidence that for top earners who report business income, it is often just a fraction of their total income. They are not the folks operating small manufacturing plants or neighborhood pizza parlors. In fact, only 0.5 percent of small businesses make that kind of money. More often, small businesses are small in every sense -- most have incomes of less than $50,000 and almost all have profits of less than $1 million -- and they wouldn’t be affected by the millionaires tax. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097037900>],/factchecks/2011/nov/10/john-boehner/boehner-equates-taxing-millionaires-hurting-small-/

Wisconsin Democratic Party says Walker supported a law that makes it easier for drunken drivers to escape punishment
","
State prosecutors are scrambling to fend off fresh legal challenges to drunken-driving cases, with defense lawyers scoring some early victories under restrictive new evidence standards.

The new rules -- which can make it harder to get police testimony and field sobriety tests admitted into court -- sprang from a legal-reform push in January 2011 by Gov. Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers.

Republicans’ primary goal was to make it easier to block unreliable expert testimony and so-called junk science in negligence lawsuits against businesses.

But the change applies to all types of civil and criminal actions, a move that led the state district attorney’s association to predict before passage that the new rules would ""significantly curtail our ability to prove our cases"" -- including in charges of operating while intoxicated.

That aspect of the law got a sharper characterization when the Democratic Party of Wisconsin -- gearing up for a recall drive against Walker -- blasted the governor on a host of issues.

Amid complaints about the budget bill, concealed carry legislation and changes related to sex-ed in schools, the party in a news release declared that a Walker administration move makes it so that ""drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it.""

Amid the rhetoric is an interesting claim:

Does Act 2, the legal reform legislation, really mean an easier go for drunken drivers, either in criminal prosecutions or in personal injury suits against them?

Asked to back up its claim, the Democrats cited three pieces of evidence: Mothers Against Drunk Drivers’ opposition to Act 2; the bill’s limits on court-ordered punitive damages in civil cases; and changes that make it harder for people to testify as experts.

But Republicans decided to exempt drunken-driving crash victims from the punitive damage limits in civil cases. So that point is off the mark.

The Mothers Against Drunk Drivers position is a moving target. The group opposed the bill initially, but then dropped its opposition after lawmakers added the punitive damage exemption -- and is now seeking a partial legislative fix in reaction to the new evidence rules.

As for the evidence rules themselves, prosecutors say the issue is real and the change puts new pressures on them.

We talked to numerous lawyers and researchers and they said the changes were significant, but welcome in concept. Almost all agreed the old standards allowed in too much. The new standards are used in federal courts, and by more than 30 states.

Since the bill’s Feb. 1, 2011 start date, challenges to OWI evidence have played out in courtrooms and prosecutor’s offices under the new law. Both sides expect many more battles as the ""Daubert standard"" rules (from a Supreme Court case, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.) come into play in more cases. 
In our interviews with lawyers in several counties, we did not discover any OWI homicide trials affected by the new Daubert standard -- the focus of the Democrats’ claim. But those cases would be subject to the same advantages and disadvantages as other OWI cases.

And there are some examples we can dig into there: 
In the very early stages here, we found that a loose cadre of defense attorneys are sharing tips on how to mount challenges that DAs told us cause worrisome delays. ""This will protract cases in the long run,"" said Gerol, who likes the Daubert standard overall.

But what’s been the experience of prosecutors and defense lawyers in states that already have Daubert?

Nationally, the reality doesn’t look one-sided, we found.

Generally speaking prosecutors have found the new standards to be fairly neutral, just more work in defending the reliability of tests and witnesses, said Scott Burns, executive director of the National District Attorneys Association.

On the defense side, national expert Michael Hawkins of Atlanta, said the tougher rules could produce an ""unintended benefit"" for some defendants, but only when evidence doesn’t pass legal muster.

""It doesn’t make it ‘easier’ on drunk drivers,"" said Hawkins, a National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers’ expert on drunken driving issues. ""It makes it so prosecutors have to do more work to assure judges and juries that the evidence they are using is accurate and reliable.""

Yes, prosecutors in Wisconsin are having a tougher go of it in first skirmishes here.

But the rules apply to both sides.

Defense attorneys acknowledge they will have have to introduce better and more reliable evidence under the new standards as well.

In fact, Andrew Mishlove, a nationally certified OWI defense lawyer who is helping train judges and lawyers on the new standards, told us a half-dozen common defense strategies might wilt now under the tougher evidence rules.

Among them: That testing equipment failed, or that radio frequency interference led to false readings of blood-alcohol level.

Overall the new standard will ""prevent the defense from putting on bogus experts or questionable experts,"" said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois-based OWI lawyer who is nationally recognized.

Ramsell noted something pertinent to the Democrats’  claim about ""drivers who kill.""

He and others said both sides will have a tougher time presenting testimony on estimates of a person’s intoxication level at the time of an incident -- when the test wasn’t taken until hours after the arrest. In fatal-crash homicide cases, the prosecution will be hurt more often in that scenario, Ramsell said, because often the drunken driver is often injured too, preventing a timely blood test.

Looking ahead, what can we expect?

On the prosecution side, the big concern is that arresting officers were formerly treated as experts who could draw conclusions about sobriety tests -- but now are being challenged, along with the tests, and police training methods.

In cases that already have some evidence weaknesses -- for example, the defendant refused breath and blood tests, or the tests were delayed -- these challenges can be important, lawyers on both sides said.

Under the new system, judges are the gatekeepers of what is reliable and relevant scientific testimony, in contrast to past practice of letting juries hear almost everything.

Some judges have concerns about testimony that has been routinely allowed in the past -- such as the follow-the-finger vision test known as Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN). Those test are not allowed as evidence in some states.

""There are judges that feel like (the vision test) is voodoo because of a conception they have,"" said Emily Thompson, an assistant district attorney in Dane County who handles crash cases, including fatalities involving alcohol.

Such concerns have led the Wisconsin chapter of MADD, the advocacy group, to call for the Legislature to revisit Act 2and exempt drunken-driving cases from the new evidence rules.

""This aspect is troubling and MADD hopes the Legislature remedies the oversight as we support prosecutors who often face a daunting task in making sure justice is served and criminal charges relating to drunk driving are fully prosecuted,"" MADD spokesman Frank Harris told us.

Ultimately the state’s high courts will decide how the issue plays out.

But most experts and lawyers are predicting neither side will gain clear advantage; others say wait and see. Some prosecutors see some advantages long-term. There’s agreement that fairness will increase.

Said Marquette University law professor Daniel Blinka when asked if OWI defendants would have an easier time: ""I don’t see how that’s going to happen.""

Our conclusion

The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that one of Walker’s actions was to make it ""so that drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it.""

One of their talking points to back up the statement -- related to civil lawsuits -- doesn’t hold up given amendments made to the bill. Their other issue, regarding Act 2’s tougher standard for scientific testimony, clearly does affect drunken driving prosecutions.

And the law already has benefited some drunken drivers, though not in every instance where scientific evidence was challenged. (We did not find a homicide case affected, but they would be subject to similarly varied effects as would regular OWI cases.) So we think there’s an element of truth in the Dems’ statement. Some defendants already have found an easier road.

But the statement implies the net effect of the law is tipped pro-defense. In OWI cases, that is an unknown at this point. Both sides -- defense and prosecution -- are subject to the new standards. And even defense-side experts don’t buy the ""easier road"" argument.

Finally, we think it’s misleading to suggest -- as the party’s statement did --  that the intent of the bill was to favor homicidal drunken drivers. It clearly wasn’t.

We rate the party’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097386F00>],/factchecks/2011/nov/10/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-walker-supported-b/

Tom Kean Jr. says Democratic tax hikes chased jobs out of New Jersey

Property taxes are one of the usual go-to sources to gripe about the high cost of living in New Jersey. But there's dozens of other taxes and fees ripe for the picking.

Buying new tires? Working on your tan? Looking to blow something up -- legally?

All that will cost a little something extra.

And a decade of Democratic control in state government is to blame, according to Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr.

""Over the past 10 years, Democrats have been in control of the Legislature and have done a disservice to New Jersey workers and their families by raising taxes over 115 times, making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states,"" Kean said in an Oct. 7 news release.

PolitiFact New Jersey has heard the claim that Democrats increased taxes 115 times before -- and we’ll probably hear it again. But is it true?

A list of the 115 tax increases that John Gorman, a Senate Republican spokesman, sent us included a mix of tax increases, fee hikes and tax policy changes between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. And though the vast majority of the bills were sponsored by only Democrats, a few had Republican support.

Also, some of the increases -- whether they were taxes or fees -- were temporary and have expired. But since they went up, if only for a short period, we think it’s still fair to call that an increase.

The state increased the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent in 2006. The legislation that hiked that tax also extended its reach, applying the tax to investigation and security services, tanning and limousine services, among other items and services.  

The gross income tax was increased in 2004 for taxpayers with income exceeding $500,000  and in 2009 for taxpayers with income exceeding $400,000.

And smokers couldn’t have missed the multiple increases on cigarette taxes between 2002 and 2009.

But among the 115 ""tax increases"" were a number of fee hikes -- measures that cost some residents more money but are arguably not a tax increase.

Of those were a bill passed in 2008 that increased the maximum fees for permits to manufacture, store, sell or use explosives and a 2004 law that imposed a $1.50 fee on the sale of a new motor vehicle tires.

Overall, Gorman provided a list that showed under Democratic majorities, there were dozens of increases in taxes or fees or other tax policy changes that could result in individuals or businesses paying higher taxes. Kean would be more accurate if he said taxes and fees were increased 115 times, but his number isn’t wildly off.

Now let’s assess Kean’s larger point that tax increases drove jobs from New Jersey to neighboring states.

Gorman sent a handful of surveys and studies that show New Jersey’s poor standing in the nation for its business and tax climate. A 2009 report by the Pew Center on the States said, ""While its proximity to New York City and its educated workforce are appealing to many employers, New Jersey has been ranked the least friendly state for business four years running, largely because of its heavy tax burden.""

That’s a valid point, but there are a number of factors involved in the creation and destruction of jobs.

Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers Economic Advisory Service, said ""so many different things"" are involved that you can’t just point to one factor as the reason for New Jersey’s job losses.

Also, we previously researched a similar claim by another Republican state senator that blamed Democratic tax hikes for private-sector jobs losses in the last decade. Considering the impact of the recession on employment, we determined that tax hikes aren’t the only factors involved.

Our ruling

Kean said Democrats raised taxes over 115 times in the past 10 years, ""making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states.""

Under Democratic control of the state Legislature and governor’s office, the state saw nearly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes. But Kean can’t attribute a loss of jobs in New Jersey solely to those changes.

We rate his statement Half True.

Portland Mayor Sam Adams: Occupy Wall Street protest camps in hundreds of U.S. cities?
","
Portland Mayor Sam Adams re-opened Main Street in downtown Portland Thursday morning, but wouldn’t elaborate on what he would do with campers who have occupied two public squares for more than a week now and plan to do so indefinitely. They are part of the Occupy Wall Street protest that started Sept. 17 in New York.

""There are now Occupy Wall Street camps in hundreds of cities across the United States,"" Adams said, ""and mayors and police chiefs across the United States are having to make practical day-to-day decisions about keeping the peace, protecting people's legal rights to freedom of expression and at the same time keeping this city and all cities moving."" 

We know Occupy Wall Street protests have spread wildly and widely, but were there actually protest camps in hundreds of U.S. cities? That struck PolitiFact Oregon as a touch on the big side. We set out to find out just how many cities are involved in this growing movement.

It turns out answers vary. The website for ""Occupy Together,"" which serves as a hub for people sympathetic to the protests, says there are ""Occupy Together Meetups"" in more than 1,500 cities. But an ""Occupy Wall Street"" post Friday says protests have spread to a much smaller ""over 100 cities.""

ABC World News anchor Diane Sawyer put the figure at more than 250 U.S. cities (before getting ridiculed for saying it had spread to more than a thousand countries). A CBS News report pegged the spread at 145 cities. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Mayors didn’t have an estimate of cities with protests -- camps or otherwise. You get the picture.

So we contacted the mayor’s spokeswoman, Amy Ruiz, who added one more figure to the mix: a link to an Oct. 4 post on DailyKos, which mapped ""Occupy"" groups in 200 cities, categorized by state. Those turned out to be links to Facebook pages and websites, and there were close to 300 organizations. But the post didn’t quite back up the mayor’s assertion about camps. While some linked to groups with occupying camps, like the one in Portland, others were a lot less developed.

Next, we scoured Associated Press stories, looking for local reports of ""Occupy Wall Street"" events. In the last week we found about 65 cities mentioned, from Trenton, N.J., to Seaside, Ore. The number of cities with protest camps is smaller, with some over-nighters to start Oct. 15. (Check out Occupy Eugene.) Again, a strikeout.

Finally, we found an interactive map on Mother Jones’ website. As of Friday afternoon, it listed more than 200 locations, including a handful outside the United States. Again, the notes for each city range from a call to observe the global Oct. 15 event in the Tri-Cities, Wash., to reports of protesters arrested in at least a dozen cities. (Portland is in that rare group.)

So, where did that leave us?

We called Ruiz. She said the mayor stands by his statement that there are hundreds of U.S. mayors trying to figure out how to balance speech rights with public safety as Occupy Wall Street events spread nationally. But she clarified that he was referring to the entire range of protests, from full-fledged to nascent.  

""Hundreds of mayors are dealing with this issue,"" Ruiz said.

That could be. But hundreds of mayors are not dealing with indefinite ""occupation"" camps, at least not yet. And that was the word that triggered our fact check. The thing is, we don’t know how many mayors are dealing with Occupy Wall Street events, whether it’s more than 100, which is not hundreds, or in the 200 to 300 range, as some sites say.

Throw in Adams’ specific claim about protest camps, and we rule the mayor’s statement Mostly False. As of Oct. 13, there were not camps in hundreds of cities across the United States. But there may be hundreds of mayors dealing with the issue. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2E6DC0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/15/sam-adams/portland-mayor-sam-adams-occupy-wall-street-protes/

Michele Bachmann says Texas spending increased more than 50 percent under Rick Perry
","
When the Bloomberg/Washington Post debate on economic topics gave GOP hopefuls the chance to question another candidate directly, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota turned to Rick Perry.

She declared that after Perry backed Al Gore for president as Ronald Reagan’s presidency came to its close, he ""went on to increase spending in Texas by over 50 percent"" as governor.

Bachmann incorrectly said Perry was Gore’s campaign co-chair, which we’ve covered in another fact check.

Her reference to state spending on the Texas governor's watch also covered familiar turf.

In an online ad we spotted last month, the pro-Bachmann Keep Conservatives United super PAC said Perry had ""doubled state spending in a decade."" We found that to be Mostly False.

Not that spending didn’t increase.

In August 2010, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White cited state budget figures to show that overall state spending had increased 79 percent with Perry as governor, from nearly $101.8 billion in 2000-01 to almost $182.2 billion in 2010-11.

At the time we took up the pro-Bachmann group’s claim, an updated spending tabulation indicated the increase had been 86 percent.

However, we recognized that this percentage was both unadjusted for inflation and population increases and that it reflected spending from all sources, including federal aid. Taking into account inflation and population growth, the increase was 21 percent over the period. And budgeted expenditures drawing on state general revenue -- the kind most swayed by a governor -- increased 44 percent without adjustments, but decreased 6 percent once inflation and population growth are weighed.

We did not hear back from Bachmann on the basis of her debate claim.

Our sense is that Bachmann’s assessment of ""over 50 percent"" misstates overall spending on Perry’s watch, especially because it doesn’t appear to include any accounting for the state’s growth or inflation. The claim also overstates the raw increase in general-revenue spending, the kind that Perry had the most control over.

We rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B8F9C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/14/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-texas-spending-increased-mor/

Alan Grayson says United States has fifth-most unequal wealth distribution in world
","
On the Oct. 10, 2011, edition of MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show, former Florida Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, took aim at the financial sector in an interview that focused on the Occupy Wall Street protests. 
""According to Wikipedia, there are only five countries in the entire planet that are more unequal than the United States in the distribution of our wealth,"" Grayson said. ""That’s a system that Wall Street created, that Wall Street maintains, and that Wall Street enforces."" 
First, some background on how equality is measured. The primary statistic used for this purpose is called the Gini coefficient. Gini coefficients range from 0, or perfect equality, to 1, or perfect inequality. 
We should note here that we’re glad that Grayson cited his sources -- in the midst of a national TV interview no less! -- but we’re also disappointed that his source was Wikipedia, which is open to editing by anyone. 
Luckily for Grayson, the Wikipedia page he cited had sourced its numbers to a peer-reviewed paper. The paper was coauthored by four academics, James B. Davies, Susanna Sandstrom, Anthony Shorrocks and Edward N. Wolff and published in The Economic Journal in 2010. 
Grayson was correct that the United States had the fifth-highest Gini coefficient for wealth in the world, trailing only Denmark, Namibia, Switzerland and Zimbabwe. In other words, the U.S. distribution of wealth was more unequal than all but four other nations. 
There are a few technical caveats to note. 
First, international comparisons such as these are always a bit dicey, because the statistics available for each country are not always perfectly aligned. 
Second, most of the figures are about a decade old. These are the most recent comparisons available -- and as a result, we don’t fault Grayson for using them -- but they do represent a snapshot of time before the recession that began in late 2007, a recession notable for the implosion of the U.S. real estate market as well as the values of many other financial holdings. (To be fair, it’s unclear whether current numbers would show a higher or lower Gini coefficient for the United States, since many Americans of modest incomes lost significant wealth when home prices tanked. It’s also unclear what new data would show for other nations.) 
Third and most important, these figures refer to wealth (that is, accumulated holdings) rather than income (the funds earned on an annual basis). To his credit, Grayson described the statistics correctly -- he very clearly said ""wealth,"" not income. 
However, to understand the full picture, it’s worth a look at income figures as well. A paper by the United Nations Development Program -- the Human Development Report 2010 -- shows that the Gini measurement for income places the U.S. more in the middle of the international pack. (Wikipedia has its own page for international income inequality, as well.) 
Among the nations ranking as more unequal in income than the U.S. were Hong Kong, Singapore and Qatar among richer nations and a large proportion of middle- and lower-income nations, ranging from Niger and Mozambique in Africa to Nicaragua and Honduras in Central America to Cambodia and Thailand in Asia to Russia and Turkey in Europe. 
Indeed, one reason that U.S. wealth is so highly concentrated among relatively few compared to the rest of the world is because so much wealth has been accumulated in America. If you’re a poor country, you’re not going to have much wealth to begin with, so there’s a mathematical limit on how narrowly it can be distributed within your population. 
This doesn’t mean that the pattern of wealth distribution in the United States is either fair or inevitable, but it does provide some important context. Wealth distribution in the United States may be unequal compared to the rest of the world, but its income inequality is not nearly as unequal. 
When we asked Grayson about the question of income vs. wealth, he said, ""I get to choose what I want to talk about in my infrequent moments in the spotlight, and I chose to talk about wealth.  That choice does not, in any way, make my statement inaccurate. For what's it's worth, when we are talking about a nation with almost unbelievable extremes of wealth and poverty -- which virtually no other candidate ever speaks about, for obvious reasons -- then a more common distribution of income is hardly much of a consolation prize."" 
He added that ""there is overwhelming, staggering inequality in America, however it is measured, and that inequality substantially exceeds the inequality in many other countries. That is not merely ‘True’ but ‘Profoundly True’ and ‘Largely Ignored.’ If thousands of people were dying each day from pollution, it hardly would be appropriate to argue whether we should be measuring that pollution by volume or by weight. That actually undermines public discourse, rather than enhancing it."" 
Our ruling 
The peer-reviewed data backs up Grayson’s claim that ""there are only five countries in the entire planet that are more unequal than the United States in the distribution of our wealth."" Had Grayson used ""income"" rather than ""wealth,"" the answer would have been much more mixed. 
But Grayson was admirably careful in his phrasing. So we rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097105A40>],/factchecks/2011/oct/14/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-united-states-has-fifth-most-une/

Mitt Romney attack Barack Obama over Boeing plant question
","
When Republican candidates want to fire up a crowd in New Hampshire, a reference to Right to Work generally delivers satisfying results. A Right to Work law makes it harder for unions to collect money from non-union workers. Unions hate these laws about as much as most Republican voters love them.

At the Oct. 11, 2011, GOP presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney played to those values. Asked about his economic plan, Romney said one principle would be respect for the rule of law, and then he took a jab at the President Barack Obama and his administration.

""We also have to have the rule of law. By that I mean, you can't have the federal government through its friends at the National Labor Relations Board saying, to a company like Boeing, that you can't build a factory in a non-union state. That's simply wrong and it violates the principle of the rule of law.""

We decided to examine this question: Did the NLRB tell Boeing that it ""can’t build a factory in a non-union state.""

The Romney campaign told us the source of this statement was an April New York Times article about a complaint filed by the NLRB against Boeing. The complaint sought ""to force Boeing to bring an airplane production line back to its unionized facilities in Washington state instead of moving the work to a non-union plant in South Carolina.""

About six years ago, Boeing was ramping up to build its newest passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner. The company explored making all the planes at its factories in Washington state, but in 2009, it decided to start a second, smaller production line in South Carolina. The union plants in Puget Sound would make seven planes a month; the non-union facility in North Charleston, S.C. would produce three a month.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers complained. The NLRB’s general counsel tried to bring the parties together but failed. In April 2011, the general counsel’s office formally issued a complaint on the grounds that Boeing built its factory in South Carolina in order to punish the union.  

Top Boeing officials were quite open about  the connection between the machinists union and the new factory. According to the filing,one executive told a newspaper that ""the overriding factor (in transferring the line) was not the business climate. And it was not the wages we’re paying today. It was that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years.""  

In the eyes of the general counsel, this was a form of retaliation against the union for having conducted strikes in the past. As such, he argued Boeing violated the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from interfering with the right of workers to organize and to strike.

The question is: Did Boeing act to get back at the union or did it have other reasons? ""The whole thing boils down to motivations,"" said Nancy Cleeland, a spokesperson for the NLRB. ""That’s the reason  to have a hearing. To see what was going on.""

Cleeland’s emphasis on a hearing could sound like boring procedure, but it’s actually pivotal.  Since Romney brought up the Boeing dispute to demonstrate his regard for the rule of law, it's worth looking at the legal process here. The NLRB has five board members. So far, they have played no role in this matter at all.  

The call for a hearing came when the general counsel of the NLRB, who acts independently of the board, filed a complaint because there seemed to be enough evidence to make it stick. Based on such a complaint, this case now sits before an administrative judge who has yet to make a decision. After the judge rules, that ruling will then go to the NLRB to be voted up or down or changed.

In short, the law provides a process with checks and balances.

Romney’s statement gets way ahead of that process, and it runs into trouble on another front. The complaint against Boeing is not based on the fact that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. We spoke to lawyers who think the complaint is well founded and lawyers who think it is utterly misguided, but they agree on this point.

Stanford law professor William Gould, a former chair the NLRB,  thinks the general counsel was wrong to move this complaint forward. By his reading of federal law, employers have the legal right to minimize exposure to strikes, and deciding to locate a plant in a place where unions are weak can be a strategy that passes legal muster.

But Gould said Romney did ""make an error of fact.""

""He’s wrong in suggesting that the general  counsel’s reasoning applies peculiarly to union or non-union states,"" Gould said.  Another labor lawyer, Jeffrey Hirsch at the University of North Carolina Law School, concurred.  ""This has nothing to do with geography,"" Hirsch said. ""You could switch the states and the case would be identical.""  

Both lawyers also said that if Romney is suggesting that the NLRB has done anything unusual, he’s completely wrong.  ""The NLRB has held in countless cases that employers can’t move to another facility for prohibited reasons,"" Gould said.  A prohibited reason would be to punish the union.

Even the spokesman for the National Right to Work Committee, Patrick Semmens, said the issue isn’t that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. ""The more fundamental point is that it was a non-union facility,"" said Semmens, who still believed that Romney’s claim has merit.

The third problem with Romney’s statement is that if the general counsel at the NLRB really wanted to block the factory in South Carolina, he could have asked for an injunction, which is allowed under the National Labor Relations Act. He did not. The factory is up and running, and Cleeland, the NLRB spokesperson, says Boeing now can tell the administrative judge that to shut the plant would cause undue economic hardship.

There is of course political context to this story. Organized labor has more pull with Democrats than with Republicans, and the machinists union pressed hard to have its complaint move forward. Semmens with the NRWC said he thinks that pressure lies behind the NLRB action.  

 Our ruling

Romney claimed that the NLRB told Boeing that it  ""can’t build a factory in a non-union state."" This presents a sweeping distortion of the NLRB's actions that is not borne out by the facts.  An office at the NLRB has started a process that could, at the theoretical limit, result in a factory closure, but the NLRB as a whole hasn’t told Boeing anything. The office of the NLRB that moved the complaint forward could have asked for the factory to close while its complaint was pending, and it did not. The legal basis for the action centers on whether Boeing was trying to punish the union for being willing to call a strike, not that Boeing had opened a factory in a right-to-work state.

Romney’s statement reflects reality in that a Democratic administration tends to give more weight to union complaints, and unions don’t like to see jobs flow to right-to-work states. But his words go far beyond what the NLRB has actually done.

We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3B3D40>],/factchecks/2011/oct/14/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-attack-barack-obama-over-boeing-plant-/

Rick Perry ad says 'Romneycare' cost 18,000 jobs
","
Rick Perry’s campaign released a new ad that attacks Mitt Romney on multiple fronts -- his health care plan for Massachusetts, his record on job creation and whether he’s been inconsistent on important issues.

It also throws in a Halloween-like reference: It shows President Barack Obama looking into a mirror, then there's a crash of thunder … it’s Mitt Romney!

The ad focuses on the health care plan Romney signed when he was governor of Massachusetts, claiming that it’s the same as the health plan supported by Obama.

Here, we’re checking the ad’s claim that ""Romneycare … killed 18,000 Massachusetts jobs.""

To review, what the ad calls ""Romneycare"" is a health care plan Romney signed into law in 2006. Though it only applies to the state of Massachusetts, it is similar in its broad outline to the national health care plan approved by the Democratic Congress and signed by Obama. Both leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They seek to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering subsidies to help moderate income people buy insurance. People are required to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the ""individual mandate."" And companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases.

For the claim about job losses, the ad cites as its source a report from the Beacon Hill Institute, a Boston-based economics research group that supports ""limited government, fiscal responsibility, and free markets,"" and is affiliated with Suffolk University.

The ad says that the Massachusetts health law ""killed 18,000 jobs,"" which makes it sound like 18,000 actual jobs were eliminated. In fact, the report makes the more modest assertion that the law prevented 18,000 jobs from being created.

The report’s basis for the claim is that the Massachusetts health care law increased costs for businesses by requiring them to offer insurance to their workers or pay fines. It also increased state spending on health care, money that otherwise would have been spent elsewhere. The report claims that these additional costs reduced job growth by an average of 18,313 jobs.

To put that in perspective, the Massachusetts workforce was 3,471,487 in July 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployed numbered 263,059.

We should note here that reports like this one largely depend on the underlying economic assumptions behind the economic model. Right-leaning and left-leaning groups often come up with different numbers when looking at the same policies. In this case, we were unable to find any other studies that looked at the effects of the Massachusetts health care law on employment.

Our friends at Factcheck.org checked out  the 18,000 number a few weeks ago when Perry, the governor of Texas, started making the claim on the campaign trail. They found mixed opinions in Massachusetts on whether the law hurt actual job growth. Health care costs have gone up in the state, but some argue they would have gone up anyway. (For the record, the authors of the Beacon Hill study told us they accounted for the effects of health care inflation not caused by the law.) Factcheck.org concluded that the 18,000 number was an estimate that could neither be proved nor disproved.

Finally, this claim also made us think of a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which conducted an economic analysis of how many jobs might be lost or gained nationwide under the new federal health care law. They found that the law would reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by about 800,000 jobs. Some of that would be due to businesses facing higher costs and deciding not to hire. But most of it would be because people working jobs simply to retain group health insurance would be able to leave those jobs and buy insurance on their own.

Our ruling

In rating this statement, it’s certainly plausible that increased costs to business could cause them to create fewer jobs. But we’re reluctant to accept a specific number based on one study by a right-leaning economic group. We would be interested in numbers reached by other groups, particularly independent, nonpartisan groups. But we don’t have those to draw on in this analysis.

More significantly, the Perry ad says that the health care plan ""killed"" 18,000 jobs. That certainly makes it sound as if existing jobs were destroyed. Instead, a hypothetical 18,000 jobs were never created in the first place.

Given that Perry’s ad bases its claim on one study and also exaggerates the study’s findings, we rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DD8240>],/factchecks/2011/oct/14/rick-perry/rick-perry-ad-says-romneycare-cost-18000-jobs/

Health care advocate says Wisconsin bill would give drug makers immunity from lawsuits over injury or death
","
When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called state lawmakers into special session on Sept. 28, 2011, he touted two dozen legislative initiatives he said would put Wisconsin back to work.

Reiterating his campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs, the Republican governor asserted that more than anything else, ""employers and workers want a sense of certainty.""

Health care advocate Robert Kraig, executive director of Citizen Action of Wisconsin, was certain he didn’t like what he saw in some of the bills on the table.

Kraig’s Milwaukee-based group describes itself as a coalition that works to ""advance progressive values and shape the public and political debate around health care, economic development and consumer protection.""

In a news release and in a blog post on Oct. 3, 2011, Kraig said several bills were ""masquerading as job-creation measures which damage the civil justice rights of consumers who are injured by corporate malfeasance"" -- in other words, curbing the rights of injured people to sue.

""Shockingly,"" Kraig added, ""one bill in the current session dangerously grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products.""

Immunity from lawsuits -- even in cases of injury and death?

The bill Kraig criticized was proposed by Sen. Rich Zipperer, R-City of Pewaukee.

As long as a drug or device is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the manufacturer or seller of that drug or medical device would be immune from liability, according to the non-partisan Legislative Reference Bureau.

Zipperer spokewoman Hannah Huffman said, however, that there are exceptions.

Immunity would not apply if FDA approval were gained through fraud, she said. And although manufacturers could not be sued for a defect in the design of a drug or device if the design had been approved by the FDA, the manufacturer could be sued if it failed to follow the design in the manufacturing process, she said.

Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families in Washington, D.C., told us she believes the immunity bill would apply to all drugs but perhaps not to all medical devices. Zuckerman, who has done research on the FDA approval processes, said it would depend on how the word approved is interpreted in the bill. Every year, only about 3 percent of new medical devices gain FDA approval, while the rest are ""cleared"" under a less-stringent process by the agency, she said.

So, Zipperer’s bill gives broad immunity, with some exceptions, to drug makers but perhaps less immunity to device makers.

We asked Kraig for evidence to back what essentially was a blanket statement that the bill ""grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity.""

Kraig initially said his statement was ""over broad and should have included the qualification that this bill covers drugs and medical devices approved by the FDA.""

Later he argued the statement was fair because most people, when they hear a reference to drug makers or medical device manufacturers, would understand that those companies make products that in the vast majority of cases must be approved by the FDA.

Kraig also argued that the bill is dangerous because in recent years the FDA’s regulatory powers have been weakened and therefore its approval of a drug or device does not provide as much protection as it once did.

As evidence, he cited a report that is critical of a Michigan law that gives immunity to drug manufacturers and that Kraig said is similar to the drug manufacturers part of the Wisconsin’s bill. And he cited a national report on problems people encountered after using drugs and medical devices that had received FDA approval.

But arguing a bill is unnecessary or unwise does not get at the question we are examining: Whether the bill does what Kraig said it does in terms of immunity.

Our conclusion

Kraig said a bill proposed by a Wisconsin lawmaker ""grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products."" He acknowledged that his statement was ""over broad,"" in that immunity applies only when FDA approval has been granted.

The bill doesn’t give blanket protection to drug and device makers. But its primary intent is to give them immunity, with some exceptions.

We rate Kraig’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC9280>],/factchecks/2011/oct/14/robert-kraig/health-care-advocate-says-wisconsin-bill-would-giv/

Cain says Medicare, Social Security in financial trouble
","
You can’t accuse Herman Cain of lacking confidence.

Metro Atlanta’s Republican hopeful for president ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004 without a lick of experience as an elected official. Now he’s running for president without ever having served in public office. His new book, ""This is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House,"" treats victory as a foregone conclusion.  

Already, he’s referring to himself as ""President Herman Cain.""  

It’s in more than a few places, including the title of Appendix A, ""The Major Issues of the Day, According to President Herman Cain."" And President Herman Cain does not like what he sees. Entitlements, he said, are compromising the nation’s financial stability.

""Current projections indicate that Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017, while Social Security will bottom out by 2037,"" Cain said.

These figures -- especially the Medicare estimate -- seemed awfully pessimistic. 2017 is only six years away.

We contacted the Cain campaign and received no response, so we did our own research. We found that FactCheck.org, another fact-checking group, looked at similar statements. Cain’s campaign website also offered some clues. His policy page makes an almost identical claim, citing a May 2009 article in Newsweek as support.

The op-ed is by columnist Robert J. Samuelson, who argued that Medicare, which provides health care for seniors, and Social Security, which provides retirement income, will have to go bankrupt before lawmakers take funding problems seriously.

Samuelson said current projections show those programs will go bankrupt in 2017 and 2037, the dates when the ""trust funds"" that back them are slated to run dry. Those are the same years Cain cited.

First, we’ll deal with Cain’s statement that projections show Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017.

FactCheck.org wrote in 2009 about a nearly identical claim made in a TV ad for Americans for Prosperity, where Mark Block, the Cain campaign’s chief operating officer, used to work. It checked another in April by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

As FactCheck.org concluded, Medicare does have big financial problems, but there’s no reason to think it’s going out of business.

There are four parts to Medicare, and they’re funded by two separate trust funds run by the federal government.

Part A covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices. It’s paid for by the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which collects most of its money from federal payroll taxes.

Part B covers doctor visits and other outpatient costs, while Part D covers prescription drugs. The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund pays their bills, which are mostly covered by the federal government’s general fund and premiums.

Medicare Advantage, or Part C, gives recipients the option to receive care through private insurers. It doesn’t have a trust fund.  

FactCheck.org’s articles said that the SMI fund is in good shape, and we found it still is. It’s ""projected to remain in financial balance for all future years,"" according to a 2011 report by the fund’s trustees

But the the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund? Not so much. As of this year, it’s expected to be exhausted by 2024, according to midrange assumptions. If conditions worsen, the trust fund will run out by 2016.

This is better than the 2009 projections, where trustees expected funds to dry up by 2017, according to midrange assumptions. That’s the same date that Cain used.

Still, as bad as the news is about the hospital insurance fund, FactCheck.org decided it didn’t truly signal bankruptcy. The fund is only a portion of Medicare. The remainder is solvent for the foreseeable future.    

It’s also worth noting that Congress has always pulled the hospital insurance fund from the brink of insolvency. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 1970, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected its funds to be exhausted by the 1990s. Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry.

Now, let’s deal with Cain’s claim that Social Security will ""bottom out"" by 2037.  

There are two Social Security trust funds: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, which pays for benefits to retired workers, their families and to families of deceased workers; and Disability Insurance, which pays for benefits to disabled workers and their families.

In 2009, midrange projections by the Social Security Board of Trustees said these trust funds combined will be exhausted in 2037, while the Disability Insurance fund will be gone by 2020.  The outlook worsened this year. The Disability Insurance fund will be exhausted in 2018. Combined, their assets will be exhausted by 2036.

When those funds run dry, Social Security will struggle to pay out benefits as promised, according to trustees.  

Cain’s information was based on a 2009 op-ed. He got that year’s data correct, and projections have not changed dramatically since then.

But while it’s fair for him to say that Social Security will ""bottom out"" by 2037, saying Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017 is a bit extreme. Only one of Medicare’s funds is expected to be exhausted by that date, and Congress has never let it run dry. Lawmakers have bailed out the fund without fail for 40 years.

Since Cain’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details about the Medicare trust fund, it meets our definition of Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A4B1C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/14/herman-cain/cain-says-medicare-social-security-financial-troub/

R.I. Rep. Peter Palumbo misses marks when reporting where state ranks in Tax Foundation ratings
","
It's widely known that Rhode Island doesn't rank well in national comparisons showing how much residents pay in taxes.

During an Oct. 5, 2011, rally protesting Gov. Lincoln Chafee’s positions on illegal immigration, state Rep. Peter Palumbo cited the rankings of one research group to argue that Chafee should be focusing instead on tax issues.

(The rally followed a decision by the state Board of Governors for Higher Education making undocumented Rhode Island students eligible for in-state tuition at the state’s colleges and university, a policy Chafee supported. Chafee has also raised the possibility of creating a driver’s license for undocumented immigrants.)

""The Tax Foundation figures Rhode Island as the 10th highest state for state and local tax burden per capita in the country,"" Palumbo told the crowd of about 500. ""We're the sixth worst in the country for the business tax index. We're the third highest per capita in the country for all taxes.""

We wondered whether the rankings are really that poor.

The Tax Foundation is a nonpartisan, business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C. It regularly ranks states on various tax issues. Their reports can be seen at TaxFoundation.org, where we found the latest numbers.

Let's break them down.

State and local tax burden: The latest study, compiled from 2009 data and released in February 2011, ranks Rhode Island as the fifth worst in the country, not the 10th, as Palumbo told the crowd. By the Foundation's assessment, things are even worse than he asserted.

Business tax index: This is actually the ""State Business Tax Climate Index,"" in which the foundation uses various measures to come up with a score. For the 2011 fiscal year it ranged from a high of 7.43 in South Dakota (which scored well, in part, because it has no corporate or individual income tax) to a low of 3.96 in New Jersey, which was ranked as having the worst state business tax climate.

Rhode Island ranked as the ninth worst, not sixth, as Palumbo asserted. The state has been gradually improving in the rankings since 2006, when it ranked worst. In addition, the Foundation, in its latest report, predicted that Rhode Island will rank significantly higher in its next analysis once changes to the state's income tax code have taken effect.

All taxes: The Foundation has what it calls its Tax Freedom Day, which is the number of days that must pass in a year before the average resident has earned enough to pay his or her federal, state and local taxes.

For Rhode Islanders, in 2011 that day fell on April 13. Rhode Islander had the 13th highest total tax burden. We didn't rank third, as Palumbo reported. (Mississippi residents were the first to pay them off; their Tax Freedom Day was March 26. Residents of Connecticut, had to work the longest -- until May 2 -- to earn enough. Nationally, the Tax Freedom Day was April 12.)

When we asked Palumbo for the source of his numbers, he told us in an e-mail that, ""knowing that I was going to be fact-checked, I made sure that the information I had was backed up!""

His source: the Foundation's 2010 Facts and Figures booklet, which is outdated. He said it had been mailed to legislators.

When we found that booklet online, we discovered that he correctly reported the state and local tax burden from that outdated booklet, but made a common math error in stating the business tax index ranking (when you rank 44th you're seventh from the bottom, not sixth).

However we couldn't find any indication, even in the older report, that ""we're the third highest per capita in the country for all taxes."" In the 2010 report it says we ranked 10th. The only measure by which Rhode Island ranked third was in state debt per capita.

The 2011 version is also available online. 
Our ruling

Palumbo spoke with authority, cited specific numbers from a specific source and gave the impression that the numbers were both correct and current.

His overall point -- that Rhode Islanders are taxed well above the national average -- is supported by the Tax Foundation's rankings.

But he misread the Tax Foundation report in one -- and possibly two -- of the rankings. And those numbers don't accurately reflect Foundation data that have been available at least since the end of March.

As a result, we rate his statement as Mostly False.

"['Energy', 'Regulation', 'Virginia', 'Ward Armstrong']","
Ward Armstrong says Appalachian Power Company is making ""record profits""
","
House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry, is seeking to turn his reelection bid this fall into a referendum on Appalachian Power Company, which has raised rates on his Southside constituents nine times in the past four years.

The outspoken Democrat is in the fight of his 20-year public career. The GOP-controlled House drew new political maps earlier this year that put Armstrong in a district with a Republican incumbent, Del. Charles Poindexter of Franklin County.

Armstrong was prepared for challenge, having amassed a sizable campaign treasury and seized a powerful issue. For more than a year, Armstrong has been calling for tougher regulation of Apco and accusing the utility of bilking customers during hard times. He has portrayed Poindexter, who has not joined the condemnation, as a friend of Apco.

The minority leader amplified the theme in two recent TV commercials, charging Apco has been raising rates ""even though they’re making record profits.""

Several readers questioned whether Apco really is making record profits, so we decided to take a look.

PolitiFact Virginia tried several times to contact Armstrong or his campaign manager over the last week, but our phone calls were not returned. So we turned to one of the lawmaker’s web sites, called ""No More Rate Hikes,"" where Armstrong lays out his case against Apco. Under a section titled ""Record Profits,"" he cites three sets of statistics. Let’s examine each:

1. ""Appalachian Power reported $3.3 billion in total revenues for fiscal year 2010 -- a $385.9 million, or 13.4 percent, increase from 2008.""

We found similar numbers and dates in annual reports that American Electric Power -- Apco’s corporate parent -- filed with the Security and Exchange Commission. But Armstrong’s use of the figures to prove record profits is misleading. The numbers are Apco’s gross revenues; they don’t include data that also show significant increases in the utility’s operating costs over the same three years.

2. ""Appalachian Power reported $136.7 million in net income for fiscal year 2010 -- a $13.8 million, or 11.2 percent increase from 2008.""

Net income -- revenues minus expenses and losses -- is often used as a term for profit. Armstrong’s figures, while correct, do not prove Apco made record profits.

We reviewed annual reports going back to 1998 and found Apco’s high-water mark for profits came in 2003, when it reported net income of $280 million, followed by 2002 when the company posted a $205 million gain.

Apco’s average annual net income for the past 13 years is $143.4 million -- higher than the $136.7 million reported in 2010, the latest figure available. Apco’s average net income over the last four years -- when, as Armstrong notes in ads, the utility has been granted nine rate increases --  is $117.5 million, well below the utility’s 13-year average.

3. ""Appalachian Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEP, which reported $14.4 billion in total revenues and $1.2 billion in net income for fiscal year 2010.

American Electric Power has reported record net income over the last three years, although the $1.2 billion in 2010 was down from almost $1.4 billion nets the parent corporation reaped in 2008 and 2009.

Apco --  which serves about 1 million customers in Southside and Southwest Virginia, as well as West Virginia and a small portion of Tennessee -- is one of six power companies owned by AEP. Although each entity keep its own books, there’s no doubt money flows through the corporate chain. Apco, for example, does not generate enough of its own power to meet demand and is required to buy electricity from other AEP companies. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has questioned whether the purchases amount to profits for other AEP entities.

But Virginia regulators do not review the profits of the parent corporation or other subsidiaries when considering Apco’s requests for rate hikes. ""We look at the entity that serves Virginia, and that’s Appalachian Power,"" said Andy Farmer, a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission.

Apco’s rates remained stable for decades, fueled by inexpensive coal burned in power plants in Ohio and West Virginia. But federal environmental regulations have tightened, forcing the company to spend $2 billion over the past five years to upgrade pollution controls. That, combined with a rise in the price of coal, has led to a 66 percent increase in Apco electric bills over the past six years.

Two major bond rating agencies -- Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings -- put Apco’s credit on watch for a possible downgrade in 2008, saying the utility’s debt was rising faster than its cash flow. Fitch said Apco’s performance as an investment depended on the outcome of its rate increase requests.

Apco’s credit stabilized in 2009 after receiving a $450 million infusion from its parent, AEP.

Apco’s 5.45 percent return on equity between from 2008 to 2010 fell well short of the 10.53 percent the SCC has been willing to allow in setting Apco’s rates.

This fall, the utility has four requests pending before the SCC that would hike residential electric bills by a total of 11 percent -- to about $105.09 a month for 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. The company is seeking an 11.15 percent return on equity.

The SCC staff has recommended a base rate hike that would produce about half of the $68.5 million in new  revenue Apco is requesting. Cuccinelli’s office has urged no base rate increase, saying Apco has room to lower its costs.

By comparison, Dominion, Virginia’s largest electric utility, has a residential rate of $112.31 per kilowatt hour. Dominion is allowed an 11.9 percent return on equity.

Our ruling:

Armstrong has charged in ads that Apco, which has raised rates nine time during the last four years, is making record profits.  

Armstrong tries to support his statement on three legs but we find fault with each. His citing of Apco’s gross revenue is meaningless because they are not profits; his argument that Apco’s net income increased by 11.2 percent between 2008 and 2010 is misleading because profits in those years were less than half of the record set in 2003; and his emphasis on the record profits of corporate parent AEP is irrelevant because state regulators, in setting rates, focus only on Apco’s performance.

Armstrong, a lawyer, has been poring over Apco’s finances for more than a year and it’s mind-boggling to suppose he's in the dark on these things. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966CE800>],/factchecks/2011/oct/14/ward-armstrong/ward-armstrong-says-appalachian-power-coompany-mak/

Mitt Romney says uninsured increased under Rick Perry
","
During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sought to contrast health care in his state with that in rival Gov. Rick Perry's home state, Texas.

""We (Massachusetts) have less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured,"" Romney told Perry. ""You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids."" Under the administration of George W. Bush, he continued, ""the percentage uninsured went down. Under your leadership, it's gone up.""

We weren’t sure whether Romney meant the uninsurance rate for Texans of all ages, or specifically for children. Romney didn’t explicitly cite children in his comment, and when we contacted the campaign, they confirmed that he had meant uninsured Texans overall. However, the comment followed on the heels of discussion of uninsured children, so we think viewers would have reason to think Romney was talking about the uninsurance rate for kids only.

As it turns out, which meaning is ascribed to Romney’s words pretty much determines whether Romney is right or wrong.

To explain, we’ll turn to historical data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. First, let’s look at the uninsurance rate for the population as a whole.

Under Bush, the percentage of Texans without health insurance declined from 24.5 percent in 1995 to 23.5 percent in 2001.

Under Perry, the percentage without health insurance rose from 23.2 percent in 2001 to 26.1 percent in 2009, the most recent year available.

(Eagle-eyed readers will notice that the rate for 2001 was slightly different for the two governors. This is because the Census Bureau changed its methodology in the interim.)

So, based on the uninsurance rates for Texas’ population at large, Romney’s claim is justified. How about the rates for children? That’s a different story.

Under Bush, the uninsurance rate for children fell from 22.4 percent in 1995 to 21.3 percent in 2001.

Under Perry, the uninsurance rate for children didn’t rise -- it continued to fall, from 21.1 percent in 2001 to 16.5 percent in 2009.

So looking at the children’s uninsurance rate, Romney’s comment is wrong.

""The continued decline in the number of uninsured Texas children … is the silver lining to a very cloudy uninsured rate for Texas adults,"" said a report from the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Austin.

The results for children’s uninsurance surprised us. Even as uninsurance rates for the Texas population as a whole were rising, the rates for children were falling -- and falling faster than the overall rates rose. In addition, the rate of children without insurance in Texas fell faster than the national rate, which declined from 11.3 percent in 2001 to 10 percent in 2009. And this all came as Texas’ population was increasing by about 20 percent, meaning that huge numbers of kids had to be added to the insurance rolls just to keep pace with population growth.

One explanation we looked at is the margin of error for the Census Bureau studies. Using the sampling error values included in the tables, we found that the declines for both all Texans and children during the Bush years was within the margin of error. That means that the decreases we saw might actually have been an increase -- the measurements weren’t precise enough to know for sure.

However, the changes under Perry were all outside the margin of error. So sampling error didn’t cause an anomaly with Perry’s statistics.

As it turns out, the biggest increase in childrens’ coverage under Perry came from government programs, mostly Medicaid, which is a joint federal-state program. In 2001, 22.5 percent of children received their health care from Medicaid; by 2009, that rose to 37.4 percent. During that same period, the percentage covered by private health insurance fell from 59 percent to 48.5 percent.

Both Bush and Perry acted to increase coverage of Texas children by Medicaid and other government programs, though both of them also took actions that worked against or delayed increasing coverage.

In 1997, when Bush was governor, the Texas Legislature established the Texas Healthy Kids Corp., a public-private partnership that subsidized coverage for children in families with incomes up to 185 percent of the federal poverty line.

That same year, Congress passed the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, which gives federal matching funds for states to help low-income children get health coverage. By 1999, after initially being criticized for slow adoption of SCHIP, Bush and the Legislature sped up Texas’ utilization of the program.

""Texas was slow in enacting and implementing SCHIP expansions, in part because the Legislature meets only every other year, and the federal authorizing statute was enacted after adjournment in 1997,"" wrote Joshua M. Wiener and Niall Brennan in a 2002 paper for the Urban Institute, an independent Washington think tank. ""After implementation, however, enrollment in the Texas SCHIP program increased quickly. In June 2000, enrollment was only 39,859 beneficiaries, but by September 2001, it had reached 439,222 children.""

Bush also signed Medicaid eligibility simplification provisions for children, which helped increase coverage rates.

Perry, for his part, first tried to privatize many of the administrative functions of his health and human services department, a decision that led to backlogs and hampered signups for Medicaid, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities.

Later, Perry pulled back and instead appointed Tom Suehs to head the department. Under Suehs, Dunkelberg said, the department has ""really turned things around,"" possibly explaining the past few years of insurance coverage gains among children, she said.

So both governors did some things that boosted coverage (and some things that didn’t) but their powers were hardly dictatorial. To the extent that Texas has seen gains in coverage among children, significant credit goes to the federally supported programs of Medicaid and SCHIP. And numerous other factors, including the general state of the economy, have an impact on insurance coverage rates.

Our ruling

Romney’s camp said he meant to refer to the uninsured population as a whole, and using those statistics, he’s right that uninsurance rates declined under Bush (though within the statistics’ margin of error) and rose under Perry.

But we think many viewers, seeing the comment in context, might have assumed that Romney was referring to uninsurance among children. And for children, uninsurance has actually declined steeply under Perry.

Meanwhile, the policies pursued by both Bush and Perry had an influence on their respective trendlines, but their records in this regard were somewhat mixed and other factors also contributed. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E10CC0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/13/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-uninsured-increased-under-rick-pe/

Rick Santorum says two-parent families better off financially
","
Rick Santorum wants to fight poverty at the altar.

In a Republican presidential primary debate on Oct. 11, 2011, the former Pennsylvania senator and ardent social conservative said one answer to reducing the economic disparity in the U.S. is to support two-parent families.

""The biggest problem with poverty in America, and we don't talk about here, because it's an economic discussion -- and that is the breakdown of the American family,"" Santorum said. ""You want to look at the poverty rate among families that have two -- that have a husband and wife working in them? It's 5 percent today. A family that's headed by one person? It's 30 percent today. ... We need to have a policy that supports families, that encourages marriage.""

That’s an interesting statistic, so we decided to see if it holds up.

The U.S. Census Bureau collects and maintains that kind of data in many forms. According to its chart ""People and Families in Poverty by Selected Characteristics: 2009 and 2010,"" the percentage of married-couple families living below the poverty line was 5.8 in 2009. It ticked up to 6.2 in 2010. 
For a single householder, the poverty rate was 26.3 percent in 2009 and 27.3 percent in 2010.

The numbers are different, however, based on if the single parent is a man or a woman, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Among ""female householder, no husband present"" families, the poverty rate was 29.9 percent in 2009 and 31.6 percent in 2010. In ""male householder, no wife present"" families, the rate was 16.9 percent in 2009, and down slightly in 2010 to 15.8.

Male-headed households compromised more than 15 percent of all single-parent households, the Census found. 
There are many different factors that contribute to poverty such as age, education, race and the health of the economy.

Austin Nichols, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, wrote a paper in 2006 about changes in child poverty rates. He said child poverty spiked in the 1970s, and that was directly attributable to a rise in single-parent households. Then the rate dropped in the 1990s as the labor market improved for nearly all economic levels.

Since then, Nichols said, changes to the child poverty rate have consistently been tied to economic factors.

Take the current recession, for example.

""There hasn’t been a rise in single-parent families during this time that child poverty has increased, whereas the job market you can see directly. The parents are losing their jobs, whether there are two parents or one,"" he said.

""All the recent changes in child poverty and more broadly in all poverty have been due to changes in the job market.""

Nichols added that separating out single-parent households headed by men in a statistical group isn’t relevant because there are relatively few of them -- only about 15 percent  of all single-parent homes are headed by men. And single-parent homes, Nichols said, always suffer higher poverty rates than two-parent homes.

Our ruling

Santorum said the poverty rate ""among families that have two -- that have a husband and wife working in them? It's 5 percent today. A family that's headed by one person? It's 30 percent today.""

U.S. Census data backs the general point Santorum is making, that households with two adults fare better than those with a single head of household. But his numbers are off on both ends, so the difference is not as great as he suggests. For married couples, the percentage in poverty is higher than he said -- 5.8 percent in 2009 and 6.2 percent in 2010, versus 5 percent. And for households with a single head, it was lower -- roughly 27 percent for both 2009 and 2010.

Santorum represented the general trend correctly, but his numbers were off in both cases. More importantly, not only marriage, but also the job market is important to families staying out of poverty. We rate the claim Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097748E40>],/factchecks/2011/oct/13/rick-santorum/rick-santorum/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Jon Huntsman']","
Jon Huntsman says the IRS will hire 19,500 new workers because of health care mandate
","
During the Bloomberg-Washington Post debate at Dartmouth College Oct. 11, 2011, presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman took his turn taking shots at President Barack Obama’s health care bill along with the other seven GOP front runners.
 
When Rick Santorum declared that repealing Obamacare would boost job creation, Herman Cain, Mitt Romney and Huntsman each shared ways to get the federal mandate off the table. Cain and Huntsman joined Santorum’s attack against Romney’s suggested waivers, which they said, would not do the trick.

""It's disingenuous to -- to just say that you can -- you can waive it all away,"" Huntsman said. ""The mandate will be in place. The IRS is already planning on 19,500 new employees to administer that mandate. That will stay, and that's the ruinous part of Obamacare.""

Huntsman's claim that the Internal Revenue Service planned to hire 19,500 new employees caught our attention, and his logic seemed similar to claims we’ve checked before. We decided to look into Huntsman’s interpretation to see how his figures compared.

First, we contacted Huntsman’s campaign to find out where he got his numbers, but spokesman Tim Miller said the campaign researcher could not be reached by our deadline.

Fortunately, both PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Georgia had reviewed similar claims. FactCheck.org, a nonprofit fact-checking team, has also done similar checks.

PolitiFact National first checked U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill.,who was involved in early fights over the health care legislation. Kirk said at the time, ""according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people ... to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates"" of the health care bill.

Kirk’s attribution was misleading, PolitiFact ruled, as the 16,500 Kirk cited actually came from an estimation made by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation. The CBO, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, actually offered a cost estimate of $5 billion to $10 billion over 10 years but did not suggest how those costs would translate into IRS jobs. Republicans picked the high end of the CBO estimate and then estimated the numbers of employees from there in order to favor their case, PolitiFact found. Republicans on Ways and Means even acknowledged that their figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs if factoring in overhead costs including desks and office supplies in addition to salaries. Kirk got a Mostly False from PolitiFact National.

A similar assertion about hiring new agents came up when Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas said it would take ""16,500 armed bureaucrats to make this program work."" FactCheck.org, who researched Paul’s statement, noted Paul had mischaracterized what the Ways and Means Republicans had said about number of potential IRS employees. IRS agents actually make up a small percentage of the total IRS workforce, while clerks, accountants, administrators, attorneys, help-line workers and other non-enforcement employees, make up the bulk. Only a minor portion of IRS agents are armed law enforcement officers who work on criminal cases. FactCheck.org called Paul’s statement a ""wildly inaccurate claim.""       

PolitiFact National again ruled on a similar IRS agent claim made by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, but gave her a better Truth-O-Meter rating than Kirk. Bachmann chose to say the health care bill ""may"" put those agents in charge of policing the bill--not that they would--which earned her a Half True.

Since Bachmann’s statement, the IRS submitted a budget request to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for fiscal year 2012 that includes estimates for workers needed to begin implementing the health care bill. PolitiFact read the 159-page budget request and found requests for 1,269 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes, at a cost of $473.4 million. But most of the requests were made for IRS support roles such as information technology or customer service. Few were for agents.

So when PolitiFact Georgia joined the party to rule on a statement made by Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., -- that the IRS estimated it must hire ""16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer"" to enforce the federal health care overhaul - -Chambliss got a False. No, not an IRS estimate. No, not agents. And no, not 16,500.

Finally, if we turn to Huntsman’s assertion during the debate that 19,500 employees will be needed to administer Obama’s health care mandate, we find it contains problems similar to previous claims we checked. Huntsman started a little more on target than some of his Truth-O-Meter predecessors, but his claim recycles misinterpreted numbers once again.

Huntsman’s claim estimates the IRS employees, rather than IRS agents, that will be tied to the health care bill. But Huntsman exaggerates when he says the IRS plans for almost 20,000 employees to administer the mandate. Really it was Ways and Means Committee Republicans, taking only the high end of the CBO's cost predictions, which floated the 16,500 employee number, while admitting they didn’t calculate overhead costs to offset those numbers.

Herman Cain says someone earning $50,000 will save under his 9-9-9 tax plan
","
The more people learn more about Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain's ""9-9-9"" plan, the more questions they have.

One of the bigger ones is how it would affect poorer Americans. We had the chance to put the question to Cain directly during his recent swing through Florida.

""Most people are going to pay less in taxes,"" Cain, a former pizza chain executive, said Oct. 5, 2011, aboard his campaign bus stopped in St. Petersburg. ""Why? Because we're expanding the base.""

Cain told us he even worked out the math himself. Someone earning $50,000 a year would pay less in taxes under his 9-9-9 than they do under the current system, he said. Under the current system, a person who earns $50,000 a year ""pays about $10,000 in taxes,"" Cain said. ""A big part of that is the payroll tax."" Cain then walked us through his 9-9-9 plan and said the same person would ""still have $2,000 left over.""

""I can't design a system for people who don't want to pay taxes,"" Cain added. ""I can design a system so they can get a job.""

Cain made a similar comment Oct. 12, 2011, during an interview with MSNBC's Chuck Todd.

""Today under the current system, ($50,000-a-year earners) will pay over $10,000 in taxes, assuming standard deductions and standard exemptions. I've gone through the math. $10,000,"" Cain said. ""Now, with 9-9-9, they're going to pay that ... 9 percent tax on their income, so that's only $4,500. They still have $5,500 left over to apply to the sales tax fees. And if you go and look at what they -- how much of it they would probably spend on sales taxes for new goods -- not used. Used goods, they don't pay a sales tax. They are still going to have money left over.""

We decided to take Cain's analysis that his plan was better for someone earning $50,000 to a trio of tax accountants.

Before we tell you the results of their analysis, here's some background on Cain's plan. 
9-9-9, Cain says, is the first step to creating a national flat or ""fair"" tax. It would replace the current complicated tax system with 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent national sales tax and a 9 percent tax on businesses. Unlike the current system, Cain's plan includes relatively few opportunities for people or businesses to claim deductions or write off expenses. The personal income tax, for example, would include only two potential exemptions -- people could write off donations to charity and tax filers would get a break for living in impoverished inner cities. Cain's national sales tax would be on top of state and local sales taxes.

For this fact-check, we'll only be talking about the personal income tax and the sales tax since the business tax directly affects only business owners and corporations.

Cain set the parameters for the $50,000 experiment during our interview.

For calculating the tax burden under 9-9-9, Cain assumed that the hypothetical tax filer made no charitable deductions and was not eligible for a tax credit by living in an inner city. So Cain's taxpayer paid the full 9 percent income tax on $50,000 -- or $4,500.

Cain then assumed every other dollar was spent on something subject to his 9 percent sales tax, meaning his hypothetical taxpayer contributed an additional $4,095 to the federal government. (Cain's 9-9-9 includes no sales tax on used goods.)

That's a total tax paid of $8,595 or a tax rate of 17.19 percent.

That's the maximum someone would have to contribute under 9-9-9, unless they spent more than they took in on items subject to the sales tax. Presumably they'd pay less if they saved money or spent money on housing, which we assume wouldn't be subject to a sales tax. But again, we're using Cain's figures.

To see how that compared to the same earner under the current system, we reached out to three accountants and asked them to run the numbers. For this analysis, we're measuring the income tax and payroll taxes a worker would be asked to contribute. (Payroll taxes vanish under Cain's plan.)

Cain's assumption in this scenario, he told us, was that the taxpayer claimed the standard exemption and nothing else.

The exercise showed one thing about the current system: It's certainly more complicated than the system Cain is proposing.

For a single person, 9-9-9 is a better deal. A single person with no dependents would pay about $10,075 in combined payroll and federal income taxes, $1,480 more than that taxpayer would pay under Cain's 9-9-9. The calculation comes with one caveat: President Barack Obama and Congress temporarily have lowered the payroll tax contribution for employees 2 percentage points, whereas these figures assume the contribution rate is restored to the full 7.65 percent.

For someone married with dependents, 9-9-9 is worse. The current tax code treats married couples with children differently -- and better -- than people who are single. With dependents, the family of four will pay about $6,515 in income and payroll taxes and even less, about $4,600, if they qualify for a child income tax credit. So the family of four could end up paying anywhere from about $2,080 to $4,000 more in federal taxes under Cain's 9-9-9.

These are broad strokes that can vary based on your personal situation -- as well as other credits workers might be able to claim under the current tax system -- but they're a good rough guide in understanding Cain's plan.

The disparity between 9-9-9 and the current tax code grows as a person's income shrinks.

A single person who makes $40,000 would still pay about $334 less in federal taxes under 9-9-9. But someone making $30,000 would pay about $212 more under 9-9-9.

For families at those income levels, 9-9-9 is even worse, especially when you include potential tax credits and exemptions low-income earners are now getting that they wouldn't under Cain's plan.

""It's going to fall very, very heavily on low-income taxpayers to middle-income taxpayers,"" Andy Hollander, a retired federal tax agent, who studied the 9-9-9 plan for PolitiFact Florida, told us.

Yet Jonathan Kraftchick, another accountant who pored over the numbers for us, pointed out that 9-9-9 allows people to control their final tax liability based on their spending.

""Households would be much more in control of what their final tax liabilities would be since the sales tax would effectively allow them to increase/decrease their taxes at will,"" Kraftchick said.

None of this addresses another point. Besides what 9-9-9 might mean for you, there's also the question of what it will mean for the federal government -- namely, if it will generate enough revenue to keep the federal government in business. Cain has said the plan is meant to generate the same amount of revenue initially, but he hasn't released enough detailed information for analysts and economists to see if that's correct.

That discussion's for another day.

Here we're looking at Cain's answer when we asked how his plan would affect poorer Americans. He responded by saying that someone making $50,000 a year, which is about the median income for all U.S. households, would be better off under his plan than the current tax system.

We have two major issues with his response. First, we asked about poorer Americans and he picked an income figure of $50,000 a year, which is the median income for U.S. households. There's some cherry-picking there, since the numbers change if you select $40,000 or $30,000. Moreover, while calculating the impacts of 9-9-9 might be simple, comparing them to the current tax system is much more complicated.

Cain's assumption holds when you look at single earners, but married couples and people with children making $50,000 a year would likely pay more under 9-9-9 than the current system.

We knock the claim down one mark for cherry-picking a figure of $50,000 a year and two more because the claim itself is only half right. To us, that equals a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097738080>],/factchecks/2011/oct/13/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-someone-earning-50000-will-save-u/

Walker’s praise for teachers not all-encompassing
","
At the NBC News ""Education Nation"" summit in New York City on Sept. 26, 2011, anchor Brian Williams put Republican Gov. Scott Walker on the hot seat over his cuts to school funding in the 2011-’13 budget.

Williams opened by saying that among the 10 governors on the panel, only Walker was the subject of a social-media campaign questioning NBC’s decision to include him -- with one Twitter post Williams read comparing it with ""having an arsonist talk about fire safety.""

Then he read from a letter sent to NBC by Wisconsin educator Heather DuBois Bourenane. The letter expressed shock that they were ""featuring Scott ‘Teachers are Thugs’ Walker at the summit.""

Twice in the minutes that followed, Williams pushed Walker hard on the origin of ""teachers are thugs"" reference. Had Walker said it in the heat of the protests over his successful push to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for teachers and other public employees?

Walker first said it ""came from the Internet and everything else"" and later flatly denied saying it. He then went further, as he described his encounters with teachers around the state.

""I’d have an open forum for an hour with teachers at our schools and they’d say, ‘Why are you pickin’ on teachers?’ And I’d say, ‘Go back to NBC, go back to YouTube, go back to all the statements I’ve made earlier this year and you’ll never find one time when I’ve said anything but great things about our teachers.’""

He continued: ""The teachers who teach not only my kids but all the other children across the state of Wisconsin, are great public servants. What I’m doing is long term, it’s making a structural change so that more of them can stay in our classrooms.""

Let’s see … high-profile statement, check. Strong comments, check. Important topic, check. A dispute over what was said, check.

Yes, this is one for PolitiFact.

So, is Walker right on the ""thugs"" comment and that he only had positive things to say about teachers?

First, ""teachers are thugs.""

It’s worth noting that prominent public officials -- as well as many political commentators --  have freely applied the term ""thug"" to aspects of the 2011 collective bargaining battle.

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, said death threats were ""thuggery,"" while former U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wausau, said Walker’s move against unions itself was ""political thuggery.""

Bloggers saw ""thuggery"" everywhere. In the damage done to the Capitol grounds. In the prank phone call made to Walker. In Walker telling that caller he considered planting troublemakers among protesters.

They also saw itin a union-supported boycott of pro-Walker businesses. In protesters’ angry confrontation  with Republican state Sen. Glenn Grothman. And in a GOP open records request for emails sent by a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who compared Walker’s ""style"" to Joe McCarthy’s.

But did Scott Walker say ""teachers are thugs""?

Certainly not in the sharp way that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie did in an April 2011 interview with ABC News about teachers there.

""I believe the teachers in New Jersey in the main are wonderful public servants that care deeply,"" Christie said. ""But their union, their union are a group of political thugs.""

We could find no instance of Walker directly addressing teachers -- or their union -- in that fashion.

We did, though, find one instance in which Walker used a form of ""thug"" in discussing the reaction to his limits on unions.

It came in a March 10 appearance on conservative talk host Sean Hannity’s TV show immediately after Republican lawmakers approved Walker’s legislation, ending a stalemate with Senate Democrats who fled to Illinois and blocked a vote for more than three weeks.

Hannity asked Walker about ""mayhem"" at the Capitol, which was occupied for weeks by protesters. Hannity specifically mentioned Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald calling the Capitol ""unsafe"" for lawmakers trying to get to work, as well as reports of death threats against senators and protests outside Walker’s Wauwatosa house.

Walker answered: ""People should not be coming into the state trying to intimidate lawmakers, offer up threats or anything else. That’s just not the way it’s done, at least not in the Midwest. And thankfully, again, our lawmakers stood up to those sorts of thuggery attacks, and we’re not going to allow that here in the state of Wisconsin. We can have good civil debate.""

He added: ""The people who work for state and local government have been decent, and I respect them throughout this process. But the people coming in from other states, that bring these sorts of tactics, just don’t belong here.""

In the view of the state’s largest teachers union, the ""thuggery"" remark was aimed in part at teachers.

""Wisconsin teachers were a big part of the collective actions at the start of the movement he’s referring to -- and his take that there was ‘thuggery’ involved, and that it was out-of-state protesters driving these actions, was way off the mark,"" said Christina Brey, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council.

But Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor was not talking about teachers when he denounced ""thuggery attacks."" He said Walker was referring to death threats from out-of-state people. A multitude of threats of various kinds were cataloged by conservative observers and the mainstream media during the protests.

In our view, it’s clear Walker directed the comment at what he characterized as out-of-state protesters, without specifically mentioning teachers or the teachers union. He didn’t exclude teachers, though.

We asked DuBois Bourenane, the letter writer to NBC, about the ""teachers as thugs"" moniker she gave Walker. She is a post-secondary instructor whose Monologues of Dissent blog frequently blasts Walker as an enemy of public education. She joined in many of the protests at the Capitol, appeared on MSNBC’s ""The Ed Show,"" and has blanketed Walker’s office with dozens of long, critical emails.

She told us it was not meant to suggest that Walker ever said those exact words, but merely a device to highlight her view that Walker disrespects teachers.

""I never said he said that and I’d be surprised if he did,"" she told us. ""But I do think he actively promotes a rhetorical discourse that promotes the impression that teachers who disagree with his policies are bad for schools and dangerous and subversive.""

This gets us to part two of this fact check.

To gauge Walker’s rhetoric regarding teachers, we examined dozens of Walker statements on education, on unions and on the Capitol protests that teachers figured so prominently in.

During the 2010 campaign, Walker made clear he felt public schools -- and specifically underperforming teachers -- were failing Wisconsin’s students. On his campaign website, he called for teacher evaluations, merit pay and other measures, without mentioning his plan to severely limit collective bargaining. He touted an expansion of voucher and charter schools.

But he also made clear the ""vast majority"" of teachers are succeeding, when he released his education plan during the 2010 campaign.

After his election, Walker pressed the case against union rules. In a Wall Street Journal opinion column, Walker wrote that the teachers union ""hid behind"" a labor contract when an award-winning first-year teacher was laid off because of seniority rules under collective bargaining.

In February 2011, after Walker unveiled his union limits and benefits cuts, major school districts across the state shut down when teachers flocked to protests in Madison.

Walker praised the ""good professionals ""who went to work and said those who skipped out had every right to be heard, ""but I said I’m not going to allow for one minute the voices of the tens of thousands here to somehow overpower the millions of hardworking taxpayers of my state who know what were asking for is modest.""

He was less diplomatic when referring to the teachers union.

He told conservative talk show host Mark Levin on Feb. 21, 2011, that the union’s motivation was only to get its hands on teachers’ dues payments. By announcing it would give in to Walker’s benefits cuts if he would drop the limits on collective bargaining, ""they threw their members under the bus,"" he said.

The same day, Walker told Hannity that Republicans were ""not going to be intimidated"" by tens of thousands of protesters from Chicago, Nevada and New Jersey.

(PolitiFact Wisconsin rated False Walker’s Feb. 22 claim that ""almost all"" the protesters were from outside Wisconsin at that point, while noting that Illinois teachers unions had sent buses of protesters to Madison.)

In late February and early March, as the standoff with Democrats dragged on, Walker used a series of news releases to highlight deals that teachers had negotiated through their union -- or won in arbitration -- on pay, retirement benefits, overtime and working conditions.

Some of the releases singled out small but attention-grabbing items in particular districts. One was, ""Almost $10,000 Per Year for Doing Nothing,"" a reference to a teacher emeritus program. Another was ""Arbitrator Reinstates Porn-Watching Teacher."" Another: ""$6,000 Extra for Carrying a Pager.""

Walker has taken steps to assert that he and his budget were pro-teacher. He frequently praises the public school teachers his two sons have encountered in Wauwatosa, and other outstanding teachers elsewhere.

At the NBC summit, Walker repeated his respect for teachers. ""I understand there’s sometimes a difference of opinion, but in the end, we believe the right thing to do is put the power in the hands of the teachers,"" he said.

Brey, the statewide teachers union spokeswoman, says WEAC’s main beef with Walker is his actions, not his words. But she said Walker uses his words to depict unions as greedy (seeking an ""expensive entitlement""); controlled by intimidating out-of-state ""bosses""; and incompetent (with union hiring restrictions gone, Walker says, now we can keep the best teachers).

Criticism of the union, Brey contends, amounts to criticism of teachers, who elect their union representatives.

In our view, both sides have a gripe.

Teachers who belong to the union feel aggrieved by Walker’s comments about their union. But being critical of a group is not the same as being critical of individuals, and it’s a stretch to call Walker’s calls for educational reform and school choice an attack on teachers, per se.

On the other hand, it’s disingenuous for the governor to suggest that his praise of teachers is all-encompassing, but that when he’s talking about the protesters -- even mischaracterizing them as dominated by out-of-state interests -- and teachers organizations, it is limited.

Our conclusion

At the NBC Education Summit, Walker denied saying ""teachers are thugs"" and said he’s only said ""great thing"" about teachers.

Though we looked at two pieces of the statement, it essentially amounts to single claim -- that he’s only praised teachers.

There’s no evidence at all that he used the thug line -- and even the educator whose letter prompted the questioning doesn’t believe he said it. He did use the term ""thuggery attacks"" in response to a question about the protesters’ occupation of the Capitol, death threats against elected officials and protests outside his home.

Many Wisconsin educators joined in that occupation, but Walker says he was referring only to death threats by out-of-state people.

On the larger point of his rhetoric about teachers, we found Walker was careful about expressing his respect for teachers and other protesters, while offering criticism of the union that represents them.

So, Walker can accurately claim he has avoided direct rhetorical attacks on teachers as a profession. But we found Walker said less than ""great things"" about the union that represents teachers, and in his ""thuggery"" comment Walker left room for teachers to assume he was passing judgment on their protests at the Capitol.

Walker’s statement may be narrowly accurate, but it slips down the Truth-O-Meter when you examine the full context of his comments about the teachers union, teacher benefits and the protests.

Taken as a whole, his comments fall short of the high bar he set about saying only ""great things.""

We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3BFA40>],/factchecks/2011/oct/13/scott-walker/walkers-praise-teachers-not-all-encompassing/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Stimulus', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner says Obama promised the stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent
","
After the U.S. Department of Labor released a report showing unemployment held steady at 9.1 percent in September, House Speaker John Boehner said it showed the need to ""find common ground on common-sense solutions to create a better environment for private-sector job creation.""

The Ohio Republican also repeated a worn but sturdy talking point that his office used to headline his statement:

""Our unemployment rate has been higher than 8 percent for more than two-and-a-half years, far above what the Obama Administration promised with the 'stimulus,' "" Boehner said.

The claim that the White House ""promised"" the stimulus would keep unemployment under 8 percent has been popular among Republican critics of the stimulus. PolitiFact first checked it in July 2009 when then House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said: ""We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)."" PolitiFact rated his claim Mostly False.

Since the House speaker has raised it anew, PolitiFact Ohio thought a reprise of our reviews was worthwhile.

The claim is rooted in a report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. It was issued on Jan. 9, 2009, before President Barack Obama took office.

The report projected that Obama’s proposed stimulus plan would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also predicted unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. A chart in the report shows that without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.

In fact, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and remains stuck above 9 percent.

But do those projections from the administration in January 2009 constitute a promise?  They certainly came with heavy disclaimers.

""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

There's also a footnote with the chart that states: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action.""

The administration acknowledged its projections were wrong.

In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: ""None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated.""

Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus.

In a White House news conference on June 8, 2009, Bernstein said the projections made in January were off because economic numbers for fourth-quarter 2008 weren't yet available. When they were released, they revealed the economy was in worse shape than economists realized, losing 600,000 to 800,000 jobs a month. Bernstein maintained in that news conference that the stimulus was working, and that the unemployment rate would be even worse without it.

Is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that, even though the unemployment rate has risen higher than projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus.

Many independent economists agree with Obama that the stimulus created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that).

Obama warned upon taking office that if ""dramatic action"" were not taken, ""the unemployment rate could reach double digits,"" with the recession lasting for years.

But PolitiFact could find no evidence of anyone in the administration making a public pledge that the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent.

When we asked Boehner's office what evidence he had, they provided a number of sources that confirmed the prediction. Those included a reference to Rep. Barney Frank -- a Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee -- saying that Obama and Democrats were saddled with a ""false prediction"" and that making the prediction ""was a dumb thing to do.""

There is an element of truth in Boehner’s statement. A report prepared by the incoming Obama administration did project that the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. It has been above 8 percent since early in 2009.

We think it's a big stretch to call an economic projection a ""promise."" The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had ""significant margins of error"" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

Those are critical facts that the speaker’s claim ignores.

As we have ruled for others who have made this claim, we rate Boehner’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A35C40>],/factchecks/2011/oct/13/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-promised-stimulus-would-ke/
"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie calls comparisons between health care reforms “completely, intellectually dishonest”
","
Standing beside Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Gov. Chris Christie had three strong words to describe any comparisons between Romney’s health care reform in Massachusetts and the national health care reform law:

""Completely, intellectually dishonest.""

A week after ruling out his own candidacy, Christie on Tuesday traveled to New Hampshire to endorse Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. During a press conference, the discussion turned to the two health care reform measures.

""Any attempt to try to compare what happened in Massachusetts and what the president has done to the United States of America with his plan is completely, intellectually dishonest,"" Christie said. ""Governor Romney did not raise one tax in doing what he did in trying to improve the health care system in Massachusetts.""

Here’s what PolitiFact New Jersey found: Christie is right that Romney’s plan did not raise taxes, but there are too many similarities between the two reforms to dismiss any comparisons as ""completely, intellectually dishonest.""

First, let’s talk taxes.

Enacted in March 2010, the federal law imposed taxes on drug manufacturers, health insurers, medical devices and indoor tanning services, among other tax increases. The Massachusetts law signed by Romney in 2006 did not enact taxes, but was primarily financed through federal dollars.

""It’s a lot easier to not raise taxes if you have the federal government paying a large share of the tab when you’re a state,"" said Alan Weil, the executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy.

Also, in 2008 -- after Romney left office -- Massachusetts raised the cigarette tax and imposed additional fees on private companies to help finance health-care costs.

Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said though the tax increases weren’t part of the initial health care law, they did help fund it. So, he said, ""it’s not fair to say there’s no taxes raised.""

Like the federal law, the Massachusetts law imposes a fine on individuals who do not purchase health insurance. Some experts argued that such a penalty is a tax.

""It’s government collecting money that you owe through your taxes,"" said Michael Doonan, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Policy Forum. ""I would consider this a tax.""

But Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, ""In both the Massachusetts reform and Obamacare, the individual mandate is not a tax, but a penalty enforced through the tax system."" 
Still, the national health care reform was based on the Massachusetts plan, and the two have much in common. 
The core elements of the Massachusetts law include the ""same essential design"" as the national health care reform, according to John McDonough, a professor of public health practice at the Harvard University School of Public Health.

""Regardless of the tax issue, to suggest then that there is no basis to compare the two sets of reforms is not valid,"" McDonough, who was involved in the passage and implementation of the Massachusetts law, said in an email.

Here are a few examples of the similarities between the two reforms:

Individual mandate: At the heart of both measures is the requirement that residents have health insurance, with exemptions for certain individuals. Otherwise, residents could face a tax penalty.

Employer requirements: The Massachusetts law requires employers with at least 11 full-time workers to contribute toward health insurance coverage, or pay a penalty per employee. Under the federal law, if employers with at least 50 full-time employees don’t provide coverage, they must pay a fee to cover the cost of tax credits used by their workers to purchase insurance.

Medicaid expansion: Both measures expand Medicaid in different ways. The national health care reform expands Medicaid to all non-Medicare eligible individuals under 65 years old who meet certain income requirements. In Massachusetts, the state’s Medicaid program was expanded to cover children with family incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.

Insurance exchanges: Both measures establish insurance exchanges where individuals and small businesses can purchase insurance.

""All of the basic elements are really, frankly quite similar,"" said Sarah Iselin, president of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation.

Our ruling

Christie dismissed comparisons between the federal health care law and the Massachusetts health insurance reform as ""completely, intellectually dishonest,"" saying the state plan ""did not raise one tax.""

The state reform did not include tax increases, but it includes several core elements similar to those in the national reform. To deny that those similarities exist would be dishonest.

We rate the statement Mostly False.
