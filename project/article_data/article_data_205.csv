Axelrod claims Bush saddled Obama with a big deficit
","It's the war of the op-eds.  On Jan. 10, 2009, former Bush administration adviser Karl Rove wrote in the Washington Post that Democrats ""will run up more debt by October than Bush did in eight years. (We checked his claim here.) David Axelrod, chief adviser to President Barack Obama, fired back on Jan. 15 in Post that Rove had it all wrong and that Bush had been the big spender.  ""The day the Bush administration took over from President Bill Clinton in 2001, America enjoyed a $236 billion budget surplus -- with a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion,"" Axelrod wrote. ""When the Bush administration left office, it handed President Obama a $1.3 trillion deficit -- and projected shortfalls of $8 trillion for the next decade."" His point was that it was Bush, not Obama, who got the country in a financial mess. He said Bush approved big-ticket items during his tenure that included tax cuts, a new prescription drug benefit for the elderly, and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which allowed the government to spend up to $700 billion to shore up troubled assets and bolster various industries.  And now, Axelrod wrote, the Obama administration is stuck with the bill.  We wondered whether Axelrod's numbers were correct.  When we asked for his sources, the White House pointed us to several documents. The first was a 2002 report from the Congressional Budget Office, an independent agency, that reported the 2000 federal budget ended with a $236 billion surplus. So Axelrod was right on that point.  The report provides an interesting trip down memory lane, when budget estimates were downright cheery: ""The outlook for the federal budget over the next decade continues to be bright,"" the report said. ""Assuming that current tax and spending policies are maintained, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that mounting federal revenues will continue to outstrip spending and produce growing budget surpluses for the next 10 years.""  Yes, the word ""bright"" was in a budget estimate. That meant big surpluses -- estimated to total about $5.6 trillion by 2011. So Axelrod was right on that, too.  Another cheery line: ""Under current policies, total surpluses would accumulate to an estimated $2 trillion over the next five years and $5.6 trillion over the coming decade, and would be sufficient by 2006 to pay off all publicly held debt that is available for redemption."" The future didn't turn out like that, of course. On Jan. 7, 2009, two weeks before Obama took office, the CBO reported the deficit was projected to be $1.2 trillion. The 10-year projection was estimated to be about $3.1 trillion. So Axelrod was slightly off on the 2009 deficit (he said $1.3 trillion) but substantially off on the 10-year projection (he said $8 trillion). The White House said Axelrod's number was based on a budget overview published by the Obama administration shortly after Obama took office, when the 2009 deficit was estimated to be $1.5 trillion, totaling about $9 trillion over the next decade. The White House explained that the figure included the $787 billion economic stimulus package. But because Bush was not president when it was approved, they subtracted the appropriate portion of it for each year, to get $1.3 trillion and $8 trillion, respectively, that the Obama White House believed was approved under Bush. Why the $5 trillion difference between the White House and the CBO's projections?  Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, said it has to do with fundamental approaches in how the two offices estimate the future. The CBO based its projections on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would expire in 2010 and that a patch to fix the alternative minimum tax would expire, among other things. The White House does not; instead, it assumes that nothing changes in current law.Gordon and another budget expert we spoke with, Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said they believe the White House approach is more realistic because it assumes current policy will continue.""I think the president is correct to make the shift,"" said Riedl. ""What current policy looks like makes more sense.""  (However, Riedl disagrees with Axelrod's larger point, that Bush deserves the blame for the big deficit. ""I'd argue that some of the TARP should be assigned to Obama,"" he said. There are only three parts of TARP that are losing money, he said, the auto company bailouts, AIG and the home loan program. Most of the auto bailouts and the home loan program were initiated by Obama, he said.) Back to Axelrod's original claim. His overall point is correct that the government was enjoying a substantial surplus when Bush took office and had a big deficit when he departed. Specifically, Axelrod is right about the surplus Bush began with, and the projected surplus at that point. Axelrod is very close on the deficit at the end of Bush's presidency, but there are two different ways to measure the 10-year projection when Bush left office. The CBO's estimate is $5 trillion lower than the White House numbers, though economists don't quibble with the White House methodology. So given that discussion, we'll take Axelrod down a notch to Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/15/david-axelrod/axelrod-claims-bush-saddled-obama-big-deficit/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry says Hutchison supports sanctuary cities
","
When the candidates faced off on immigration in the GOP primary debate Thursday night, Gov. Rick Perry accused Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of supporting sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. 
""Senator,"" he said, ""you voted for sanctuary cities."" 
Hutchison said the charge was ""absolutely wrong."" 
Who's right? We decided to check the vote. 
Perry's campaign pointed us to the proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. Hutchison voted against an amendment by Sen. Tom Coburn, R.-Okla., to enforce existing border security and immigration laws before granting illegal immigrants amnesty. (The bill itself never passed the Senate.) 
From a press release Coburn issued, the amendment would have required enforcement of ""existing border security and immigration laws before amnesty can be granted to illegal immigrants. These provisions of existing law include: control over maritime borders, full fencing required by law, integrated alien databases, US-VISIT program, biometric ID system, and ending 'sanctuary city' policies."" 
A 1996 provision in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act requires states and localities to pass along someone's immigration and citizenship status on request from any government entity. Coburn's amendment tried to insure it would be enforced. 
From a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides analysis to Congress: ""Most cities that are considered sanctuary cities have adopted a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy under which they don't require their employees, including law enforcement officers, to report immigrants who may be illegally present in the country."" 
The Senate rejected the amendment 54-42. Hutchison's campaign said she voted against it because it also prevented local input on the location of a border fence — a project widely opposed in the Rio Grande Valley. 
""I must protect my constituents,"" Hutchison said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. Border fence decisions belonged to the Border Patrol, ""not the Congress, most of whom have never visited Laredo, Texas."" 
The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which Hutchison voted for, extended reinforced fencing and other barriers, roads, cameras and sensors, along 700 miles of the southern border. 
Hutchison said that she agreed with with the ""purpose"" of Coburn's amendment but objected to what she said it would have allowed: government disregard for the opinion of private property owners and cities on the Rio Grande who would be affected by the fence. 
But by voting to kill the amendment, was she also voting in favor of sanctuary cities? 
We found no evidence that Coburn considered opposition to his amendment as support for sanctuary cities. 
Coburn's amendment would have reaffirmed established border and immigration policies. From all evidence, there’s no reasonable way to conclude that Hutchison’s vote against the amendment was a vote in favor of sanctuary cities.

Hutchison says Texas lost more jobs than it gained in 2009
","
Texas' job growth is a key tenet of Gov. Rick Perry's re-election campaign, and he sounded that theme again in Thursday's debate. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison tried to take him down a few notches. 
""And, oh, by the way, we definitely lost more jobs in Texas this year than we gained,"" she said. ""We lost 300,000 jobs in Texas alone this year. That is not a record to be proud of."" 
We couldn't let Perry sit on his laurels without checking Hutchison's claim. 
After clarifying that ""this year"" meant 2009, her campaign provided data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that showed Texas lost 271,700 jobs between November 2008 and November 2009. 
Perry's campaign didn't respond to our query — is Hutchison correct? — so we turned to the Texas Workforce Commission, which supplies the federal labor bureau with Texas' seasonally-adjusted employment numbers (farm jobs not included). 
Ann Hatchitt, the commission's director of communications, said Hutchison is right, and ""there's certainly no problem in rounding that up to 300,000 jobs."" 
The bottom line: Texas had a net job loss of 271,700 jobs, which means the state did lose more jobs than it gained. Nearly 300,000. 
That net job loss stands in contrast to 2007-08, when Texas led the nation in net job gains, as the Perry campaign frequently notes. 
Stay tuned for Jan. 22 when the commission updates its data with December's employment rate. And again in March, when number crunchers fine-tune their report. 
Until then, we rate Hutchison's claim True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/15/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-texas-lost-more-jobs-it-gained-2009/

Florida's Alex Sink says 2009 fundraising tops for any Democratic candidate for governor
","Florida's leading Republican candidate for governor, Bill McCollum, is bragging that he raised more money in the last three months of 2009 than any other candidate running for the state's top elected post. That produced some crowing in response from Alex Sink, the major Democratic candidate. Sink raised more than $5 million in cash and check contributions in 2009, state campaign finance records show. ""No Democratic campaign for governor has ever had these kinds of resources this early on in an election cycle, proving what a strong position our campaign is in going into 2010,"" Sink campaign manager Paul Dunn said on Jan. 6, 2010. We wanted to see if Sink, the state's chief financial officer, has built a war chest so large it's unusual for Florida Democrats. The state Division of Elections maintains an online database of campaign finance information for candidates going back to 1996. The online database covers gubernatorial elections in 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010. We searched the years prior to each election to see if anyone matches or comes close. Sink's 2009 total -- not including in-kind donations -- was $5,050,000. There were two leading Democrats running for governor in 2006, former U.S. Rep. Jim Davis and former state Sen. Rod Smith. Davis reported raising $1.65 million in 2005; Smith reported a total of $1.26 million in cash and check contributions. That's a little short of $3 million combined ($3.3 million when adjusted for inflation), way short of Sink's haul. Davis ultimately won the party's nomination, but was defeated by Republican Charlie Crist. In 2002, the two frontline Democrats were former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Sink's husband, lawyer Bill McBride. Reno raised $570,000 in the year ahead of the election; McBride raised $743,000. McBride won that primary, but lost in November to incumbent Gov. Jeb Bush. The Democrat in 1998 was Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who was trying to hold the governor's mansion following Lawton Chiles. MacKay raised $1.57 million the year ahead of the election. MacKay lost to Bush. We also checked back to the 1994 gubernatorial election, the last time Democrats won in Florida. Chiles raised a total of $2.7 million in private donations for that campaign, the St. Petersburg Times reported. That's worth nearly $4 million in today's dollars, but Chiles' total includes contributions made in the year prior and year of the election. Sink, on the other hand, still has 11 months of fundraising ahead. Prior to 1994, eclipsing $5 million a year before the election was inconceivable. Sink clearly has benefited by being the only major Democrat running for governor. She's also campaigning at a time that simply requires candidates to raise more money. Yet the $5 million Sink raised in cash and check contributions in 2009 is more than what Jim Davis and Rod Smith raised in 2005, combined. It's also more than what her husband, McBride, and Reno raised a year ahead of the 2002 election. MacKay in 1997 and Chiles in 1993 don't come close, either.

Hector Uribe says Jerry Patterson threatened to shoot him
","
Two former state senators are warming up Texas-style in anticipation of a fall showdown over who should be Texas land commissioner through 2014.

Lately, they've kidded each other about gunplay.

Democrat Hector Uribe's campaign went so far as to issue a press release suggesting the Republican he hopes to defeat, incumbent Commissioner Jerry Patterson, recently threatened to shoot him.

Uribe's Jan. 11 release states: ""Meanwhile, Uribe’s Republican opponent threatened to shoot him last week.""

Keeping our own tongues firmly in cheek, we checked into the claim.

Uribe's spokesman, Harold Cook, traced Patterson's threat to an item in the online Quorum Report.

In the Jan. 4 item, Patterson notes that he and Uribe both appeared in ""The Alamo,"" a movie. Patterson wrote, according to the report: ""Hector's a friend and fellow actor. We were both in the recent movie ‘The Alamo’, filmed near Austin, albeit on different sides in the conflict (actually Hector had a real part, I was just an extra). When Hector surrendered at San Jacinto, I should have shot him when I had the chance... ""

""I hope folks understand then we were just acting, now it's a real war,"" the item quotes Patterson saying.

Contacted later, Patterson — who once helped pass Texas' concealed-weapon law — said he was joking about any shooting.

""If it's not tongue-in-cheek stuff, that's a criminal offense,"" Patterson said. ""You're not supposed to threaten people. Does this put me on the (federal) no-fly list?""

Probably not. Especially when it's all just in good fun — and he didn't really make a threat. He just expressed ex post facto regret.

This is why we love Texas politics. Where else would a (pretend) gunfight spill into a (real) race for land commissioner? And where else would we get to fact check a claim like this one?

For making us laugh and for reminding us not to take this stuff too seriously, we give Uribe's claim that he was threatened a rating of Pants on Fire. And we suggest that all guns remain holstered for the rest of the campaign.",/factchecks/2010/jan/15/hector-uribe/hector-uribe-says-jerry-patterson-threatened-shoot/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Texas Democratic Party']","
The Democrats say Perry sent $899 million to an offshore call center in Bermuda that caused children to lose their health insurance through CHIP
","
As Gov. Rick Perry questioned efforts by congressional Democrats to pass a health care overhaul, the Texas Democratic Party accused him of undermining Texans' care with policies that benefit private companies instead of citizens.

""Perry's 'Pay to Play' politics led him to send $899 million to an offshore call center in Bermuda — a privatization scheme that deeply cost Texas taxpayers and resulted in 237,000 children losing their health insurance through CHIP,"" according to an Oct. 5 party news release. CHIP stands for Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves children of the working poor. 
The specter of needy Texans forced to seek assistance from operators in Bermuda — causing more than 200,000 children to lose their insurance coverage — seemed shocking.

We wondered if the Democrats' charge was true. 
The Democrats' news release cited a 2007 article by the San Antonio Express-News.We couldn't find anything in the Express-News article to back up the fiery claim. 
A party activist quickly admitted at least partial error.

Phillip Martin of the Texas Democratic Trust, which helps the party, said the press release was worded incorrectly. ""The call centers obviously weren't in Bermuda,"" Martin said, ""but the company was based in Bermuda — so Texas taxpayers' money did go to a company in Bermuda.""

The state had hired Accenture, a consulting and outsourcing company, to lead a group of companies called the Texas Access Alliance that would field social service applications and enroll clients. Accenture LLP, the U.S. subsidiary of Accenture Ltd., was incorporated in Bermuda in 2001, though shareholders voted last year to move the place of incorporation to Ireland.

But CHIP phone calls haven't been going to either country. In fact, they're answered in Texas.

We learned from the Health and Human Services Commission that the state's contract with Accenture required call-center employees to work from U.S. locations. The centers, located in Austin, San Antonio, Midland and Athens (the city near Tyler in East Texas — not Greece), have been run by Virgina-based Maximus, which signed a contract with the state when Accenture's role ended in June 2007.

Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said: ""The only way a call could be sent out of state is if a catastrophic situation happened that took down all the phone lines.""

In a broader context, the Democrats’ Martin suggested the creation of the call centers still was part of a Republican-fostered privatization scheme driving down CHIP sign-ups. 
Martin’s point: In 2003, the GOP-led Legislature made a push for privatization. Part of that involved directing the HHSC to determine whether using call centers run by private firms would cut costs. 
Kirsten Gray, Democratic Party communications director, explained that ""'Pay to Play' is a political term of art,"" which we assume means Perry's politics are inspired by whoever coughs up enough money toward his career. 
He did sign HB 2292 — the legislation that ushered sweeping changes into the state's health and human services — but Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth authored the bill, and the Legislature passed it. 
Accenture later landed the state’s call-center contract, which was projected to cost $899 million over five years, the cost figure cited by the Democrats. The privately run call centers were set up to process applications for CHIP, food stamps and Medicaid. Accenture ended up getting $245 million because Maximus took over the call centers.

We made a run at gauging whether the creation of the call centers alone reduced CHIP participation, as the Democrats claimed.

It’s just not so.

True, during the two years that Accenture was employed by the state, CHIP caseloads decreased and applications were lost in the system, causing children to lose health coverage.

But those numbers first dropped before the Accenture contract — after lawmakers approved policy changes restricting enrollment. For instance, an amendment adopted in the 2003 legislative session required clients to re-enroll every six months instead of 12 — a reduced time-frame intended to keep children from staying in the program past the time that their parents’ income surged. However, that resulted in more children being dropped from the rolls because their parents failed to re-enroll in time.

CHIP sign-ups rebounded a bit after legislators restored the 12-month enrollment period in 2007.

Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income Texans, summed up: ""The state implemented some really, really ill-considered policy changes, all at the same time.""

She said that a combination of policy changes, privatization and staffing cuts all contributed to CHIP reductions, but it's impossible to blame any one factor for CHIP reductions.

True, privatizing oversight of CHIP may not have delivered hoped-for savings, and enrollment may have been reduced.

But the Democrats' claim that Perry sent nearly $900 million to an outfit in Bermuda, directly causing more than 200,000 children to lose their health coverage, amounted to a big overreach. If they'd been more careful — even saying that the call centers were part of a troubled privatized model — our analysis may have been different.

But the party misstated the facts, undermining what could have been a meaningful critique.

We rule the statement False.",/factchecks/2010/jan/15/texas-democratic-party/democrats-say-perry-sent-899-million-offshore-call/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Gov. Rick Perry says Hutchison helped Democrats advance health care package
","
Gov. Rick Perry's campaign landed a Nutcracker-like leap in December by suggesting that Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison enabled Democrats to advance their health-care package by voting for the Senate to take up an unrelated spending proposal.

Hutchison's vote caused a small stir back home. Texas ""tea party"" activists gathered outside Hutchison's offices in Austin, Houston and Dallas.

Perry spokesman Mark Miner said Dec. 20: ""After promising to fight health care, Sen. Hutchison abandoned Republicans and stood with Democrats to ensure health care legislation would pass quickly.""

But is that the way it happened in Washington? We decided to check Perry's version of events.

True, Hutchison voted with the majority Democrats in favor of the Senate taking up the defense appropriation.

Early on Dec. 19, Democratic leaders amassed more than the 60 votes needed under Senate rules to proceed to action on the measure. Outnumbered Republicans had hoped to keep members stewing on the defense plan, thereby putting off action on the looming health care legislation.

The vote kept the Senate on a schedule that allowed the Democrats to bring up the health care overhaul. On Christmas Eve, the Senate passed it.

By Perry's analysis, Hutchison's vote eased the Democrats' passage of the health care bill she opposed. Perry's campaign posted several videos online including the version we're showing to the right musically casting Hutchison as flip-flopping. The video includes a snippet showing Hutchison telling colleagues before the vote that its early-morning timing was being driven by the ""underlying"" health care legislation.

Remember, Democrats needed only 60 votes to stay on their schedule. We found that Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, voting at 1:14 a.m., provided the crucial 60th vote in favor of action on the defense bill.

One minute later, two Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine — voted ""aye."" Video broadcast on C-SPAN2 shows Hutchison voting ""aye"" at 1:16 a.m. 
At 1:20 a.m., the final tally was read: 63 Yeas, 33 Nays.

Most Republicans — including Hutchison — then joined Democrats in passing the spending measure, 88-10.

Did Hutchison's procedural vote in any way ensure the Democrats' health care legislation would pass quickly?

We don't see how. The Perry campaign hasn't offered evidence to prove Hutchison blessed the Democratic health plan in any way other than casting a vote on that defense bill after the outcome was determined. 
Asked why Hutchison signed off on taking up the earlier spending measure -- surely knowing her vote might generate sparks back home -- Hutchison spokesman Joe Pounder said: ""After the Democrats had their 60, Sen. Hutchison felt it was important to register her vote for our defense priorities."" 
Significantly, Hutchison later joined fellow Republicans and voted against passage of the Democratic health plan. 
In claiming that Hutchison paved the way for the Democratic health bill, the Perry campaign leaped to a conclusion not supported by the facts. We give the Perry campaign's statement a ruling of Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jan/13/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-hutchison-abandoned-gop-helped/
"['Crime', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
White says crime hit 25-year low during his tenure
","
As his campaign revs up, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White is pointing voters to his record as mayor of Houston from 2004 through 2009. On his campaign Web site and in a thank-you letter published Jan. 2 in the Houston Chronicle, he brags about the city’s crime rates.

Though White in his public statements has stopped short of claiming he reduced crime in the nation's fourth-largest city, his Web site biography notes that during his tenure as mayor, he ""saw Houston’s crime rates drop to the lowest levels in more than 25 years.""

White's critics have accused him of being soft on crime, and the issue is likely to emerge in the governor's race. We decided to investigate whether White's statement about the decrease in Houston crime was true.

Statistics provided by his campaign confirm that the crime rate overall hit a 25-year low during his administration. That measure includes three nonviolent property crimes (such as burglary) as well as four major violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault). The White campaign's numbers, which were generated by the Houston Police Department for the years 1980 through 2008, show that the city’s 2008 total crime rate -- 6,080 offenses per 100,000 residents -- was the lowest of any of those years. In fact, 2006, 2007 and 2008 had the three lowest total crime rates in the 29 years of data offered by the campaign.

To double-check the numbers, we compared White’s statistics with those of the Texas Department of Public Safety, which collects data from local law enforcement agencies for the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. The DPS numbers for Houston did not perfectly match the police department’s because the agencies use different population estimates in their calculations. However, the discrepancies were small and did not undermine White’s assertion: In the DPS data starting with 1980, 2008 was also the year with the lowest total crime rate: 6,053.7 offenses per 100,000 residents.

Looking only at violent crime in Houston, the picture changes somewhat. There was at least one year -- 1998 being the most recent -- when the violent crime rate was lower than any year during White's tenure. And both the White campaign and Clete Snell, chairman of the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Houston Downtown, note that Houston experienced an uptick in violent crime in 2005, White’s second year in office, that they attribute to the influx of Hurricane Katrina evacuees.

These days, few public officials can legitimately take credit for reducing crime locally. That's because crime rates have been trending down all across the country for years, in some cases to record lows. According to FBI data, the nation's total crime rate in 2008 was down 29 percent from 1983, 25 years earlier.

Experts don't agree on the reasons for the persistent trend, but have suggested such factors as rising incarceration rates, the aging of the population and improved police practices.

It is important to note that crime trends do not follow straight lines — they can fluctuate year-to-year. Still, according to the DPS data, total crime in Houston has dropped 31 percent since 1983. And the decline was under way before White took office.

Nevertheless, when the Houston FBI office gave White the FBI Director’s 2007 Community Leadership Award, his efforts to combat crime were among the reasons cited. ""Mayor White is being recognized for his outstanding contributions toward improving the quality of life in the City of Houston through his commitment to law enforcement and the prevention of crime,"" a statement from the FBI said.

Summing up: Although experts debate the reasons for the downward trend in crime nationwide, White is right that the total crime rate in Houston hit a 25-year low during his time as mayor. We give him a True.

Perry says 1,000 people move to Texas daily
","
Gov. Rick Perry touts Texas as a model state that escaped the recession with few battle scars and a lot of jobs, if you're looking for one.

An unemployment rate significantly below the national rate is one reason folks are coming here — 1,000 people daily, according to Perry.

""I am pleased to receive the endorsement of the Southwest Movers Association, which plays a key role in supporting the more than 1,000 people who move to Texas every day,"" he said Dec. 29. ""As our state continues to grow, I look forward to working with members and stakeholders of SMA to ensure that Texas remains a top destination for job seekers.""

Matthew Thompson, a senior writer and editor at the Office of the Governor, said the governor's staff divided the state's annual population growth by 365 days to estimate how much the population swells daily. The statistics came from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Between July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009, Texas gained 478,012 more people — more than any other state (California, still boasting the biggest population overall, was second with 381,000 new people). That's about 1,300 people per day, by Thompson's calculation.

But 478,000 is the net population change. It includes births as well as people relocating to Texas, after accounting for deaths and people leaving the state. So, what part of that net figure represents newcomers? 
With help from the U.S. Census Bureau, we learned that about 635 people come to Texas every day, on average. A census official based that number on average daily net migration from other states (393) plus average daily net migration from other countries (242). 
A separate estimate of the actual number of people entering the state comes from the Internal Revenue Service, which tracks the addresses of people who file taxes each year, and reports that information to the Census Bureau. The IRS found that 493,840 people switched their residence to Texas between the time they filed in 2007 and when they filed in 2008 — that's about 1,353 people each day. (The IRS' data are slightly older than the figures Perry cites as evidence for his claim.) 
In the end, Perry came close to getting it right, though he didn't take into account in-state births or people moving away. Statistically speaking, of course, a set number of people aren't moving to Texas every day because that number varies. But if you rely on IRS data collected in 2007 and 2008, more than 1,300 people on average were relocating here during that time frame.

Gingrich claims Obama's order will let Interpol investigate American officials
","Conservatives have long feared that America is losing its sovereignty to international organizations, dating back to the John Birch Society issuing warnings about ""one world government"" in the 1950s. And perhaps nothing evokes this fear more than the possibility of an international police or military force with power over American citizens. A recent executive order signed by President Barack Obama dealing with the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, has reignited those fears.

During a Jan. 4, 2010, appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said: ""The president recently signed very quietly an executive order that basically releases Interpol from all American constraints. Freedom of Information Acts don't apply. All the constraints that you as a citizen could use against an American police force, based on a recent Obama-signed executive order, give Interpol, which has relationships with Syria, with Libya, with Iran, it gives them all sorts of extralegality in the United States in a way that has never ever before been offered to Interpol. And I'm very curious as to why the president is doing this. ... What I'm told is that it could lead to a number of investigations by Interpol in the United States, potentially aimed at American officials. And the question I would raise is, why would the president of the United States give that kind of extralegal protection to an international police force?""

""So you're saying that if there was any abuse by the CIA or something like that, that Interpol now has more authority to come into the United States and investigate it?"" O'Reilly asked.

""Yes,"" the Georgia Republican replied.

So Gingrich was raising the specter of an unaccountable group of foreigners coming to the United States with the approval of President Obama and arresting CIA officers or other American government officials.

The key problem with this notion is that Interpol couldn't investigate CIA or American officials, because Interpol doesn't do investigations. Although Interpol is often portrayed in movies as an international police force, solving crimes and arresting bad guys, its actual purposes are modest: It helps police organizations in different countries communicate and coordinate actions, provides databases of crime information (fingerprints, stolen artwork, names of suspected terrorists), training and other support services. It doesn't arrest anyone, and doesn't even have its own officers. Instead, police forces from around the world loan their officers to the organization. ""All investigations are done by national police,"" Interpol spokeswoman Rachel Billington said. ""We don't have powers of arrest.""

So if this executive order doesn't surrender American authority, what does it do? It ensures Interpol is treated the same way any other international organization that operates on American soil is treated. Like diplomats, international organizations in the United States are given certain immunities and privileges. A 1983 executive order signed by President Ronald Reagan gave Interpol some of these privileges, but others were withheld because the organization didn't have an office on U.S. soil at the time. In 2004, Interpol opened an office near the United Nations in New York, and the Obama administration has just gotten around to giving it the rights most other international organizations have.

What are these rights? Most of them deal with federal and customs taxes, but one grants Interpol immunity from having its property -- including its archives -- searched or seized.

We spoke with Gingrich's representatives and spokesman Joe DeSantis e-mailed this response: ""The argument that Interpol currently 'doesn't' do a certain activity misses the point. The executive order effectively removes the U.S.’s ability to know what Interpol is doing, and thus, if it wanted to start doing investigations into (for instance) American officials, it could, and the U.S. would have no way to ever know its activities since we have granted them immunity.""

But there's no reason to believe Interpol will suddenly reverse 87 years of precedent and begin to investigate and prosecute crimes. And for an organization based around the sharing of information, it's hard to think it will begin top-secret investigations of high-profile Americans, particularly when the current head of Interpol, Ronald Noble, is an American who served as a top official in the Treasury Department under President Bill Clinton.

Noble told the conservative Web site Human Events that ""the executive order gives Interpol no law-enforcement or investigative powers to engage in activities on U.S. soil."" Noble said that included ""searches, seizures or arrests in the U.S."" DeSantis pointed us to a National Review Online piece by Andy McCarthy. It argues that even if Interpol has no plans to investigate Americans, the ""order removes the negative legal restraints that block Interpol from conducting unauthorized police activity."" Even if no one thought other law enforcement organizations -- he cites the New York Police Department and the FBI -- were going to abuse their police powers, McCarthy argues, we still wouldn't remove the congressional and judicial checks that prevent them from doing so.

But, again, Interpol doesn't have police powers to abuse. It can't arrest anyone, and it doesn't conduct investigations. And even if it did, the organization's constitution bounds it to operate ""within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries."" The only relevant law Obama's executive order waives covers search and seizure, and that right can be reclaimed if the president deems it necessary.

Much of the teeth-gnashing likely has roots in Interpol's relationship with the International Criminal Court in the Hague, another landmark for those who see the erosion of American sovereignty. Some blogs have raised the possibility of Interpol arresting Bush administration officials for trial at the ICC. But this is a misrepresentation of the relationship between the two organizations. True, the ICC would theoretically be responsible for investigating and prosecuting war crimes allegations against U.S. officials. But Interpol would still lack the power to arrest those officials. Instead, it would put out a ""red notice"" alerting domestic law enforcement agencies that the person is wanted by the ICC.

Regardless, the ICC can only investigate crimes that are referred to it by the U.N. Security Council, that occur on the soil of a signatory to the court or are committed by nationals of a signatory to the court. The U.S. hasn't signed on to the ICC and can use its position on the Security Council to veto any referral. So any situation in which an ICC prosecutes an American is far-fetched.

As for a few other parts of Gingrich's statement: Interpol does have relationships with Syria, Iran and Libya, but its 188 members include stalwart U.S. allies like the United Kingdom, Israel and Australia. And as an international organization, Interpol never would have been subject to FOIA. The United States' National Central Bureau -- which is based at the Justice Department in Washington and is the main point of communication between the United States and Interpol -- says it will continue to respond to FOIA requests.

The sheer impossibility of the claims hasn't stopped them from becoming conservative talking points. After apparently originating on the blog ThreatsWatch, the claims spread to the aforementioned National Review piece, RedState.com, a column by Chuck Norris on WorldNetDaily and have been mentioned by Glenn Beck on his TV show.

Beck, perhaps looking to add some credibility to the idea, declared: ""The oddest part is the story was actually reported on in the New York Times. Yes.""

While the Times did report on the executive order, the story debunked many of the claims being made about it. Charlie Savage, the reporter who wrote the story, wrote in a Twitter message: ""Debunking hysterical conspiracy theories about Obama's Interpol executive order.""

That's exactly what Gingrich's claims are: conspiracy theories, based on wild conjecture, not reality. For fanning the flames of paranoia, Gringrich's claims earn a Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7c646785-156a-4922-b957-12ef24ec4fb9",/factchecks/2010/jan/13/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-interpol-will-investigate-american/

Fla. Democrat calls U.S. Senate race a tossup
","With Republicans Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio dominating news coverage about Florida's U.S. Senate race, Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek would like you to know he's running, too. ""A number of the national publications have put this race in a tossup race between Democrats and Republicans,"" Meek said in an interview with Bay News 9 and the St. Petersburg Times that aired Jan. 10, 2010. ""They don't know who's going to win this race."" Meek, a Miami congressman serving his fourth term, is seeking the Senate seat originally held by Sen. Mel Martinez and now held by Sen. George LeMieux, both Republicans. Meek is facing former Miami Mayor Maurice Ferre in the Democratic primary. Crist, the Florida governor, and Rubio, former speaker of Florida's House, are among the Republican candidates. When it comes to November, are national prognosticators putting Democrats like Meek on equal footing with the GOP? Congressional Quarterly's map lists Florida as ""Likely Republican."" Stuart Rothenberg, an oft-quoted political analyst, currently has Florida's Senate race as ""Clear advantage for incumbent party,"" or in this case Republicans. Another familiar name in political speculating, the Cook Political Report, lists the Florida race as ""Likely Republican."" Larry Sabato at the Center for Politics: ""Likely Republican."" Ken Rudin at National Public Radio: ""Republican favored."" A group called Intrade says Republicans have a 78.45 percent chance to keep their Florida Senate seat. New York Times: ""Likely Republican."" At the Washington Post, The Fix's Chris Cillizza does not list Florida among his 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties. At FiveThirtyEight.com, Florida ranks as the 13th-most likely seat to switch hands in November. Struggling to find the word ""tossup"" anywhere associated with the Florida Senate race, we asked the Meek campaign for help. They referred us to a blog post from the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 6, 2010. The post, entitled ""2010 Tossups: A Rundown of the Most-Competitive Senate Races,"" includes Florida among 11 other races. About Florida, Susan Davis writes: ""So much of the focus in this race has been on the Republican primary between Gov. Charlie Crist and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio that it's important to remember that either candidate still has to win a general election. Crist — back when Crist was seen as inevitable — was regularly leading likely Democratic nominee Rep. Kendrick Meek in the polls. But the evolving nature of the GOP primary, and what it says about the party and state, means that the Florida race is shaping up to be one of the more interesting and entertaining contests of the midterms."" That's the only example Meek's campaign provided and we didn't find any others on our own. Meek spokesman Adam Sharon says the ratings may change based on the shifting dynamics of the Republican primary, where Crist is quickly losing his front-runner status, but we're checking Meek's statement based on current predictions. Meek says a number of national publications consider Florida's Senate race this fall a tossup. That number, however, appears to be just one. The overwhelming majority of pundits who attempt to predict election outcomes all have Republicans favored in the Sunshine State. Maybe the ratings will change. But they haven't yet.

"['Crime', 'Women', 'Texas', 'Barbara Ann Radnofsky']","
Radnofsky says the attorney general requires rape victims pay for rape kits.
","
In her campaign to become the next attorney general of Texas, Democratic candidate Barbara Ann Radnofsky is using a crime-victim issue to attack her opponent, GOP incumbent Greg Abbott.

In a video on her Web site, Radnofsky makes the provocative claim that ""the attorney general requires that rape victims pay for the rape kit"" — a reference to forensic examinations given to victims of sexual assault.

 We wondered whether Radnofsky's statement was true. This is what we found:

Under current state law, sexual assault victims in Texas should never have to pay for their forensic exams, which are done by medical professionals to collect physical evidence for the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault suspects. Local law enforcement agencies are responsible for paying hospitals for rape kits in cases in which the victims report the crimes. Those agencies can seek reimbursement of up to $700 through the Crime Victims’ Compensation Fund, which is administered by the attorney general’s office. If a victim chooses not to report the crime, the Texas Department of Public Safety is responsible for paying for the exam and getting reimbursement from the fund.

When asked about Radnofsky’s statement in the video, Torie Camp, deputy director of the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, a victims advocacy organization, said, ""That’s not true, and if any rape victims are paying for rape kits, that shouldn’t happen. State law is very clear on this issue, and the attorney general can’t trump state law to make rape victims pay for rape kits.""

But Texas law hasn't always read that way. In the past, rape exams were done by medical professionals and then paid for by law enforcement agencies only if sexual assault victims reported the crimes. The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, signed by President George W. Bush in 2006, gave states three years to eliminate such reporting requirements so that all victims could obtain free forensic medical exams. In 2009, the Texas Legislature finally changed the law, directing the Department of Public Safety to cover the cost of a rape kit for any victim who chooses not to report.

For Radnofsky, that change took too long. She says that Abbott could have -- and should have -- acted earlier to bring administration of the victims' compensation fund into compliance with the federal act. 

A spokesman for Abbott's office says the attorney general did not have the authority to change a policy that was mandated by state law.

When asked if she knew of any instances when victims had paid for their own rape kits, Radnofsky said she did not.

But she isn't the first person to wade into this gnarly issue.

In May, a Houston television station aired a report, picked up by CNN, that caused an uproar in the advocacy community because it implied that sexual assault victims were being billed for forensic exams, Camp said.

In response, both the attorney general’s office and TAASA issued public statements that termed the TV story inaccurate and misleading. The attorney general's office said that as of Jan. 1, the office had paid for 57,702 rape exams since December 2002 and had not denied any requests for reimbursements for the kits from law enforcement agencies.

TAASA said the TV report implied that billing victims for their rape kits ""was a common practice in Texas despite being told by several sources … that this was not the case. … The problem is there isn’t really a problem.""

Officials from other organizations that deal directly with sexual assault victims, including SafePlace and the Austin Police Department’s sex crimes unit, also said that they were not aware of any large-scale problems with victims receiving bills for forensic exams.

That leaves this question: Before the Texas law was changed, did sexual assault victims who did not want to report a crime have to pay for their forensic exams? No, according to officials contacted for this story. In those cases, victims were not given the exams to begin with, so payment was not an issue.

However, hospitals have sometimes mistakenly sent bills to victims for their forensic exams, according to the attorney general’s office. But none of the officials we contacted knew of any data on how often that happens.

Summing up: Regardless of whether Abbott took the initiative on this issue and regardless of whether some sexual assault victims have been mistakenly billed on occasion, Radnofsky’s claim is wrong. The attorney general does not require rape victims to pay for rape kits and never has.

That's why we give Radnofsky a Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jan/12/barbara-ann-radnofsky/radnofsky-says-attorney-general-requires-rape-vict/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Kay Bailey Hutchison']","
Hutchison says she quadrupled Border Patrol agents
","
  
A TV ad for U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison describes her as a conservative as tough as Texas, who ""doesn't just talk tough, but delivers."" 

The ad cites her work against a state income tax, opposing the economic stimulus package and says she has ""quadrupled agents to secure our border,"" among other claims.

Although she is correct that the number of agents has quadrupled since she became a senator in 1993 — from 3,600 to more than 18,000 now — much of the increase was prompted by requests from President George W. Bush, who honored his 2004 promise to double Border Patrol agents from 9,000.

And Hutchison is only one of 100 senators. We wondered how much credit she can accurately take for all that growth in Border Patrol manpower. 

Hutchinson's TV ad flashes tiny print from a 2006 San Antonio Express-News editorial endorsing the incumbent senator for another term: ""Her influence has been instrumental in securing funding for 1,500 new Border Patrol agents."" But that refers to a 2005 boost in funding, not the cumulative increase that took place over time.

It's true that Hutchison has pushed for funding and consistently voted to increase Border Patrol since her first year on the Hill, notably joining Congress to pass an immigration bill in 1996 that authorized the addition of 5,000 agents over five years. She's been active on the issue, even if some of her bills didn't pass. In 1995, she introduced the Immigration Reform Control Act that would have added 6,000 patrol agents, but it never made it out of the Judiciary Committee. Nor did the Border Law Enforcement Relief Act of 2008 that she co-sponsored to increase funding for agencies addressing border-related crime.

In 2001, she voted for a bill that snagged $180 million for law enforcement on the U.S.- Mexico border, fulfilling Hutchison's requests to hire 570 full-time Border Patrol agents and fund new facilities across Texas for fiscal year 2002. 

But anyone who votes for an immigration bill — and almost all of the measures include a Border Patrol component — can claim credit for bolstering the patrol force, says Dr. Nestor Rodriguez, a sociology professor at the University of Texas. (The bill Hutchison voted on in 2001 passed 98-1.)

We spoke with several experts about which senators have championed legislation to beef up the Border Patrol, and nobody volunteered Hutchison's name. The experts noted that the measures were widely supported on both sides of the aisle — not proving controversial. 
""The general consensus on Capitol Hill is that we were, and are, understaffed,"" said T.J. Donner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union that represents more than 17,000 border agents and staff. Donner said Bush deserves the credit for stregthening the border patrol. 

Hutchison has advocated increasing border agents, but she didn't personally quadruple anything. In many cases, the increases were pushed by President Bush and she was one of many who supported them. We find her claim Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/jan/12/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-she-quadrupled-border-patrol-agents/

Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos says 1 in 4 schools in the state are failing on DPI report cards
","
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) ignited fierce Democratic reaction when he contended that widespread failings by Wisconsin public schools were a rationale for endorsing Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to expand private-school choice. 
""In 2012, 1 in 4 Wisconsin schools had a subpar score on the Department of Public Instruction’s recent report cards,"" Vos said in an April 5, 2013, video news release. ""Simply, those schools are failing the Wisconsin children they serve."" 
Within hours, state Rep. Sondy Pope (D-Cross Plains) fired back: 
""Saying that one in four public schools is receiving a subpar score on the school report cards is a gross misrepresentation of the truth,"" Pope said in a press release. ""If we are going to have an honest discussion about increasing the performance of all types of Wisconsin schools, we cannot continue to tolerate this type of intellectual dishonesty."" 
Turn away, children, the grown-ups are fighting again. 
Isn’t it the parents and kids who are supposed to spar when the report cards come home? 
Let’s pull out those report cards and take a look. Did 25 percent of schools get a subpar -- below average -- score that indicates they are ""failing"" their students, as Vos claimed? 
The report cards, first produced in October 2012, were the product of a bipartisan task force. Three Republicans -- Walker and the two top legislative leaders -- plus State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers co-chaired a group that included teachers, school leaders, researchers, advocates, and legislators from both parties. 
The group voted against an A to F scale for the report cards and left the design of the rating scale to the Department of Public Instruction. Walker had advocated an A to F scale in the 2010 campaign, but nonetheless applauded the compromise package of accountability measures. 
Under the system, schools were evaluated on test scores and test-taking participation, graduation rates, attendance and graduation rates and closing performance gaps between various student groups. About 210 schools were not rated mainly because information was lacking or the schools were too new or small. 
Here is the scale, and how 1,908 public schools came out : 
Significantly Exceeds Expectations: 66 schools (3.5 percent). Based on combined score of 83 -100. 
Exceeds Expectations: 643 schools (33.7 percent). Scores of 73 - 82.9. 
Meets Expectations: 926 schools (48.5 percent). Scores of 63 - 72.9. 
Meets Few Expectations: 197 schools (10.3 percent). Scores of 53 - 62.9. 
Fails to Meet Expectations: 76 schools (4.0 percent). Scores of 0 - 52.9. 
An Oct. 22, 2012, Associated Press story on the cards described the results this way: ""Most Wisconsin schools meet or exceed expectations as defined on new, more stringent report cards ... More than 85 percent of schools meet or exceed expectations."" 
The Journal Sentinel said that of schools rated, 86 percent met or exceeded the state's expectations for performance, noting: ""About 14% of the schools rated...fell below the state's expectations for performance."" 
So the report card says one in 10 schools are meeting ""few"" expectations, and one in 25 are simply failing to meet expectations -- for a combined total of 14 percent or one in seven below the ""meets expectations"" level. 
With that statistical backdrop, how does Vos come up with 25 percent (his one in four) that are ""subpar"" and ""failing"" in their mission? 
When asked about the claim, Vos aide Kit Beyer told us her boss was choosing to view the scores in the report card as a parent would -- as an A-to-F proposition. 
That is, Vos takes the total score for a school and compares it to the traditional letter-grade scale. In his view, a score of 66 percent or below is barely passing on the traditional report card, and therefore the 23 percent of schools that scored at or below that level are ""subpar"" and ""failing"" students. Vos rounded 23 percent to ""one in four."" 
Beyer acknowledged that the state report card ""uses a different grading scale"" than the traditional report card, but said Vos ""believes the grading scale used on these report cards make it seem like more schools are doing okay."" 
But there’s a major problem with Vos’ approach. 
In his statement, Vos specifically cited ""the Department of Public Instruction’s recent report cards."" 
And the department has noted the scale is not constructed as a traditional A-to-F scale. The only similarity is it has five categories. 
In a November 2012 item, PolitiFact Wisconsin noted the department’s warning on this was explicit. 
""It’s important to note that the 0 to 100 accountability index score is not a ""percent correct"" measurement, so the scores are not the same as grades,"" the state Department of Public Instruction warned when the grades came out. That was one reason we rated it a Compromise on the Walk-O-Meter. 
Department of Public Instruction spokesman John Johnson reiterated that the state’s card was not set up to correspond with a traditional letter-grade scale. 
""It make senses to avoid conflating these two different types of measures and these different ways of understanding results,"" he said. 
A task force member, Miles Turner, executive director of the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators, said that trying to convert the report card scores to letter grades was ""like using a thermometer to weigh something. The tool doesn’t measure that."" 
Of note: Walker’s choice expansion (which Vos supports) would be based on 2013 report cards as written, not as Vos re-envisions them. 
Walker has proposed that districts with at least two schools in the bottom two categories in the report card are ""underperforming"" and should be opened to choice competition. Those are the categories that contain 14 percent of schools. 
  
Walker has sometimes used the term ""D"" and ""F"" schools to describe some schools in the report card. 
But -- unlike Vos -- Walker’s ""D"" and ""F"" schools are the bottom two categories that contain 14 percent of the state’s public schools. He sticks to the report card’s numerical system. 
Our rating 
Advocating expansion of school choice into more cities, Vos said: ""In 2012, 1 in 4 Wisconsin schools had a subpar score on the Department of Public Instruction’s recent report cards"" and are ""failing"" the children they serve 
Vos is entitled to his viewpoints on how many schools are substandard and on how the report card was set up. 
But he clearly references the department’s report cards -- and then wrongly quotes them as saying they show one in four public schools are not only ""subpar"" but ""failing"" their students. 
The report card does not make either one of those claims, doesn’t use that language and, it’s architects say, can’t be converted to grades. In fact, the report card says about one in seven schools are not meeting expectations. 
Vos is way off base in the way he tries to turn up the heat on public schools to push choice. 
That lands him on the fiery red end of the Truth-O-Meter.

New anti-Chris Christie ad by Democratic group mostly on target
","
New Jersey’s just about gone to economic hell under Chris Christie’s leadership, a Democratic group suggests in a new TV ad. 
Things are so bad here that the state ranks at the top nationwide for unemployment, at the bottom for economic growth and isn’t doing a thing to help the middle class, the ad claims. 
""Under Republican Chris Christie, New Jersey had the highest increase in unemployment in the country last year,"" a narrator states in the ad by One New Jersey. ""Nearly 1 in 10 jobless. The worst unemployment in the region. Near the bottom in economic growth, yet Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires but vetoed a minimum wage hike."" 
The ad, which is also running on NJ.com, the online home of The Star-Ledger, is largely accurate. 
Let's review each claim. 
New Jersey having the ‘worst increase in unemployment’ is based on the period from December 2011 to December 2012. 
Let’s note that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics measures unemployment data by unemployment rates and the number of unemployed. 
For that period, New Jersey and New Hampshire had the highest rate increase, at 0.3 percent. New Jersey’s rate ticked upward to 9.5 percent from 9.2 percent. 
New Jersey wasn’t the worst, though, when looking at the number of unemployed, said Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. Pennsylvania had 24,761 unemployed. New Jersey had 21,932. 
New Jersey’s unemployment rate increase was the 10th highest nationwide for the period from February 2012 to this past February, Seneca said. 
And with New Jersey’s unemployment rate hovering above 9 percent since June 2009 – the end of the recession – it’s accurate to claim the state has nearly 1 in 10 people jobless. The state, however, has added more than 120,000 private-sector jobs, according to BLS data, Seneca and the state Republican Party. 
Next, did we have the ‘worst unemployment in the region?’ 
One New Jersey didn’t define region specifically so we compared New Jersey with New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Connecticut. New Jersey’s unemployment rate was the highest among the five states from December 2011 to December 2012, according to BLS data. 
The ad also claims New Jersey is near the bottom for economic growth. We previously checked a similar claim by Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden). 
From 2010 to 2011, New Jersey’s real gross domestic product – an inflation-adjusted measure of a state’s economy -- dropped by a half percent, placing us 47th among all states, according to data from The Bureau of Economic Analysis. So we were near the bottom, but economic experts told us for the Greenwald claim that national and regional economic conditions – not just Christie -- were factors. 
Now let’s look at whether Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires and vetoed a minimum wage increase. 
Democrats approved a bill in May 2010 renewing a one-year tax rate increase of 10.75 percent for those with taxable income above $1 million. The rate had expired before Christie became governor.. Christie, who campaigned that he wouldn’t raise taxes, vetoed the surcharge -- protecting the rich, some claim -- and Democrats couldn’t override it. 
As for the minimum wage claim, Christie in January vetoed a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 an hour, with future increases tied to inflation. He instead proposed phasing in a $1 increase over three years and eliminating automatic hikes. 
""The sad truth is New Jersey is falling further behind, and no amount of hype can hide the reality that the middle-class and working families are hurting,"" One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne said in an e-mail. ""The facts clearly show New Jersey has consistently trailed the rest of America when it comes to jobs and the economy."" 
NJGOP spokesman Ben Sparks pointed to the state's private-sector job growth under Christie. 
""Despite the predictably misleading claims from Barbara Buono's campaign operatives, New Jersey has created over 120,000 private-sector jobs since Governor Christie took office, which stands in stark contrast to the failed two years Barbara Buono spent as Jon Corzine's budget chair, when our state lost 240,000 private-sector jobs,"" Sparks said in an e-mail. 
Buono, (D-Middlesex), is challenging Christie in the November gubernatorial election. 
Our ruling 
One New Jersey’s new ad claims, ""Under Republican Chris Christie, New Jersey had the highest increase in unemployment in the country last year. Nearly 1 in 10 jobless. The worst unemployment in the region. Near the bottom in economic growth, yet Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires but vetoed a minimum wage hike."" 
Each claim had varying degrees of accuracy. New Jersey and New Hampshire tied for the highest increase in unemployment last year. Nearly 1 in 10 New Jerseyans are jobless, and our state’s unemployment rate is the worst in a five-state region. The state has been near the bottom in economic growth, even though experts have said that’s not entirely Christie’s fault, and the governor vetoed a minimum wage hike. Christie technically didn’t cut the millionaire’s tax since it expired before he took office, but opinions vary wildly on that claim. We rate the ad Mostly True.

R.I. Board of Education Chairwoman Eva Marie Mancuso says harder questions are dropped from NECAP re-tests
","
The plan to make high school students pass -- or at least show some improvement on -- a proficiency test before they can graduate from high school continues to cause controversy. 
During the April 7 edition of the WPRI-TV program ""Newsmakers,"" the chairwoman of the newly formed Rhode Island Board of Education, Eva Marie Mancuso, was asked about the basic test, known as the New England Common Assessment Program. High school students can it take a second or third time, if necessary, to demonstrate that they have learned enough for a diploma. 
Mancuso said it was important to note that ""the second and third NECAP test that's given is not the same NECAP test that they're given originally. . . . You know those really hard questions that are on the front page of the paper that we all look at and say, 'Oh my goodness, how could anybody pass these?' Those are there to weed out and to show what our excellent students are doing. So when the test is re-given to the kids the second and third time, those [harder] questions are taken out."" 
We were under the impression that students who had to re-take the NECAP test to demonstrate proficiency didn't take a less-challenging form of the test, so we decided to check her statement. 
Mancuso's office sent us to her spokesman, Mike Trainor. While we were waiting for his response, we contacted Elliot Krieger, spokesman at the Rhode Island Department Education. 
Krieger said although questions on the NECAP change from year to year -- as they do for most standardized tests -- the test is not dumbed-down if students need to retake it in the beginning of their senior year. It's the same NECAP test high school juniors are taking. 
But seniors who fail to show enough improvement on the second test and need to take a third will be given a stripped-down version of the NECAP, a version that is still under development. ""It will be a shorter version, have less degree of difficulty because it's single purpose will be to determine whether students at the low-scoring level have shown improvement,"" said Krieger. ""There may be some difficult questions, but they will be fewer."" 
""We haven't designed it yet. It's more than a year away. But that's the plan,"" he said. 
When Trainor got back to us, he said Krieger had the correct information and Mancuso supports that. 
Our ruling 
Rhode Island Board of Education Chairwoman Eva Marie Mancuso said, ""When the [NECAP proficiency] test is re-given to the kids the second and third time, those [harder] questions are taken out."" 
Seniors who retake the NECAP should find that the second test is just as difficult as the first because it's the same test that juniors are taking. 
It's only in the third test, given to seniors who fail the second, that the number of questions will be fewer and harder questions -- ones designed for more advanced students -- will be removed. At least, that's the plan. 
Because her statement is only partially accurate, we rate it Half True.

Has Oregon's higher minimum wage hurt our restaurant industry?
","
Melvin ""Mel"" Sickler, a representative of the National Restaurant Association, recently told a U.S. Senate committee to put the brakes on a bill that would increase the federal minimum wage and tie it to inflation. 
Why? Boosting the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 would reduce the number of jobs in the food service industry, Sickler said. 
The claim: In his testimony, Sickler trotted Oregon out as an example of a state with a high minimum wage (it’s $8.95) tied to inflation, saying that’s happened here. 
Here’s what he said: 
""Given the experience in states that have raised their minimum wages above the federal rate, we know the impact The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013 would have, if enacted, on the availability of jobs in my industry. 
""For example, Oregon's state minimum wage is now $8.95, more than a dollar less than what is being proposed in The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013. After peaking at 16.4 employees per establishment in 1996, the average number of workers in Oregon's restaurants declined steadily."" 
Wow, right? And, it gets worse, according to Sickler. 
""By 2011, Oregon's restaurants employed an average of only 13.8 workers, or 2.6 fewer employees than they did before the state's minimum wage began rising above the federal level in 1997,"" he said. 
Oregonians are sensitive about the quality of their restaurants and the size of their workforce so we wanted to figure out if this was true. Has Oregon’s minimum wage hurt the state’s restaurant industry? And what is ""employees per establishment,"" anyway? 
The analysis: We went to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for some numbers. The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages is the go-to data source for job trends. 
To find the ""employees per establishment"" throughout the U.S., we took the average number of employees in the food service industry in 2011 and divided it by the average number of ""establishments."" Bingo. Oregon’s number in 2011 was 13.8. That’s lower than the national average of 16.4. 
But that’s just the start. Sickler was making a statement about how we got there. So let’s look at that other question, has the minimum wage in Oregon led to job losses? 
To dig into that, we started comparing Oregon to other states. That’s where the trouble began. 
But first, we need to talk a little more about the minimum wage. 
In Oregon, pretty much everybody has to be paid at least the minimum wage. That’s true in Washington, California and a few other states. But it’s not very common. In most states, tipped employees can be paid less under certain circumstances. The math gets pretty fuzzy pretty fast and lots of states have their own rules. But the main point is this: waiting tables on the West Coast pays better. 
So if our high minimum wage has hurt the job market for bartenders, the $9.19 hourly rate in Washington and the $8 rate in California has to have done the same thing, right? 
Well, this is where it gets sticky. 
Washington had 1.54 fewer employees per establishment than the national average. But California was basically at the national average. Oh, and in Nevada, where you either get the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour if your employer provides health coverage or you get $1 more if they don’t, the average number of employees per establishment was 18.75, 1.8 ahead of the average. 
Here’s another puzzler. Tipped employees in New York and New Jersey can earn less than $7.25. But New York food service businesses had an average of 12.6 employees. In New Jersey they had an average 12.4 employees. That’s worse than Oregon! 
Since you’re probably wondering, the state with the lowest average employees per population was Wyoming with 10.4. The highest number came from South Dakota, which had 22.46. Employees in both states earn the federal minimum. 
We asked Josh Lehner, a senior economist with the state of Oregon, whether this ""employees per establishment"" thing was a good gauge of the economic health of the restaurant industry. 
""You have two numbers there,"" Lehner said. ""Your numerator and denominator -- and they can both be moving on their own trend lines for a whole host of reasons."" 
See, lots of things happened between 1997 and 2011. Brewpubs began sprouting up like mushrooms across the state. Food carts blossomed in downtown Portland, then throughout the metro area. Foodie culture hit, increasing the interest in small locally owned restaurants over big national chains. There also were a couple recessions. 
We weren’t sure of the effects of all those things, so we looked at the underlying data. There we found that the yearly number of food service establishments in Oregon grew each year from 1997 through 2011. Employment grew every year except 2010, when it took a tiny dip. 
The ""employees per establishment"" number quoted by the restaurant association, seems to have changed over time, but not because of a massive drop in employment or restaurants. 

If you control for population growth, you get a clearer indication of the impact of recessions and the business cycle on the industry. That’s just what Lehner did. 
His conclusion was that Oregon’s a pretty good place to nosh. 
From 2001 to 2011, Oregon consistently had more establishments per 1,000 people than the U.S. average, and it had more people working in the food service industry per 1,000 people than the national average. During the entire time, Oregon’s minimum wage was higher than the national average and steadily crept up, matching inflation. 
Finally, we tracked down Michael Reich, director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California Berkeley. 
""The drop in jobs per establishment in Oregon could be caused by any number of factors. The chart shows a rising trend in jobs per establishment in the U.S. as a whole, even while the federal minimum wage rose several times during the period in the chart,"" Reich said. ""I would not argue, though, that the minimum wage caused the increase. One has to have many more controls to make the transition from correlation to causality."" 
We went back to the National Restaurant Association to discuss our findings. 
Katie Laning Niebaum said the group wasn’t arguing that smaller establishments were bad for the economy, or that Oregon’s restaurant industry was in decline, but instead, that a change in business model in response to the minimum wage was reducing opportunities for employment. 
""The data shows that over the last several years since Oregon's minimum wage rose above the national,"" Laning Niebaum said, ""it appears that restaurant owners have changed their business model to employ fewer individuals. 
The ruling: Sickler wants to connect the shrinking size of restaurants on average in Oregon to the state’s minimum wage being higher than the federal minimum. In a vacuum, his data seem to suggest that link. 
But when we looked at data from other states, the correlation just didn’t work. And putting employment and the number of restaurants into context, as Lehner did, we can see that restaurant jobs rise and fall with the health of the national economy, not the state’s minimum wage. Oregon’s per capita restaurant employment is higher than the national average, in spite of having a higher minimum wage.

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers says fewer now working than any point since 1979
","
During an interview with NPR, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., a member of the House Republican leadership, expressed concern about the state of working America. 
""We have the fewest people employed in this country since 1979,"" McMorris Rodgers told host Audie Cornish. ""And the current path that the president has outlined ... is not getting people back to work. So it's going to take both parties engaging."" 
It turns out that McMorris Rodgers is on the right track with her statistic, but she described it incorrectly. 
A look at the numbers 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 89.4 million Americans were working in March 1979, but by March 2013, that number had grown to 135.2 million. This number remains lower than the all-time high of 138.1 million in January 2008, which was around the time the most recent recession hit. But the number of employees nationally is slowly climbing back to that peak. 
McMorris, however, meant to refer to a different BLS number: the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of the U.S. population who are considered to be ""in the labor force."" To qualify as being in the labor force, you have to either be working or actively looking for work. 
In March 2013, the labor force participation rate was 63.3 percent -- lower than in any month since May 1979. 
(A similar statistic known as the employment-to-population ratio has also fallen, though it’s at its lowest level since late 1983.) 
Riva B. Litman, a spokeswoman for the House Republican Conference, told PolitiFact that McMorris Rodgers phrased the statistic incorrectly and meant to refer to the labor force participation rate. 
""If we adjust for population growth, fewer Americans work than at any time since Jimmy Carter was president,"" Litman said. 
What does the statistic mean? 
Most economists agree that a decline in the labor force participation rate is worrisome. But it’s important to point out some nuances. 
""The trick is to determine how much of the drop represents the impact of a lagging economy, which is worrisome, and how much is due to non-worrisome factors, such as the aging of the adult population,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. 
As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. And that’s been happening in a big way as the baby boomers age. Using federal data, Burtless has calculated that the percentage of the adult population over 55 has risen from 27 percent in 1999-2000 to 32 percent in the 2011-12. 
The new retirees are showing up in the data. Burtless has determined that the two employment ratios would have fallen in recent years just on the basis of aging, even if there had been no recession. But the age-related decline has been worsened by high unemployment rates during the recession. Most troubling, economists say, is the decline among the core working ages of 25 to 55. In addition, the tight job market has convinced more people to opt out of the labor market, perhaps by becoming students or stay-at-home parents. 
Burtless has estimated that half to two-thirds of the recent decline in the labor participation rate has been due to the aging of the population, depending on the time period you look at. 
In general, economists like to see more people working because it generally helps economic growth, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. But it’s also important to keep in mind that leaving the labor force can be a voluntary decision. ""Perhaps people would prefer to have more time at home rather than more stuff,"" she said. 
Our ruling 
McMorris Rodgers said, ""We have the fewest people employed in this country since 1979."" That’s not correct -- far more people are working now than in 1979. But a different statistic that takes into account population growth, the participation rate, is indeed lower now than it’s been since 1979. It’s important to note that a significant portion of this decline comes from the aging of the baby boomers, rather than economic weakness.

Joe Negron says PETA is using a drone to spy on hunters overseas
","
Drones are not just a tool of the United States military. Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, says they are being used right now to monitor the movements of hunters overseas. 
Negron's pet project of the legislative session aims to curtail the use of nonmilitary drones by state and local law enforcement. Even though Negron's story about hunters doesn't directly impact his proposal, SB 92, he shared it recently to help explain the growing drone market. 
""I don’t know how many of you saw the story about, and this is in another country so it’s beyond the jurisdiction of the Florida Legislature, but I think it’s PETA is using this really fancy drone to follow hunters around in some places in other countries to watch their hunting activities,"" Negron told reporters on April 10. ""You're going to see more and more creative uses of drones because the technology has become so affordable."" 
Is PETA, or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, really taking their war against animal cruelty to the skies? 
It's planning on it. 
PETA announced in an April 8 press release titled ""PETA to acquire drones to stalk hunters"" that it is seeking drone technology to use in the United States. PETA said it wants to ""monitor those who are out in the woods with death on their minds."" 
The group said it wants to capture video footage of ""slob hunters"" who drink while in possession of a firearm, fail to pursue maimed animals and use spotlights and hunting lures that are banned in some places. The group said it also intends to use drones over factory farms, fishing holes and other places ""where animals routinely suffer and die."" 
""The talk is usually about drones being used as killing machines, but PETA drones will be used to save lives,"" PETA President Ingrid E. Newkirk said in a statement. ""Slob hunters may need to rethink the idea that they can get away with murder, alone out there in the woods with no one watching."" 
Newkirk later told CNN that PETA was also planning to fly drones overseas where the group is active. 
A blogger at AmmoLand.com reacted to the announcement with expected snark: ""Sounds to me like this will create a whole new shooting sport. ‘PETA Drone Target Shooting.’ "" 
So PETA says it is planning to use drones both domestically and abroad, but it hasn't yet. Negron got that mixed up. But other wildlife protection groups, such as the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, have used drones to target illegal hunters in other countries. 
The World Wildlife Fund received a $5 million grant from Google to deploy technology, such as sensors, tags and ""conservation drones,"" that would help protect elephants, rhinos and tigers from wildlife traffickers and poachers. The group has already tested conservation drones over national parks in Nepal. 
Negron sent us a U.S. News and World Report story about a Belgian research team conducting unmanned aerial surveys in Burkina Faso. Drones are better than plane-based surveying because they cost less and can be deployed more easily, a researcher explained. However, drones have a limited flying time and the camera zoom is sometimes not effective. The researchers could not see antelopes or baboons but could count elephants. 
In this instance, Negron is right that drones are being used overseas, but he referenced hunters -- not illegal poachers -- when describing their target. 
For the record, Negron’s bill does nothing to prevent private groups from using drones in Florida. SB 92 would ban the use of drones by law enforcement unless they have a warrant or are responding to threat of terrorist attack. It also prevents information obtained by drones from being used in the courts as evidence. 
Another point: In the United States, flying a drone isn't as simple as buying one and putting it in the air. The Federal Aviation Administration regulates drone use by government entities and corporations. Because PETA is a nonprofit, it might be able to work around the rules by flying under model aircraft rules, which generally limit operations below 400 feet and away from air traffic. 
""The caveat there is that some of the operations that they have talked about doing would appear to be difficult to do while maintaining sight of the unmanned aircraft,"" said FAA spokesman Les Dorr, pointing to model aircraft guidelines the group would have to follow. 
Our ruling 
Negron said he thought PETA is ""using this really fancy drone to follow hunters around in some places in other countries to watch their hunting activities."" 
Negron, to our eye, conflates PETA's plan to use drones to watch hunters in the United States and abroad with other wildlife groups currently tracking poachers overseas with drones. 
But his main point is largely right. Animal rights groups are using drones to look for animal abuses. We rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/12/joe-negron/joe-negron-says-peta-flying-drones-spy-hunters-ove/

Gender wage gap claim needs more context
","
Next month, South Carolina voters head to the polls for a special election to select a new representative for the U.S. House in the state’s 1st Congressional District. 
The race between former Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican candidate known for his infamous antics, and Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a Democratic candidate known for her talk-show host brother’s antics, has garnered national attention for Georgia’s next-door neighbor. 
  
This week, Colbert Busch tried to capitalize on Sanford’s poor reputation with women, while pushing for equity in employee pay. 
  
The Colbert Busch campaign did not return a call and an email for comment. 
  
""In South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to men’s earnings,"" the candidate said in a news release. She went on to say that ""I am committed to making sure that women earn the same pay for the same work."" 
  
PolitiFact has heard and examined similar wage gap claims before. We decided to revisit the claim and check any new material available on the subject to see whether Colbert Busch’s claim was correct. 
  
Colbert Busch made her comments about the wage gap on Equal Pay Day. That day symbolizes how many months after one year a woman must work, on average, to earn as much as a man earned that same one year. 
  
In conjunction with Equal Pay Day, the National Partnership for Women and Families released a report examining the pay gap in the states and 50 largest metropolitan areas. For South Carolina, the group found that women in general are paid 76 cents for every dollar paid to men. The report is based on census data of full-time, year-round workers. The NPWF used the study to push for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act to prevent pay discrimination. 
  
Colbert Busch’s figure is correct, and based on numerous studies that have controlled for factors like education level and time on the job and they still cannot explain the gender wage gap, said Drucilla Barker, a professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of South Carolina. ""Women and men do different kinds of work and in general women’s work pays less than men’s work,"" she said. ""The question then becomes ‘why?’"" 
  
Last year, a National Women’s Law Center report provided a state-by-state ranking comparing median earnings for both genders for full-time, year-round workers, regardless of occupation, based on census data. The report found that in 2011 in South Carolina, women earned 75.6 cents for every dollar earned by a man. 
  
The state gaps follow the often-repeated national data that shows women earning 77 cents to every dollar a man earns.The 77-cent figure is derived from a 2010 census report comparing female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers. 
  
But that report compares all workers, regardless of occupation and other factors such as education level and time on the job. It has been used widely to support eliminating gender discrimination. 
  
Last June, in a campaign ad, President Barack Obama claimed that women are ""paid  77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men."" Obama neglected to include employee factors such as education level, occupation and time on the job in his analysis, and received a Mostly False rating for oversimplifying his statement. A few months later, Colorado legislator Diana DeGette received a Mostly True rating for her claim that women ""receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns"" because she did not use the ""same work as men"" qualifier. 
  
The 23-cent gap has been challenged by economists and policy groups who say the gap is much smaller when factors such as education, type of job and experience level are considered. 
  
This week, the Independent Women’s Forum, a conservative nonprofit group, posted a video about the gap, calling it inaccurate, and saying that proposed laws to close the perceived gap will lead to undue government regulation. 
  
In October, a study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equity for women and girls, analyzed men’s and women’s earnings one year after graduation. 
Study authors maintain that a wage gap for almost all occupations still exists. When taking qualifiers such as education, training, age and parental status into account, women in 2009 still earned 6.6 percent less than men, the study concluded. 
  
This unexplained gap could be attributed to gender discrimination and women’s ability to negotiate salaries, the report found. An AAUW researcher noted that the wage gap can grow as careers progress. 
  
How much of a pay gap between women and men is due to discrimination against women is unclear, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""But a fair-minded person should certainly take account of hours worked per week before calculating the earnings penalty of being a women. It is less clear how much of the occupational difference, the job tenure difference and the work experience difference between women and men we should take into account."" 
  
Our conclusion: 
  
Colbert Busch said that in South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to men’s earnings. 
  
PolitiFact has examined similar wage gap claims several times over the past couple of years. During that time, the data used to make the claims has been reviewed extensively. Each time, we have noted that some studies reporting the larger gaps do not take into account several variables impacting pay, including types of occupations, age of employee, education and training, hours worked and duration on the job. 
  
That is the case with the claim made by Colbert Busch. 
  
Making such a blanket statement without the context of the qualifiers is disingenuous. 
  
There is a wage gap between men and women. She is right about that. 
  
But most studies indicate it tends to diminish when other factors are considered. Colbert Busch’s claim is accurate, but it leaves out substantial context that would give the reader a different impression.

Lon Burnam says rejecting expansion would send $9 billion of Texans’ taxes to Medicaid in other states
","
State Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, said the Texas House was throwing money away when it voted March 4, 2013, to reject federal Medicaid expansion dollars. 
In a press release, Burnam said refusing to expand would accomplish nothing except to ""send $9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans to other states to insure their working poor."" 
Medicaid is a federal-state insurance program that targets children and low-income families, elderly and disabled people, pregnant women and children in foster care. Under the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare), the federal government would pay all costs for the first three years for Texas and other states that extend Medicaid to households making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. 
To offset such federal costs, congressional Democrats wrote new taxes into the law, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry, alongside a number of measures intended to reduce the growth of Medicare spending. 
Texas officials have estimated that from 2014 through 2023, the state would receive $79 billion in federal money to cover the adults who are newly eligible under the higher income limit. Because states begin paying a share of the costs after three years (gradually rising from 5 percent in 2017 to 10 percent in 2020 and beyond), Texas would chip in an estimated $8.8 billion over ten years from its own general revenue fund. 
Burnam spokesman Conor Kenny told us by email that Burnam’s number was based on another state estimate for the same 10 years: $90.6 billion, which includes the $79 billion in Medicaid expansion money plus $11.6 billion the feds will send Texas to help cover people who are already Medicaid-eligible but not enrolled. Those folks will have to sign up for insurance plans when Obamacare’s individual mandate kicks in Jan. 1, 2014. 
Burnam’s $9 billion figure, Kenny said, was the average amount of federal money coming in per year ($90.6 billion divided by 10) calculated in Feb. 6, 2013, legislative testimony from the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities. 
Both the $79 billion in expansion money and the $90.6 billion total for expansion plus newly-enrolled-but-already-eligible Texans are 2012 estimates from the state Health and Human Services Commission, which administers Medicaid. Spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman sent us a March 8, 2013, presentation from the agency and a spreadsheet with estimated year-by-year federal and state costs. 
Burnam also relied, Kenny said, on part of Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer’s Jan. 14, 2013, state-of-the-state speech, in which she said not expanding Medicaid would mean that $2 billion of ""Arizona’s tax dollars would simply be passed to another state – generating jobs and providing health care for citizens in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico or any other expansion state."" Her office did not respond to our inquiries about Brewer’s basis for the statements. Kenny also said that he had talked to Edwin Park, vice president of health policy at the liberal Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
First, a misconception: Burnam referred to ""$9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans,"" much as Brewer referred to $2 billion in Arizona tax dollars. But the money a state gets won’t come directly from the federal taxes its own residents paid. 
Experts told us that federal payments to states for expanding their Medicaid programs -- some 25 states had signed on when Burnam spoke -- will come out of the U.S. Treasury, where everybody’s tax dollars go to mingle. So in a general sense, Texas dollars might be a part of any Medicaid expansion payment to any state. There’s just no telling which paid-in-Texas federal taxes go where. 
And money won’t be sent from one state to another, the experts told us. In fact, there’s no dedicated dollar amount for Medicaid expansion. Rather, the states will be sent federal money for new participants as they come in. 
We spoke with two of Burnam’s sources, Park and Center for Public Policy Priorities associate director Anne Dunkelberg, as well as two Washington, D.C., groups -- the American Action Forum, a conservative think-tank, and Families USA, a liberal group that pushed for the health care law. 
Dunkelberg contrasted Medicaid expansion with the federal Children's Health Insurance Program, in which states do get block grants. Twice, Texas lawmakers have decided against taking the CHIP money, she told us by phone, and ""those funds really did get redistributed to other states."" 
Similarly, Park told us the Medicaid expansion funding is ""not a fixed pot of money."" Whether one state chooses to participate or not does not affect the other states or the money they receive, he said. 
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Foundation and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told us by phone that when revenues are collected from the new Obamacare taxes, that money is not set aside. 
""Every single one of those dollars flows into the federal treasury"" with other tax revenues, Holtz-Eakin said, and ""there’s no link"" to the dollars that states will then receive in the Obamacare spending programs. ""They’re all stirred together,"" he said. 
Spokesman David Lemmon of Families USA told us by phone that any projected Medicaid expansion money Texas turns down ""is not redistributed to other states."" But if Texas does opt out, he said, ""certainly Texas taxpayers are not able to benefit from that money."" 
Similarly, Dunkelberg said it’s ""true that Texas taxpayers are helping to fund the expansions of all the other states. And we don’t get any break on our federal taxes (if we decide) not to participate in Medicaid expansion."" 
Our ruling 
Burnam said that if Texas fails to expand Medicaid, $9 billion of Texas taxpayers’ money would flow toward insuring the working poor in other states. Burnam meant $9 billion per year over 10 years, though that clarification didn’t appear in his press release. 
But: 
Texans’ tax dollars aren’t handled separately from others in this program. 
What Texas decides won’t affect how much money is available for other states. 
Burnam’s $9 billion is based on a $90 billion ten-year estimate that includes $11.6 billion Texas would get whether it expands Medicaid or not.

Are babies born in Coos County twice as likely to be born to smokers?
","
Legislation to let counties set additional taxes on tobacco squeaked through the Oregon House last week on a 31-to-29 vote. 
Lawmakers opposed to higher taxes said it wasn’t fair to squeeze more revenue out of cigarette addicts. Lawmakers in support said smoking is a public health hazard and that local governments should be allowed to assert local control. 
Freshman Rep. Caddy McKeown, D-Coos Bay, said she too struggled with aspects of House Bill 2870, but then reeled off some disturbing statistics courtesy of the Coos County public health department, including this one: 
""A baby in Coos County is two times as likely to be born to a mother who is someone who used tobacco during her pregnancy as is the average baby born in Oregon or the U.S.,"" she said. 
Twice as many smokers? What’s up, Coos County? Studies show that prenatal smoking puts babies at greater risk of low birth weight, respiratory illnesses and other potential health problems. 
State and county numbers 
McKeown’s office shared a 2011-12 annual report on the status of public health in Coos County. 
We also checked with Stephen Brown, a tobacco prevention program coordinator at Coos County. Figures from 2011 birthsshow that in Coos County, 23.4 percent of mothers used tobacco while pregnant. Statewide, the figure was 10.7 percent. That’s more than double. 
In real numbers, that means 135 of 577 babies born in Coos County in 2011 were born to smokers. Statewide, 4,795 of 45,136 babies born in 2011 were born to smokers. 
Brown says that studies show that people are less likely to smoke the higher their educational attainment. Prenatal tobacco use is greater among women who don’t finish high school than among women who graduate from college. People living in poorer households are more likely to smoke. Coos County lags the state in educational achievement and in per capita income. 
Certainly Coos is not the only county to post rates at least twice Oregon’s. Douglas and Josephine counties posted rates at 25 percent, and Lake County was the highest at 26.5 percent. Those are also rural counties similar to Coos in income and education demographics. Multnomah County was at 6.8 percent. 
National average 
A national average is harder to come by, mainly because not all states use the same ""certificate of live birth"" forms to collect prenatal information. The Annie E. Casey Foundation calculates a U.S. figure of 9 percent for births in 2010, but the number leaves out about 20 states. Oregon, which was included, was at 11 percent. 
Still, the average is backed up by a hefty Oregon Health Authoritydocument, which reports prenatal tobacco use across the country went from 13.6 percent in 1996 to 10.7 percent in 2005. In Oregon, the percentage of women smoking during pregnancy also dropped during that period, from 17.8 percent to 12.4 percent. 
The ruling: 
We can say with certainty that babies born in Coos County are twice as likely to have mothers who smoked during pregnancy than the average baby in Oregon. That also looks to be the case using older or incomplete national averages. We rate the statement True.

Expert says infant mortality rate near University Circle exceeds that of some Third World countries
","
Public health experts consider the infant mortality rate an important indicator of a community's well-being. It is one of the factors that helped land Cuyahoga County in the bottom third of Ohio counties in overall health in a national study released last month by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 
Cuyahoga, with its major health centers, performed well again on access to primary care in the annual study. But major health centers can't compensate for poverty and the other, often related stressors that contribute to the high infant mortality of Northeast Ohio. 
Ohio's rate of infant mortality -- 7.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in the first year of life -- is 11th-worst in the nation, said a public radio report on the subject on WCPN's ""Sound of Ideas."" 
The most recent rate reported for Cuyahoga County was a dismal 9.1 deaths, according to the Ohio Department of Health, and the average from 2006 to 2010 was 9.7. 
Among the experts who discussed the subject on WCPN was Dr. Michele Walsh, division chief of neonatology at Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital. 
""Within the three miles surrounding the University Circle area, infant mortality exceeds some Third World countries,"" she said, ""and that is an embarrassment and cannot be allowed to continue."" 
PolitiFact Ohio agreed that the rate would be alarming. We wanted to know more. 
We called Dr. Walsh, who said her statement about the city reflects data from a study conducted by researchers at Case Western Reserve University Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences. 
Its extensive research database is called NEO CANDO, for Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing. It draws from a wide variety of sources 
that include the U.S. Census and the Ohio Department of Health, and it can break down information by neighborhood. 
For worldwide rates of infant mortality, we checked the authoritative CIA ""World Factbook."" 
The term ""Third World,"" which once designated countries not aligned politically with the West or the Communist bloc East, generally refers to underdeveloped and developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Many poorer nations use the term to describe themselves. For our fact-check, we used the listings of Third World countries, as measured by poverty and low human development, from the Nations Online independent reference portal. 
To stay within three miles of University Circle, we looked at data for neighborhoods on Cleveland's East Side. 
We found that two neighborhoods, Hough and Mount Pleasant, had infant mortality rates above 27 per 1,000 -- worse than in North Korea, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Samoa, Maldives or the Gaza Strip. 
Two other neighborhoods -- Kinsman (with an infant mortality rate of 31 per 1,000) and South Collinwood (29) -- had infant mortality worse than was reported in Zimbabwe. 
Infant mortality in the University Circle neighborhood, according to the NEO CANDO database, was slightly above 69 deaths per 1,000 live births. That exceeds the rate in countries that include, among others, Bangladesh, Haiti, Burma, Cameroon, Djibouti, Sudan, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Rwanda and Uganda. 
That number struck us as both anomalous and staggering. We looked for an explanation and got one from researcher Richard Stacklin of the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. 
The rate for University Circle, he said, reflected the neighborhood’s small statistical base in 2009 of 43 births and 3 infant deaths.  He said its most recent three-year average -- a preferable statistic for the neighborhood because it better accounts for fluctuations -- is 18.6 deaths, a figure he noted is still unacceptable and almost double the countywide rate. 
The average rate worldwide, according to the ""World Factbook,"" is 39.4 per 1,000. 
The book estimates infant mortality in the United States in 2012 as 6 deaths per 1,000 births -- worse than the average for nations of the European Union and worse than countries including Australia, South Korea and Cuba. 
Its figures show that some Third World nations have infant mortality rates that are exceeded by those for some neighborhoods within three miles of University Circle.

NH Democrats say they left the state budget with surplus and GOP left it with defecit
","
  
Just like baseball, New Hampshire's budget season is just getting under way. But even before legislators got their first swing at this year’s spending proposal, political leaders were already checking the score. 
N.H. Democratic Party leaders took aim at the current 2012-13 budget on Twitter last month. They contrasted the Republican-led spending plan, crafted two years ago by Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley and former House Speaker William O’Brien, with the 2010-11 budget, passed by Democratic Gov. John Lynch and Senate President Maggie Hassan, the current governor. 
""NH FACT: Lynch/Hassan 2010/11 budget ended in $18m surplus,"" Democratic chairman Ray Buckley tweeted Friday, March 29th. ""OBrien/Bradley 2012/13 budget has $40m deficit."" 
With nearly three months left in the 2013 Fiscal Year, the budget projections are constantly on the move. But, the 2010-11 figures have been set for a while. So, we decided to go back and check the record books. 
To start, we approached Democratic Party officers, who pointed to a PolitiFact check we conducted back in August looking into the 2010-11 budget. 
At the time, we checked a claim by the New Boston Republican Committee, that suggested Democrats had built up a deficit of $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2010-11. 
As we noted then, the $1 billion figure came from a report released in January 2011 by the Legislative Budget Assistant, a nonpartisan office that reviews the state spending plans. The report, intended as a point-in-time projection rather than a final budget tally, identified $845 million in spending that could have posed concerns for the new legislature if all fiscal policies remained the same. 
""I was talking about appropriations that would go up by virtue of formula driven things,"" Jeff Pattison, the budget assistant, said at the time. ""Things that would happen if nothing was done about them."" 
But, state legislators, required by law to balance the budget, made the necessary adjustments, and by the end of the year, they had built a $17.7 million surplus, according to the state’s annual report. 
Some political leaders argued at the time the numbers were skewed because lawmakers relied heavily on borrowing (more than $130 million, according to some reports) and on one-time federal funds ($80 million-plus) to balance the budget, leaving a ""structural deficit"" heading into the next budget cycle. 
That year, Lynch, Hassan and other Democratic leaders removed the State Liquor Commission off state spending books by putting its $90 million budget in an independent enterprise account, and they saved another $90 million by issuing state-backed bonds rather than paying cash to cover school construction costs. 
Still, others maintained the surplus came through a range of budget cuts and tax hikes common to the budget cycle. They cut more than $233 million, laying off nearly 200 state workers, closing some programs and making the university system return $25 million in state aid, among other actions. 
Either way, the $17.7 million surplus officially left from the 2010-11 budget roughly matches the Democratic Party’s $18 million claim. So, Buckley is on target on the first part of his claim. 
Now, on to the 2012-13 budget. 
To support their $40 million deficit claim, Democratic Party officers directed us toward a Fiscal Year 2013 snapshot, released last month by the budget assistant’s office. 
As Buckley suggested, the worksheet, released March 12, did report a $40.7 million revenue shortfall, most of which comes from shortages in Medicaid Expansion Tax revenues ($36.8 million). But, like the 2011 report, Pattison, the budget assistant, intended this release only as a point-in-time projection to give legislators an idea of what could happen in the months to follow. 
The projections change frequently, Pattison said. ""I’m not saying it changes on a daily basis, but it can change fairly quickly,"" he warned last week. 
By the end of March, the projections had changed course. 
According to a monthly revenue report released Tuesday, April 2, by the Department of Administrative Services, state officials closed March with revenues up $26.6 million over the initial budget projections. 
If those numbers stand, that would leave the 2012-13 budget facing a $14 million deficit, and further revenues could level the spending by the end of the fiscal year, said Linda Hodgdon, commissioner of the administrative services department, who authored the March report. 
""We're hopeful that because March was such a good month, April will also be a good month,"" Hodgdon said. ""If we have another good month, it could potentially close the gap. That’s what I’m hoping."" 
Our Ruling 
Buckley and the Democratic Party are right on with their claim about the 2010-11 budget. That year, lawmakers closed the spending plan with an $18 million surplus. And, though the numbers change constantly, Buckley, the Democratic chairman, is on target regarding the 2012-13 spending plan, as well. Or he was at the time, anyway. 
Recent reports show the projections have changed, as they will continue to do throughout the rest of the fiscal year, But those numbers, released this week, were not available yet March 29 when Buckley tweeted his claim. Instead, Buckley deferred to a March 12 report, which showed the $40 million deficit. 
Comparing final state budget figures to a point-in-time snapshot is not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, since this budget will likely end with a different deficit than Buckley claims. But, at the time of his tweet, Buckley’s numbers were right on the money. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/11/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-democrats-say-they-left-state-budget-surplus-an/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims Corzine, other administrations raided state unemployment fund
","
New Jersey’s fiscal history is not going to repeat itself, if Chris Christie has anything to say about it. 
In particular, that means no more raiding the state’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund to plug budget holes – a practice he alleges occurred during the Corzine and other administrations. 
""The people who were running the budget, in the Corzine years, decided to steal from the unemployment trust fund. … As did other Governors before,"" Christie said on the March 25 ‘Ask the Governor’ radio program on NJ 101.5-FM. ""We simply don’t do that, haven’t done it, and won’t permit it."" 
There’s a degree of accuracy to what the governor said but for this fact check, it’s equally important to look at what he didn’t say. 
First, some background on the state’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. 
Payroll taxes paid by employees and employers comprise the fund. That money is used to build up reserves in good economic times so unemployment benefits can be paid during economic downturns. The fund pays unemployment benefits to people who worked in New Jersey. 
But that’s not what happened, especially after both parties spent years diverting fund money to cover charity care payments to hospitals, ultimately reaching $4.6 billion by 2005. Then the recession hit and unemployment claims started pouring in around 2008. 
The fund was near empty by March 2009 and New Jersey had to borrow more than $1 billion from the federal government to cover expenses. That loan is on track to be repaid by March 2014, said Frank W. Haines III, assistant legislative budget and finance officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. 
About a year ago, state Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) claimed an ""unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton"" was largely responsible for the frequent fund diversions, but PolitiFact New Jersey ruled that claim Mostly False. While both political parties were responsible for diversions, the OLS told us that about 67 percent of the roughly $4.6 billion in total diverted funds resulted from legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature between 1992 and 1997. 
So where does Corzine come in? Despite Christie’s claim, Corzine was the first governor in years to stop diverting money from the fund. But he authorized a $260 million payment into the fund so claims could be paid, as well as borrowing from the federal government. 
Money from the fund has not been diverted since fiscal year 2006, which was actually calendar year 2005, Haines explained. The governor at that time was Richard Codey, not Corzine. Codey served 10 months as interim governor after Democrat Jim McGreevey resigned. Corzine became governor in January 2006. 
So Christie is wrong to pin diversions on Corzine, but Corzine still bears some blame, said Michael Drewniak, a Christie spokesman. 
""The Governor has said many times that both parties were guilty of raiding the UI fund; Governor Corzine’s borrowing extended and compounded the problem,"" Drewniak said in an e-mail, noting that Christie was speaking colloquially when he used the word ‘stealing.’ ""There’s been other equal opportunity failures too, pension underfunding comes immediately to mind. The Governor has always said there’s plenty of blame to go around for prior fiscal mismanagement, but he also always emphasizes the need for bipartisanship to fix all those things that set us back."" 
Drewniak also noted that Christie said of the fund’s diversions, ""We simply don’t do that, haven’t done it, and won’t permit it."" 
That’s probably because the governor supported a ballot question giving taxpayers the say-so for future diversions. Taxpayers approved the measure in 2010. As a result, state law forbids the diversions Christie claims he ""won’t permit."" 
Our ruling 
Christie said, ""The people who were running the budget, in the Corzine years, decided to steal from the unemployment trust fund. … As did other Governors before. We simply don’t do that, haven’t done it, and won’t permit it."" 
The governor’s claim contains an element of truth, that other administrations have diverted money from the fund, but his hasn’t. The reason? State law now forbids such diversions – something he didn’t say. Although Christie was speaking colloquially about ‘stealing’ from the fund, he was wrong when he pegged diversions to the Corzine administration. The last time such a diversion occurred was when Codey was interim governor. We rate Christie’s statement Mostly False.

Dick Cheney disputes Margaret Thatcher’s famous ‘no time to go wobbly’ quote
","
It’s one of Margaret Thatcher’s most memorable quotes, spoken to President George H.W. Bush after Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait: ""Remember, George, this is no time to go wobbly."" 
It evokes the image of a weak-spined Bush, bolstered by the Iron Lady. 
Dick Cheney, the defense secretary who would become vice president, recently called it ""an old wives’ story."" 
And we said: Really? 
Cheney fondly recalled the former British prime minister, who died Monday, in an interview that day with Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren. 
Van Susteren: ""But there's that famous quote where, apparently, she told President Bush 41 not to go wobbly."" 
Cheney: ""That's not true."" 
Van Susteren: ""That's not true?"" 
Cheney: ""Not true, no."" 
Van Susteren: ""That's a falsehood."" 
Cheney: ""An old wives' story. There was never any doubt about what the president was doing. He didn't need any bucking up."" 
The same day, the Christian Science Monitor published: ""Margaret Thatcher: 'This is no time to go wobbly' and other memorable quotes."" The New York Times mentioned the line in her obituary. 
Is the quote just ""an old wives’ story""? 
Bush and Thatcher 
We’ve reviewed speeches, transcripts, books and more, and we can tell you: Bush and Thatcher agree that she said it. 
Bush himself publicly told the story in a 1991 speech as he awarded Thatcher the Medal of Freedom. He mentioned it in a 1998 book. She mentioned it in her 1993 memoirs and in a Frontline interview. 
But the popular account of her admonition that ""this is no time to go wobbly"" has taken on a life of its own — one doesn’t match Bush and Thatcher’s accounts. 
In Bush and Thatcher’s versions, it happened during a phone call three weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
The leaders disagreed about how to respond to ships leaving Iraq in defiance of U.N. sanctions. The Bush administration, at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State Jim Baker, wanted to delay a few days to win support from the Soviet Union through the U.N. Security Council — a historic collaboration Baker later said marked the true end of the Cold War. 
Thatcher, on the other hand, urged prompt action. 
Bush says in his 1998 book she warned him ""this is no time to go wobbly"" around Aug. 22 as he explained why they would delay using force until they got specific authorization from the U.N. on Aug. 25. Thatcher says in her 1993 memoir she warned ""this was no time to go wobbly"" as he explained on Aug. 26 why, even with new U.N. authorization to enforce sanctions, they would let a ship through. 
But some accounts place the quote earlier — on Aug. 2, the same day that Iraq invaded. That timing suggests Thatcher bolstered Bush’s early response, such as his declaration Aug. 5 on the White House lawn that ""this will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait."" 
In one account, she made the remarks on Aug. 2  in ""an aside at an Aspen Institute conference,"" as reported by the Christian Science Monitor. 
In another, she made the comment on that same trip to Aspen, Colo., but in the vacation home of diplomat Henry Catto, according the New York Times, which cited Catto’s autobiography. 
But those accounts don’t match the recollection of Philip Zelikow, a National Security Council staffer under Bush, or of Bush’s national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, who spoke about it in 1996. Both were part of the Aspen trip. 
""The ‘wobbly’ comment has indeed been widely misunderstood and long ago became a factoid,"" Zelikow told PolitiFact. 
Zelikow, now a history professor and associate dean at the University of Virginia, recalled the encounter as part of an oral history project for the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. 
""I remember her using that line later in the context of arguments over the rules of engagement in the embargo and so forth,""  Zelikow said in April 2000. ""There was an argument about whether we should be willing to fire on Iraqi ships, and there were a number of these fairly complicated conversations later in August and then in September."" 
In any telling, Thatcher warned Bush against wobbliness in August or September 1990. The precise date — and, especially, whether he needed such advice — is a matter of some dispute. 
But by March 1991, the phrase had entered White House lore, the president himself said. 
""Those who work with me in the White House know we use that expression often and have used it during some troubling days,"" Bush said in his medal speech for Thatcher. ""And never, ever will it be said that Margaret Thatcher went wobbly."" 
Our ruling 
Cheney called ""that famous quote"" nothing but ""an old wives' story."" But Bush and Thatcher themselves recount a phone call near the end of August 1990 in which Thatcher admonishes ""this is no time to go wobbly."" 
Popular accounts of the ""wobbly"" quote shift the statement to the beginning of August, giving it an early starring role that several insiders dispute. 
Instead, Bush and Thatcher describe a later, narrower discussion about when and how to enforce U.N. sanctions. Still, they agree she made the comment, and Bush says it became a common expression around the White House. We rate Cheney’s claim False.",/factchecks/2013/apr/10/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-margaret-thatcher-go-wobbly/

Pasco County has second highest homeless population in Florida, advocate claims
","
For Tampa Bay residents, the state’s homeless crisis hits home harder than you may think. 
Discussion of a measure that would allow people applying for or renewing driver’s licenses or motor vehicle registrations to make $1 donations to homeless outreach programs sparked an interesting claim from a Pasco County resident. 
""Pasco County has the second highest population of homeless in all of Florida,"" said Brian Anderson, a homeless advocate from Hudson, on April 9, 2013, before the Senate Rules Committee. 
Anderson, 30, is a 10-year Army veteran who moved to Hudson in May 2012 to attend Saint Leo University and study social work. He said he just received approval from the Pasco County Commission to hold a ""Stand Down"" event for homeless veterans transitioning into civilian life at Veterans Memorial Park in September 2013. 
""We have an epidemic,"" he said of homelessness. 
PolitiFact Florida was skeptical of Pasco being the No. 2 county in Florida for homelessness. Wouldn’t the number of homeless people be higher in counties with substantially more people, such as Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach? 
To find out, we consulted the 2012 report of the Florida Council on Homelessness, which makes recommendations to the governor and Legislature for addressing the prevalence of homeless adults and children in Florida. The latest report, submitted June 2012, says families with children are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. 
In 2012, local homeless coalitions counted 54,300 homeless people living in shelters or on the street on one day and one night in January. 
Before we get into the data, we’ll stress that the totals are imperfect. Not every county, especially rural counties, has the resources to spread out and tally homeless residents. 
Still, the report offers the best snapshot we have of how to count the homeless. 
The homeless count is required every two years by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to receive grants for addressing the homeless problem. Using the 2012 report, we found the homeless counts for the biggest counties in the state. In the chart below, we added in the county’s estimated 2012 population as a point of comparison using U.S. Census Bureau data.

""It just doesn’t make sense for a county with a population under 500,000,"" he said. ""It’s a hard statement to comprehend."" 
For the most part, Pasco’s homeless live in the woods, Romagnoli said. Law enforcement advised volunteers not to go as far back into the woods to conduct their count in 2013 because of a couple recent murders, so Romagnoli expects the county’s 2013 total will be lower. 
Rep. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, said he has noticed an increase in people reaching out to his office in recent years because they lost their house. ""It’s surprising to me,"" he said when told about the state’s high homeless count. 
The higher-than-expected figure may have more to do with how aggressive local coalitions and their volunteers are in getting accurate figures, said Tom Pierce, executive director of the state’s Office on Homelessness. The coalitions need to do the legwork to figure out where the homeless are in advance of the biennial count, he said. 
A more accurate way to describe the figure may be ""reported homeless population."" 
""It’s obviously fraught with its own limitations, but it’s the best we’ve got,"" Pierce said. 
As for Miami-Dade, the county has been effective getting more homeless people into permanent housing units. Miami-Dade gets more money from the federal government because it raises more money for homeless initiatives from a 1 percent sales tax on food and alcoholic beverage purchases at restaurants and bars. Miami-Dade passed the tax in 1993. 
""Our community has had no political will to advance that,"" said Lesa Weikel, Homeless Coalition of Hillsborough County spokeswoman. 
She wanted to dispute a myth that homeless people come to Florida from other states because of the warm weather. In 2009 and 2011, volunteers asked homeless people in what state did they become homeless. In 2009, 88 percent said Florida. In 2011, it was 90 percent. 
Pasco County has many programs aimed at curbing the homeless program, such as offering hotel vouchers for families, placing people in jobs suited for each person's abilities and criminal record, and offering bus rides to work, said Rev. Jim Campbell, president of the Coalition for the Homeless of Pasco County. 
Our ruling 
A homeless advocate named Brian Anderson came to Tallahassee to support a bill that would allow people at the DMV to check a box indicating they wanted to donate $1 to homeless programs. Anderson, of Hudson, evoked his home county in his plea, saying ""Pasco County has the second highest population of homeless in all of Florida."" 
Anderson accurately cites the state’s 2012 county-by-county homeless population report. However, there is enough skepticism about the count itself that we think it’s best to proceed with caution. 
As such, we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/10/brian-anderson/pasco-county-has-states-second-highest-homeless-po/

Frederica Wilson says she stopped a Broward airport tower closure
","
When the budget sequester started in March, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that it would soon shutter 149 airport towers nationwide. 
Enter U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, the South Florida Democrat best known for her sequined hat and matching ensembles. Wilson is also famous for her passion -- whether speaking out for inner city children, Haitian refugees, or, in this case, air traffic controllers facing layoffs. 
On April 4, Wilson held a press conference to protest the threatened closing of the North Perry airport in Pembroke Pines. Wilson gave a rousing speech -- sometimes over the noise of airplanes flying overhead -- against the FAA’s plan. 
Wilson said fighting the sequester was ""the civil rights movement of 2013 ... It's going to hurt people, people will die, people will suffer, people will lose their homes, people will lose their tax break."" 
The next day, the FAA announced that it would delay closures slated for Florida and other states until June 15. Lots of politicians expressed relief including U.S. Reps Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, and C.W. Bill Young, R-Indian Shores. 
But Wilson’s press statement had a different tenor: she took credit for the FAA’s decision though only for the airport in Pembroke Pines: 
""Congresswoman Frederica Wilson successfully postpones closure of the North Perry airport tower,"" announced the headline. 
The press release continued: ""Following the Congresswoman’s month-long campaign to save the tower, which included fact finding, speeches, official requests, and legislation, Congresswoman Wilson was notified, this morning, by FAA officials that the tower had been granted a temporary reprieve from closure....""   
There is no dispute that Wilson fought the closure and a day after her press conference, the FAA announced the closure delay. But should she get credit here for prompting the FAA to act? 
The lawsuits against the FAA 
Soon after the FAA made its announcement in March that it intended to close airports, the airports began filing lawsuits. About 20 were filed and plaintiffs argued that the closures would jeopardize safety. 
The clock was ticking: Closures were set to start April 7, prompting lawyers to start filing emergency motions. 
We interviewed Peter Kirsch, an attorney who represents multiple plaintiffs. He said plaintiff lawyers from three firms had conference calls with federal officials on April 5. The lawyers reached an agreement in the early afternoon and that led to the FAA’s announcement that it would delay closures until June 15, Kirsch said. 
""The FAA decision was part of an agreement among the lawyers that the FAA would delay the closure date if we would agree to withdraw our emergency motion for a stay, which is like a preliminary injunction or restraining order,"" Kirsch told PolitiFact Florida. 
On Friday afternoon, the FAA issued a press release stating that it was delaying tower closures nationwide. ""This additional time will allow the agency to attempt to resolve multiple legal challenges to the closure decisions."" 
Kirsch said several factors were pressing on FAA administrators. ""I think they recognized that they would not accomplish the closure of these towers in an orderly fashion  .... There is no question that this particular dispute, this battle is being played out administratively, being played out in courts, and being played out in Congress. No one of those is independent of the others."" 
Airport officials told PolitiFact Florida that they were stunned at the speed that the FAA was attempting to move. When an airport has a modest construction project, the FAA requires a safety plan that can take six months to complete, said Lawrence Krauter, chief executive officer of an airport in Spokane, Wash., that filed one of the lawsuits. But due to the sequester, the FAA was attempting to pull off a major nationwide change even faster. 
That the FAA wasn’t ready to pull this off was evident in a conference call between the FAA and airport officials nationwide less than a week before the closures were slated to start. The FAA couldn’t answer basic questions about the timing of closures and procedures for local airports taking over, Krauter told PolitiFact. 
""I don’t think there was enough time that the FAA could respond to all of those things. I think they made good decision step back,"" Krauter said. ""I think that call was pivotal in establishing there were some fundamental issues and there wasn’t time to coordinate."" 
Wilson on tower closures and sequestration 
Shortly after she issued her press release on April 5, we spoke to Wilson by telephone to ask why she was taking credit. 
Wilson said she spoke with Roderick Hall, FAA Assistant Administrator for Government and Industry Affairs, about the cuts that morning after the FAA had threatened to lock the North Perry tower if Broward didn’t sign an agreement. 
""We gave them a threat,"" Wilson said. ""The threat was if they came to shut the tower down I would personally be there to stop them. ... I told him I am a protester of the civil rights movement. He said, ‘Congresswoman I am aware of your advocacy.""’ 
She said Hall called back later in the day and told her about the decision to delay the closures. 
""He said ‘Congresswoman go ahead, you can take the credit. It's from pressure, pressure pressure from Congresspeople like yourself,"" Wilson said. ""He didn’t mention anything about lawsuits."" 
Hall didn’t respond to messages we left on his cellphone, and the FAA pointed us to their press release that didn’t mention Wilson or congressional pressure. 
Four members of Wilson’s staff, including legislative director Justin Talbot Zorn, joined PolitiFact Florida on a conference call Monday to explain why they believe Wilson deserved the credit. 
Wilson’s staff said that from the moment she learned about the closures at North Perry and Opa-Locka she had fought them and sent two  letters to the FAA protesting their plan. Then she held the press conference Thursday, April 4. 
On Friday, Wilson’s office was contacted by Kent George, Broward County’s aviation director. George’s staff had received an agreement from the FAA Thursday night. The FAA gave the county a deadline of 3 p.m. to sign the agreement, though George said it wasn’t clear why the FAA wanted to charge $5,280 a month. (The county had a separate agreement to pay the workers.) 
""They said if the agreement wasn’t signed they intended to change the locks on the tower at midnight on the 6th,"" George told PolitiFact. That’s when George’s office contacted local members of Congress. 
Wilson got on the phone with Hall to protest the closure and ""he said he see what he could do by 3 p.m,"" Zorn said. 
Hall called back later that afternoon, said Zorn, who was in on the call with Wilson and recounted it for PolitiFact. 
""This second call, he said, ‘Thank you so much for your call this morning. We understand how important this is and how passionate you are about this. I have good news for you...’ "" he said. Then Hall told Wilson about the delay. ""So you can claim this as a win. You can take as much credit as you want to take for this."" 
The scope of the phone call was only about North Perry -- Hall didn’t discuss the lawsuits or the FAA’s nationwide decision. 
So Wilson did take credit for North Perry and issue the press release. 
Pressure from Congress 
We can’t be certain exactly what was said between Hall and Wilson but even if we assume that he did give her the sense that she could take credit, does it seem reasonable that Wilson’s pressure caused the FAA’s decision? By that Friday, the FAA was facing lawsuits nationwide and protest letters from politicians across the country. 
Airport officials we interviewed say bipartisan congressional pressure could have played a role, but there is no dispute that the litigation was the driving force. 
""I think the litigation, I think the media coverage, as you know, was pretty intensive, and certainly calls and letters from Congress have an impact on any federal agency,"" said Spencer Dickerson, president of the American Association of Airport Executives, which sued the FAA said. 
Our ruling 
In a press release Wilson took credit for the FAA’s decision to postpone closing an airport tower in her district. 
""Congresswoman Frederica Wilson successfully postpones closure of the North Perry airport tower,"" stated the headline. The press release also stated ""Following the Congresswoman’s month-long campaign to save the tower, which included fact finding, speeches, official requests, and legislation, Congresswoman Wilson was notified, this morning, by FAA officials that the tower had been granted a temporary reprieve from closure...."" 
The press release can leave readers with the misleading impression of cause and effect: Wilson protested for a month, and the FAA caved and postponed this particular airport tower closure. But there was no separate FAA decision for the North Perry tower. 
In explaining its nationwide decision, the FAA wrote that the delay would buy it time ""to attempt to resolve multiple legal challenges to the closure decisions."" While congressional pressure nationwide could have played a role in the FAA’s decision, clearly the lawsuits seeking immediate action from the courts was the driving factor. Even if Wilson had ignored the tower battle, the FAA likely would have taken action at North Perry and the other sites. 
We’re not evaluating Wilson’s claim that an FAA official whose job includes fostering relationships with Congress gave her the impression that she deserved credit -- we are evaluating her claim that her actions led to the FAA’s decision. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/apr/10/frederica-wilson/frederica-wilson-says-she-stopped-broward-airport-/

Facebook post ignores caveats in citing Harvard study on gun laws
","
Does having more gun laws in a state result in fewer gun deaths? You would think so if you've seen the recent Facebook posting, created by a group called Anti-Republican Crusaders and shared more than 1,700 times on that and another Facebook page. 
The posting has the Joe Friday character from TV's ""Dragnet"" saying, ""Just the facts, ma'am,"" followed by this headline: ""Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths."" 
There's also a color-coded U.S. map showing the states with the most laws and fewest deaths. 
We wondered if the Harvard study did, in fact, prove that point. 
The Facebook posts send readers to a study published online by JAMA Internal Medicine (not the Journal of the American Medical Association, a separate medical journal, as the post reports). The team led by Eric Fleegler of Harvard and Boston Children's Hospital created a ""legislative strength score"" to gauge which states had more gun laws. Then they compared that to the state-by-state firearms death rate. 
The more gun laws a state had, the lower the rate. 
That may sound conclusive, but there's a huge caveat. As the researchers concluded: ""Our study could not determine cause-and-effect relationships."" 
There could be many other factors, such as the rate of gun ownership or a state’s culture of gun ownership.. 
Curious Facebook readers might have uncovered this if they followed a link to an interview with Fleegler conducted by Robin Young on the March 13, 2013, edition of ""Here & Now,"" the news program produced by WBUR in Boston. Young zeroed in on the same problem, asking if the relevant factor could be a state's gun culture. 
Fleegler acknowledged the point. ""[It] may be true that there are states [where people] don't own a lot of guns, they're OK with passing legislation [and] they have lower rates of firearm deaths,"" he said. 
Dr. Garen Wintemute of the University of California-Davis School of Medicine, was even blunter in a commentary that JAMA Internal Medicine released at the same time. 
When the Fleegler team took into account the amount of gun ownership, ""the association between firearm laws and firearm fatalities essentially disappeared,"" he wrote. 
Another key shortcoming of the study: The scorecard used to assess how many laws a state has ""does not account for variations between states in the specifics of their laws and includes no measure of whether or how effectively the states enforce them."" 
Wintemute noted that while gun laws were almost certainly enacted to reduce criminal violence, their real impact was a reduction in suicide, which ""accounted for 94 percent of the observed decrease in firearm-related mortality."" 
Fleegler, in his ""Here & Now"" interview, noted that suicide was a key factor because when people think of killing themselves, the presence of a gun means they will succeed 85 percent of the time compared to close to 2 percent when they don't have a firearm available. 
In the end, when the Facebook posting says ""Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths,"" it is correctly summarizing one finding of the study. But it leaves out important details and context that argue against the idea that reducing gun deaths is simply a matter of blindly passing more gun laws in each state. 
For that reason, we rate it Half True.

Rep. Sondy Pope says most public school students get less state money than private school students
","
Even before Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his plan to expand school choice, a leading Democratic voice on education warned against spending more on ""unproven and unaccountable"" voucher schools. 
On a per-pupil basis, state backing for choice programs in Milwaukee and Racine already exceeds state funding for the average public school pupil, said state Rep. Sondy Pope (D-Cross Plains). 
""Last session Republicans chose to protect and expand private school vouchers and that came at the expense of public education,"" Pope said in a Jan. 30, 2013 news release noting the GOP-approved cuts to state school aid for public districts. 
Now, Pope said, ""the vast majority of our public school students are receiving less state support than their private voucher peers."" 
She offered statistical proof: ""The average public student receives roughly $4,900 of state general aid while choice students are guaranteed $6,442 in state aid. Over 80% of school districts now receive less than the voucher guaranteed amount."" 
Legislators are reviewing Walker’s 2013-’15 budget plan to increase funding to choice schools while capping overall public school revenue. 
As debate heated up on his plan, Walker contended that even after that increase, choice schools would be getting about half the funding per pupil that public schools get. We rated that Half True, noting problems with his math and methodology. 
Now let’s examine Pope’s claim that the vast majority of public school students are receiving ""less state support than their private voucher peers."" 
Pope's equation 
In evaluating Pope’s claim, one key phrase is ""state support."" 
Pope excludes non-state funding such as local property tax support and federal funding, which typically make up about half of public school district revenue. And she specifically defines ""state support""  as general aid distributed under the state’s equalization formula. 
We found numbers from credible sources that back up her specific claim, but also some problems inherent in the comparison. 
Based on figures reported by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau and the state Department of Public Instruction, just over 81 percent of Wisconsin’s public school districts received less in general state aid per-pupil than the $6,442 amount guaranteed to choice schools if they spend that much. The figures are for 2012-’13. 
Those districts encompass more than 75% of all public school students. 
Pope’s decision to zero in on state general aid fits with her talking points about restoring state general aid cut in the last budget session. 
And talking about general aid allows for a direct comparison with state aid to choice schools because in both cases the aid is unrestricted -- it can be spent on anything in the educational program. General aid is by far the largest source of state aid to schools. 
But her claim gave us a vague feeling of deja vu. 
Let’s go back to that Walker claim, that choice schools would get about half the funding that public schools get -- even after the increases in his budget in per-pupil aid to choice. 
Walker picked the largest possible revenue figure for public schools, one including federal funds, all state aid and local property taxes. Pope, by contrast, uses a much narrower -- if commonly used -- revenue figure for public schools. This explains why their conclusions are so starkly different. 
But some of the same cautions apply to both claims. 
Apples and oranges 
Researchers told us clean comparisons were difficult between the two types of schools. But they thought a better way was to compare public school revenue from state general aid and property taxes vs. the choice school guarantee of $6,442. 
The results of a comparison using that method would be dramatically different than Pope’s way. Statewide, public districts get an average of $9,884 from property taxes and general state aid. 
In fact, in the Walker item, we found that choice school revenue is about 25% lower  than the public-school funding amount on average. (Important disclaimer: a complete comparison is currently impossible.) 
It’s important to note that Pope made clear she was concentrating on the state general aid payments that lawmakers cut, and was not discussing how schools compare when all funding sources are considered. 
However, there are more cautions and caveats even with that approach. 
On top of general aid, public schools also receive state funds for specific programs such as special education and class-size reduction. It’s known as ""categorical aid."" 
If you included that categorical funding, fewer public districts would fall below the $6,442 level. About 67 percent of public districts -- not the claimed more than 80 percent -- are below the choice aid level even with categorical aid included, based on calculations by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. 
The Milwaukee comparison 
Milwaukee Public Schools, we should note, is not one of the ""vast majority"" of districts where public students get less under Pope’s comparison -- or the broader view of including categorical aid. 
Students in Milwaukee Public School in 2011-’12 got $6,442 in general state aid -- the exact same amount of state-guaranteed aid paid out to voucher students there. Milwaukee is home to most of the nearly 25,000 voucher students in the state. 
Finally, there’s a nuance that affects the comparison Pope uses. 
Pope sets up a comparison of ""state support"" to choice and to public schools. But the choice funding of $6,442 per pupil really is a hybrid of state aid and local property taxes. 
It gets paid out 100 percent in state funds, and the state by law is on the hook for that amount (if schools spend to the maximum), so the $6,442 figure is often cited as ""state support."" 
But in reality, property taxes levied by Milwaukee Public Schools are estimated to support 34.7 percent of  the $154.6 million Milwaukee choice program in 2012-’13. Racine property taxpayers also contribute a big chunk to that city’s choice program. 
Here’s how it works: The state offsets a big part of its costs by reducing general aid to Milwaukee and Racine, and in turns allows them to make up the difference by raising local property taxes. MPS officials say, given the size of the reduction, they are compelled to raise the tax to protect education. 
This property tax component is fiercely debated, because Milwaukee Public Schools levies for those funds but by law is not allowed to count those students for purposes of the state’s aid formula. The effect is a shift onto Milwaukee property taxpayers due to the lost state aid. 
The bottom line -- when you take the property taxes into account -- is the state’s estimated share of choice costs for 2012-’13 is $4,207 -- not the full $6,442, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau said in a March 6, 2013 letter to state Sen. Paul Farrow. 
If you use $4,207 as a comparison point, Pope’s result flips -- only 33 percent of public districts get less general aid than that. 
Our rating 
Pope said the ""vast majority of our public school students are receiving less state support than their private voucher peers."" 
As was the case in Walker’s diametrically opposed claim, Pope accurately cites funding figures to make a point. 
But the narrow way she sets up the comparison is both a virtue and a vice, creating a technically accurate statement that leaves too little room for important details necessary to explain such a complex comparison.
