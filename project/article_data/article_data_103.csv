No, Michigan lawmakers didn’t create a framework for microchipping humans
","It sounds like something out of a science fiction story, but some employers are implanting microchips in their employees, prompting some governments to take action. In 2017, a Wisconsin technology company became the first in the U.S. to offer employees microchip implants, which granted them access to the building, their computers and more.  Although the company, Three Square Markets, said it would not use the microchips to track employees, the idea of microchipping humans sparked privacy concerns. In some states, these concerns have led to legislation. As of February, seven states have banned ""mandatory microchipping for any human,"" according to Market Watch. That brings us to Michigan, where lawmakers are considering a bill that would require companies to keep microchip implants voluntary for employees. At the end of June, the state’s House of Representatives passed the bill. But some social media posts turned the legislation on its head, saying the proposed microchipping law would be harmful. One social media user copied the text of a post from the blog Repub.li and shared it on Facebook. ""Despite the massive issues and state of emergency in Michigan the state’s House of Representatives found the time to pass a bill that creates framework for microchipping humans,"" reads the blog post that was copied onto Facebook. The post goes on to acknowledge the bill ""prohibits employers from requiring employees have microchips."" But it also claims employers might be able to make work life more difficult for employees who refuse microchips. ""In some circles this could be seen as a sane step forward by enabling people to choose whether or not they want a chip,"" the blog post reads. ""However, employers could inconvenience non-compliant employees and cause entry and exit delays that might make it less profitable to work somewhere."" Another post shared on Facebook goes further, saying the Michigan House passed a bill to ""Voluntarily Begin Placing Human Implantable Microchips Into The Bodies Of All State Government Employees."" The Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The posts leave out important details about the law, or get parts of it all together wrong. The microchip bill, which is three pages long, is fairly straightforward.  ""A bill to prohibit employers from requiring employees and prospective employees to have devices implanted or otherwise incorporated into their bodies as a condition of employment or any employment benefit,"" the bill reads.  The bill also explicitly prevents employers from discriminating against employees who refuse to have microchips implanted, a point contrary to the blog post’s claim.  The bill — which was sponsored by a Republican — does not create a new ""framework"" to allow employers to microchip employees, as the blog post claims. Instead, it introduces new rules that would prevent employers from making microchips compulsory. It doesn’t single out state government employees. ""Despite this type of technology not quite making its way into our state yet, I wouldn’t be surprised if it becomes a standard business practice statewide within the next few years,"" state Rep. Bronna Kahle, a Republican who represents a southern Michigan district, said after her bill passed. ""We should absolutely take every step possible to get ahead of these devices."" Several news outlets reported on the bill, which passed the House with bipartisan support. The news reports frame the bill as a pre-emptive protection that would allow employees to avoid mandatory microchipping. But some experts said the law fell short because of a provision that would allow employers to require an employee to be microchipped in order to comply with a court order. The bill will need to be passed by the Michigan Senate and signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer before it becomes law. A blog post says a Michigan bill ""creates a framework for microchipping humans"" and allows employers to ""inconvenience"" workers who refuse microchips. Another post says the Michigan House passed a bill to voluntarily begin placing microchips into the bodies of state government employees. The bill, sponsored by a Republican, would require employers to keep any microchip implants strictly voluntary for employees. The bill would also prohibit employers from discriminating against employees who choose not to be microchipped. It does not single out state workers.

Tillis never said restaurant workers shouldn't have to wash their hands
","The novel coronavirus outbreak has prompted renewed attention on controversial comments Thom Tillis made in 2015. Tillis is the Republican incumbent running for U.S. Senate in North Carolina. He faces a challenge from Democrat Cal Cunningham in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. A new TV ad from Majority Forward PAC takes the senator’s old comments and presents them in the context of the pandemic. The ad highlights Tillis’ comments on regulation and hand washing. But it doesn’t play the audio. Instead, a narrator says: ""He doesn’t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands."" An Asheville Citizen-Times headline appears on the screen: ""Tillis: Restaurant workers shouldn't have to wash hands."" That’s a reference to the paper’s article about Tillis’ comments. But did Tillis really say that?  The attack ad is misleading.  Tillis talked about handwashing on Feb. 3, 2015 at an event of the Bipartisan Policy Center. A clip from the event is available on C-SPAN’s website. At the event, Tillis recalled a conversation he had with a friend. He said they were sitting in a Starbucks when an opportunity presented itself to make a point about business regulations in the U.S.  Here’s part of the transcript: ""And at that time we were sitting back at a table that was near the restrooms and one of the employees just came out. She said, ‘For example, don’t you believe that this regulation that requires this gentleman to wash his hands before he serves your food is important, should be on the books?’ I said, as a matter of fact, I think it’s one that I can illustrate the point.  ""I don't have any problem with Starbucks if they choose to opt out of this policy, as long as they post a sign that says, 'We don't require our employees to wash their hands after leaving the restroom.’ The market will take care of that.  ""It's one example — but then let them decide. Now that's probably one where every business that did that would go out of business, but I think it's good to illustrate the point that that's the sort of mentality that we have to have to reduce the regulatory burden on this country."" There’s an important distinction that needs to be made here. Tillis never said restaurant employees shouldn’t be required to wash their hands. Tillis said he would be fine if the government didn’t require employees to wash their hands. Under the fictional scenario Tillis presented, businesses could choose to have a handwashing policy. And if businesses disclosed that they didn’t require employee handwashing, Tillis said they would likely go out of business. In other words, Tillis argued that regulations aren’t needed because market forces would prompt business owners to do the right thing. He offered an opinion on business regulations, not the health benefits of hand washing. Another misleading aspect of the ad is that it mentions Tillis’ handwashing comments in the present tense. The beginning of the ad shows someone washing their hands. A narrator says: ""Everyone does it. Especially now. Well, maybe not everyone."" Then it shows a photo of Tillis. But Tillis clarified his 2015 comments shortly after making them. In an interview with The Hill in 2015, Tillis said his comments weren’t meant to be taken seriously. ""Of course (handwashing) needs to be regulated,"" Tillis said. ""If you noticed it was one of the instances at the very tail end, it was clearly meant as a joke. Even (the moderator) at the end said, 'Well, now I'm not sure I should shake your hand.' It was just fun."" In an interview with HuffPost, he blamed any controversy on a blogger ""without a sense of humor."" It’s also inaccurate to suggest that Tillis hasn’t encouraged handwashing during the pandemic. On April 6, he told Fox 8: ""If we want to get out of this sooner, then everybody in North Carolina needs to make sure they’re staying at home, social distancing, washing their hands, all the things that they’re being asked to do every single day."" He made the same point in a tweet the next day. Asked about the ad, Majority Forward spokeswoman Rachel Irwin said the old Tillis comments are ""fair game."" ""North Carolinians deserve to know that Tillis holds such extreme views, especially during a pandemic when their health and safety are further at risk,"" Irwin said. ""I think health and safety experts would agree that his view is problematic and he should have to answer for it."" The ad says Tillis ""doesn’t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands."" He never said restaurant workers shouldn’t wash their hands. In context, he was saying he didn’t think the government needed to regulate handwashing at restaurants, because customers would stop going if that happened. He later reversed that statement, saying ""of course"" it needs to be regulated.  What’s more, his 2015 comments had nothing to do with the pandemic. During the pandemic, Tillis has held up hand washing as an important public response. The ad is inaccurate, so we rate it False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/25/majority-forward/tillis-never-said-restaurant-workers-shouldnt-have/
"['Michigan', 'Great Lakes News']","
Michigan Gov. Whitmer didn’t defund police and corrections
","As Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer tries to close a gaping budget shortfall, a news outlet in the state accuses her of defunding the police to do so. A July 22 tweet from Great Lakes News, whose news program is broadcast on radio stations across Michigan, claims that the Democratic governor ""defunded the Michigan State Police and the prisons"" with an executive order that ""slashes tens of millions"" from the two departments. ""Defund"" is a nebulous and politically charged term, but it’s not an accurate description of Whitmer’s proposal for closing a $2.2 billion budget gap due largely to the COVID-19 crisis and recession, which have hit Michigan hard. Whitmer did propose funding cuts for the agencies, but the Great Lakes News claim leaves out critical information about her plan. Whitmer’s executive order recommends a reduction of just over $115 million from the State Police and nearly $393 million from the Department of Corrections. Most of the gap in funding will be filled by federal Coronavirus Relief Fund money, $106.8 million of which has been authorized for the State Police and $368.2 million for the Department of Corrections. This leaves budget shortfalls of around $8.27 million for the State Police and around $23.5 million for the Department of Corrections — or about 1% of the funds appropriated for each agency for the current fiscal year.   The state has already imposed a freeze on hiring and discretionary spending as well as one-day-a-week furloughs on most state employees. These measures will help the state achieve nearly $8 million in savings from State Police. So the federal funding replaces about 99% of what Whitmer’s proposal would cut and offsets payroll cuts to the State Police. ""It was definitely more like reimbursing the police than defunding the police,"" said Alex Rossman, external affairs director at the nonpartisan Michigan League for Public Policy, which is advocating for more federal relief for the state and urging Michigan to generate more revenue to address budget shortfalls. ""There certainly should be concern about a revenue crunch coming up, but saying that that is going to impact the police or corrections budget any differently than any other priority currently, there’s no foundation for that assertion,"" Rossman said. Whitmer’s recommendations were included in the plan approved by the state House and Senate appropriations committees, and the Legislature will soon vote on it. Even some Republican state lawmakers took to social media to explain the funding arrangement and challenge the Great Lakes News claim. ""There was not a net reduction in the budgets,"" wrote state Rep. Scott VanSingel. ""In the end, there is no defunding,"" state Rep. Phil Green explained on Facebook. On July 23, Great Lakes News acknowledged that the federal funding will offset Whitmer’s proposed funding cuts for police and corrections, but stood by its original claim of ""defunding."" ""Essentially, the Gov. is defunding the Michigan State Police and the Dept. of Corrections because there’s no guarantee that federal funds will fill the gaps in 2021,"" it said in a tweet. What happens next year The cuts in state funding proposed in the executive order do not single out the Department of State Police. The recommended cuts include around $36.5 million at the Department of Health and Human Services and $26 million at the Department of Transportation. State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor, voted against the proposal in committee, citing concerns that the state does not have a plan to raise additional revenue after federal relief dollars disappear. Members of Congress are currently trying to craft the next coronavirus federal relief packages. Experts argue federal aid to state governments is needed to address the impact of the pandemic-induced recession and fill large budget shortfalls created by the public health crisis. Most states, including Michigan, are required to balance their budgets annually, and the recession has forced states across the country to make significant spending cuts to avoid deficits. But ""as COVID subsides, as a vaccine becomes available, as our economy opens back up, the idea is that it’s poised to rebound,"" Rossman explains. This will help state revenues recover as the economy does. Does Whitmer support defunding the police?  The phrase ""defunding the police"" has come to refer to a range of policies, from redirecting some funding toward community development initiatives to dismantling police agencies altogether. It has served as a shorthand rallying cry for activists demanding police reforms, as well as a political cudgel for conservatives seeking to paint liberals as soft on crime. In a June interview with The Root, Whitmer said that she supports ""the spirit"" of defunding the police. She explained, ""You look at budgets and they’re focused on policing — they should be focused on education, transportation, access to health care, access to skills and leveling the playing field."" Whitmer later told the Detroit Free Press: ""I don’t believe police should be defunded."" Instead, she said, ""we need to rebuild and level the playing field through better schools and better transportation and access to health care."" Our ruling A tweet from Great Lakes News said a Whitmer executive order ""defunded"" the State Police and Department of Corrections. The governor’s proposed cuts are part of an effort to close the budget shortfall the state faces in the current fiscal year. The cuts affect several agencies, but in the case of police and corrections, about 99% of the funds will be offset by federal funding this year, though future budgets remain a concern. Whitmer has said she does not support defunding the police, but supports ""the spirit"" of the movement in calling for more resources for education, transportation and health care.

Fact-checking Biden’s comments on COVID-19 small business closures
","Arriving in face masks and sitting far apart from each other, Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama sat down for their first in-person meeting since the COVID-19 outbreak. A 15-minute video released by Biden’s presidential campaign shows the two men venting about the current handling of the pandemic and reliving their accomplishments over eight years in the White House. They talked about health care access, the summer’s protests against racial inequality and police brutality, and the pandemic’s effect on American businesses. ""There’s already 10,000 businesses that are not likely to open again,"" Biden said, ""and a significant number of small businesses and minority businesses."" The shuttering of 10,000 businesses over a few months is bleak enough. But Biden actually underestimated the pandemic’s toll — by a lot. The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that Biden intended to say 100,000 small businesses were lost, not 10,000. That tracks with a study by researchers at Harvard, the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago, which estimated that over 100,000 small businesses permanently shut down between early March and early May. The data does indicate that Black- and minority-owned businesses have suffered at significant rates. Economists told us it’s difficult to gauge which businesses closed for good, especially in the middle of an unyielding pandemic.  ""Temporary closure and permanent closure are very different,"" said Tara Sinclair, an associate professor in economics and international affairs at George Washington University, ""and identifying the excess businesses that close due to COVID-19 can be tricky, particularly when focused on small businesses, because small businesses, especially young small businesses, frequently close."" Only about two-thirds of businesses with employees survive at least two years, and only about half survive at least five years, according to the Small Business Administration. And that’s without a pandemic. Bryan Stuart, an assistant professor of economics at George Washington University, said that while the 10,000 figure is likely a sizable underestimate, ""measuring closures, even without attempting to distinguish between whether they are permanent or temporary, is difficult."" The research study that estimated 100,000 lost businesses was based on data collected from weekly surveys by Alignable, a network for small business owners. ""These surveys are valuable because they can be very timely, but an important limitation is that the survey frames, and the businesses within those frames that respond to surveys are usually not representative of all types of business across the U.S.,"" Stuart said.  Another estimate of closure announcements comes from Yelp, an advertising platform for local businesses. Yelp found that about 132,500 businesses closed between March 1 and July 10. Of those, Yelp says nearly 72,850 are believed to be permanent closures. One caveat with Yelp’s data is that it is not representative of all employers or all small businesses, Stuart said. The number of Black business owners plummeted from 1.1 million in February 2020 to 640,000 in April, according to a June 2020 report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. ""The loss of 440,000 black business owners representing 41% of the previous level is disconcerting,"" wrote study author Robert W. Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California Santa Cruz. The report, which was based on Census data, found that the shutdown disproportionately affected Black Americans, but also hit other minority businesses hard: Latino business owners fell by 32%, and Asian business owners dropped by 26%. The long-term effect could be problematic on several fronts, Fairlie wrote, worsening wealth inequality and the availability of local jobs. Stuart also referenced the NBER report, and said that among those who are self-employed, minorities have lost more work. The data indicates that COVID-19 is affecting a significant number of minority-owned businesses, he said, but doesn’t tell us whether business closures are permanent or temporary. Biden said 10,000 businesses likely won’t reopen due to COVID-19, and that the health crisis is significantly affecting small and minority-owned businesses. That’s true, although the problem is substantially worse than he described. Biden’s campaign said he intended to say 100,000 businesses, a figure that lines up with recent research.  Biden is right that Black and minority-owned small businesses have been disproportionately affected by the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic, according to census data research. Biden’s claim is accurate — 10,000 businesses are certainly unlikely to reopen — but the caveat is a lot more businesses will also likely close.

Unpacking Donald Trump’s statement on 'record job numbers'
","During his first White House coronavirus briefing after a months-long hiatus, President Donald Trump touted recent economic improvements on his watch. During the July 21 briefing, he was asked, ""Do you want the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you’ve handled this pandemic so far?"" Trump responded, ""I think the American people will judge us on this, but they'll judge us on the economy that I created and that already we're creating. We're setting record job numbers, as you know. I think we're going to have a very strong year next year."" Trump returned to the theme of roaring job gains in the next day’s briefing.  ""We have an economy that's going to be booming. … A lot of jobs are being produced. The job numbers will be coming out shortly, meaning over the next week or so, and I think it'll be a continuation of the last two months. The last two months have been incredible."" Trump’s boast focuses on month-over-month job gains in May and June and ignores the huge job losses the country saw in March and April. It also overstates the overall jobs picture. Since Trump took office, the unemployment rate is significantly up, and the current number of Americans working is down.  Yes, May and June saw significant job growth. According to the official Bureau of Labor Statistics count, non-farm employment rose by nearly 2.7 million in May and by 4.8 million in June. Those are significantly higher than the 1.1 million rise in September 1983, the previous record. But these large increases followed a drop of more than 20 million jobs in April. That 20 million decrease is 10 times larger than the previous record for jobs lost in one month, which came in September 1945, when post-World War II demobilization was kicking in. ""The only reason the job growth numbers for May and June set records was because of the catastrophic collapse of jobs in March, and, especially, April,"" said Steve Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""There is no way job growth would be setting records without the much worse collapse that preceded the record months.""   In May and June, the U.S. made back about 37% of the jobs that had been lost in April.  Economists say this is an important piece of context to consider. The focus on the two monthly job gains is ""incomplete,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the free-market American Action Forum. ""You can’t ever just look at one or two months’ data,"" he said. ""You have to provide some context or else you’re cherry-picking."" Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, used a stock market analogy to describe the current jobs situation. ""If the price of shares drops 25% in the first half of the year and then rebounds 20% in the second half of the year, stock market investors are still 10% poorer on Dec. 31 than they were on Jan. 1st,"" he said. ""‘The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 11.1% last month …’ is not a phrase any American president wants to see. June had the highest unemployment rate in my lifetime, except for the rates in April and May. And I’m 70 years old."" The decline in April was so large that a big bounceback is not all that surprising, said Dean Baker, an economist and co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""In fact, it would be incredibly scary if we didn't,"" Baker said. ""The real question is how rapid the job growth will be going forward. We are still down by more than 14 million jobs. That is a disaster."" Trump said, ""We're setting record job numbers."" Trump is fixating on one piece of the jobs puzzle, the job gains in May and June, while ignoring the rest of the picture. The gains make up less than 40% of the April losses, the nation’s unemployment rate remains over 11%, and the total number of Americans working now is less than when Trump took office.

Johnson accurate in his estimation of PPP loan per employee
","How much money does the government’s Paycheck Protection Program provide for each employee? That’s the focus of a recent claim by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson. In a July 1, 2020, interview with Axios, the Wisconsin Republican discussed his proposed changes to the PPP, which was part of an effort to protect the economy from the effects of coronavirus. But he also added a statement that may have had listeners seeing dollar signs: ""PPP on average probably provided a grant of around $11,000 per employee,"" he said. Let’s take a closer look at that figure. The PPP is a $650 billion program intended to keep small businesses afloat during the coronavirus pandemic by providing them money — primarily used to pay workers.  The U.S. Small Business Administration distributed more than $521 billion through the program as of June 30, 2020, according to a report released July 6, 2020. Roughly $131 billion set aside for the program remains undistributed.  The PPP money is distributed as loans that can be fully forgiven if the money is used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The loans are subject to various requirements, such as that businesses use at least 60% for payroll. That number was reduced from the previous requirement of 75%. (Johnson in his claim referred to the PPP loans as ""a grant."" He mentioned this in a May 21, 2020 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, saying forgivable loans are ""essentially federal grants."") Businesses originally had just eight weeks to spend the loans, but that period was increased to 24 weeks in early June. The loans are intended for small businesses, which are generally defined as those with fewer than 500 employees.  The $521 billion in loans supported 51 million jobs as of the end of June, according to the July SBA report. That translates to about $10,200 per employee — but that assumes 100% of the money went directly to employee payroll, which is not the case.  For instance, if every company put just 60% of its loan toward payroll — the minimum required for the loan to be forgiven — that would average out to just over $6,000 per employee. When asked to back the claim of $11,000 per employee, Johnson spokesperson Aaren Johnson used a different method.  Aaren Johnson used the private-sector employer’s average cost for employee compensation from December 2019 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, calculated that for a full work week and put that number in the context of an eight-week period, the original period of time the loans were meant to cover. Using these metrics, the average loan per employee was around $11,110.  Aaren Johnson emphasized the senator’s comment was made in the context of his proposal for a PPP replacement program, which included a federal grant of $10,000 per employee to businesses. He added the senator ""was talking about the payroll-covering part of the PPP forgivable loan"" when he made his statement. Kevin Mumford, a professor of economics at Purdue University, said Johnson’s method of calculation is ""reasonable as a rough approximation"" of the average loan per employee.  Mumford noted the average amount of money per employee would vary by business depending on the percentage of the loan businesses put toward payroll and benefits.  John Witte, professor emeritus of public affairs and political science at the University of Wisconsin, also said Johnson’s method was accurate without immediate access to detailed tax data from the businesses.  Witte added it was ""correct"" to use the average employer cost for employee compensation from December 2019, because that was before the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the U.S. economy, altering those payment figures. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report for March 2020 showed a slightly higher average cost of employee compensation than the December 2019 figure. Had Sen. Johnson used that figure, his average loan per employee would have been around $12,000. Sen. Johnson said the ""PPP on average probably provided a grant of around $11,000 per employee."" Although the methodology used to calculate this figure is an approximation due to lack of access to detailed tax information, it largely aligns with the $10,200 average the PPP data shows. But both figures assume businesses are applying 100% of the loans toward payroll, which is not always the case. Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.

It calls for strengthening the role of women, local leaders, workers, farmers, entrepreneurs and even private business and industry in promoting sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by each country in the U.N. in 2015. The agenda includes 17 sustainable-development goals that are to be achieved over 15 years, including ending poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, combating climate change, and ensuring access to clean water and affordable energy.  There are some common threads between the goals in the 2030 U.N. plan and what’s listed in the Facebook post, but in each case, the post exaggerates or distorts them.  For example, the U.N.’s 2030 agenda proposes a goal of reducing the rates of child and maternal mortality in every country. This goal supports research and development of vaccines and medicines for diseases primarily affecting developing countries, according to the U.N. But it doesn’t call for ""mandatory multiple vaccines"" or ""the ban of natural non synthetic drugs and naturopathic medicine"" as the Facebook post claims.  Similarly, the U.N. agenda advocates for free, suitable and quality primary and secondary education and lifelong learning opportunities. But it says nothing about ""government owned and controlled schools.""  The U.N. agenda includes ensuring universal access to ""affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy,"" not the end of private transportation or fossil fuels, as the Facebook post says. The caption on the post invokes the term ""plandemic"" to suggest that the COVID-19 crisis is aligned with the purported U.N. agenda. ""Plandemic"" is the title of a 26-minute video airing various conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 crisis. PolitiFact fact-checked eight of the most misleading claims in the video, which Facebook and YouTube removed.  We also fact-checked another doctored United Nations document in 2013 that claimed a civilian gun confiscation plan was in the works in the United States, and was created through Agenda 21. We rated it Pants on Fire.  A photo posted to Facebook claims the United Nations is creating a ""new world order"" that would initiate a one world government, one world military and the end of national sovereignty, among a list of agenda items. The list alludes to a real action plan, Agenda 21, that was created in 1992, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which introduced 17 goals. Those action plans were created to end poverty and inequality, not to create a totalitarian government. They are also nonbinding. Some of the post’s listed goals seem to link to the 17 goals introduced by the U.N., but they exaggerate or manipulate the meaning and proposed outcomes of the action plans.  We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/24/viral-image/facebook-post-distorts-uns-sustainable-development/

Fact-checking Trump on rising murders in Philly
","President Donald Trump said this week that he plans to send federal law enforcement agents into major American cities to combat a surge in violent crime, and Philadelphia is one of his targets. His initial announcement Monday came days after camouflage-clad federal agents swept demonstrators off the streets of Portland, Ore. – a heavy handed response that drew criticism from several Democratic mayors, including Philadelphia’s Jim Kenney.  ""Murders this year have spiked 27% in Philadelphia,"" Trump said Wednesday during a speech he delivered from the White House’s East Room.  Trump is right. So far this year, there have been 232 homicides in Philadelphia, 50 more than at this time last year, city crime statistics show. That’s an increase of 27 percent. Five people have been murdered across the city since Monday night alone.  Violent crimes such as rape, robbery, and some types of aggravated assault have fallen amid the coronavirus pandemic, but homicides and nonfatal shootings have not abated, frustrating city leaders who have called for calm. Other cities like Chicago and Detroit have also been battling a rise in shootings during the pandemic. One day last month, 23 people were shot across Philadelphia — the most in a single day since at least 2013. Six of the victims died, including a 6-year-old boy who police believe was mistakenly shot by a 5-year-old boy inside an Upper Holmesburg rowhouse.  Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw and District Attorney Larry Krasner have pledged to increase the number of gun violence cases that result in arrest and prosecution. They also say tackling the widespread poverty that underpins much of the city’s violent crime is a critical part of the solution.  City resources have been stretched thin because of the ongoing protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Kenny said earlier this month.  City Council President Darrell L. Clarke called the source of the rising crime rate a ""perfect storm"" of problems, including widespread poverty, the coronavirus, the ongoing unrest, and easy access to guns — issues he said the City Council was working to improve. ""At the end of the day, we’ve got to get through this,"" Clarke said. ""We got to figure out a way."" Kenney said Monday he doesn’t want help from federal law enforcement officers and vowed that if Trump sends them anyway, ""we would use all available means to resist such a wrong-headed effort and abuse of power.""  ""To send federal agents to police U.S. cities that have not requested such aid can only impede the work of local governments and exacerbate already heightened tensions in these cities,"" Kenny added.  Local legal experts say it may be unconstitutional for Trump to deploy federal agents to Philly without consent of local officials. The administration has cited 40 U.S. Code 1315 under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 as justification for sending officers to Portland. The rule gives the department’s secretary the power to deploy agents to protect federal property. Using that same rationale to send agents to Philadelphia would be unprecedented. Alexis Karteron, a Rutgers University associate professor of law and director of the school’s Constitutional Rights Clinic, called the administration’s reasoning ""very dubious.""  ""I can’t think of any legitimate reason to be sending federal law enforcement to Philadelphia right now,""Karteron said. ""Federal troops descending on American cities, that is very troubling, outside of historic practices, and almost certainly illegal.""  Trump said ""murders have spiked 27 percent in Philadelphia,"" and city crime statistics show the same thing.  Violent crimes such as rape, robbery, and some types of aggravated assault have fallen amid the coronavirus pandemic, but homicides and nonfatal shootings have not.

Republican committee’s claim about the estate tax isn’t the whole story
","In a recent advertisement making rounds in Iowa online and on television, the National Republican Senatorial Committee targets Iowa’s Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Theresa Greenfield’s support for an estate tax.  Dubbing the tax the Pelosi-Greenfield Death Tax, the advertisement says, ""This unfair tax would punish family farms and small businesses, forcing them to be sold off instead of passed on to the next generation."" The ad references an op-ed by Greenfield in the Valley News in October 2017, when she was running in the Democratic primary for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District. Greenfield’s article argues that a proposed tax bill, in which Republicans were trying to eliminate estate taxes entirely, would be a win for wealthy Americans and corporations, not farmers. The National Republican Senatorial Committee’s claim gets made frequently by those who see the estate tax as being unfair, and we’ve dealt with it several times from different perspectives in previous fact-checks. We zero in, here, on the claim made in the presumed competitive U.S. Senate race in Iowa that an estate tax would punish family farms and small businesses. The estate tax — in place in various iterations since 1916 — is a federal tax on property and asset transfers after the death of the owner. Some states impose their own estate taxes on top of the federal tax but Iowa does not. The tax only applies to estates valued above a specified amount, which has risen substantially in the past two decades. In 2000, estates worth more than $675,000 were subject to an estate tax, which would be worth a little more than $1 million in today’s dollars. But, the exempt value has risen beyond inflation-adjusted levels — to $5.49 million by 2017, when Greenfield’s op-ed was written.  In 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the exemption on taxable estates and indexed it for inflation to $11.58 million. Tax cuts in the act will sunset after 2025 unless Congress decides to extend them or pass another tax bill.  The exemption doubles if the estate is owned by a couple, so family farms and businesses owned jointly won’t pay a tax on an inherited estate unless the estate is valued above $23.16 million.  Does the estate tax put a strain on small businesses and family farms, forcing them to sell to pay off the tax? The data says no.  Family farms and small businesses are largely exempt from the tax because they usually don’t have enough assets to meet the minimum value for a tax. Of the 5,500 taxable estates in 2017, when the taxable value was $5.49 million, 80 were small farms and businesses, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based non-partisan think tank. The center defined a small business as one with farm and business assets totaling less than $5 million and making up at least half the estate.  Since 2018,  the Tax Policy Center estimated 1,900 estates every year have been subject to the tax. None fell under the center’s definition of a small business, but about 140 had business and farm assets making up at least half the estate, according to the estimates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 0.6 percent of the 38,106 farm estates created nationally in 2018 were required to file an estate tax return when the exemption was $11.18 million, and only 0.35 percent — 133 farms — ended up paying any taxes. Asked for comment, the National Republican Senatorial Committee referred to five sources, including an American Farm Bureau position statement arguing for repealing the tax. The statement says 91 percent of farm assets are tied up in land, equipment and buildings and not liquid, leaving farmers short of cash to pay an estate tax. The statement doesn’t provide evidence that this is a common occurrence. But the committee points to Kevin Kester, the former president of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, who wrote a 2017 opinion piece in U.S. News, saying his family would have to sell parts of its 22,000-acre California ranch to pay a $2 million tax bill when he inherited his ranch.  The Republican Senatorial Committee also pointed to an open letter from 2001 that was penned by economist Milton Friedman arguing for a repeal of the tax. The letter was reissued in 2017 and signed by 727 economists.  It’s true that there’s a cost associated with complying with the tax when it is owed. Wealthy families need to hire estate planners who can navigate the intricate tax code, and there are ways to structure an estate to lower the tax burden. Thomas Gelman, a lawyer at Phelan Tucker Law Firm who has been working in estate planning around Iowa City for 42 years, said multiple strategies exist for people — generally the wealthiest families with large estates — who are subject to the tax. They can transfer ownership of property during their lifetime, for example, or structure a family business to give up total ownership.  ""There’s just multiple strategies about how you might accomplish that,"" Gelman said in an interview. ""And yes, they can become somewhat expensive and complicated to implement, but the federal estate tax is 40 percent. So, on every dollar you save tax on, you're saving 40 cents. And for people with enormous wealth, it usually justifies the effort.""  Heirs of small businesses and farms can defer tax payments, excluding interest, for up to five years after filing a return, and can pay what’s left in installments over 10 years. Small farms  also can be valued at their farm use value rather than fair market value, which assesses land based on how much it produces versus how much it could be sold for on the open market. This allows for additional exemptions of more than $1 million when passed down. Leonard Burman, a Tax Policy Center economist, said in a Daily Iowan interview the likelihood the tax would force family farmers or small-business owners to sell their assets is essentially nonexistent. ""If you have a farm that, by itself, would be subject to the estate tax, it’s a giant estate in California, it’s not a corn farm in Iowa,"" he said. The average size of a farm in Iowa was 351 acres in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Combine that with the average value of Iowa farmland — $7,432 an acre, according to a 2019 Iowa State University survey — and you get an average farm value of about $2.6 million. Even when accounting for real estate, equipment, and other assets, this is a far cry from the $23 million that would make a couple-owned farm subject to the tax, the data shows. Gelman said that in 42 years of practicing estate planning, he hasn’t encountered a situation where a family had to sell a farm or business in order to pay the tax, though he has had clients who were subject to the tax take advantage of the provisions outlined above.  ""The current federal estate tax, with the exemptions that are now applicable, do not force small farmers, in my experience, to have to sell off their farm,"" he said.  The NRSC advertisement said the tax would ""punish family farms and small businesses, forcing them to be sold off instead of passed on to the next generation.""  Estate planning to prepare for the tax can be costly, and the few families that are subject to it do have an associated burden. With few liquid assets, very large farms like Kester’s could run into trouble paying the tax, but the ad left out the crucial fact that only a tiny fraction of farms and businesses will ever see a tax on their estates. Most family farms in Iowa are below the threshold that triggers an estate tax. There are also several mechanisms, specifically for small businesses and farms, to reduce the amount owed and extend the payment window when a tax is owed.  While it’s possible that a handful of Iowa family farms and small businesses may be subject to the estate tax, it’s hard to find evidence that the tax is forcing average farmers and business owners to sell their estates.

Fact-checking Hillary Clinton on Donald Trump's response to reports of Russian bounties on US troops
","Hillary Clinton said Russia succeeded in its effort to influence the U.S. presidential election four years ago when she was the Democratic presidential nominee, and that Russia was working again to help elect someone ""who is favorable to their agenda."" In a July 20 interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid, Clinton characterized President Donald Trump’s foreign policy as incoherent and inconsistent. She said she was glad that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, was trying to warn Americans ""that what happened in 2016 is sadly underway again."" Reid then said: ""Yeah, to say nothing of putting bounties on American troops."" ""It’s unbelievable, Joy,"" Clinton replied. ""I mean, he is still yet to say anything, as the president of the United States, about bounties on American troops."" The ""bounties"" story is about reports that Russia offered Taliban-linked militants bounties to kill American troops in Afghanistan. PolitiFact decided to fact-check whether Clinton was right that Trump hasn’t said anything on the matter. A spokesperson for Clinton, Nick Merrill, told PolitiFact that Clinton was referring to Trump ""abdicating his responsibilities as commander-in-chief to hold a foreign adversary that’s killing our troops to account, and ensuring it stops."" Trump has not challenged Russia over the bounties reports, but he has not been silent on the issue either. Trump has dismissed New York Times reporting as ""just another hoax,"" said the story of Russian bounties wasn’t ""credible"" and that he wasn’t briefed about it. The New York Times reported June 26 that American intelligence officials concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for the killing of coalition forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. troops. A Taliban spokesman told the New York Times that the report was baseless and the press secretary for Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Russian government was not aware of the accusations. The New York Times story relied on officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Other news outlets, including the Associated Press, Washington Post, CNN and Fox News, have also reported on the information, citing officials familiar with the issue. ""While officials were said to be confident about the intelligence that Russian operatives offered and paid bounties to Afghan militants for killing Americans, they have greater uncertainty about how high in the Russian government the covert operation was authorized and what its aim may be,"" the New York Times story said. That story and subsequent reporting said Trump was briefed on the U.S. intelligence finding. Trump hasn’t condemned or warned Russia over the information reported by the New York Times — because he has said the reporting isn’t credible. ""Nobody briefed or told me, @VP Pence, or Chief of Staff @MarkMeadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russians, as reported through an ""anonymous source"" by the Fake News @nytimes. Everybody is denying it & there have not been many attacks on us....."" Trump tweeted June 28. In a follow-up tweet, Trump claimed that no other administration has been tougher on Russia and veered off into a campaign-related talking point on Ukraine and Hunter Biden. Trump ended that tweet with: ""Probably just another phony Times hit job, just like their failed Russia Hoax. Who is their ‘source’?"" Trump also tweeted June 28: ""Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP. Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News @nytimesbooks, wanting to make Republicans look bad!!!"" On July 1, Trump reiterated his argument that the story was made up and intended to damage him and Republicans. ""The secret source probably does not even exist, just like the story itself. If the discredited @nytimes has a source, reveal it. Just another HOAX!"" Trump wrote. Later that day, Trump repeated that there was no corroborating evidence and that he was never briefed because ""any info that they may have had did not rise to that level."" In a Fox Business Network interview, Trump was asked, ""if there's ever a scenario in which Russia puts a bounty on U.S. troops, how would you respond?"" ""First of all, they’d hear about it,"" Trump said July 1. ""But we never heard about it, because intelligence never found it to be of that level where it would rise to that. … From what I hear and I hear pretty good, the intelligence people didn't even, many of them didn't believe it happened at all. I think it's a hoax. I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats."" Trump added that ""many of the intelligence people didn't think it was something that even happened, and if it did happen, the Russians would hear about it and anybody else would hear about it that was involved."" While the White House has said Trump was never orally briefed, warnings that a Russian intelligence unit placed bounties on American forces appeared in the President’s Daily Brief, according to multiple news reports. RELATED: What’s the President’s Daily Brief? Not ‘like a mini novel,’ as Fox News host says White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany in press briefings has not directly denounced Russia over the New York Times reporting, offering instead broad warnings to all countries and saying there are dissenting opinions on the intelligence reported by the New York Times. A reporter on July 13 asked McEnany if Trump or the administration planned to ""make it very clear to the Russian Federation that there should not be bounties placed on the heads of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan. McEnany said, ""We tell each and every country that."" But the information on Russia was uncorroborated and there were ""varying views"" about it, she said. ""I’m not going to answer a question based on unverified intelligence, but rest assured, every country in this world is put on notice that bounties on the heads of U.S. troops is unacceptable, and this president will stand for U.S. troops at home and abroad,"" McEnany said. McEnany said ""yes"" when she was asked if that included Russia. Trump and Putin spoke on the phone July 23 and discussed the coronavirus pandemic and arms control issues, the White House said. There was no mention of the presidents talking about the news of Russian bounties to kill U.S. troops. Clinton said Trump ""is still yet to say anything as the president of the United States about bounties on American troops."" There is an element of truth in that Trump has not condemned Russia over the reports. But he has talked about the topic several times.

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump supports privatizing the VA health care system
","Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton pledged to do ""whatever is required to move the VA into the 21st century"" during NBC’s Commander-In-Chief Forum, while adding that her opponent’s plan would be much worse for veterans. ""I will not let the VA be privatized,"" Clinton said Sept. 7, 2016, during the forum at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. ""I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that. I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans."" We wondered if Republican nominee Donald Trump has proposed or supports privatization of the health care system for U.S. veterans. Trump, for the record, addressed the question head on when it was his turn to answer questions. ""I never said take the VA -- take the Veterans administration -- private."" ""I wouldn’t do that,"" Trump added. ""I do believe, when you're waiting in line six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the (private) doctor, you get yourself taken care of."" Trump's comments are consistent with what he's said before, and Clinton's concerns about privatization are a misleading Democratic talking point. In July, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said that ""Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization"" of the VA. What we found then, and what holds now, is that Trump wants to give veterans access to private providers when they face delays at the VA. That's not the same as privatization. When we contacted Clinton's campaign about her statement, spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us several references where Trump's plan has been characterized as some degree of privatization and Trump’s explicit promise to give veterans the chance to go elsewhere for care. ""Every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care. Every veteran,"" Trump pledged in a July 11, 2016, speech in Virginia Beach, Va. ""Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center. We must extend this right to all veterans, not just those who can’t get an appointment in 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is, unfortunately, the current and wrong policy."" The logistics of how that would work, of course, are another matter. Trump has spoken of letting VA patients go to any doctor or health care facility that accepts Medicare and getting treatment there immediately. The VA would pay for the bill. Experts we spoke with raised several issues with Trump’s plan and also debated whether Trump's plan should be considered a type of partial privatization. One concern is that non-VA providers don’t have the same level of experience that the VA has with treating veteran's health issues — including combat injuries, combat-related illnesses and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. There's also concern that letting veterans go anywhere for their care would result in fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care. Our ruling Clinton said Donald Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Affairs health care system. Trump does support allowing more privatized care in cases where treatment at the VA is delayed or inadequate. In some cases he's talked about giving veterans a choice that would include doctors and hospitals outside the system. But that's not the same as privatizing the system, which would get the get the government out of the treatment business. Trump has never proposed that. Because Clinton's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e782bf2-269d-45f2-9c69-c527093c99f2",/factchecks/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-supports-privati/

Did Hillary Clinton say she was ""satisfied"" with Veterans Administration?
","An Iraq War veteran asked Donald Trump at NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum how the Republican nominee would support veterans, beyond words. Trump referred the speaker to his website, saying one of the big problems veterans face is wait times to see doctors. He said his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has been dismissive of the crisis. ""And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there's no real problem, it's over-exaggerated,"" Trump said. ""She did say that."" Host Matt Lauer cut in, saying, ""No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA."" Trump doubled down: ""Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me. I'm telling you, this is -- she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration. We wondered if in fact Clinton had used those words to downplay reports about veterans waiting for months to get medical care. Trump’s campaign issued a news release quoting Clinton at a November 2015 event, where she said, ""I think Secretary (Robert A.) McDonald is doing a great job, but there is a lot more that needs to be done."" The 16-second clip about McDonald, who took over the job in July 2014 after Eric Shinseki’s resignation, doesn’t provide much context of what she said before that quote. The Washington Post reported that Shinseki, former secretary, resigned May 2014 after reports that the VA hospital system ""conspired to hide months-long wait times that veterans faced when seeking care."" The event followed multiple media reports on extended wait times veterans face to get medical treatment, including reports of veterans dying waiting for care. Trump’s campaign after the forum also pointed to a Wall Street Journal article on criticism Clinton received after saying ""It’s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,"" on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show, regarding problems at the Veterans Affairs Department. In that interview, Maddow asked Clinton about talks of privatizing the VA and if she had ideas on how to fix the program. ""You know, I don’t understand why we have such a problem, because there have been a number of surveys of veterans, and overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment,"" Clinton said in the Oct. 23, 2015, interview. ""Now, nobody would believe that from the coverage that you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have."" Maddow interjects: ""But in part because there has been real scandal."" ""There has been. But it’s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,"" Clinton responded. ""Now, I do think that some of the reforms that were adopted last year should be given a chance to work. If there is a waiting period that is just unacceptable, you should be able to, in a sense, get the opportunity to go out, have a private physician take care of you, but at the cost of the VA."" Clinton went on to say the problem went ""deeper"" than access to health care and also included a backlog of disability determinations. ""There’s something not working within the bureaucracy,"" she said. Clinton spoke before Trump at the NBC forum and said she was ""outraged"" by the stories about the V.A. and that she has been ""very clear"" about the necessity to move the department into the 21st century. Clinton has called for addressing the VA’s problems at multiple town halls and campaign events. At a June 2015 roundtable in Nevada, she said transforming the VA across the country should be a priority and ""what happened in Phoenix and elsewhere is absolutely unacceptable, period,"" transcripts show. Later in November 2015, Clinton said at a town hall that the VA ""does a lot of good work"" but also ""has systemic problems."" ""And those have been revealed, and it's been shameful that people have been mistreated. They've been put on waiting lists and never gotten the treatment that they were looking for. They've been given the wrong treatment. There are serious deficiencies within the VA,"" Clinton said. Our ruling Trump said Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is ""over-exaggerated,"" and, ""She said she was satisfied with what was going on."" This reading of Clinton’s comments about the problems facing veterans’ health care is misleading and leaves out the full story. While Clinton has said problems at the VA have ""not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,"" she has also acknowledged systemic problems within the system and repeatedly urged reform so veterans can get care quickly.

","The long shadow of the Iraq War continues to color presidential politics. In a forum focused on national security, Democrat Hillary Clinton was questioned about her Senate vote in favor of action against Iraq. She in turn noted that Donald Trump initially supported the war. When it was Trump’s turn, the Republican nominee denied the charge. ""I was totally against the war in Iraq,"" Trump said during the NBC News event. ""You can look at Esquire magazine from '04. You can look at before that.""

Trump dialed that back a bit in another interview in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W.

""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,"" Trump said.

And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" So Trump put the economy ahead of confronting Iraq, but he didn’t speak against going to war. At most he suggested waiting for the United Nations to do something. A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave different takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that ""the war’s a mess,"" according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket."" The earliest evidence of Trump’s outright opposition to the war came in that August 2004 article in Esquire: ""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way,"" Trump said. Trump has been challenged many times in this election to explain his early acceptance of the war. In a February 2016 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump said that he didn’t know what he meant during his 2002 conversation with Stern. ""That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head."" Trump said. Our ruling Trump said he was ""totally against the war in Iraq."" While he came to that position when the war became difficult, earlier on he was more accepting of military action. In 2002, asked if America should go to war, he said, ""I guess so."" Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said the president should be more focused on the economy, but he didn’t speak against launching an attack. Trump didn’t speak often about the Iraq War before it happened, but what he said did not add up to the sort of opposition he describes today.

Rudy Giuliani says food stamps rose two and a half times under Barack Obama
","Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump, criticized President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy as he touted Trump’s efforts to court African-American voters. ""So, now you compare New York to Detroit and Baltimore, and you look at the number of crimes in both of those cities and you look at New York, you look at the unemployment rates, you look at the economic opportunities, and you see that I think Donald Trump is the first Republican since Jack Kemp, and me, to go into minority poor communities and say, the Democrats have failed you for 50 years, and you are reflexively giving them your vote, and they are going from bad to worse,"" Giuliani said in an interview on the Sept. 4, 2016, edition of CNN’s State of the Union. ""Food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama. He should be ashamed of himself. Jobs should have gone up two-and-a-half times."" Is the use of food stamps -- formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP -- really two-and-a-half times higher than it was when Obama took office? The short answer is that it’s higher -- but not by nearly that much. And in recent years, it’s been falling. As we’ve noted, SNAP is the federal government’s largest food program, eclipsing other big farm-bill food spending for school lunches and breakfasts and for Women, Infants and Children. It helps low-income people buy groceries, usually with benefit cards that work like debit cards. Two factors undergird the rise in food stamp use during Obama’s presidency. The first is that the number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush due to policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama. The second is the 2007-09 recession, which drove the number of SNAP recipients to record highs. In an average month in 2011, one in seven U.S. residents got help. So what does the trend line for food stamp usage under Obama look like? Here’s a graph, drawn from Agriculture Department data: Note that the number of beneficiaries did rise -- but not nearly by two-and-a-half times, or 150 percent. At the outset of Obama’s presidency, nearly 32 million people were receiving SNAP benefits. By May 2016, that number had risen to 43.5 million -- an increase of 36 percent. That’s a significant increase, and it’s one of the weakest economic metrics on Obama’s watch. But it’s not two-and-a-half times as high as when he came into office, as Giuliani said. It’s also worth noting that, while the number of recipients is higher now than it was when Obama took office, it has fallen, slowly but consistently, over the past three years. What about the cost of the program? We created a graph from that data as well. This shows that during the Obama presidency, the cost of SNAP increased at a somewhat faster rate than the number of beneficiaries did -- by just under 50 percent. But even that increase was nowhere near the two and a half times or 150 percent that Giuliani cited. We inquired with Giuliani’s office and Trump’s campaign but did not hear back. Our ruling Giuliani said that ""food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama."" Due to expanded eligibility and outreach, as well as the after-effects of the Great Recession -- each of which began under Bush -- the number of SNAP beneficiaries and the cost of the program has risen under Obama. However, the increase in these metrics has been 36 percent and 50 percent, respectively -- far less than the two-and-a-half-times multiplier Giuliani used. It’s also worth noting that both of these figures have been falling consistently over the past several years, a trend that Giuliani’s comment obscures. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dce7bf66-64d8-4c46-b449-3c471eb34446",/factchecks/2016/sep/07/rudy-giuliani/rudy-giuliani-says-food-stamps-rose-two-and-half-t/

Donald Trump says his financial disclosures more than make up for lack of releasing tax returns
","As Election Day draws nearer, the window for Donald Trump to release his tax returns continues to narrow. When asked about his refusal to release his tax returns during an interview with ABC News’ David Muir, Trump said that ""the only one that cares is the press. ... It’s not a big deal."" Trump went on to say that he’s already provided significant information about his holdings. ""I released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics,"" Trump said. ""It’s either 100 or maybe more pages of names of companies, locations of companies, etc., etc., and it's a very impressive list, and everybody says that. … You don't learn much in a tax return."" Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but he appears to be referring to the Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report, also known as OGE Form 278e. This is a form that all presidential candidates must fill out. In Trump’s case, his financial disclosure form is indeed extensive. It runs 92 pages, often crammed with small print detailing assets, income sources and positions held. By comparison, Mitt Romney -- the 2012 Republican nominee who was a businessman with a complex set of holdings -- filed a 47-page disclosure form, not counting amendments and updates. But does his release of that information mean Trump is releasing more than prior presidential candidates who opened their tax returns to public scrutiny? We took a closer look. The history of presidential tax-filing releases The key difference comes from Trump’s refusal to release his tax filings. (Trump has cited an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service.) Whereas the personal financial disclosure form must by law be made public, public release of a candidate’s tax returns is a 40-year tradition that isn’t required by law. As we have previously noted, Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1976, President Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns but instead provided a summary of his taxes. His opponent, Jimmy Carter, did release his tax returns that year -- and every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, until Trump. Hillary Clinton has released her tax returns from 2000 to 2015. Right off the bat, the fact that Trump has not released any tax filings undermines his claim to have ""released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics,"" despite the lengthy personal financial disclosure form he submitted. Romney’s 2010 tax filing, for instance, runs 203 pages and is chock full of detail about his personal financial situation. For instance, Romney’s tax return ""scrutinized his family’s charitable foundation and their donations to their church,"" said Ryan Williams, a longtime aide to Romney and a spokesman during his 2012 presidential campaign. So how seriously does the lack of public tax filings undermine Trump’s claim? We checked with experts. Why tax filings matter ""It is true that Trump's businesses have received a lot of attention, but without the release of Trump's tax returns, we don't know a lot about his personal financial situation,"" said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. The two most obvious pieces of the puzzle missing without Trump’s tax returns are the effective rate of tax he pays on his income, and the extent and nature of his charitable giving. Depending on what figures appear on his tax forms, Trump could face political criticism. Paying a low tax rate could be politically embarrassing. And Trump has faced questions about his past charitable giving. (For details, see the ongoing coverage by reporter David Farenthold of the Washington Post.) Tax returns also can give a clearer picture of the candidate’s liquid assets. ""Trump can inflate his image of being rich on the financial disclosure forms, but you can get a better sense of how much he’s actually making from his tax returns,"" said Williams, who did not support Trump during the GOP primary and now says he’s officially undecided on the presidential race. Other nuggets can be gleaned from tax forms as well, such as what specific mix of taxes the candidate paid. ""Romney’s tax return showed us a ton of valuable information about Romney, including the fact that most of his substantial income was ‘carried interest,’ "" which is a type of tax-favored income available primarily to fund managers, said Allan Sloan, a business columnist for the Washington Post. Because of this, ""we saw that the majority of his income was taxed at low rates."" Trump wouldn’t necessarily qualify for the carried-interest tax, but as a someone in the real-estate business, he would have access to specialized tax breaks of his own, Sloan said. There is a ""provision in tax law that allows people who spend at least half their working time as real-estate or development professionals to get depreciation deductions not available to other investors,"" he said. ""That’s a huge loophole, and it’s gotten nothing like the attention that carried interest has gotten."" The fact that Trump has not run for office before or served in government makes the scrutiny of his business dealings especially important for those who care about transparency. Yet the fact that he runs a privately held company makes it hard for outsiders to get a handle on his personal finances as long as no public tax filing is available, experts said. ""Because Trump’s business dealings are varied and extensive, there is a lot to look at, but the quality of information is often poor, so reporters spend a lot of time looking at information insufficient to draw accurate conclusions,"" said Dennis Caplan, an associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany. Our ruling Trump said that he has ""released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. … You don't learn much in a tax return."" Trump did release an extensive (and legally required) document detailing his personal financial holdings. However, experts consider that a red herring. Unlike all presidential nominees since 1980, Trump has not released his tax returns, which experts say would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid, and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his income-producing assets. Trump’s statement is inaccurate. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-his-financial-disclosures-more-m/

Do girls make up the majority of new HIV infections among African youth?
","International leaders continue to try and shine a light on the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. But do they get their facts right? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently penned a letter decrying the impact of poverty and disease on young girls in Africa, a group he says make up a disproportionate amount of new HIV infections among young people. Trudeau wrote the letter in response to the One Campaign, which sent out an appeal to global leaders asking them to help combat gender inequality. The One Campaign is a worldwide advocacy program that works to raise awareness about poverty and preventable disease. Included in Trudeau’s message was a claim that young women ""account for a shocking 74 percent of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Africa."" We’ve seen this statistic floating around before. Our partners at Africa Check investigated a nearly identical claim featured in an online article published in April. They concluded that the source of the data was ambiguous, but their independent calculations mostly fell in line with the overall message of the claim. PolitiFact decided to dig into Trudeau’s claim in more detail. Running the numbers Trudeau’s office informed us that the source of his claim is a 2015 reference report authored by UNAIDS and the African Union. The report, titled ""Empower young women and adolescent girls,"" contains a figure claiming that in 2013, 74 percent of new HIV infections among people between ages 15 and 24 in Africa occurred in adolescent girls. But the report’s footnotes section only lists ""2013 UNAIDS data"" as its source. Where did this data come from, and is it still accurate today? First, it’s important to note that although Trudeau named the entire continent of Africa in his claim, the majority of AIDS estimates in Africa specifically examine sub-Saharan Africa. Alasdair Reid, deputy director of communications and global advocacy at UNAIDS said that discussion of AIDS in the continent usually focuses on sub-Saharan Africa and treats North Africa as a separate region or as part of the Middle East.  Katie Smith, communications associate at the Kaiser Family Foundation, referred us to the 2016 Prevention Gap Report, a collection of HIV data and analysis of infection trends from 146 countries. The press release for the report states, ""In eastern and southern Africa three-quarters of all new HIV infections among adolescents aged 10–19 years are among adolescent girls."" The report made no reference to data analyzing sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. We reached out to UNAIDS to obtain the most recent data for the entire region. The agency pointed us to the 2016 Prevention Gap Report as well, but also gave us up-to-date figures taken from aidsinfoonline.org, a database of AIDS-related statistics. According to a spreadsheet provided by UNAIDS, in 2015, 76 percent of all new HIV infections among adolescents aged 10-19 in sub-Saharan Africa were among adolescent girls. The age range used in the sheet is lower than the 15-24 group used by Trudeau’s source. The officials we spoke to told us that Trudeau’s claim was basically correct, and was actually slightly lower than more recent numbers because it was based on data from 2013. Why girls are so vulnerable to HIV Trudeau’s sobering statistic made us wonder why African girls are so disproportionately affected by a virus that can infect any human being. The experts we talked to stressed that a wide variety of factors ranging from economic circumstances to societal gender norms were responsible for the gap. Anurita Baines, the HIV/AIDS regional advisor at UNICEF’s Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, stressed that the obstacles most girls in poverty face even when healthy make avoiding HIV infection more difficult. ""The primary reasons that girls are more vulnerable have to do with gender inequality, including lack of access to education,"" she said. ""These issues prevent women and girls from negotiating for condoms and safe sex practices."" One particular problem is the phenomenon of intergenerational sex, where poor young girls have sex with men who are often at least a decade older. Reid told us that these ""blessers"" shower poor girls with gifts and money, who then become dependent on the men to stay in school. The result is often unprotected exposure to an HIV-positive partner. However, in recent years an array of initiatives has been developed and implemented to specifically protect young women from HIV infection. Baines highlighted UNICEF’s social protection programs in countries such as Kenya and Malawi that give small cash grants for households with school-age girls. The purpose of the grants is to keep girls in school longer, which delays their sexual debut and reduces their risk of contracting HIV. Ultimately, Baines is hopeful that increased international attention could further advance efforts to fight the disease. ""To have someone at a high political level make a statement like that is very encouraging,"" she said of Trudeau’s claim. ""What has to come next is the funding and the support for programs that actually reach these girls and help them."" Our ruling Trudeau claimed that young women ""account for a shocking 74 percent of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Africa."" The data from UNAIDS and UNICEF closely matches his numbers, though Trudeau would have been more precise if he said sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence there shows that young girls between the ages of 10 and 19 are significantly more vulnerable to HIV infection than their male peers due to a wide variety of economic and gender-related issues. Trudeau’s claim is accurate with the small caveat about his use of Africa and not sub-Saharan Africa. We rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/565b33e4-ee02-4513-a724-3e3deeeb8d6c",/factchecks/2016/sep/07/justin-trudeau/do-girls-make-majority-new-hiv-infections-among-af/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Did Russ Feingold break promise to fund campaign primarily in state?
","In 1992, Democrat Russ Feingold introduced himself to Wisconsinites as a regular guy supported by regular guys (and gals). He listed campaign promises on his garage door and repeatedly said he would take the majority of his funding from Wisconsinites — not out-of-state residents or interest groups. He stayed true to that pledge throughout campaigns in 1992, 1998, 2004 and 2010 — when he was unseated by Republican Ron Johnson. In the 2016 rematch, Feingold has reversed course and is now taking the majority of his money from out of state. Johnson frames this as a broken promise in a recent campaign ad, noting that at the time Feingold’s pledge originated he did not limit it to any time period. Rather, he declared he was making the commitment ""for the future."" Let’s take a closer look. Feingold’s promise PolitiFact Wisconsin examined this issue before, giving Feingold a ""Full Flop"" in October 2015 for reversing his position and accepting a majority of his funding from out of state. The Flip-O-Meter ruling only examined whether Feingold had changed his position — which he clearly did. We are taking another look because Johnson now alleges that in doing so Feingold broke a promise to always get the majority of his funding from Wisconsinites. The ad is the latest volley on this point, which Johnson has also made in an interview, a tweet and on his website. If you ask Feingold now, his pledge was always for the campaign at hand. ""When I said in 1992, whenever I said that I would get a majority of my contributions from Wisconsin citizens, I made that pledge for that term,"" Feingold said in January 2016 as part of an ""On The Issues with Mike Gousha"" appearance at Marquette University Law School. Let’s go to the tape.           Feingold stated in a 1992 TV ad that he would ""rely on Wisconsin citizens, not out-of-staters, to pay for this campaign"" -- a promise he touted often. But he also took it a step further. In an August 1992 primary debate on C-SPAN, an opponent accused Feingold of making a self-serving pledge because he was a newcomer to national races who didn’t have the out-of-state contacts his opponents did. ""It’s not just self-serving, because I’m promising it for the future,"" Feingold responded. ""I’m saying that’s a pledge that I’m going to keep. I’m not going to get in (office) and go, ‘OK, where are the PACs and where are the out-of-state contributions?’ ""I’m making a pledge for the future."" That is clearly not a pledge Feingold is keeping this time around. An analysis of Federal Election Commission data by the Center for Responsive Politics shows 70 percent of individual contributions to Feingold’s campaign during this election cycle have come from out of state. That’s the same number cited by Johnson in the ad. Feingold has acknowledged the change in position, asserting in an August 2015 interview that keeping the 24-year-old pledge ""makes no sense now"" since the campaign finance landscape has changed dramatically due to a deluge of massive, undisclosed contributions. We encountered a similar question in 2014 when the group One Wisconsin Now claimed Walker broke a promise not to take contributions during the budget process -- a claim we rated False. In that case, the group misrepresented the nature of the promise. First, the pledge was from Walker’s brief gubernatorial bid in 2006, not his successful bid in 2010. And the promise, part of his first 100 days plan, referred to a specific period: ""Scott Walker will not accept any campaign contributions (from any source) from the time he takes office (January 3, 2007) until the state budget is signed into law."" That’s not the case for Feingold, who repeatedly cited the pledge, said at the time the  promise was ""for the future,"" and then went on to follow it for three future campaigns. Michael Tyler, a spokesman for Feingold’s campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on how Feingold reconciles the ""for the future"" line with his current assertion that the promise, from the start, was only for the campaign at hand. Our rating Feingold used the words ""pledge"" and ""promise"" in 1992 while asserting his grassroots funding plan was for that election as well as ""for the future."" The future is here, and Feingold has failed to keep his promise. Not only that, he claims he never said the pledge applied going forward, despite video evidence to the contrary. Johnson’s ad includes several clips that, while short, are used in context. We rate Johnson’s claim True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/07/ron-johnson/feingold-broke-promise-fund-campaign-primarily-sta/
"['Abortion', 'Nevada', 'Catherine Cortez Masto']","
Catherine Cortez Masto largely correct about Joe Heck's votes to defund Planned Parenthood
","Republican Rep. Joe Heck’s record on abortion is fast becoming the subject of many salvos in the unending television ad wars in Nevada’s competitive Senate race. Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto has run several ads attacking Heck on the issue, most recently one featuring a Las Vegas-area gynecologic oncologist who opposes Heck because he voted to strip funding for Planned Parenthood. ""Joe Heck voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood, which thousands of women depend on for cancer screenings,"" she says in the ad. ""And Heck opposes a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk."" Heck is no stranger to ads attacking his stance on abortion, as Democrats have sought to highlight the Republican military doctor’s adamant anti-abortion stance in both his current Senate race and past congressional races. A review of Heck’s voting record and public statements over the past six years shows that Cortez Masto’s ad is largely accurate, though over-simplified. Ten votes? Heck himself freely admits he voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and his voting record since entering Congress in 2010 reflects that position. It’s more difficult to argue that Heck has voted 10 separate times to defund the program, as that number relies on counting several procedural motions that weren’t strict up-or-down votes on funding for Planned Parenthood. For example, the ad cites five votes taken by Heck in September 2015 to ""shut down the government over Planned Parenthood,"" but not all of them are the same, including: Two procedural votes on Sept. 17 to end debate and adopt rules for floor consideration on a measure defunding Planned Parenthood. A Sept. 18 vote on a bill (Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015) barring federal funding to the organization for one year and redirecting the funding to community health centers. A Sept. 30 procedural vote allowing for floor consideration of continuing resolution to fund the government that would also defund Planned Parenthood, and a subsequent vote on that bill itself. All of the votes mentioned in the ad were taken as part of a legislative attempt to strip funding from the program, but they aren’t all strict up-or-down votes. Of the five votes listed above, two are actual roll call votes on barring federal funding the program, while the other three are procedural votes that certainly moved the legislation forward but, again, aren’t direct votes on the bill. Cortez Masto spokesman Zach Hudson said the campaign referenced every vote listed in Congressional Quarterly that references defunding Planned Parenthood. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baluta told PolitiFact that counting procedural votes unfairly inflates the number. The other votes mentioned in the ad are a mix of procedural and more straightforward votes to defund the program. The ad cites three votes related to the same piece of 2015 defunding legislation, including the initial House vote, a reconciliation vote agreeing to changes made by the Senate, and a veto override vote. And it cites two votes on amending 2011 spending bills clearly designed to bar federal funding from the organization. Our friends at PolitiFact New Hampshire took similar issue with a claim about endangered Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte voting to defund the group six times, ruling that counting procedural votes is ""accurate but needs clarification."" Health exemptions The second part of the ad claims that Heck opposes ""a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk."" Generally, Heck opposes abortion. His campaign said he supports exemptions in cases of rape, incest and if the pregnancy threatens a mother’s life. The Cortez Masto campaign argues, however, that Heck opposes abortion even when the mother’s health is ""at risk."" There is a difference between situations where continuing a pregnancy threatens the life of the mother and pregnancies with serious future health concerns for the mother. Cortez Masto’s campaign pointed PolitiFact to a 2008 Newsweek article detailing the health exemption, in part citing a Supreme Court ruling in Doe v. Bolton that says health can be defined as medical judgment on factors including ""physical, emotional, psychological, familial and the woman's age."" The National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL), a pro-abortion rights group, provides several examples in a 2016 fact sheet of women whose pregnancies, while not life-threatening, would endanger their future ability to have children or seriously harm the mother if the pregnancy was brought to term. The ad cites as evidence Heck voting for a measure banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exemptions for abortions necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman ""in reasonable medical judgment,"" and limited cases of rape and incest. Heck voted against a Democrat-led ""motion to recommit"" the bill that sought to add an exception to the 20-week ban by allowing abortions that would preserve the health of the mother.   Our ruling A Catherine Cortez Masto campaign ad claims Joe Heck ""voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood,"" and ""opposes a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk."" Heck has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, a fact he publicly admits. The harder question to answer is whether to count procedural votes leading up to formal votes on the defunding measures as votes to defund the group. The ad is mostly accurate, but needs some clarification on the actual number of votes. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab6a58e3-8036-4024-b176-c218b2187d5b",/factchecks/2016/sep/06/catherine-cortez-masto/catherine-cortez-masto-largely-right-say-opponent-/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says Secure Communities, 287(g) immigration programs worked
","One facet of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s new immigration plan would increase cooperation between federal and local law enforcement agencies to deport criminals living in the country illegally. ""We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program,"" Trump said in Phoenix on Aug. 31. ""We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked."" The programs Trump mentioned led to the removal of undocumented criminal immigrants. But they have also been criticized as tools for racial profiling, diminishing trust between communities and police, and for deporting large numbers of immigrants with no criminal record. We wanted to take a closer look at the programs, whether Obama ""gutted them,"" and why there is disagreement on whether they worked. Trump’s campaign did not return our requests for more information. Secure Communities Implementation of Secure Communities began in 2008 under President George W. Bush. The program ended in 2015 when Obama replaced it with a similar enforcement program. Secure Communities resulted in deportations but also stirred up controversy with law enforcement and advocates for holding immigrants without probable cause. Secure Communities was designed to ""improve and modernize efforts to identify aliens convicted of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment, and who may be deportable, and remove them from the United States once they are judged deportable,"" according to ICE. Here’s how it worked: when someone was booked into a police station or jail, that person’s fingerprints and booking information was sent to the FBI, which in turn shared it with the Homeland Security Department. DHS then ran the information through its databases and if there was a ""hit,"" meaning if that person had an immigration record, then Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the local law enforcement agency were notified. ICE then determined that person’s immigration status and whether or not to deport the person based on the agency’s priorities. ICE could then request a detainer, asking the local agency to hold the individual beyond the point he or she would be released, so ICE could have a chance to transfer the person to federal custody. During the course of this program, ICE’s priority was immigrants in the country illegally who had also broken criminal laws. A 2010 ICE memo outlined removal priorities, with the highest priority including violent criminals. From October 2008 to February 2015, ICE removed 406,441 people from the country, the agency reported. That included 135,726 criminal aliens convicted of Level 1 offenses, such as murder, rape and sexual abuse of a minor. Secure Communities was responsible for 60 percent of all interior deportations in fiscal year 2013 and 73 percent in fiscal year 2014, a Migration Policy Institute analyst testified in December 2015 before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. (Interior deportations do not account for border removals.) ""Nonetheless, Secure Communities also proved to be highly controversial, because it resulted in a large number of low-priority removals and was seen by many (law enforcement agencies) as damaging to public safety,"" said Marc R. Rosenblum, who left the institute to work for the Homeland Security Department in January 2016. In 2014, a federal judge ruled that an Oregon county had violated a woman’s Fourth Amendment right by detaining her for immigration authorities without probable cause, The Oregonian reported. ""It’s hard to call (Secure Communities) a success by any measure except to the extent that you support the violation of our Constitution in order to deport more people,"" said Lena Graber, a special projects attorney for Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an immigrant advocacy group, via email. In November 2014, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Secure Communities would be ""as we know it, discontinued."" By that point, Secure Communities had attracted ""a great deal of criticism,"" was ""widely misunderstood,"" and ""embroiled in litigation,"" Johnson said. ""Governors, mayors, and state and local law enforcement officials around the country have increasingly refused to cooperate with the program, and many have issued executive orders or signed laws prohibiting such cooperation,"" Johnson wrote. In his memo, Johnson also announced the creation of the Priority Enforcement Program. That program continues to use fingerprint data, but, as its name suggests, emphasized top priority offenders, such as those who pose a threat to national security. The Priority Enforcement Program also stipulates that ICE cannot ask local law enforcement agencies to detain individuals beyond their release date (detainers can be used in limited circumstances). ICE, instead, can ask to be notified of the release date. One of the issues with Secure Communities was that while it was mandatory nationwide, more than 300 jurisdictions were not cooperating, said Randy Capps, director of research of U.S. programs at Migration Policy Institute. Many refused to comply with the detainers requested by ICE, he said. More than half of the undocumented population lives in places that were not cooperating with ICE as part of Secure Communities, Capps said, which poses a problem for Trump if he is elected president and wants to revert back to the Secure Communities program. ""That was one of the main reasons why the Obama administration went to PEP,"" Capps said, ""to try to get some of these local and state police departments back on board."" Capps views Obama’s Priority Enforcement Program as a revision, and not a gutting, of Secure Communities. ICE still does fingerprints and issues notices, he said, even if it does not also ask local law enforcement for detainers. Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, said Secure Communities was effective because it was able to link DHS and FBI databases so that ICE and local law enforcement agencies could be notified when noncitizens were arrested. ""The result was that ICE was able to identify and remove more criminal aliens than ever before,"" Vaughan said. ""Local law enforcement agencies no longer had to make a judgment call on whether to seek information on an inmate’s immigration status, it was done automatically (which thwarts racial profiling), and they no longer had to make manual queries of ICE, which saves time and resources."" 287(g) The other program Trump wants to expand, ""287(g),"" stems from the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The act added section 287(g) allowing ICE to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies and train officers to carry out immigration law enforcement functions. ICE has these agreements with 32 law enforcement agencies in 16 states, including Florida, Texas and Arizona. ICE credits the program for identifying more than 402,000 ""potentially removable aliens"" from January 2006 through Sept. 30, 2015. The program has had two enforcement models: a task force, where officers patrolling the streets could approach and process ""removable aliens,"" and a jail model, allowing officers in state and local detention facilities to process removable aliens charged with or convicted of an offense. Capps, from Migration Policy Institute, says 287(g) has a mixed track record. There were allegations of racial profiling early on, particularly in the small number of jurisdictions using the task force model, when officers could ask someone about their immigration status on the street, Capps said. In 2009, DHS decided not to renew the task force model agreement with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hard-line immigration stance. The Obama administration decided in 2012 to end the task force model. As a result, trained local police can only question people about their immigration status after they are booked into jail, Capps said. In December 2011, DHS said the Justice Department found ""discriminatory policing practices"" within the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office and terminated the county’s jail mode agreement. Vaughan says local agencies have wanted 287(g) because ""they had so many criminal aliens that ICE couldn’t handle the workload by itself,"" and because they were too far from ICE offices to be able to arrange regular pickup of criminal immigrants. ""I believe that the Obama administration’s suppression of this program has contributed to the steep drop in interior enforcement,"" Vaughan said. Interior removals went down about 71 percent from 237,941 in fiscal 2009 (the first year Obama entered office), to 69,478 in fiscal 2015, according to ICE data. Interior deportations have decreased under Obama due to the administration’s focus on border apprehensions and removal of undocumented immigrants threatening public safety, analysts have told us. Our ruling Trump said Secure Communities and 287(g) immigration programs ""were programs that worked"" but were ""recklessly gutted"" by the Obama administration. The programs have led to the removal of criminal immigrants living illegally in the United States, and the Obama administration did scale down their scope. Yet the programs have been criticized for allowing officers to racially profile minorities, a federal judge found Fourth Amendment violations in one of them, and federal reviews have found discriminatory practices in the other. While the programs have removed criminals from streets, they’ve also involved unlawful practices. Given the ambiguity of their outcomes, we rate Trump’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/06/donald-trump/trump-says-secure-communities-287g-immigration-pro/

Trump surrogate repeats wrong talking point on Clinton Foundation giving
","Surrogates for Donald Trump continue to make the argument that the Clinton Foundation is a ""slush fund"" for Bill and Hillary Clinton, and they keep repeating an inaccurate talking point. While discussing on Meet the Press why Trump has yet to release his tax returns, Republican strategist Alex Castellanos turned the tables, saying that the nonprofit bearing Clinton’s name doesn’t do much except enrich her family. ""Because that idea that somehow the Clinton Foundation is this wonderful thing that helps people, most charities give 75 percent of their money in direct aid. The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave 9 million to people in direct aid,"" Castellanos said. We’ve heard various versions of this claim (from former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and RNC chairman Reince Priebus). It’s misleading. Castellanos’ numbers don’t take into account the bulk of the foundation's work. The foundation does spend a lot of money on charity, not through grantmaking, but through its own programming.  Tax returns show the Clinton Foundation raised just under $143 million and spent about $85 million, including $9 million in grants to other organizations. But that does not include all of the foundation's charitable work ""Grantmaking is not part of its mission, and that creates confusion — since many people imagine that foundations are engaged in giving away money,"" writes David Callahan, editor of Inside Philanthropy. Despite its name, the Clinton Foundation is not actually a private foundation (like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Donald J. Trump Foundation) that solely gives to philanthropic causes. Rather, it’s a public charity, like United Way or the Salvation Army, that runs its own in-house projects and hires staff to carry out the work. Clinton Foundation programs include providing women in Peru with the tools and equipment to launch their own businesses, installing solar panels and grids in Haiti after the earthquake, helping farmers in Tanzania boost yields and turn a profit, and using market mechanisms to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medicine. All together, these programs cost $68 million in 2013 (page 10 of the foundation’s tax documents for that year), or about 80 percent of all of the foundation's expenses that year. In 2014, programs were 87 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses, according to Charity Navigator, giving it a score of 10 out of 10 on that metric. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the foundation’s 2013 expenses:  In sum, Castellanos’ claim is ""totally wrong,"" Callahan of Inside Philanthropy told PolitiFact. ""The vast majority of the money raised goes to support program work in the field, as anyone can tell from looking at the Clinton Foundation’s annual finances."" Castellanos did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Castellanos said, ""The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent in direct aid). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave $9 million to people in direct aid."" Castellanos is cherry-picking one line-item that doesn't include all of the foundation's spending on charity. While outside grantmaking made up about 10 percent of its expenses in 2013, the foundation spent about $68 million, or about 80 percent, on in-house charitable programs to help those in need.

Gary Johnson says unauthorized immigrant border crossings at '12-year low'
","Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson scoffs at Donald Trump’s call for the U.S. should build a wall on the southwest border to keep immigrants out. ""Undocumented workers crossing the border right now is at a 12-year low,"" Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said in an Aug. 29 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch editorial board. We wondered if Johnson’s claim about a dramatic decrease in border crossings is correct. Joe Hunter, the Libertarian nominee’s director of communications, pointed us to a December 2014 report written by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan group that takes no position on immigration policy. Mexican border detentions Pew’s report says 229,000 Mexicans were apprehended at U.S. borders in 2014. That, Pew said, was a steep drop from 2007, the year the Great Recession began, when 809,000 Mexicans were detained at the border. A graphic in the Pew study shows the 2014 Mexican immigrant border detentions was the lowest it’s been, not just during the past 12 years but for any year in the early 2000s, the 1990s and 1980s. Also in 2014, the Border Patrol apprehended 257,000 non-Mexicans, making it the first year on record that detentions of non-Mexicans outpaced those of Mexicans trying to cross into the U.S., the Pew report said. ""This shift is another sign that unauthorized immigrants from Mexico are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border significantly less often than they did before the Great Recession,"" Pew’s study says. The trend of fewer Mexican border detentions continued in 2015, the latest full fiscal year. In that year, the agency apprehended 188,122 Mexicans trying to cross illegally, Border Patrol figures show. That’s the lowest level during the past 12 years. You may have noticed that all of these figures focus on ""apprehensions."" It would not take into account illegal workers who come across the border without drawing notice from authorities. Immigration analysts have told PolitiFact numerous times that there is no perfect comprehensive measure of people entering the U.S. illegally. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas put it: ""There’s no direct indicator of illegal immigration. Folks don’t report in."" In the absence of definitive data, experts use the apprehension figures to get an idea of border-crossing trends. The U.S. Border and Customs Enforcement says its apprehension figures are ""an indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally."" The figures Johnson’s campaign cites focus on apprehensions around the entire U.S. border, including the border with Canada. The vast majority - some 98 percent - of Border Patrol apprehensions occur along the southwestern border, according to agency figures. Also, his campaign’s response further zeroes in on apprehensions of Mexicans caught while trying to cross the border. But Johnson, during the editorial board interview, referenced not just Mexicans but all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. That suggests that the border crossings for all illegal immigrants is at a 12-year low. Border crossings by all immigrants Looking at all detentions around the entire U.S. border, the Border Patrol says it apprehended 337,117 people trying to get into the U.S. in fiscal 2015, which ended last Sept. 30. That was the lowest level in decades. But if you look at the southwestern border, Johnson’s statement hits a snag. In 2011, Border Patrol agents reported apprehending 327,577 border-crossers there, a bit lower than 2015. PolitiFact National on July 26 rated Mostly True a statement by Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who said that southwest border crossings have been at the lowest level in 30 years. PolitiFact noted that the 2011 figure creates a wrinkle for such a broad claim. Still, some researchers told PolitiFact that they gave Gutierrez the benefit of the doubt. ""Given the uncertain ratio between apprehensions and actual crossings, it would be fair to call 2015 and 2011 a statistical ‘tie,’"" Jacob L. Vigdor, a professor at the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington, told PolitiFact. These figures only go through fiscal 2015, which ended in September that year. We’re still in the midst of fiscal 2016, and updated information about the fiscal year has been released in the weeks since that fact-check was published. It shows the number of apprehensions at the southwest border has surpassed the total for all of fiscal 2015. The Border Patrol keeps a running month-to-month tally of apprehensions along the southwest border. Through July of this fiscal year, 332,360 people have been apprehended along the border. That’s just a tad higher than last fiscal year, but there’s still a couple months of the 2016 apprehension figures to go. In recent years, about 50,000 to 60,000 apprehensions occur in the last couple months of the fiscal year, meaning this year is on pace to end at around 400,000 apprehensions at the southern border. That still would be lower than eight of the past 12 years. But that 400,000 level would be higher than in fiscal 2011, 2012 and 2015. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates tighter immigration controls, told PolitiFact in July that there really is no way to know for sure if the number of people illegally crossing the border is less than in recent decades. Camarota also said apprehensions are a weak way to measure new illegal immigration, because it doesn’t count visa overstays. Experts estimate that one-third to one-half of illegal immigrants aren’t people who crossed the border but instead came into the U.S. on visas and overstayed. Our ruling Johnson said, ""Undocumented workers crossing the border right now is at a 12-year low."" There is no comprehensive set of figures that can definitively say how many people come across the border illegally, when taking into account both people who get caught and people who evade authorities. Still, experts and Border Patrol officials do look at figures on border apprehensions to get an idea of the level of crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson points to a drop in illegal border crossings from Mexican immigrants to justify his statement, and it’s true that in fiscal 2015, the latest full fiscal year, the number of Mexican immigrants apprehended at the southern border was the lowest during the past 12 years. But Johnson’s statement suggests that we’re seeing a historic low in all illegal immigrants coming across the southern border. His statement requires some clarification in that there are a couple years when there were lower levels of apprehensions. Still the former New Mexico governor has a point that the level of apprehensions currently is at a relative low point compared with the past dozen years. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/06/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-unauthorized-immigrant-border-cr/

Pence wrongly says Trump has been consistent in immigration views
","Donald Trump made a statesman-like visit to the president of Mexico, then followed that up by a delivering a hard-charging speech on immigration in Phoenix. It left many people wondering if Trump was softening or hardening his immigration policies. That was the topic for Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who took questions about his running mate on Meet the Press.   Host Chuck Todd pointed out that Trump has been inconsistent on what to do with approximately 11 million people living in the United States illegally, specifically those who haven’t committed violent crime. Trump has said violent criminals should be deported, a position that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also holds. Todd noted that Trump’s position on what to do with nonviolent immigrants isn’t clear. ""I think Donald Trump’s been completely consistent,"" Pence countered. ""And I think he did answer the question."" Todd pressed Pence with more questioning, noting that Latino leaders were concerned about Trump’s policies and what they actually were. But Pence didn’t directly answer. We looked in depth at Trump’s statements about the undocumented and found that Trump’s answers have not been consistent. At times Trump has been vague, and at other times he’s contradicted himself. His current position seems to be one of wait and see. No official position Before he jumped into the presidential race, Trump seemed to advocate for a pathway to citizenship, not deportation, and repeatedly implied that immigration reform was ""what’s right."" But he warned that it wouldn’t help the Republican Party. ""Every one of those (11 million) votes goes to the Democrats. Now with that, you have to do what’s right, you have to do what’s right. It’s not about the votes necessarily,"" he said in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference of 2014. ""So with immigration, you better be smart and you better be tough."" As a presidential candidate, Trump has advocated the ""return of all criminal aliens,"" detention of those crossing the border and enhanced penalties for visa overstays. (Snapshots show his position page hasn’t changed since September 2015, when his campaign website launched.) But the position page makes no mention of the undocumented population at large and, in comments throughout this election, he’s floated several different proposals. Let’s run through them. Proposal No. 1: ‘Have to give them a path’ A few days after he announced his candidacy, Trump suggested he was open to a pathway to citizenship. ""You have to give them a path, and you have to make it possible for them to succeed. But the bad ones, you have to get them out and get them out fast,"" Trump said in a July 3, 2015, press conference. Proposal No. 2: Mass deportations and expedited legal return During most of the GOP primary, Trump consistently advocated for deporting all undocumented immigrants, but allowing some to return through an expedited legal process. He didn’t give details on how he would pay for and implement the deportations, but remained committed to his position and criticized primary opponents for being weak on the issue and promising ""amnesty."" Here are some examples of comments Trump made during that period: • Sept. 27, 2015, CBS: ""If they’ve done well, they’re going out and they’re coming back in legally. ...We’re rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they’re going to be happy because they want to be legalized."" • Nov. 11, 2015, MSNBC: ""You’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely. ... Now they can come back but they have to come back legally."" • Feb. 25, 2016, CNN/Telemundo GOP primary debate: ""We either have a country, or we don’t have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back — some will come back, the best, through a process."" Proposal No. 3: No mass deportations and ‘we work with them’ After winning the GOP primary, Trump seemed to walk back his previous calls for removing all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants. He told Bloomberg in a June 2016 interview that his immigration policies would have ""heart."" Pressed to clarify his earlier deportation position, he said, ""No, I wouldn’t call it mass deportations. … We are going to get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here, that I can tell you."" ""I never liked the media term ‘mass deportation’ — but we must enforce the laws of the land!"" he tweeted the same day. Trump reiterated this position in a Aug. 23 Fox News town hall. Asked whether he would accommodate law-abiding undocumented immigrants with families, he said, ""There certainly can be a softening, because we’re not looking to hurt people, we want people — we have some great people in this country. We have some great people in this country. So, but we’re going to follow the laws of this country."" In a follow-up town hall that aired a night later, Trump asked his supporters to indicate via applause what he should do with the noncriminal immigrants: ""No. 1, we’ll say throw them out. No. 2, we work with them."" ""They’ll pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes. There’s no amnesty,"" Trump said following the voice vote. ""But we work with them. ... Everywhere I go, I get the same reaction. They want toughness. They want firmness. They want to obey the law. But -- but they feel that throwing them out as a whole family when they've been here for a long time -- it's a tough thing."" Proposal No. 4: Possible pathway to legal status and possible mass deportations The same day as his second Fox News town hall, Trump insisted he hadn’t changed his position. He talked about granting legal status provided the undocumented immigrants leave the United States first, but also suggested there’s a ""very good chance"" he’ll deport them. ""You can’t take 11 (million) at one time and just say, ‘boom, you’re gone.’ We have to find where these people are. Most people don’t even know where they are,"" he said to CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Aug. 26. ""I don’t think it’s a softening. I’ve had people saying it’s a hardening, actually. ... We’re going to deport many people, many, many people."" Given that the vast majority of the undocumented immigrants are not criminals, Cooper asked, would they be able to gain legal status? ""Unless people leave the country — well, when they come back in, if they come back in then they can start paying taxes,"" Trump responded. ""But there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back."" When pressed on whether he would deport undocumented immigrants who haven’t committed a crime, Trump said, ""We’re going to see what happens. But there's a very good chance the answer could be yes, but there's no legalization. There's no amnesty. If somebody wants to go the legalization route, what they'll do is they'll go leave the country, hopefully come back in and then we can talk."" Proposal No. 5: Deportations prioritizing criminals, visa overstays and ‘public charges’ In his Aug. 31 Phoenix, Ariz., speech outlining his immigration policy, Trump reiterated that legal status would only be granted to undocumented immigrants who ""return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else."" As for deportations, Trump suggested the threat would always loom, but the focus wouldn’t be on law-abiding undocumented immigrants. ""Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation,"" he said. ""Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration."" Proposal No. 6: ‘Assess the situation’ A day after his speech, Trump suggested his mind wasn’t quite made up, and that he’d have to see which undocumented immigrants remained after all his policies had been implemented. ""We're going to sit back, we're going to assess the situation,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""We're going to make a decision at that time. I want to see, before we do anything further, I want to see how it shapes up when we have strong, you know, I use the word impenetrable borders."" Our ruling Pence said, ""Donald Trump’s been completely consistent"" about his plan for nonviolent undocumented immigrants. Trump has been consistently vague about his policies for undocumented immigrants who live in the United States and largely obey the law. He’s advocated for mass deportations and then rejected mass deportations before saying there’s a ""very good chance"" they would happen. He’s said ""you have to give them a path"" but rejected ""amnesty"" and then said legal status could be granted to those who leave the country first and apply for reentry.

Mike Pence cites Clinton support for more Syrian refugees
","It’s an old political motto: A good offense is good defense. So to defend Donald Trump’s policies on immigration, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence went on the attack against Hillary Clinton’s policies. On NBC’s Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked Pence about Trump’s policies to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In recent weeks, Trump has said he would ban Muslims from countries with terrorist activity. When Todd pressed Pence about what countries those would be, Pence changed the subject to Clinton’s Syria policy. ""Well, Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent,"" Pence said. ""Donald Trump and I believe that we should suspend the Syrian refugee program."" Pence added that their preferred policy is to work with Arab countries to establish safe zones closer to Syria. We wanted to look at Pence’s claim that Clinton’s policy is for 550 percent increase. That number is accurate for now.  Syrian refugees by the numbers The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the international agency that tracks and promotes refugee resettlement around the world. Its current count of people who have fled the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011, is 4.8 million. Many of those 4.8 million refugees are in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Due to overcrowding and the large number of overall refugees, the UN has called on other countries around the world to accept more Syrians for resettlement. President Barack Obama agreed on behalf of the United States to accept 10,000 refugees for  fiscal year 2016. The number was reached on Aug. 29, 2016, and the UN hailed the milestone in a press release. ""We thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded,"" said Shelly Pitterman, UNHCR regional representative in the United States. The agency reported that around 478,000 Syrians are in need of resettlement, and Syrians make up about 40 percent of all refugees worldwide who need resettlement. In September 2015, Clinton had called the 10,000-figure for the United States a good start but had urged an increase up to 65,000. Clinton said then the United States should be ""looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women."" That 65,000-figure is a 550 percent increase from the 10,000 that Obama supported. It’s important to note, however, that those numbers applied to fiscal year 2016, which ends by Oct. 1, 2016. Clinton has not discussed numbers for the next fiscal year. So it’s possible that 550 percent number may soon be out of date. We should also note that there is a screening process for refugees. The UN identifies and screens refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. U.S. security agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, then conduct multiple security checks. Our ruling Pence pointed to a real policy distinction between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees when he said that Clinton ""wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent."" Trump is opposed to refugee settlement, while Clinton supports it, and at a greater number than Obama’s current policy. Clinton supported allowing in 65,000 refugees when Obama supported a 10,000 figure. (The refugees would be screened.) That’s a 550 percent increase. The UN has determined that about 478,000 Syrian refugees are in need of resettlement. The statement is accurate and we rate it True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c92c56-bd8d-4a39-b2c5-58a7fed58505",/factchecks/2016/sep/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-cites-clinton-support-more-syrian-refug/

Roy Cooper falsely says North Carolina teacher pay ranking has fallen under Pat McCrory
","In his new ad, Democratic candidate for N.C. governor Roy Cooper focuses on a teacher who says she had to leave North Carolina to find a better-paying job in another state. The ad says Gov. Pat McCrory, the Republican incumbent whom Cooper is trying to unseat, proposed a budget for this school year that would’ve had the smallest percentage of state funding going toward education in 30 years. We rated that claim Half True in a previous fact check. But another Cooper claim caught our eye: The one he used to promote the ad online. ""Under Pat McCrory, our state has fallen to 41st in teacher pay,"" Cooper tweeted along with a video of the ad. ""We must fix this."" He said the same thing on Facebook, also adding in a jab accusing Republicans of ""election year gimmicks."" But we wondered if it was actually Cooper who was using an election year gimmick here. Who pays teachers? First, a refresher on teacher pay. It doesn’t come entirely from the state government. School boards are allowed to supplement local teachers’ salaries, and all but a handful of North Carolina’s 115 school districts choose to do so. Depending on the district in North Carolina, teachers can get a few hundred dollars a year or more than $6,000. So it’s hard to attribute all of the responsibility for teacher pay, good or bad, to only the state government or only the county and city governments. However, the state does provide most. National ranking In the 2015-16 school year, according to estimates by the National Education Association, North Carolina was ranked 41st in teacher pay – just like Cooper claimed. However, take that number with a grain of salt. The NEA typically revises its salary numbers after a year, and that revision can sometimes make a difference in the rankings. In 2014, for example, the NEA estimated the average North Carolina teacher made $45,737 in 2012-13. It tentatively ranked the state 46th in the country. The revised numbers came out a year later. Even though North Carolina’s average pay for 2012-13 didn’t change, its ranking rose from 46th to 43rd because other states did change. So when the revised numbers for 2015-16 come out, North Carolina might still be ranked 41st. Or it might be a few spots higher or lower. We won’t know until spring 2017, however, so for now we’ll just go by the estimates. The rise and fall of teacher pay But is Cooper right with the more important part of his claim, that North Carolina has ""fallen"" to 41st under McCrory’s leadership? No. McCrory was sworn in on Jan. 5, 2013, halfway through the 2012-13 school year. As we already mentioned, North Carolina was ranked 43rd that year. McCrory’s first budget, for the 2013-14 school year, saw teacher pay drop to 47th in the nation. But teacher pay has only risen since then, even if only slightly. In 2014-15 average pay rose to 42nd, and in 2015-16 it was estimated to have risen again to 41st. So Cooper is clearly wrong about the ranking having ""fallen to 41st"" under McCrory. It actually rose to 41st. Cooper’s campaign pointed out that teacher pay was much higher when Cooper was in the state legislature – especially toward the end of his tenure when Cooper was one of the top Senate leaders. In the 1990s and early 2000s under Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor in Jim Hunt, North Carolina did rank much higher in average teacher pay. While the state never paid teachers as much as the national average, its ranking did break into the top half of states. North Carolina ranked 21st in average teacher pay during Cooper’s last year in the Senate, in 2000-01, and it was 22nd the year before. But the ad doesn’t talk about any of that, nor do the posts promoting it. The posts instead make the incorrect claim that the state’s ranking has fallen under McCrory. We wondered if there was a different way the claim might have some truth to it. Maybe even though North Carolina’s ranking rose, its average pay fell compared to the national average. That’s possible. A state could rise in the rankings even while sinking further away from average, if the average is affected by outliers at the very top or bottom of the rankings. But again, that’s not the case. In 2012-13, the last pre-McCrory budget, the average North Carolina teacher made 81.6 percent of the national average. The most recent data we have is the NEA estimate for 2015-16, when the average North Carolina teacher made an estimated 82.6 percent of the national average. Like with the ranking itself, that’s not much of an increase but it is still an increase – although it’s lower than the 95.6 percent it reached during the last budget Cooper helped pass as a legislator. Our ruling Cooper said North Carolina ""has fallen to 41st in teacher pay"" under Gov. McCrory. In fact, the opposite is true. North Carolina has risen to 41st in teacher pay since McCrory entered office. It’s barely an increase, from 43 to 41, but it’s still an increase. Since the claim contains a snippet of truth – that North Carolina is one of the country’s lowest-paying states for teachers – but uses that to paint a misleading picture, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/02/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-falsely-says-north-carolina-teacher-pay/

Donald Trump strays from key facts on Hillary Clinton 'amnesty,' social programs for immigrants
","Donald Trump is claiming that Hillary Clinton wants to give immigrants who are in the United States illegally access to federal benefits that they haven’t earned and that the country can’t afford. ""Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days,"" he told a crowd in Phoenix on Aug. 31, ""and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget."" We'll deal with the amnesty issue first. The 100-day pledge Clinton's website page on immigration doesn't mention amnesty at all. It does, however, promise to ""introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within her first 100 days in office."" That would require a series of steps before an immigrant who is here illegally would be eligible for citizenship. That's not bestowing amnesty within 100 days. Clinton is, however, in favor of allowing many of those immigrants the chance to stay in the United States and be temporarily free from the threat of deportation. She supports two programs that give them a ""deferred action"" designation by the Department of Homeland Security. The first is known as DACA (for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). It's been in effect since 2012 and protects nearly 730,000 people who came to the United States as children. The second, called DAPA (for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents), was proposed for the 4 million or so people whose children are already U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. It's an attempt to keep families together. But the U.S. Supreme Court had blocked its implementation. The programs are designed to provide temporary relief; the immigrants who qualify must renew their designation every few years. They are still considered to be in the country illegally. Again, that's not amnesty. In the past, Clinton supported ""Gang of Eight"" legislation calling for enhanced border security, using E-Verify to check a person's eligibility for employment and a system to prevent people from overstaying their visa. It also required illegal immigrants to learn English, pay a fine and pay back taxes, and it gave higher preference to the applications of immigrants already seeking citizenship. During the process, those immigrants would not have been eligible for federal public benefits. Some critics characterized the measure, which didn't pass, as amnesty. Supporters said it’s not amnesty, a claim we’ve generally rated Half True. One legal dictionary defines amnesty as ""a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out. ... The basis for amnesty is generally because the war or other conditions that made the acts criminal no longer exist or have faded in importance."" In modern American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program, both then and now. And its failure to stem the flow of illegal immigration is partly why ""amnesty"" is such a poisonous word today. When we asked the Trump campaign about that part of the claim, immigration adviser Julie Kirchner said Clinton has promised to propose it during the first 100 days. Social programs Clinton does support proposals that would make some illegal immigrants eligible for Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare. But it wouldn't be all illegal immigrants for all programs, as Trump says. On Obamacare, Trump is correct. Clinton's website says, ""We should let families — regardless of immigration status — buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Families who want to purchase health insurance should be able to do so."" Also, note that Trump doesn't mention welfare, food stamps or Medicaid health care for the poor. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for those programs now, and they wouldn't be eligible for the first two, even if they were granted amnesty for coming to the United States illegally. They would have to become citizens or lawful permanent residents. (If Clinton got them covered by Obamacare, Medicaid might be in play.) But on the issue of Social Security and Medicare, if Clinton manages to get a DAPA-like program implemented, nearly 4 million to 5 million illegal immigrants (out of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants) would get a ""deferred action"" designation and, as a result, become eligible to work here. That, in turn, would require them to pay into the Social Security and Medicare programs and — if they grew old enough and had a work history of at least 10 years — they would be eligible for those benefits under a system set up in the President Ronald Reagan years. So on this point, Trump is mostly correct, although he's giving the false impression that illegal immigrants would be entitled to all social programs under Clinton. Which brings us to . . . Breaking the federal budget? Is this going to cripple the federal budget, as Trump claims? As we noted in an earlier fact-check when Trump was making similar claims, undocumented workers have been a boon to Social Security. They added about $12 billion to the Social Security trust funds in 2010. The reason: They're paying into the system, but they are not — and may never be — eligible to take benefits out. In fact, a 2015 report by the Social Security Administration estimated that if both DACA and DAPA had been implemented, it would have initially increased the short-term solvency of Social Security. The payments of those working immigrants would have generated a small overall increase in revenue through 2045, a smaller overall decline from 2046 through 2082, and be neutral after 2082. They're not going to break the federal budget that way — or break it anymore than it's already broken. As for Obamacare, that's not free health care. It's an insurance program that people have to purchase. The more young people it enrolls, the healthier the program is. Normally if someone is poor and enrolls in Obamacare, they are then added to Medicaid or the federal Children's Health Insurance Program instead. It would be costly to enroll illegal immigrants in Medicaid or CHIP, although whether it would ""break"" the federal budget is a matter for debate. We received varying ballpark estimates from experts on how much it could potentially cost if all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants were put on Medicaid or CHIP, which would be highly unlikely. Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, said the maximum cost would be about $11 billion on a $4 trillion federal budget. But Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego, said a more reasonable estimate was $33 billion, or up to ""$66 billion if there is a large number of disabled or otherwise high-cost individuals. ""These numbers would still overstate the expenditures that would actually unfold,"" he said, ""because only some difficult-to-estimate fraction of the relevant population would actually obtain ACA-financed coverage."" In fact, as the Clinton campaign later told us, Clinton is on the record as saying that there should be no significant extra cost with her plan because undocumented immigrants won't be eligible for a subsidy for private insurance or Medicaid. Whether that changed would depend on how the laws are revised. Clinton told Anderson Cooper on March 21, 2016: ""If they can afford it, they should be able to go into the marketplace and buy it. But it is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that because the subsidies in question have to be worked out in comprehensive immigration reform."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget."" She has not pledged to grant amnesty in her first 100 days. She's promised to submit immigration legislation. Her plan doesn't ""provide"" Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare to immigrants. They'll have to pay into the system to get those benefits just like everybody else. In the case of Social Security and Medicare, it would be at least a decade — perhaps several — before they get any benefits. In the case of Obamacare, even if all 11 million undocumented immigrants were so poor they qualified for Medicaid, it would not ""break"" the $4 trillion federal budget. But Clinton has said they would not automatically be eligible for Medicaid or subsidies. Trump has gotten so much wrong here, we rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3878d3cf-2365-43a5-895f-219cac443911",/factchecks/2016/sep/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-strays-key-facts-hillary-clinton-amne/

Donald Trump says Obama has let 300,000 criminal aliens to go back into U.S. communities
","A number of the statements Donald Trump made in his high-profile immigration speech in Phoenix were ones we’d checked before. But one was new to us. ""Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities,"" Trump said. ""These are individuals encountered or identified by (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct."" As it turns out, the numbers are a lot more complicated than Trump indicated. Let’s take a closer look. Where does the 300,000 figure come from? Stephen Miller, a spokesman for Trump, directed us to Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies with the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors stricter immigration policies. (Officially, the center’s website says the group’s research has convinced many of its staff to be ""animated by a ‘low-immigration, pro-immigrant’ vision of an America that admits fewer immigrants but affords a warmer welcome for those who are admitted."") Vaughan said that the 300,000 estimate comes from three distinct numbers. • In fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a cumulative 86,288 criminal aliens from custody pending removal proceedings. (That number has actually fallen year by year, from 36,007 to 30,558 to 19,723.) This number was announced by Sarah R. Saldana, ICE’s director, at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on April 28, 2016. According to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, these 86,288 criminal aliens collectively were convicted of more than 231,000 crimes. • From Jan 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015, state and local law enforcement agencies turned down 18,646 requests by ICE to hold deportable aliens arrested for non-immigration-related crimes until ICE could take them into custody. This figure was verified by ICE during an investigation by the Texas Tribune. • Vaughan has calculated that between 2013 and 2015, ICE officers, due to prosecutorial discretion, ""let off more than 200,000 criminal aliens they encountered, instead of initiating deportation. Most of these were in local custody at the time. The encounters were hands-on, usually interviews at a jail – not just reviewing a list or getting a hit in a database."" Vaughan said this number comes from internal ICE reports on enforcement activity -- the Weekly Report on Departures and Detention. The original documents are cited in the footnotes of Vaughan’s work here, here and here. If you put these three figures together, they add up to roughly 300,000. How solid is the 300,000 number? On purely numerical grounds, the experts we checked with didn’t express much concern about the first two categories, which collectively add up to about 105,000 individuals. The 200,000 figure is more controversial, however. Part of the concern stems from relying heavily on Vaughan’s calculations of ICE data, made necessary in part because the numbers from ICE are often opaque, hard to obtain, or both. Adam Cox, a law professor at New York University who has studied the issue, said that Vaughn offers ""no evidence about whether there was actually probable cause under the law to arrest most of those who were not arrested. The report treats every encounter by an ICE agent as one in which we know there could have been an arrest. But as we know from many studies in lots of policing contexts, many police encounters end without an arrest because there is no basis for an arrest to be made."" Other experts also urged caution about the number. ""We cannot confirm that ICE has released 300,000 criminal immigrants and not placed them in removal proceedings,"" said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that believes that well-managed immigration brings ""benefits to immigrants and their families, communities of origin and destination, and sending and receiving countries."" Meanwhile, another concern stems from differences of opinion about what ""prosecutorial discretion"" means. The Obama administration has enacted a policy of ""prosecutorial discretion"" to prioritize removal proceedings. The guidelines place a lower priority for removal on those who came to the United States before age 16, are currently below age 30, have resided in the U.S. consistently for five years, are in school or have graduated or are serving in the military or have been honorably discharged -- and have ""not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanor offenses."" To supporters, this simply makes sense: In a world of limited resources, ICE should be putting the most dangerous or disruptive deportable individuals at the top of the list. To critics, however, this policy is a smokescreen for failing to uphold the law. Current law, Vaughan said, states that all aliens who are here illegally ""are potentially subject to deportation regardless of whether they have other criminal convictions."" Prioritization hasn’t been driven by resource constraints or public-safety considerations, she said, but rather ""by political considerations."" There’s a related question of whether it’s reasonable to call the Obama policy ""political correctness,"" but that’s an opinion, so we’ll set that aside. At the very least, we can say that there is a professional dispute about whether the 200,000 figure is accurate. And since this category accounts for two-thirds of the total number referenced by Trump, this at least raises a question about whether his 300,000 figure is credible. How accurately did Trump describe Vaughan’s statistic? Beyond the question of whether the number is accurate, experts told us that Trump cut a few corners in how he described the number in his speech. • The three categories are a mixture of different statistics, and there may be some overlap. Vaughan acknowledges this, though she suspects the impact would be small. ""There may be a few duplicates in the mix, if an individual was encountered or released more than once during the time period, but these are not enough to throw off the estimate by a lot,"" she said. • Trump is loose with his terminology. He uses the term ""criminal aliens,"" even though the widely accepted definition of that term refers only to the first category of the three -- the one that counted 86,288 over the three-year period. As for the third category -- the cases where a local law enforcement agency declined to hold a deportable individual in custody for ICE -- it counts arrests, not convictions, making the term ""criminal alien"" inappropriate in at least some instances. Cox cited research showing that nearly one-third of all noncitizens taken into federal custody this way between 2008 and 2012 had no criminal convictions. • It’s an overreach to lay all of this at the Obama administration’s feet. For starters, Saldana in her congressional testimony said that between one-third and two-thirds of the criminal releases -- the first category -- were required by law, not by ICE’s choice, depending on the year. ""These folks would also have to be released by ICE even if Trump were president, unless the agency was planning to flout court orders and ignore the detention rules written into law by Congress,"" Cox said. One problem, as we’ve noted previously, is that in some cases, the individual’s home country -- notably Cuba and Vietnam -- refused to accept them. We found that in fiscal year 2013, home country refusal led to the release of 3,746 people. (Critics, including Trump, say the U.S. should work harder to punish those recalcitrant countries.) Meanwhile, the primary actor in the third category are state and local law enforcement agencies, not the Obama administration, meaning it is ""flatly incorrect to say that these are ‘criminal aliens’ that the Obama administration has allowed . . .  to return back into United States communities,"" Cox said. In fact, he added, ""ICE has been extremely unhappy about this resistance and has worked hard to get local governments to comply with detainer requests, so it is misleading to say ICE is ‘responsible’ for any such releases."" (Vaughan countered that these releases ""could have been prevented if the Obama administration had taken action against"" sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that do not routinely turn over deportable aliens in their custody. ""Instead, the administration has facilitated them,"" she said.) Our ruling Trump said that ""since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct."" One can make a reasonably strong -- though not foolproof -- case for 100,000. But immigration professions are divided over how credible the next 200,000 is. Meanwhile, Trump’s description of the number in his speech is not entirely accurate. On balance, we rate the Half True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-obama-administration-has-let-300/
"['Voting Record', 'Florida', 'Patrick Murphy']","
Mostly True: Marco Rubio has worst voting record of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years
","U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy wasted no time attacking incumbent Marco Rubio’s voting record after handily winning the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. When Rubio challenged Murphy to six debates, the Jupiter Democrat countered that Rubio was more concerned about a future presidential run than serving in the Senate, something he said is proven by the senator’s record. ""Sen. Rubio has the worst vote attendance record of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years,"" Murphy said in an Aug. 31, 2016, statement. We’ve already noted that Rubio has had an exceptionally bad voting record among presidential candidates that served in the U.S. Senate, although not necessarily the worst. But where does he stand among Florida senators of years past? We checked the record to see if he had the worst absentee rate in almost half a century. Rubio’s record To check this claim, we turned to GovTrack, which keeps a record of votes by members of Congress. Because we’re going back ""nearly 50 years,"" we had to look back to at least 1966. Senator Years served Roll call votes missed Absentee rate Marco Rubio (R) Jan. 3, 2011 — present 234 of 1,616 (through July 2016) 14.5 percent Bill Nelson (D) Jan. 3, 2001 — present 107 of 4,922 (through July 2016) 2.2 percent George LeMieux (R) Sept. 10, 2009 — Jan. 3, 2011 8 of 423 1.9 percent Mel Martinez (R) Jan. 3, 2005 — Sept. 9, 2009 53 of 1,574 3.4 percent Bob Graham (D) Jan. 3, 1987 — Jan. 3, 2005 201 of 6,222 3.2 percent Connie Mack III (R) Jan. 3, 1989 — Jan. 3, 2001 101 of 4,115 2.5 percent Paula Hawkins (R) Jan. 1, 1981 — Jan. 3, 1987 245 of 2,368 10.3 percent Richard Stone (D) Jan. 1, 1975 — Dec. 31, 1980 209 of 3,521 5.9 percent Lawton Chiles (D) Jan. 3, 1971 — Jan. 3, 1989 769 of 8,781 8.8 percent Edward Gurney (R) Jan. 3, 1969 — Dec. 31, 1974 293 of 2,759 10.6 percent George Smathers (D) Jan. 3, 1951 — Jan. 3, 1969 847 of 3,585 23.6 percent Spessard Holland (D) Sept. 25, 1946 — Jan. 3, 1971 243 of 4,951 4.9 percent Rubio’s overall absentee rate — the percentage of all the votes he’s missed during his first term — is 14.5 percent. That’s considerably higher than the 1.7 percent average absentee rate among all senators in the same time period. His counterpart, Democrat Bill Nelson, has a 2.2 percent absentee rate since 2001, and 3.3 percent since Rubio took office in 2011. As Murphy’s campaign said, the last senator from Florida to exceed Rubio’s rate was George Smathers, a Democrat who had a 23.6 percent absentee rate over his 18 years in office. We’ll note there was a significant uptick in missed votes during the end of Smathers’ last term, from 1966 onward, which is 50 years ago. He missed 435 of 835 votes, or more than 52 percent, during his final four years. After that, Smathers declined to run for re-election and became a lobbyist. If we look at the sheer number of missed votes over a similar length of time, Paula Hawkins skipped 245 over six years, while Edward Gurney missed 293. Those are both more than Rubio’s 234 missed votes. But remember, those two had significantly more votes to miss, so we think the absentee rates carry more weight. Other presidential candidates who were senators do miss plenty of votes. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who also ran for the 2016 Republican nomination, missed 139 of 321 votes between April 2015 and June 2016, an absentee rate of 43.3 percent. His career rate is 18.1 percent. In 2008, then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois missed 137 out of 213 votes as he ran for president, or 64.3 percent of votes. His career absentee rate was 24.2 percent. In 2004, then-U.S. Sen John Kerry of Massachusetts missed 89.8 percent of votes. His career rate was 7.7 percent. But back to Floridians: A Rubio spokesman pointed out that Bob Graham, who ran for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, missed about the same number of votes during his campaign as Rubio did. That was a compelling bit of trivia to check. We found that between April 2015 and March 2016, the months Rubio was on the trail, he missed 157 of 242 votes, a 65 percent absentee rate. (Rubio's campaign clarified that he both declared and ended his campaign in the middle of those months, so his absentee rate then was 53.3 percent.) Graham missed 149 of 459 votes between January and November 2003, roughly the time he considered and campaigned for the presidency. That’s an absentee rate of 32 percent. He underwent heart surgery on Jan. 31 that year, which caused him to miss votes before his official campaign launch on May 6. (Rubio's campaign noted that between May 6 and when Graham dropped out on Oct. 6, Graham's absentee rate was 50.4 percent.) That overall period also accounted for three-quarters of Graham’s missed votes over 18 years in the Senate. Graham routinely spent months without missing a single roll call vote. Finally, overall voting trends in the U.S. Senate do change. Spessard Holland was a senator for 24 years between 1946 and 1971. GovTrack noted that in that time period, the average absentee rate for his peers was considerably higher — 14.5 percent. Our ruling Murphy said, ""Sen. Rubio has the worst vote attendance record of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years."" Rubio has the highest absentee rate since Smathers, who left office in 1969. There are plenty of ways to slice the data: Some senators missed more votes overall, and his record is largely in line with other presidential candidates from the U.S. Senate. It’s important to keep those points in mind, but the roll call has been recorded. We rate the statement Mostly True. Editor's note, Sept. 3, 2016: This fact-check was updated to clarify the time span of Marco Rubio's and Bob Graham's presidential campaigns. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c01d97ae-d882-4acc-8e49-158f10a44b8f",/factchecks/2016/sep/02/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-says-marco-rubio-has-worst-attendan/
